Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:15.327
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:19.127
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:22.767
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:26.617
about Korean pop music, otherwise known as K-Pop.

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:32.067
It’s the story of how artists from a small and in some respects unlikely

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:37.357
country went on to have a huge impact on global music and pop culture, acquiring

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.267
a legion of die-hard fans and making billions of dollars in the process.

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:47.330
OK then, The Korean Wave: How K-Pop Conquered the World.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.260
On February the 1st 1964, almost exactly  60 years before this episode was released,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.750
a group of four young men from Liverpool had their first number one hit in America.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.100
The song was “I Want To Hold Your Hand”, and the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.230
young men’s names were John, George, Paul and Ringo.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.700
You’ll know them as The Beatles.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.470
The group went on to monumental success, not only in America, but around the

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.850
world, achieving 10 number one hits, selling out concert after concert to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.180
millions of adoring fans, and having an enduring impact on society and culture.

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:35.505
And if you had sat one of The Beatles down in 1964, and asked them

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:40.115
what country they thought might produce the next kind of band to have

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:44.765
a similar global influence, well, I wonder what they might have said.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:51.765
The obvious answer might be the United States or their home country, the United Kingdom.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:57.165
Perhaps they might have suggested France or Italy, European

00:01:57.165 --> 00:02:00.995
countries that were cultivating their own musical identities.

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:07.722
One country that I imagine they might not have suggested would have been South Korea.

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:16.792
In 1964, South Korea had only recently gained its independence, after 35 years under Japanese rule,

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:22.592
and then endured a bloody war that was still technically ongoing, it was never declared “over”.

00:02:23.892 --> 00:02:29.962
It was also very poor, with a GDP per capita only just slightly higher than that

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:36.582
of Pakistan, and eight times lower than its neighbour and former coloniser, Japan.

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:45.032
The point is, South Korea was a very poor country that was just coming out of a brutal war, not

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:50.392
necessarily the kind of place that Paul McCartney would have thought would produce the next Beatles.

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:57.589
But fast forward 60 years, and South Korea is a musical powerhouse,

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.549
producing some of the most influential pop bands in the world.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.599
In fact, one Korean pop group, BTS, is the only band that can claim to have ever

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:15.169
rivalled The Beatles in terms of global popularity, and the only group other than the

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:21.609
Beatles to have got three number one albums in the same year is BTS, the kings of K-pop.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:29.546
So, how did this happen, how did a country of only 50 million people become a pop music factory?

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:32.556
Well, this is the story of K-Pop.

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:38.596
Now, a quick disclaimer is that you might remember us touching on this subject in an episode

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:44.216
last year on 21st century soft power, but we are going to go a lot deeper in this episode.

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:50.556
So, to understand where K-Pop came from, we first need

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:53.856
to remind ourselves of some modern history of Korea.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:04:00.926
Korea, as you may know, has a long and rich history, but in the interests

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:05.216
of brevity we are going to just talk about the 20th century onwards.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:11.206
The Korean peninsula has always been sandwiched between two powerful

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:17.056
neighbours, in the form of China to the west and north and Japan to the east.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:25.886
Both powers invaded and threatened Korea throughout much of its history, and in 1910 the Japanese

00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:32.536
successfully invaded and annexed the entire peninsula, turning it into a Japanese colony.

00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:38.466
In 1945, with the Japanese defeated after the end of the Second World

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:44.166
War, Korea was liberated, but was divided into two parts, with the

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:48.496
Soviet Union occupying the north and the United States the south.

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:54.806
This was meant to be a temporary administrative division, with the understanding

00:04:54.816 --> 00:05:00.526
that the two zones would be reunited, but Cold War politics got in the way.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:10.398
Then the north invaded the south in 1950, war broke out and lasted until a ceasefire in 1953.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:16.898
And, as you will know, Korea is to this day two separate countries:

00:05:17.338 --> 00:05:22.028
North Korea and South Korea, separated by the 38th parallel.

00:05:23.358 --> 00:05:27.238
To the north is the communist North Korea, the isolated,

00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:31.878
rogue nuclear state most closely allied with China and Russia.

00:05:32.888 --> 00:05:37.628
And to the south is South Korea, a now flourishing democracy with

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:41.858
strong economic ties to the West, and the United States in particular.

00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:49.548
The US isn’t just a remote ally to South Korea; almost 2 million American soldiers

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:55.948
fought in the Korean War, and to this day the United States maintains several military

00:05:55.948 --> 00:06:01.968
bases in the country, with just under 25,000 American troops still based in South Korea.

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:08.516
So, during and especially after the Korean war, these tens

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:12.016
of thousands of American soldiers needed some entertainment.

00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:18.036
Back in the United States, a revolution in pop music was just getting started.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:24.026
Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, Nat King Cole and Louis Armstrong were topping the charts.

00:06:25.026 --> 00:06:29.626
The young men stationed in Seoul or Pyeongtaek were no different to those growing

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:34.706
up in New York or San Francisco; they wanted to listen to the latest music.

00:06:36.276 --> 00:06:41.046
Soon enough, records made their way over the Pacific, and Nat

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:44.626
King Cole could be heart blasting out of American army bases.

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:50.126
In fact, Nat King Cole even visited Korea to entertain the troops,

00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:54.406
as did Marilyn Monroe, but they couldn’t be there all the time.

00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:59.696
The soldiers wanted some more permanent “live” entertainment,

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:03.996
they wanted people to perform for them in bars and clubs.

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:09.366
And there were plenty of young Koreans who were more than happy to do this.

00:07:10.426 --> 00:07:16.686
After all, Korea was an incredibly poor war-torn country, and many people

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:21.096
jumped at the chance to earn some money performing for American troops.

00:07:22.673 --> 00:07:28.923
Now, Korea had its own rich musical culture and history, but that wasn’t what the

00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:34.643
twentysomething American soldiers wanted to hear; they wanted to hear the sounds of home.

00:07:36.063 --> 00:07:40.133
Koreans started performing at military bases, they were very popular,

00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:46.243
and this also started to change domestic musical taste, introducing the

00:07:46.253 --> 00:07:51.743
South Korean population to a Korean interpretation of American pop music.

00:07:53.313 --> 00:08:01.033
And the late 1950s and early 1960s saw a continued swing in Korea towards US culture.

00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:07.123
Many Koreans had grown up surrounded by American culture and influence, and

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:13.063
this naturally influenced Korean culture and the behaviour of some Korean youth.

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:18.193
Some people started to grow their hair long, take drugs, and have a

00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:22.643
more liberal attitude, inspired by the hippy movement in the States.

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:29.603
However, the political situation in Korea was moving in the opposite direction; in

00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:35.973
1961 there was a military coup, and the country moved in a more conservative direction.

00:08:37.103 --> 00:08:43.993
US pop music was banned, Korea’s most famous rock musician was imprisoned for possession of

00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:50.383
marijuana, and it looked like the Westernisation of Korean culture had come to a hard stop.

00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:56.743
That was until the early 1990s, when the Korean government noticed something.

00:08:58.013 --> 00:09:01.223
There was a government report on the economic impact of a

00:09:01.223 --> 00:09:05.693
recent American movie, Jurassic Park, which came out in 1993.

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:11.833
South Korea, at this point, had a growing economy, and had developed

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:15.533
expertise in the manufacturing of goods like electronics and cars.

00:09:16.603 --> 00:09:20.953
The largest company in South Korea in the early 1990s was Hyundai,

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:25.523
the car company, which had produced over 4 million cars by this point.

00:09:26.493 --> 00:09:32.843
It was a huge driver of economic growth for the country, but this government report looked at

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:40.703
the economic impact of the film Jurassic Park and determined that just this one film, 2 hours

00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:48.833
and 7 minutes of movie, had an economic impact equal to producing 1.5 million Hyundai cars.

00:09:50.103 --> 00:09:55.363
Now, not to belittle the work of Steven Spielberg, and the original Jurassic Park

00:09:55.463 --> 00:10:01.423
is a great film, but the Korean government looked at this and thought, “hmm, this

00:10:01.483 --> 00:10:06.113
pop culture business looks quite easy compared to producing millions of cars”.

00:10:07.703 --> 00:10:12.883
As a result, it formed something called the Cultural Industry Bureau in 1994,

00:10:13.243 --> 00:10:18.723
which had the mission of developing Korean pop culture and expanding it abroad.

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:26.383
The problem was, there was very little market for it at first, so it was fighting an uphill battle.

00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:30.623
But slowly, slowly, it started to work.

00:10:31.323 --> 00:10:37.303
Korean soap operas and TV dramas were translated and started to be shown on Chinese TV networks.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:42.173
They became hugely popular, and a so-called “Korean

00:10:42.173 --> 00:10:45.803
Wave”, hallyu, started to sweep over much of Asia.

00:10:47.003 --> 00:10:52.583
The process was later repeated in several Latin American countries, such as Peru and Brazil,

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:58.673
and soon tens of millions of people who had never set foot in South Korea became as familiar

00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:03.753
with Korean culture, if not more, than they were with the culture of any other country.

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.973
And it wasn’t just film, of course.

00:11:07.883 --> 00:11:11.993
Despite the government’s original attempts to suppress the burgeoning

00:11:11.993 --> 00:11:17.133
Korean music scene, the groundwork had been laid, the seeds had been sown.

00:11:18.683 --> 00:11:22.173
The first sign of K-Pop’s potential had actually come a couple of

00:11:22.173 --> 00:11:27.613
years before this Jurassic Park report, with the 1992 debut of a band

00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:31.853
called Seo Taiji and Boys on a talent show on Korean national TV.

00:11:33.353 --> 00:11:37.943
The judges gave the boy band trio the lowest possible score, but

00:11:38.203 --> 00:11:42.523
the audience and the wider public, well they didn’t quite agree.

00:11:43.743 --> 00:11:48.863
Seo Taiji and Boys would go on to be a huge chart-topping sensation.

00:11:49.513 --> 00:11:55.343
They were only active for four years, from 1992 to 1996, but they

00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:59.643
were huge in Korea, and gained popularity throughout Asia as well.

00:12:00.883 --> 00:12:05.483
For copyright reasons we can’t actually play their music, but it was a kind of

00:12:05.593 --> 00:12:12.463
fusion between a variety of different musical genres: rap, hip hop, rock and techno.

00:12:13.963 --> 00:12:17.733
They also made dance front and centre of their performances,

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:21.633
and they were performances in the true sense of the word.

00:12:23.213 --> 00:12:28.373
Now, Seo Taiji and Boys might have been the trailblazers, but it

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:33.013
wouldn’t be until almost 20 years later that Korean pop music would

00:12:33.023 --> 00:12:38.543
have its first undeniable global hit in the form of Psy’s Gangnam Style.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.173
This is a song I’m sure you will be aware of.

00:12:42.403 --> 00:12:46.073
It topped the charts in practically every Western country, as of the

00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:50.943
time of recording this episode the cult music video is about to top 5

00:12:50.943 --> 00:12:56.193
billion views on YouTube, and it was a musical and cultural sensation.

00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:03.773
And even as Psy was dancing on the rooftops of Seoul, beneath the surface, unknown to

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:10.343
everyone but a tight-knit group of musical executives, an even bigger sensation was brewing.

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:17.593
In 2010, an executive at a music company called Big Hit Music had offered

00:13:17.613 --> 00:13:22.263
a teenage boy a record contract, and then held gruelling auditions

00:13:22.643 --> 00:13:27.273
to find a group of other boys who would join him to form a boy band.

00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:32.763
The result was BTS, which was formed of 7 young men,

00:13:33.443 --> 00:13:37.901
boys you could even say, aged between 12 and 17.

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:45.912
The band members were chosen in 2010, but they weren’t unveiled to the public until 2013.

00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:51.076
They had  to undergo an intense period of training and

00:13:51.076 --> 00:13:54.636
practice, perfecting their techniques before their public debut.

00:13:56.106 --> 00:14:00.686
This came in 2013, with their first album “2 Cool 4 School”.

00:14:02.196 --> 00:14:06.656
It was a moderate success, getting to number 5 in the charts in

00:14:06.656 --> 00:14:11.446
South Korea, but it would pale in comparison with what was to come.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:17.839
Fast forward to 2017, with the members of BTS still in their early

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:23.509
20s, and they had gone from Korean pop sensation to global superstars.

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:29.649
In 2019 they became the first non-English-speaking group to sell out

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:34.049
both Wembley Stadium, in London, and the Rose Bowl Stadium in California.

00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:39.459
They have won dozens of awards, been on the front page of Time Magazine, they

00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:44.839
broke the record for the most YouTube views in 24 hours, which was 113 million,

00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:49.531
by the way, they were invited to meet President Joe Biden, and have amassed

00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:55.061
tens of millions of die-hard fans all over the world, the so-called “Army”.

00:14:56.461 --> 00:15:01.611
Now, if you are not a member of the Army, or you are not so familiar with

00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:06.821
the work of BTS, it is incredibly polished, flawless, music and dance.

00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:08.791
No mistakes, ever.

00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.081
The members of the group are incredibly polite, always

00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:16.231
smiling, friendly, hardworking and happy young men.

00:15:17.491 --> 00:15:23.111
Of course, their public image is very carefully controlled and curated by their record label.

00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:28.451
None of the members are ever allowed to be seen in a public relationship, as

00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:33.651
an important part of their appeal is that they fit into this boyfriend fantasy.

00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:38.731
If they are seen as single, or at least without a visible partner,

00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:43.721
it keeps the doors open, it increases their appeal among fans who can

00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:48.351
imagine that maybe one day they might be chosen by one of the members.

00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:55.471
And to address the question in the title of this episode, how did K-Pop conquer the

00:15:55.471 --> 00:16:00.951
world, well other than the fact that Korean pop stars make very catchy, memorable

00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:05.889
pop music, and are incredibly hard-working, there are a few other elements to note.

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:15.229
Firstly, K-Pop stars, and BTS are a prime example of this, are very adept at using social media.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:22.349
BTS are constantly posting on Twitter and Instagram, giving fans a behind-the-scenes look at their

00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:29.629
lives, and the fact that all of the members seem so nice and honest, so flawless and down to earth,

00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:36.719
this has led to legions of fans spreading the word and fighting for their band at every opportunitY.

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:41.599
They seem like good, hard-working young men, deserving

00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:44.549
of their success, so their fans root for them.

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:50.139
Secondly, and on a related note, social media has meant

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:54.049
that a band can now bypass some of the traditional channels.

00:16:55.319 --> 00:16:59.859
When Seo Taiji and Boys were starting out in the early 1990s, they

00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:04.139
would have to go on TV, deal with record labels, and go on tour.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:10.569
Fast forward to the era of social media and YouTube and a band can record

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:15.939
one music video or share one clip and immediately it's live everywhere in

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:20.899
the world, cutting out any middlemen and transcending geographical borders.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.969
BTS’s YouTube channel is a testament to this: as of the

00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:30.279
time of writing this episode it had 22 billion views.

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:35.509
The band posts all the time, and when I just looked, it had posted a

00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:41.749
video from 4 hours ago and it had already amassed 1.3 million views.

00:17:43.189 --> 00:17:47.289
And one of the amazing things is that this video, like most of

00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:52.069
their videos, is only in Korean, no English subtitles, no nothing.

00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:55.629
If you look at the comments on the video, they are in

00:17:55.629 --> 00:17:59.619
Korean, in English, in Russian, in French, and in Spanish.

00:18:00.109 --> 00:18:03.439
This gives you an idea of the scale of their popularity,

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:07.269
and how far their influence spreads across the world.

00:18:08.329 --> 00:18:13.549
And in terms of some more numbers to ram home quite how much of a big deal they

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:21.319
are, it’s estimated that one BTS song, Dynamite, added $1.4 billion to South

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:29.179
Korea’s economy in 2020, and was responsible for 8,000 new jobs, and that the group

00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:35.996
overall is worth something like $3.6 billion to South Korea every single year.

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:40.576
Now, perhaps you are hearing about BTS for the first time.

00:18:41.056 --> 00:18:43.326
Perhaps you’re thinking, “how did I miss this?

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.366
I don’t know anyone who listens to BTS!”

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:50.786
If so, let me tell you that BTS fans and K-pop fans

00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:54.856
in general tend to fit into a particular demographic.

00:18:56.106 --> 00:19:00.336
The genre is most popular with young people, with the average age

00:19:00.336 --> 00:19:05.846
of a K-Pop fan being 23, and over half of the fans being female.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:14.186
It is, perhaps, an unusual army, an unusual group of fans, but  it is a very

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:19.426
powerful one, united by a love of K-Pop, and in particular a love of BTS.

00:19:21.266 --> 00:19:27.086
As just one example of this, you might remember how a group of K-pop fans, mainly teenage

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:32.206
girls and young women, managed to successfully humiliate Donald Trump a few years ago.

00:19:33.296 --> 00:19:38.687
There was a free rally held by Trump in 2020,  but K-Pop fans got

00:19:38.707 --> 00:19:43.027
together to register all of the tickets and then to simply didn’t

00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:47.357
go to the event, so that he gave a speech to a mostly empty stadium.

00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:53.007
To wrap things up, the story of the rise of K-Pop is

00:19:53.007 --> 00:19:56.667
not just a tale of catchy tunes and flashy performances.

00:19:57.137 --> 00:20:02.157
It's one of cultural resilience, strategic planning, and the power of globalisation.

00:20:03.497 --> 00:20:08.417
South Korea transformed its image from a war-torn nation to a global

00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:12.997
cultural powerhouse, influencing fashion, language, and lifestyles

00:20:13.007 --> 00:20:17.347
worldwide, and generating huge wealth for the country in the process.

00:20:18.627 --> 00:20:22.477
And to bring it right back to the start, we asked ourselves the question

00:20:22.697 --> 00:20:27.757
of what one of the Beatles might have said if you’d asked them in 1964 to

00:20:27.757 --> 00:20:31.817
name a country that would have produced a similar global musical sensation.

00:20:33.227 --> 00:20:35.627
Of course, we still don’t know the answer to that question,

00:20:36.067 --> 00:20:39.837
but we do know what one of The Beatles thinks of BTS now.

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:46.917
Sir Paul McCartney has publicly declared that he likes BTS, saying, and I’m quoting

00:20:46.917 --> 00:20:51.847
directly, “it’s not really because of the music like it is for the fans, but for

00:20:51.847 --> 00:20:56.547
me, it’s [about] just seeing some young kids go through what we went through.

00:20:57.147 --> 00:20:58.667
BTS— Korean guys.

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.019
I like watching them and seeing what’s going on.

00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:02.084
I think they’re good.”

00:21:03.474 --> 00:21:08.244
So, there you have it, BTS and the Beatles, K-Pop and

00:21:08.244 --> 00:21:11.355
Beatlemania, they aren’t as far apart as you might think.

00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:18.905
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Korean Wave: How K-Pop Conquered the World.

00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:23.495
I hope it was an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and if you've

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:28.165
never knowingly listened to any K-Pop before, well perhaps this might have inspired

00:21:28.165 --> 00:21:33.515
you to go to YouTube or Spotify, type in BTS, and see what all of the fuss is about.

00:21:34.745 --> 00:21:37.205
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:38.855
Are you a K-Pop fan?

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:41.805
If so, what was it that first got you hooked?

00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:46.475
And what do you think are some of the reasons that K-Pop has become so popular?

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:49.885
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

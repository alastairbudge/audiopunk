Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.459
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.590
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.539
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.980
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.130
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.360
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.810
it is part two of our three-part

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.860
mini-series on European dictators.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.790
In part one, we looked at the life

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.300
of The Grey Blur, Joseph Stalin.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.380
In today’s episode, we are going to go to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.490
the other side of the political spectrum,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.720
to the far-right, and look at the life of

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.470
Benito Mussolini, the father of fascism.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.189
And in part three, well you can

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.199
probably guess who it’s going to be, the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.570
leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.720
Now, clearly it would be incredibly

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.400
difficult to give a thorough,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.930
blow-by-blow account of Mussolini’s

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.080
entire life, and it certainly

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.030
won’t be possible in this episode.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.780
So today, I’ll give a broad overview

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.520
of his life and place in Italian and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.850
European history, whilst also trying

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:12.916
to give you a sense of the type of

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:16.070
man Mussolini was, and how his early

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.680
years shaped the dictator he became.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190
So, let’s get into it and talk about

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.960
Benito Mussolini, the father of fascism.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.729
In the early hours of the 29th of

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.530
April, 1945, a crowd was gathering

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.060
in the Piazzale Loreto in Milan.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.120
There was a sea of top hats,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.800
military helmets, men in long

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.650
coats, and military vehicles.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.440
In the middle of the square, a furious mob

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.930
gathered around something on the floor.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.430
They screamed, cheered, and jeered.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.110
Two dead bodies lay on the floor.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.490
The crowd pushed forward, trying

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.160
to get closer, hoping to catch a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.210
glimpse of one body in particular.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:09.220
Jostling for position, the people who

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.179
had managed to push past the soldiers

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.329
were confronted by the face of Italy’s

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.340
fascist leader, Benito Mussolini.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.799
People spat on him, trying to kick

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.160
his body, hurling abuse at the corpse.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.260
Firemen arrived and dispersed

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.030
the crowd with jets of water.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.500
People began to move back,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.619
and order was restored.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.739
But then the crowd pushed forward

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.959
again, took Mussolini’s body,

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.279
dragged him across the square, and

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.859
hung him up from a petrol station.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.620
The mutilated body of the man

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.915
who had ruled Italy with an iron

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.239
first was there for all to see.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.989
Il Duce was dead.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.660
It was an end so brutal, so undignified,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.310
that historians believe it was one of the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.560
reasons Hitler decided to commit suicide,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.270
rather than risk falling into the hands of

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.350
his enemies and enduring a similar fate.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.260
It was an unlikely fate for many reasons,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.100
and completely likely for many others.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.210
This man, Benito Amilcare Andrea

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.530
Mussolini was born on the 29th of July,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.560
1883, in Predappio, in central Italy.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.790
His father, Alessandro, was a blacksmith

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.580
and committed socialist, and his

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.200
mother, Rosa, a devout Catholic.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680
In fact, Mussolini’s father wasn’t just

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.050
a fly-by-night socialist, but left-wing

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.970
enough to name his son after Benito

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.650
Juárez, Mexico’s liberal President

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.700
and the first indigenous head of state

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.980
anywhere in post-colonial Latin America.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.670
His middle names, Andrea and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.470
Amilcare, were given to him after

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.610
Andrea Costa and Amilcare Cipriani,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.840
two famous Italian socialists.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.060
As you’ll know, he would go

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.130
in an altogether different

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.010
direction to his namesakes.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.890
In school, he was known as a shy and good

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.910
student but one with a violent temper.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.480
At 10 years old he stabbed another

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.510
student, and then, at 14, in 1897, he

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.040
again stabbed a classmate with a pen

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.220
knife and was suspended from school.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.010
After leaving school Mussolini worked

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.720
briefly as a school teacher but didn’t

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.250
enjoy the job, and in 1902 his prospects

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.730
were so poor that he moved to Switzerland.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.600
He would spend the following two years

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.880
travelling around Switzerland and,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.460
following his father’s lead, became

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.260
involved in socialist politics, often

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.390
clashing with police in the process.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.660
A couple of years later, in 1904,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.660
Mussolini returned to Italy and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.870
continued to do bits of teaching,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.720
remaining active in socialist politics,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.890
before moving to Austria-Hungary

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.510
where he edited a socialist newspaper

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.440
but was deported back to Italy for

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.700
violating freedom of press laws.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.840
As we’ll see from his own behaviour

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.900
later on, this is somewhat ironic.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.430
Historians believe that Mussolini saw

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.870
himself as a bit of an intellectual.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.050
He read philosophy, learned French and

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.480
German, and clearly thought himself

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.750
to be something of a grand thinker.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.860
These grand thoughts would end up

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.810
leading him to the complete opposite

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.690
side of the political spectrum.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.300
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.650
At this time, Mussolini was

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.690
still a committed socialist and

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.980
a committed anti-imperialist.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.210
In 1911 he spent six months in prison

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.230
for inciting, or encouraging violence

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.960
at a rally against Italy’s war in Libya.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.830
But even then Mussolini had visions

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.760
of grandeur, of big plans for himself,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.930
and used his time in prison to begin

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.330
writing his autobiography, which

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.580
reportedly included descriptions of

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.490
his many romantic, sexual, conquests.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.070
Even back then Mussolini was keen

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.730
to boast about his womanising, and

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.030
much like a more recent Italian Prime

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.900
Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, he was keen

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.590
to use it as part of his macho image.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.750
Clearly, there was truth behind it, with

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.590
one biographer estimating that he slept

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.500
with around 5,000 women during his life.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.640
If you’re wondering how you make time

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.940
for this while running a country, well

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.410
according to one account, he slept with

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.280
at least one woman every day at his

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.240
office while he was running the country.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.140
Perhaps he would have ruled for a bit

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.860
longer if he had swapped this daily office

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.310
activity for something else, who knows.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.430
Anyway, when he was finally released

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.960
from prison, Mussolini continued

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.510
working on several socialist newspapers,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.310
but he supported Italy’s involvement

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.720
in the First World War, a position

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.170
that put him at odds, or in contrast

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.280
to, mainstream Italian socialists.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.550
This view of war, and general enthusiasm

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.950
for violence and militarism, would lead

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.080
to his departure from the Socialist Party

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.830
in 1914, and his swing to the right.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.740
With civil unrest spreading across

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.830
the country, Mussolini’s view of the

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.650
world began to change, moving away

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.430
from his socialist emphasis on social

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.830
class to believing that national

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.950
identity was more significant.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.990
He was drafted into the Italian army in

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.270
September of 1915 where he fought on the

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.060
front lines and was promoted to the rank

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.660
of corporal before being discharged,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.570
or released, after being wounded.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.390
Upon his return to civilian life,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.810
Mussolini the corporal became Mussolini

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.980
the journalist again, and by 1917

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.790
he was agitating for Italy to remain

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.080
in the war and support the allies.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.670
It would be the start of his route to

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.580
power, but you might be surprised to hear

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.740
that he owes much of it - arguably all of

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.820
it - to the British intelligence services.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.240
Yes, that’s right - archived records

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.480
have revealed that Mussolini was paid

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.150
by Britain’s famous MI5, the British

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.110
Intelligence Services, to write propaganda

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.000
articles encouraging support for Italy’s

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.980
continued participation in World War I.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.820
He was paid £100 per week by MI5 - which

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.120
is around €10,000 a week in today’s

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.640
money, which also went towards paying

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.550
supporters to go and beat up and

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.320
intimidate anti-war protestors in Milan.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.890
And Mussolini’s political views

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.380
had done an about turn, they

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.910
were completely different.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.570
By the following year, in 1918, he was

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.540
publicly stating that a dictator could,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.550
and should, take control of Italy.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.050
He began to organise the different

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.380
fascist groups around Italy into a

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.070
national organisation known as the

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.220
Fasci Italiani di Combattimento,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.480
which you could translate as something

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.580
like the Italian Fighting Groups.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.420
The group appealed particularly to

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.180
war veterans and the unemployed, and

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.630
encouraged violence, mainly against

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:57.990
socialists, and Mussolini became

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:03.880
the de facto leader of the Fascists.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.900
In late 1919, he ran as the Fascist

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.250
candidate in the Italian general election

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.460
but lost in a large Socialist victory.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.750
In the aftermath of the election,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.700
he was arrested for collecting

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.790
weapons and planning to overthrow

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.810
the government, but was released.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.590
Then, in 1921, with the country

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.890
gripped by political instability and

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.130
fascists fighting communists in the

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.560
streets, The King, Victor Emmanuel

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.020
III dissolved the Italian Parliament.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.530
The following election saw

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.470
big wins for the Fascists, and

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.950
Mussolini won a seat in Parliament.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.850
Fascism was entering the

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.850
political mainstream.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.980
Encouraged by their electoral

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.340
success, the party changed its

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.480
name to the Partito Nazionale

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.000
Fascista - the National Fascist Party.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.980
In 1922 Mussolini’s men, the same

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.080
ones that had been paid with British

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.830
money to violently disrupt anti-war

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.720
rallies, changed to their famous black

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.440
shirt uniforms and were put in squads

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.090
that resembled Roman army groups.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.380
In fact, Mussolini’s vision of

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.090
fascist Italy relied heavily on

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.550
romanticised notions of the Roman

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.890
Empire and what he saw to be Italy’s

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.250
rightful place among world powers.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.990
In Parliament, he continued his calls

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.140
for a strong leader, and became known

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.090
as a charismatic and powerful public

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.610
speaker, delighting huge crowds with

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.680
dramatic gestures and facial expressions.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.350
Giving a speech in Naples in October

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.220
of 1922, Mussolini promised the 40,000

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.560
fascists in the crowd that, “Either

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.220
the government will be given to us, or

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.850
we will seize it by marching on Rome.”

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.840
As the country deteriorated

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.350
into further civil and political

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.670
unrest, several Italian cities

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.790
were seized by Fascist squads.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.230
And then, on the night of the 27th

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.970
of October, 1922, 30,000 Fascist

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.530
blackshirts gathered to demand the

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.440
resignation of Prime Minister Luigi Facta.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.870
King Victor Emmanuel, Vittorio

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.400
Emmanuele, could only watch as

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.110
thousands of armed Fascists entered

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.660
Rome, though Mussolini wasn’t one of

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.850
them himself - he didn’t actually go.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.330
The King quickly dissolved the government

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.350
and asked Mussolini to form a new one.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.960
And just like that, Mussolini

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.940
became not only Prime Minister,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.100
but the Minister of the Interior

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.570
and Minister for Foreign Affairs.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.810
The journalist, the school teacher

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.140
and former-socialist, had become

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.200
the most powerful man in Italy.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.610
But he wasn’t a fully-fledged,

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.770
a real, dictator just yet.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.350
Over the next couple of years, Mussolini

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.140
built up more and more power, sidelining

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.220
democratic institutions and rivals

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.630
until he could destroy them altogether.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.090
During this period there were several

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.080
unsuccessful assassination plots

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.270
against him, and in response he had all

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.500
Communist members of Parliament arrested.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.980
Even those who couldn’t be

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.880
found guilty of any crimes were

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.980
detained for up to five years.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.890
After dealing with the Italian left - his

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.860
former comrades, it must be remembered

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.410
- Mussolini turned his attention to

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.930
his other former passion: the press.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.240
And let’s not forget, he was a former

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.940
journalist, so he was acutely aware of the

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.380
power of the written word, of the press.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.300
As Mussolini began to tighten his grip

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.750
on the country, the freedoms of the press

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.090
were muzzled, or silenced, and cinemas

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.330
were made to show government propaganda.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.560
Fascists owned the majority of

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.100
newspapers and controlled how things

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.140
were reported in the media, issuing

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.660
editorial guidelines and arresting

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.210
editors who didn’t follow them.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.160
Being aware of the power of an image,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.440
he was also very conscious about

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.920
how he was portrayed in the press.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.230
And, as you may know, he was not a

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.100
tall man, he was 1.69 m, and he would

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.420
insist on photographs of him being

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.080
taken from above, or standing on

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.850
a box, or on a horse - anything to

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.680
make him seem more heroic and grand.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.240
Now, historians generally say that

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.420
Mussolini confirmed his total control

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.740
of Italy, and grip on the country’s

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.185
institutions, a few years later, on the

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.940
3rd of January, 1925, when he made a

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.500
speech to the Italian parliament declaring

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.190
his right to supreme power of the country.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.940
In just a few years, Mussolini had

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.420
assumed full control of Italy and become

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.990
the world’s first fascist dictator.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.640
But what would he do next?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.620
In the late 1920s and early

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.430
1930s, Mussolini further developed

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.570
his personality cult, giving

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.070
seemingly endless public speeches.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.890
Carefully creating a hyper-masculine

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.660
image, Mussolini tried to establish

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.190
himself as an ‘Ubermensch’ - a

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.540
philosophical concept of a person

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.940
who is almost superhuman and has

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.160
powers ordinary people don’t have.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.960
This concept was actually created by

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.410
Friedrich Nietzsche, a philosopher

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.930
historians believe Mussolini was fond of,

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.890
and one used by other fascist dictators

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.590
as a means of justifying their brutality.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.390
In fact, it is thought that Hitler

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.090
himself gave Mussolini the complete

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.710
works of Nietzsche for his 60th birthday.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.560
Now, on the subject of Hitler, it is

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.630
worth considering the relationship

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.990
between the two of them for a moment.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.970
It is well-known that Hitler was a great

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.890
admirer of Mussolini in the early days,

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.260
and that Italian fascism was seen as

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.450
the ideological ‘big brother’ of Nazism.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.030
Hitler particularly admired

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.890
Mussolini’s March on Rome - in fact

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.150
his failed putsch in Munich in 1923

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.490
was Hitler’s attempt to do the same.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.770
In their early meetings,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.120
however, Mussolini wasn’t

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.960
particularly impressed by Hitler.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.360
After their first meeting in Venice

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.700
in 1934 - during which he refused a

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.280
translator and struggled with Hitler’s

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.300
thick Bavarian accent - Mussolini

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
reportedly described the German

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.380
dictator as a ‘mad little clown.’

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.200
Over time, however, and as Hitler

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.470
grew in power, their partnership

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.690
developed and Mussolini embraced

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.450
some of Hitler’s foreign policy

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.010
ideas and his anti-semitism.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.430
Yet, despite what the propaganda at

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.440
the time showed, the relationship

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.530
between the two was a ‘marriage of

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.610
convenience’, or in other words,

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.450
a relationship for mutual gain, an

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.470
agreement that helps both parties.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.290
The biggest implication of

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.690
their relationship, of course,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.170
would come a few years later.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.970
But Mussolini wasn’t just the

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.130
ideological father of fascism for

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.700
Hitler; he was the father of fascism

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.640
full-stop, and an example for every

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.310
European fascist that would follow.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.380
And Mussolini knew it.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.830
With the fascist general Franco plunging

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.950
Spain into Civil War, and fascism also on

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.570
the rise in Germany, Mussolini began to

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.110
look beyond his own borders and consider

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.730
the bigger picture, and his place in it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.830
In October of 1935, Mussolini ignored

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.320
the League of Nations and ordered Italian

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.530
troops to invade Ethiopia - then known

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.660
as Abyssinia – forcing the country's

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.070
Emperor, Haile Selassie, into hiding.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.450
Mussolini, the man who just years

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.840
ago was an active anti-imperial

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.220
campaigner, declared Abyssinia, along

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.610
with the territories of Somaliland and

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.180
Eritrea, part of a new Italian Empire.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.630
During the conflict Mussolini proved

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.250
himself to be particularly ruthless,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.760
ordering the Italian forces to use

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.210
chemical weapons, including mustard

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.900
gas, as they slaughtered 50,000 people.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.620
It would prove to be his only real

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.130
military success, and was against an

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.590
enemy with significantly inferior,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.930
worse, weapons than the Italians.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.230
Now, back in Europe, as the Spanish

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.970
Civil War intensified, Mussolini sent

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.250
tens of thousands of men to support

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.990
the fascists, which further alienated

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.070
Italy from other European powers.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.570
Mussolini instead grew closer to another

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.940
European dictator: his old friend,

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.430
the ‘mad little clown’ Adolf Hitler,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.110
who was no longer the fascist little

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.900
brother, but a valuable European partner.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.990
When Italy invaded Abyssinia, Germany

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.370
had, after all, been the second country

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.150
to recognise Italy’s claim to it.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.690
Both Hitler and Mussolini sided with

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.370
Franco in the Spanish Civil War,

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.120
and in 1937 Italy left the League of

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.210
Nations in solidarity with Germany.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.690
In March of 1938, with Mussolini’s

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.650
support, Hitler invaded Austria.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.780
And despite having had an on-off affair

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.990
with a Jewish author and academic for

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.240
many years, and Italian fascism not

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.850
initially being anti-semitic, Mussolini's

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.420
increasing closeness to Hitler and Nazism

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.430
increased his own anti-semitic views.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.260
In 1938, Mussolini wrote an article

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.750
supportive of the German concept of the

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.850
Aryan race, and soon after, he called

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.310
for the expulsion of Jews from Italy.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.670
In 1939, when Hitler invaded

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.000
Poland, Britain and France declared

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.520
war against Germany but Mussolini

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.210
remained neutral, for now.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.010
When Germany took Denmark and Norway,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.540
however, Mussolini became convinced

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.250
that Hitler would win the war, and after

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.400
the Nazis steamrollered through Holland

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.200
and Belgium, Italy and Germany signed

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.770
the “Pact of Steel” officially creating

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:48.980
the Axis powers, on May 22, 1939.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.790
Now, to skip forward a few years, by 1943

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.060
it was clear that Italy was losing the

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.800
war, and that the Italian army wasn’t

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.460
particularly well organised or effective.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.980
And as Italians realised this, Mussolini’s

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.150
grip on power began to wane, or decrease.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.780
Even his propaganda machine began to fall

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.610
apart, and Italians increasingly listened

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.320
to and read foreign media to find out

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.370
what was really going on in the war.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.420
On July 25th, of 1943, Mussolini was

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.770
voted out of power by his own Grand

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.680
Council, arrested, and thrown into prison.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.500
When the new Italian Prime Minister

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.740
began secret peace talks with the Allies,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.430
Hitler sent German troops into Italy.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.560
Then, in September of 1943, allied

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.960
forces landed in Italy with the

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.150
aim of liberating the peninsula.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.180
Fearful of being found by the advancing

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.630
allied troops, on the 12th of September

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.190
of 1943 Mussolini was rescued by an

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.020
elite unit of German SS paratroopers and

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.560
taken to German-occupied northern Italy.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.700
There he was made Hitler’s puppet

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.360
leader, creating the Italian Social

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.760
Republic - known as the Salò Republic.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.580
Though he claimed to be in full control

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.190
during the next year and a half, Mussolini

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.070
was effectively put under house arrest and

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.270
guarded by SS troops - in his own country.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.380
How the tables had turned - how

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.780
the situation had reversed - since

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.040
Hitler and Mussolini’s first meeting.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.040
And by June of 1945, allied forces

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.990
were rolling through Italy, and

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.490
Mussolini tried to escape to Spain

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.660
with his lover, Claretta Petacci.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.870
And, this all takes us back to

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.380
the beginning of the episode,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.850
Mussolini’s gruesome end.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.220
Though he was strung up in the

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.290
Piazzale Loreto in Milan, he

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.720
didn’t actually die there, he was

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.110
already a dead man when he arrived.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.920
On the 27th of April, 1945, a couple

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.650
of days before, a group of communist

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.570
partisans had stopped a convoy near

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.220
the village of Dongo on Lake Como.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.500
Mussolini was found hiding in the

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.820
back of a truck, trying to disguise

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.410
himself in a German army overcoat and

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.050
helmet, but his distinctive shaved

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.350
head and jawline gave him away.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.550
Autopsy reports suggest he was shot dead

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.580
the following day, on April 28th, 1945.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.410
His body was then driven to

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.800
Milan and displayed for all

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.730
Italians - indeed the world - to see

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.860
Now, we need to jump forward almost 80

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:49.250
years to the modern day - to 2022, as

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.070
debatably more so than Stalin and Hitler,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.950
the spectre of Benito Mussolini looms more

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.090
closely over his country than either of

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.140
the other subjects of this mini-series.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.550
In October 2022, as you may know,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.700
a lady called Giorgia Meloni became

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.850
Italy’s first female Prime Minister.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.720
Her party, the Brothers of Italy,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.950
is generally described as a

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.680
far-right or post-fascist party,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.870
and Meloni has publicly expressed

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.970
her admiration of Mussolini.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.530
As a teenager, Italy’s current Prime

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.680
Minister said, and I quote, “Mussolini

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.890
was a good politician, in that

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.860
everything he did, he did for Italy.”

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.410
Her party won 26% of the vote, so one

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.630
in four Italian voters decided that

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.730
she, a woman who had openly expressed

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.580
her administration for Mussolini,

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.100
she was the best choice for leader.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.960
Now, this is not to say that this means

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.440
a quarter of Italy is fascist, of course,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.660
but rather to point out that the legacy of

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.590
Benito Mussolini is still alive and well.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.100
Yet, as we have discussed

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.380
today, Mussolini’s legacy went

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.850
beyond the borders of Italy.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.050
He was, put simply, the

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.010
original fascist dictator.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.380
It was his violence, his personality

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.230
cult, his charismatic public speaking,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.020
his strongman one-party state and his

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.030
march on Rome that really gave birth to

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.030
fascism and inspired similar movements

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.200
across Europe in the inter-war years.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.390
Though he’s not the the most infamous

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.190
of the fascists, Mussolini was a brutal

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.400
dictator who ordered the death of his

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.030
political opponents and imprisoned and

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.670
tortured anyone who dared to oppose him.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.600
By some calculations, he was

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.800
indirectly responsible for

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.270
the deaths of 300,000 people.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.660
His greatest, most dangerous, legacy,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.520
however, is the fact that he started

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.900
the fascist movement, inspired its

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.420
rise, and created the political

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.760
divisions that - in Italy and around

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.720
the world - remain to this day.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.160
When put like this, perhaps he

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.870
holds responsibility for the

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.170
deaths of tens of millions more.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.600
Ok then, that’s it for today’s episode

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.600
on Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.490
who started fascism and met a gruesome

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.620
end at the hands of his own people.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.840
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.540
and whether you knew a lot about

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.690
Mussolini, or this was the first time

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.210
you’d heard anything about him, well

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.640
I hope you learned something new.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.580
As always, I would love to know

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.020
what you thought about this episode.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.090
We have lots and lots of members

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.680
from Italy, so my question to you

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.530
is this: what is the legacy of

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.180
Benito Mussolini on modern Italy?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.230
Do you think that Italy ever

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.630
really had to deal with its

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.100
role in the Second World War?

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.890
Are there any saving graces, any

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.250
positive things to be taken, from

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.810
the rule of Benito Mussolini?

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.240
I would love to know, so let’s

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.690
get this discussion started.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.100

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.829
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.949
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.789
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the East India Company.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.279
It’s the story of how one company went from an idea to arguably the most

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.199
powerful corporation to ever exist, accounting for half of the entire

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.099
world’s trade and controlling one of the world’s largest countries.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.419
So, let’s get right into the cut-throat capitalist story of The East India Company

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.319
Our story starts back in 1600, in London.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.297
Although a couple of hundred years later, by the 1800s.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.929
Britain would have an empire so large and powerful that it would claim

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:10.619
that the sun never set on the British Empire, in 1600 Britain was just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.459
one of several small European countries vying for global dominance.

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:21.269
France, Spain, Portugal and Holland - all these European countries

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:25.439
all had started to exert a growing influence on world trade.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.959
But they were all dwarfed by, they were much smaller

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.969
than, the vast Chinese and Mughal empires in the East.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.299
And it was in the East that riches were to be found.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.739
In particular, spices from Indonesia.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.769
Now, there’s an entire episode on the history of spice–it’s episode

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:51.259
168–so I’d encourage you to listen to that one if you haven’t already.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.119
But, long story short, spices were incredibly profitable goods to trade.

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:03.649
They didn’t take up much room in a ship, and they could be sold for a lot of money back in Europe.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.039
They were used for everything from covering up nasty smells to adding flavour to food.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.019
The problem was that there were never enough of them, and that it was

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.969
expensive to go to the Western Pacific Ocean to actually get these spices.

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.959
You needed boats and sailors, and by the time you had sailed

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.329
there, got the spices and come back, it could take several years.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:35.959
So, in 1600 a group of wealthy British merchants decided to

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.359
get together to form a company to buy ships and hire sailors.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.909
This was what was called a “joint stock” company.

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:52.009
In practice, this meant that everyone put in a bit of money and in

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.049
return they would become a part-owner and receive a share of the profits.

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:02.659
Although most companies are formed this way now, and it wasn’t completely

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.009
unique at the time, it was a relatively new structure, and what it did was

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.219
separate the owners of the company from the people who were paid to operate it.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:20.099
This structure of having multiple owners also meant that, because there were 200 or so

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.229
initial investors, the company was able to raise enough money to start, to get off the ground.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.139
It needed ships and men to sail them, and the process of sailing to the

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.929
Spice Islands, buying lots of spices and returning back could take several

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.949
years, so the company needed a large injection of money to get it started.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.539
Another important point to mention is that the company, which was called the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:53.609
East India Company, was given a “royal charter” by Queen Elizabeth I of England.

00:03:54.779 --> 00:04:00.669
This was a document signed by the queen, which not only gave the company an outward

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:06.999
sense of legitimacy and high status, it also gave it exclusive trading rights to the Far

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:12.919
East and the ability to have its own army–something that would come in handy later on.

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:18.829
Now, the British East India Company wasn’t the only East India Company - there

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.019
was, most famously, a Dutch East India Company but there were also Danish,

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:29.229
French, Portuguese, Genoese, Swedish and Austrian East India companies.

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:37.369
And soon enough after the first British East India Company ship set sail, in 1601, it found

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:43.139
that there was a lot of competition for spices in the East Indies, in modern day Indonesia.

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.029
The Dutch East India Company had developed a powerful monopoly on global

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.989
spice trade with its iron grip, its tight hold, on the Spice Islands.

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.429
But one place that had been relatively untouched by the Europeans was

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:04.699
the Indian subcontinent - essentially the area that includes all of

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:09.559
modern day Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:16.319
The Portuguese, Spanish and French had landed there and set up some trading

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.549
posts, but much of the area was controlled by the powerful Mughal Empire.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.789
In the early 1600s this empire, the Mughal empire, covered about 4 million

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:34.299
square kilometres and ruled over approximately 100 million people - it was

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:39.799
far richer and more powerful than any of the fledgling European empires.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.999
And when the first traders from the British East India Company arrived in India, in 1608, there

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:53.769
was no grand plan for imperial expansion, for taking over the country, as they would do later.

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.899
They were there to make money, to trade.

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.289
They came looking for spices, but it wouldn’t be spices that

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.869
would become the main commodity the East India Company traded.

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:10.199
It would be textiles, cloth, or woven fabric.

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.109
India had a very advanced textile industry, and the East India

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:20.859
Company would buy the latest textiles and send them back to Britain.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.119
Indian textiles were in high demand back in Britain, and soon enough

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:31.119
the company was setting up factories in Indian coastal cities.

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:38.439
At the time, the Mughal emperor was happy for the British to do this - after all, they

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:43.729
wanted to trade with him, they bought Indian textiles, and everyone was making money.

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:49.639
The British were also tiny compared to his empire, and he

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.619
was well aware of the power imbalance between the two powers.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:59.109
He would even, reportedly, make some British diplomats wait several

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.959
years before they were granted an audience, a meeting with him.

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.689
The one thing the Mughal emperor did grant the British though

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:12.559
was an exemption from taxes, they didn’t need to pay local taxes.

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.069
This will be important later on in our story.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:23.469
But for the first 130 years or so of the British East India Company’s existence

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:30.229
in India, it was principally a trading company, a company that would buy textiles

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:34.849
from Indian merchants and sail them back to Britain to sell for a profit.

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:41.949
This would all change in the mid 18th century, when the British East India Company began

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:48.789
its transition, its change, from a trading company to a corporation that ruled all of India.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:52.189
And it happened for a few reasons.

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:58.979
Firstly, the collapse of the Mughal empire, which started in the early 18th century

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:05.759
and was sped up with the invasion of India by the Persian ruler Nadir Shah in 1739.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:10.959
Secondly, India became an increasing battleground for

00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:14.259
tensions between Britain and France back in Europe.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:19.409
There were frequent skirmishes, small battles, between the British and

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:23.649
the French in India, and both sides had formed alliances with local

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:28.199
Indian rulers as a way to try to reinforce their military capabilities.

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:33.829
To defend itself against the French, the British East India Company

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:38.439
had started to build up an army mainly filled with Indian soldiers.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:45.939
This all culminated in the year 1757 with the Battle of Plassey, which

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:49.879
is often considered to be a turning point in the history of the British

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:54.849
East India Company, the history of India, and even world colonial history.

00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:59.939
The battle pitted the British East India Company against a

00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:04.193
local ruler called The Nawab of Bengal and his French allies.

00:09:05.173 --> 00:09:08.793
It was both a battle between the British and the French, but

00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:12.113
also a battle between the British and a local Indian ruler.

00:09:13.173 --> 00:09:17.083
Now, why, you might be thinking, was a trading company

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:20.833
fighting battles with local rulers and their European allies?

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:26.933
Well, with the Mughal empire in decline, local Indian rulers were becoming

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:32.083
increasingly powerful, and they would often seek to form alliances with foreign

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:37.263
trading companies, so you would have situations where armies of trading companies

00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:41.833
from different countries, let’s say Britain and France, would fight each other.

00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:51.403
In 1757, this particular local ruler, the Nawab of Bengal was unhappy with the East India Company.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:56.383
It didn’t pay him taxes, because of the exemption the Mughal emperor had

00:09:56.383 --> 00:10:01.113
given it, and it had been building fortified trading posts in his territory.

00:10:02.543 --> 00:10:08.483
These forts were in principle to protect against attack from other European powers,

00:10:08.623 --> 00:10:14.373
but perfectly reasonably the Nawab of Bengal saw them as a threat to his power.

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:21.963
Together with a small French force, the Nawab of Bengal attacked the British fort in Calcutta.

00:10:22.943 --> 00:10:28.013
Unprepared, the company’s civilian employees, plus a small group of

00:10:28.013 --> 00:10:33.223
mostly unprofessional soldiers, either attempted to escape or surrendered.

00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:39.303
When the Nawab’s army took over the town, the remaining East India Company

00:10:39.403 --> 00:10:44.213
civilians and soldiers were locked inside a small underground room that was

00:10:44.213 --> 00:10:49.143
normally used as a sort of prison cell, and was nicknamed “The Black Hole”.

00:10:50.443 --> 00:10:59.256
The hole measured 4.3 by 5.4 metres, and it would normally be used for a maximum of 6 prisoners.

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:06.246
On the night of 20th June, 1757, almost 150 people, it’s

00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:11.036
believed, were locked in The Black Hole without any food or water.

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:14.946
Perhaps you can imagine what happened next.

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:20.136
With no water or fresh air, in the June heat, it’s thought

00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:24.796
that up to 123 of the prisoners inside died overnight.

00:11:25.676 --> 00:11:29.376
A horrible death, but these would be far from the only

00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:33.306
people to meet a grim end in the subsequent months and years.

00:11:34.406 --> 00:11:40.476
When word got out what had happened, the East India Company leaders decided to seek revenge.

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:46.466
Lieutenant-colonel Robert Clive, who was originally an East India Company clerk

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:51.366
but now one of the company’s top military leaders, was sent to free Calcutta.

00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:57.186
Clive led a small army and managed to liberate Calcutta, but

00:11:57.376 --> 00:12:00.336
there was still the issue of the Nawab of Bengal to deal with.

00:12:01.436 --> 00:12:04.336
And this is what takes us to The Battle of Plassey.

00:12:05.026 --> 00:12:11.826
The two armies met at a place called Plassey, approximately 150km north of Calcutta.

00:12:12.946 --> 00:12:20.256
Clive’s army had around 3,000 men, while the Nawab and French forces numbered 50,000.

00:12:21.346 --> 00:12:25.786
But luck, or perhap cunning, was on Clive’s side.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:33.706
He had managed to bribe, to secretly pay, one of the Nawab’s leaders, a man called Mir Jafar.

00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:41.916
Mir Jafar was in control of about ¾ of the Nawab’s forces, and when the two armies met

00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:48.436
on the battlefield, Mir Jafar simply instructed his soldiers to not engage, to not fight.

00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:53.606
It wasn’t really much of a battle - the British forces

00:12:53.796 --> 00:12:57.916
only lost 22 men while the Nawab lost around 500.

00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:06.116
But the damage had been done, and this “battle” became the deciding incident in the fate of India.

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:10.866
Mir Jafar was rewarded by the British with the position

00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:14.966
of Nawab, and the British now had their man in power.

00:13:15.846 --> 00:13:21.026
After the Battle of Plassey, the British East India Company was able to put pressure

00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:26.636
on the severely weakened Mughal emperor to appoint it as the main tax-collector

00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:32.076
for the country, and over the next 100 years it went from trading company to

00:13:32.326 --> 00:13:37.716
country-administrator, essentially giving it the right to govern the entire country.

00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:42.706
With this, it continued to build up its army, which

00:13:42.706 --> 00:13:46.166
would consist primarily of local, Indian soldiers.

00:13:47.356 --> 00:13:56.356
By the 1790s this army numbered about 100,000, and by 1815, the East India Company had an army in

00:13:56.356 --> 00:14:03.456
India of almost a quarter of a million troops - more soldiers than the entire official British army.

00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:10.807
By this time India had turned from an important trading partner to a colonial interest.

00:14:11.527 --> 00:14:18.287
This was especially so after the loss of the American colonies, which was also partially caused by

00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:23.757
the East India Company, or at least by the British government’s treatment of the East India Company.

00:14:25.007 --> 00:14:29.427
In an attempt to support The East India Company, the British Parliament

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:34.647
decided to grant it a monopoly on the sale of tea to British American colonies,

00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:39.557
meaning it didn’t have to pay taxes or have to worry about British competition.

00:14:40.757 --> 00:14:45.407
This put American tea merchants out of business, and culminated in the

00:14:45.407 --> 00:14:51.267
Boston Tea Party in 1773, an important episode in American history that

00:14:51.447 --> 00:14:57.017
led to the American revolution and the kicking out of the British in 1776.

00:14:58.007 --> 00:15:01.527
So, having lost its most valuable colony, the

00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:04.857
Americas, an increasing importance was placed on India.

00:15:06.417 --> 00:15:11.097
By the start of the 19th century the British East India Company had succeeded

00:15:11.207 --> 00:15:15.347
in kicking out all of the other European powers in India, defeating the

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:20.027
Mughal emperor, and it was now in charge of all of the collection of taxes.

00:15:20.747 --> 00:15:25.577
Essentially, it ruled the country, it had political control over the entire state.

00:15:27.037 --> 00:15:31.657
But while you might have thought that this would bring with it huge profits

00:15:31.677 --> 00:15:36.167
and wealth, it was during the late 18th and early 19th century that the

00:15:36.197 --> 00:15:40.757
East India Company actually started to run into financial difficulties.

00:15:41.927 --> 00:15:45.947
Back in Britain, the Industrial Revolution was well underway.

00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:50.617
Indian textiles were no longer so competitive, and in fact it was

00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:54.767
often cheaper to make clothes in Britain and export them to India.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:16:02.797
What’s more, having a standing army of a quarter of a million men was not cheap, and the East

00:16:02.807 --> 00:16:08.337
India Company had to ask the British government for financial support on several occasions.

00:16:09.607 --> 00:16:15.617
By this time the East India Company was a de facto extension of the British state.

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:21.747
It was still independent, however not only was it supported by the state but

00:16:21.887 --> 00:16:26.807
it was part-owned by some of the most powerful politicians in the country, with

00:16:27.007 --> 00:16:32.687
25% of British members of parliament owning shares in the East India Company.

00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:38.597
Put another way, 1 in 4 politicians had a personal financial

00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:42.137
interest in the British state supporting the East India Company.

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:47.217
But the textile industry was becoming less and less profitable,

00:16:47.577 --> 00:16:51.197
so the East India Company looked for other goods to trade.

00:16:52.057 --> 00:16:57.704
There was one commodity that it could still make a healthy profit trading: Chinese tea.

00:16:58.659 --> 00:17:01.830
Chinese tea was the next big thing in Europe and

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.800
the East India Company wanted a piece of the action.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.250
The only problem was that the British East India Company simply didn’t

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.380
have enough money to pay for the tea from the Chinese tea growers.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.930
Britain had adopted the gold standard, it mainly had gold reserves, but the Chinese used silver.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:28.840
To get silver, Britain needed to sell something to the Chinese, but the Chinese empire was

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:36.170
proudly self-sufficient, with the Chinese Emperor Qianlong famously writing that “Our Celestial

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:42.330
Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders.”

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.960
But there was one product the British could bring into China, which

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.090
they could sell for silver, with which they could buy Chinese tea.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.350
Opium, the powerful drug made from poppies.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.060
The East India Company used its Bengal territories to grow poppies and illegally

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.240
smuggle opium into China in return for silver with which they bought their tea.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:15.430
This resulted in addiction, suffering and deaths, triggering the First Opium War.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.210
We have an entire episode on this, by the way, it’s episode 93,

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.682
so I’d recommend listening to that one if you’d like to learn more about it.

00:18:24.678 --> 00:18:26.172
Anyway, back to

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:26.752
our story.

00:18:27.292 --> 00:18:32.782
The British East India Company has gone from a relatively small trading company to a

00:18:32.942 --> 00:18:39.132
corporation running India, smuggling opium to China, and triggering vast and expensive wars.

00:18:40.182 --> 00:18:45.262
There were concerns about the growing influence and power that Company employees had in India.

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:52.202
Many were growing spectacularly wealthy, and there were plenty of valid concerns about corruption.

00:18:53.443 --> 00:18:58.080
As you might imagine, if you are in charge of collecting taxes there is a lot of

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.760
room for anything from corruption to extortion, and there were reports of towns and

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.770
villages being ransacked, being destroyed and robbed, by British company tax collectors.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.740
The East India Company was in charge of ruling the country, but its primary concern

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:22.350
was on its bottom line, on making money, not for the people it was in charge of.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.702
This is perhaps no better illustrated than in The Great Bengal famine of 1770.

00:19:30.672 --> 00:19:36.152
The East India Company had forced farmers to switch from producing food crops

00:19:36.182 --> 00:19:41.322
to producing crops like tea and cotton rather than food to feed themselves.

00:19:42.362 --> 00:19:49.682
A bad harvest pushed things over the edge, and it’s thought that up to 10 million people starved to

00:19:49.682 --> 00:19:55.522
death, all while the British East India Company employees would have plenty of food for themselves.

00:19:56.542 --> 00:20:00.852
This is just one of many examples of maltreatment of the

00:20:00.852 --> 00:20:04.362
local Indian population under the British East India Company.

00:20:05.702 --> 00:20:10.842
And in fact, the ultimate downfall of the East India Company would come

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:15.712
from within, from the soldiers that it had hired for its private army.

00:20:17.312 --> 00:20:21.512
As a reminder, this army, at its peak, numbered around

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:27.012
250,000 men, over 80% of whom were local Indians.

00:20:28.202 --> 00:20:33.652
Many of these Indian soldiers were unhappy with their levels of pay and promotion.

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:40.302
What’s more, a lot of soldiers from higher levels of Indian society saw the company’s

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:45.652
attempts to recruit soldiers from what were seen as lower levels of society as

00:20:45.652 --> 00:20:51.592
being a direct insult, given India’s strict caste, the social class, system.

00:20:52.862 --> 00:20:58.162
To add insult to injury, cartridges for the East India Company's new

00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:03.152
rifles, their new guns, were said to have been greased with pig and

00:21:03.192 --> 00:21:08.342
cow fat, making them off limits for both Hindus and Muslims alike.

00:21:09.699 --> 00:21:16.039
Combined with the famine, corruption, and general maltreatment and suffering, enough was enough.

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:24.159
In 1857, in a town just outside Delhi, Indian soldiers, who were employed by the East

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:29.789
India Company, rose up and attacked British officers, killing British soldiers and

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:35.279
other company employees, as well as other Indians who refused to join in the movement.

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:41.483
Over the next year and a half, hundreds of thousands of ordinary people also joined in with them.

00:21:42.393 --> 00:21:48.553
In retaliation, as revenge, and to make sure that they had definitely crushed all signs

00:21:48.553 --> 00:21:54.613
of the uprising, the East India Company tortured and killed thousands of suspected rebels.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:22:03.133
In a particularly grisly and violent display, the chosen method of execution for Indian rebels

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:09.783
was to tie them to the front of a cannon and fire it, literally blowing the rebels to pieces.

00:22:11.224 --> 00:22:14.754
Alarmed and horrified by the bloodshed, the British

00:22:14.804 --> 00:22:17.944
state finally got to grips with the East India Company.

00:22:18.974 --> 00:22:24.174
In 1858, the Government of India Act transferred the East India Company's

00:22:24.204 --> 00:22:29.564
possessions to the British Crown, with Queen Victoria becoming the ruler of India.

00:22:30.764 --> 00:22:35.714
The East India Company continued to exist for another 15 years, trading

00:22:35.714 --> 00:22:40.574
tea for the British government, before finally closing down in 1874.

00:22:42.044 --> 00:22:47.614
After 274 years the British East India Company was no more,

00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:52.124
but its legacy is longstanding both in Britain and India.

00:22:53.474 --> 00:22:59.074
From the docklands of London, which were built for the East India Company, to grand country

00:22:59.074 --> 00:23:05.274
houses built on shareholder profits, from colonial outposts in India through to the Indian

00:23:05.274 --> 00:23:10.704
civil service, there are traces of the East India Company that are still very visible today.

00:23:11.464 --> 00:23:17.004
It is clearly a complicated legacy, one of a corporation from a tiny island in

00:23:17.004 --> 00:23:21.684
Northern Europe that took over one of the largest countries in the world, started

00:23:21.684 --> 00:23:26.954
wars, trafficked drugs, and mercilessly punished anyone who stood in its way.

00:23:28.334 --> 00:23:34.574
It’s easy and perhaps simplistic to make parallels between the powerful multinational corporations

00:23:34.574 --> 00:23:41.184
of today, but when you realise that there was basically no oversight or accountability, when you

00:23:41.184 --> 00:23:47.404
realise the extents to which the East India Company was prepared to go in pursuit of its profits

00:23:47.464 --> 00:23:54.044
and you see the true scale of the East India Company, it’s clear that it was in a league of its own.

00:23:56.094 --> 00:24:00.964
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the East India Company.

00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:05.464
I hope it was an interesting one, and it has shed some light on what

00:24:05.474 --> 00:24:09.914
happens, or rather what “happened”, when a company is allowed to do

00:24:09.954 --> 00:24:14.364
almost anything it wants, and is answerable only to its shareholders.

00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:18.674
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:24:19.034 --> 00:24:22.564
What do you think about the legacy of the British East India Company?

00:24:23.034 --> 00:24:28.744
How do you think the history of India, or indeed the world, would have been different without it?

00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:32.734
Do you think that the East India Company had any positive

00:24:32.734 --> 00:24:35.564
lasting impact for India, or was it all negative?

00:24:36.284 --> 00:24:39.894
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

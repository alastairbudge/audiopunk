Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:16.546
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:21.056
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:27.906
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part two of our three-part mini-series on Disney.

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:32.716
You can listen to these episodes individually if you like, but they

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:36.996
are intended to be listened to in order, so if you haven’t yet had the

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:40.896
chance to listen to part one, I’d recommend listening to that one first.

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:46.976
As a quick reminder of what we talked about in part one, it was the history of Disney,

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:52.366
how it all started with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit, why it was actually Mickey Mouse

00:00:52.396 --> 00:00:56.768
that became the main character for Disney, how the organisation developed over the

00:00:56.768 --> 00:01:02.938
years, what Walt Disney was reportedly like as a man, and what Disney is up to today.

00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:09.498
So, in part two, in today’s episode we are going to talk about some of the magic

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:15.368
of the Disney business, and why it has become such a hugely successful enterprise.

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:21.338
We’ll first cover something called the Disney flywheel, then we’ll talk about how

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:26.238
Disney continues to make money from films long after they are released, we’ll talk

00:01:26.248 --> 00:01:31.558
about some of the interesting ways that Disney had tried to cut out middlemen, and

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:36.908
end by talking about one amazingly clever development that Disney is now working on.

00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:41.008
It's a super interesting topic, even for those of you

00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:43.858
that might not be particularly interested in business.

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:47.748
And if you are the sort of person who is interested in business

00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:51.478
type topics, well I think you will find it even more fascinating.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:56.445
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get started right away.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:03.095
The Walt Disney Company started, as we learned in Part One, with Walt Disney

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:07.985
and his brother Roy setting up a small animation studio in California.

00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:15.565
The company is now worth over 300 billion dollars, has made–and still makes–some of

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:21.275
the most successful films in history, and employs about a quarter of a million people.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:25.855
So, how did it get there, from a business point of view?

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:33.385
Well, the easy answer might be that it created really good entertainment, from films to theme parks,

00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:38.915
people pay money to be entertained, and if you continue making things that hundreds of millions

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:44.655
of people want for almost a hundred years then it’s completely logical that Disney became so big.

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:48.885
But there are some really interesting aspects to how

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:52.365
Disney works that have propelled it to its success.

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:57.855
The first, and most famous of these is something called a Flywheel.

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:04.355
Now, a flywheel is a small metal disc, a small metal wheel

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:08.335
that is used to regulate and push forward a larger disc.

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:15.335
The concept of a flywheel in business is when there are lots of smaller things happening that

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:21.645
all support each other, that all help each other, so that the overall object, the overall

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:27.325
business, moves faster than all of the individual objects would do if they were on their own.

00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:35.945
When it comes to Disney, there’s a now famous drawing drawn by Walt Disney himself from back in 1957

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:43.185
where he mapped out exactly how each part of his Disney empire helped push the other parts forward.

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:50.855
The map that Disney drew back in 1957 would look completely different now, as the Walt Disney

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:55.823
Company doesn’t just make films, sell licenses for products, and have theme parks, it now

00:03:55.823 --> 00:04:01.753
does everything from cruise lines to sports networks, streaming services to news channels.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:06.192
But the principle is the same - there are a lot of different parts

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:09.952
to Disney, but they all work in tandem, supporting each other.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:15.332
In Walt Disney’s map, in the middle stood the creative talent,

00:04:15.372 --> 00:04:19.422
the characters of the films, the centre of all of the magic.

00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:24.262
This creative centre links to all the other parts of the flywheel,

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:29.542
and is in turn linked to by other aspects of the Disney business.

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:36.702
For example, people watch a Mickey Mouse film so they want to buy Mickey Mouse merchandise, which

00:04:36.892 --> 00:04:42.772
reminds them of the Disney brand, which might make them more likely to go to Disney world, where

00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:48.692
they might buy a Disney magazine, which in turn advertises Disney films, so someone might go to

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:54.562
the next Disney film, discover a new character they like, they might buy the record of the music

00:04:54.572 --> 00:04:59.602
from the film, which will remind them of how much they enjoyed the film, and so on and so on.

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:05.462
Everything is joined together, with each part linking to the next, supporting it,

00:05:05.612 --> 00:05:11.572
keeping it top of mind, and further cementing the Disney brand into that person’s life.

00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:18.202
This might sound like some business school lecture, that it’s easy to see how it all

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:24.532
works with retrospect, but Walt Disney himself drew this all out, he knew it perfectly.

00:05:25.332 --> 00:05:29.482
He realised that at the heart of everything were the characters and the

00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:34.412
story–without magical characters and magical stories the whole thing would come

00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:40.172
crashing down–but that all these other aspects of the Disney business reinforced

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:44.642
each other, making the whole this much greater than the sum of its parts.

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:51.032
Since this Disney flywheel was first mapped out, back in 1957, the Walt

00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:56.552
Disney company has continued to grow by adding things to its flywheel that

00:05:56.552 --> 00:06:00.872
will increase the value of the overall pie, that all support each other.

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:05.932
So, that’s our Disney flywheel, the mechanic that means

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:08.372
all the different parts are supporting each other.

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:15.782
The second, related, aspect of the business of Disney is about how good Disney is

00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:21.342
at extracting value from the centre of the flywheel, the characters and the story.

00:06:22.212 --> 00:06:27.552
As we talked about briefly in Part One, Disney films are incredibly expensive to make.

00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:32.662
Right from the early days, Disney didn’t skimp on the quality of illustration,

00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:36.702
it didn’t try to save money by getting lower quality illustrators.

00:06:37.622 --> 00:06:44.172
Anyone can see this in a Disney film, the quality of illustration is fantastic, and always has been.

00:06:45.232 --> 00:06:50.982
This means that making one always has been very expensive, and when it comes to the more

00:06:50.982 --> 00:06:57.332
recent animated films, things like Frozen and Tangled, they are incredibly expensive.

00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:03.046
Tangled, the 2010 film about the girl with magical hair who

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:08.036
is locked up in a tower, cost $260 million dollars to make.

00:07:09.256 --> 00:07:13.516
So, there is a very high cost-base to the creative side of

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.756
Disney, just to produce one of these films is hugely expensive.

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:23.586
Even for a company like Disney, making one of these massive films is risky.

00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:30.746
It might flop, people might not like it, and in that case Disney can lose a lot of money on a film.

00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:39.266
You might not remember a Disney film from 2011 called Mars Needs Moms, because it wasn’t very good,

00:07:39.686 --> 00:07:46.846
but it cost $150 million dollars to make, and only brought in $39 million dollars at the box office.

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:54.944
But these box office flops, these failures, are few and far between, they don’t happen very often.

00:07:55.624 --> 00:08:02.304
Disney is evidently excellent at producing hit after hit, but what it is perhaps even

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:07.454
better at is making as much money as possible from each and every part of the film.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:13.514
Disney builds brands around the main characters in the films, selling the rights to

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:19.318
merchandise, to things like toys, duvet covers, clothes, video games, you name it.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:25.688
Of course, you know this - you may well have bought Disney merchandise - but the way to think

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:31.608
about this is that there is the story and the characters at the centre of everything, and of course

00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:37.708
these films often make over a billion dollars at the box office, but the way Disney continues

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:42.578
to make money from it is through everything else that they do with the film and the characters.

00:08:43.408 --> 00:08:45.738
This isn’t a new development at all.

00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:52.958
Indeed, as we talked about in the last episode, as early as 1930 Walt Disney started

00:08:52.978 --> 00:08:58.268
merchandising Mickey Mouse, he was offered $300 to put Mickey Mouse on some pencils.

00:08:59.648 --> 00:09:08.548
$300 in 1930 is about $5,000 in today’s money, so not a huge amount of money for the rights to

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:15.008
use probably the world’s most famous mouse, but Walt Disney needed the cash, so he said yes.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.950
And the merchandising never stopped.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.570
But merchandising is just one way to squeeze more money out of each and every movie.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.990
Another way that Disney used to do this was through re-releasing the movie out into the cinema.

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:35.824
Remember, the video cassette recorder didn’t come out until the late 1970s, and so

00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:40.484
before that if you wanted to watch a movie again, you had to go to the cinema again.

00:09:41.174 --> 00:09:47.474
Disney would release a film for a defined period, then wait a few years and re-release it.

00:09:48.334 --> 00:09:53.474
Of course, it’s the same film, so there are no more production costs, giving Disney

00:09:53.474 --> 00:09:57.824
the chance to make even more money, both from people who didn’t see it the first

00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:02.738
time, and people who did see it but enjoyed it so much they want to watch it again.

00:10:03.828 --> 00:10:10.148
And if you grew up in the 1990s, as I did, you probably remember a series of films that went

00:10:10.148 --> 00:10:16.368
straight to video, that didn’t come out in the cinema, and were available to buy to watch at home.

00:10:17.338 --> 00:10:22.448
They were normally sequels of the Disney hit films, so you had Pocahontas II,

00:10:23.076 --> 00:10:28.746
The Return of Jafar, which was the sequel to Alladin, and around 25 others.

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:33.146
Now, a lot of these were quite average quality films,

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:36.906
and most don’t really expand on the original story.

00:10:37.594 --> 00:10:40.664
So, if you haven’t watched them, you aren’t really missing out.

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:48.144
The straight-to-video era for Disney didn’t continue forever, it stopped in 2008, but it was

00:10:48.144 --> 00:10:53.704
an interesting experiment with what happens when you control the distribution of everything.

00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:58.264
If you go and watch a film in a cinema, Disney has to

00:10:58.264 --> 00:11:01.094
share a percentage of the money you pay with the cinema.

00:11:01.784 --> 00:11:06.284
But, if Disney controls everything, from the creation of the film through

00:11:06.284 --> 00:11:10.244
to how it is watched by someone like you or me, well you don’t have to

00:11:10.244 --> 00:11:14.244
share this money with anyone, or at least you share a lot less of it.

00:11:14.984 --> 00:11:19.444
And that brings us to Disney today, and probably the most revolutionary

00:11:19.634 --> 00:11:23.574
and important development for Disney, and that’s Disney Plus.

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:30.034
Disney Plus, in case you hadn’t heard of it, is Disney’s answer to Netflix.

00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:35.304
You pay a monthly or annual fee to Disney, and you

00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:38.534
can watch any of the Disney movies, whenever you want.

00:11:39.114 --> 00:11:43.354
Disney has a direct relationship with you, you pay Disney directly,

00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:47.358
not a cinema, not a third party, not a shop that sells a video.

00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:52.474
It’s also remarkably cheap, at least when you first think about it.

00:11:53.364 --> 00:11:59.814
In Europe it’s €7 a month, or €70 a year, for the entire Disney catalogue,

00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:04.294
hundreds of hours of Disney films, available at the tap of a button.

00:12:05.014 --> 00:12:09.944
Certainly when you compare it to buying the videos or DVDs, which could

00:12:09.944 --> 00:12:16.194
easily be €20, or going to watch it in a cinema, which is easily more than €10

00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:21.274
nowadays, it does seem like an incredible bargain, it seems like very good value.

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:27.754
But, when you look at it a little bit more closely, there’s another way to think about it.

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:34.144
If you weren’t subscribing to Disney Plus, you probably wouldn’t be going to buy these films on

00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:40.494
DVDs, and you might not be that likely to go back to the cinema to watch a re-release of them.

00:12:41.414 --> 00:12:46.904
Disney owns the rights to all of the Disney films, so there isn’t much of a direct

00:12:46.944 --> 00:12:52.554
cost to it to allow you to stream a Disney film, to watch one on Disney Plus.

00:12:53.424 --> 00:13:00.514
In fact, coming back to our flywheel, Disney Plus means unlimited Disney is in your house,

00:13:00.564 --> 00:13:07.834
available 24/7, and the films are working as adverts for all of the rest of the Disney products.

00:13:08.824 --> 00:13:15.084
For Disney it’s absolutely fabulous if you - or even better, your kids - spend hours

00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:20.534
watching Disney movies, because then you’ll buy Mickey Mouse pencils, your kids might

00:13:20.814 --> 00:13:26.544
beg you to take them to a Disney theme park, you’ll be more likely to buy a t-shirt with

00:13:26.554 --> 00:13:31.654
Simba from the Lion King on it, and when there is the next big Disney release at the

00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:36.921
cinema, you’ll see trailers for it on Disney Plus, you'll see adverts all over Disney Plus.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:41.684
And the Disney Plus service has so far been a huge success.

00:13:42.144 --> 00:13:47.304
Within 24 hours it had 10 million subscribers, 6 months after launch it

00:13:47.314 --> 00:13:51.884
had 50 million, and it now has almost 100 million paying subscribers.

00:13:52.754 --> 00:13:58.334
Of course, it’s quite nice for Disney to have 100 million people paying €7 a month,

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:04.294
but the real advantage is the fact that Disney has a direct relationship with you, the

00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:09.534
consumer, and the more Disney you watch, the more stuff from Disney you will end up buying.

00:14:10.794 --> 00:14:15.084
I can remember, when I was about 8 years old I guess, there being

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:18.964
an advert before the start of a Disney film, where you could write

00:14:18.994 --> 00:14:23.454
a letter and get a free short Disney video sent to you in the post.

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:29.528
I thought, wow, a free video, and dutifully sent off a letter to get mine.

00:14:30.588 --> 00:14:35.588
A few weeks later, it arrived, and it was a video all about the magic of

00:14:35.618 --> 00:14:39.958
Disneyland Paris, and I think there were a few cartoons in it as well.

00:14:40.898 --> 00:14:45.618
I remember thinking that it was mad that I had got a video for free, but years

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:50.138
later, I realised that it was really just an advert for Disneyland Paris.

00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:55.848
And the real sceptic might say that, with Disney Plus, Disney has

00:14:55.868 --> 00:14:59.988
actually achieved something that most companies would die for, and that’s

00:14:59.988 --> 00:15:04.598
hundreds of millions of people paying to watch adverts for their products.

00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:10.968
OK then, that is it for the part two of our mini-series

00:15:10.968 --> 00:15:14.398
on Disney, about the business of this magical corporation.

00:15:14.928 --> 00:15:18.898
I hope it’s been an interesting one, that you’ve learned a little bit about some of the

00:15:18.898 --> 00:15:24.658
ways it makes money, and now you'll certainly know that there is a lot of money in magic.

00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:29.018
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:15:29.348 --> 00:15:30.728
Are you a Disney fan?

00:15:30.978 --> 00:15:34.818

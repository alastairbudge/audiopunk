Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.370
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.500
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.830
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Adnan Khashoggi.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.920
He was a businessman, a hyper connector, a lavish spender, and an arms dealer, who made

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.420
his fortune in the late 20th century through facilitating connections between the West

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.919
and Saudi Arabia, earning himself the nickname of “The Great Gatsby of The Middle East”..

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.550
His was a fascinating, if not controversial life, and I’m thrilled to tell you more about it today.

00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:55.072
OK then, let’s get started and talk about the life of Adnan Khashoggi.

00:00:56.392 --> 00:01:01.642
Between the years of 1984 and 1995 there was a popular

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:06.652
American TV show called Lifestyle Of The Rich And The Famous.

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:13.782
The show involved, as the title suggested, a look inside the lives of rich and famous people.

00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:23.022
And in one of the first episodes, from February of 1985, the show opened like this:

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.992
How lavish a lifestyle would you lead if you were the richest man on earth?

00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:32.762
In this world exclusive edition of Lifestyles, we'll explore the fabulous private

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:37.802
domains of Adnan Khashoggi whose globetrotting existence is so unbelievably lush.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:41.882
It has inspired blockbuster movies and novels, which only pale in

00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:45.926
comparison to the true story you will see in the next 60 minutes.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:49.848
In case you didn’t get that, the host said:

00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:55.234
“How lavish a lifestyle would you lead if you were the richest man on earth?

00:01:55.688 --> 00:02:02.738
In this world exclusive edition of Lifestyles, we'll explore the fabulous private domains of Adnan

00:02:02.738 --> 00:02:09.818
Khashoggi whose globetrotting existence is so unbelievably lush it has inspired blockbuster movies

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:16.638
and novels, which only pale in comparison to the true story you will see in the next 60 minutes”

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:24.108
The next 60 minutes went on to describe the “mysterious mogul”, how excessive his

00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:29.748
life was, the houses, the yachts, the private aeroplanes, the royal friends, and

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:37.338
how he had an estimated wealth of $10 billion, making him the richest man on Earth.

00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:46.288
This was in 1985, so $10 billion is around $30 billion in inflation adjusted terms.

00:02:46.908 --> 00:02:51.938
In today’s age of tech billionaires he would only just sneak into the top 50 richest

00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:58.278
people in the world, but back in 1985 this would have put him firmly in first place.

00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:04.568
But, just a year later, he was said to be down to his last few dollars,

00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:09.328
with creditors chasing him for everything from unpaid jet fuel to

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:12.678
staff at his houses complaining that they hadn’t been paid in weeks.

00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:18.118
And this all begged the question, where did the money go?

00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:24.118
Was he ever the richest man on Earth, or was it all one great lie?

00:03:25.648 --> 00:03:30.518
Adnan Khashoggi was born in 1935, in Mecca, in Saudi Arabia.

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:34.668
When he was born, Saudi Arabia was a poor country,

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:38.368
for the most part an agricultural subsistence economy.

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:46.758
In 1938, three years after Khashoggi was born, oil reserves were discovered, but this didn’t mean

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:52.368
that the country’s economy went from poor and underdeveloped to swimming in oil cash overnight.

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:58.248
It took a long time, with the majority of the country not seeing the benefits from

00:03:58.248 --> 00:04:03.708
the oil until the late 20th century, debatably even the start of the 21st century.

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:10.068
But Adnan Khashoggi was not born into regular Saudi society.

00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:17.058
His father was the king’s personal doctor, and the young Khashoggi was afforded

00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:21.938
privileges and opportunities that most of the kingdom’s citizens did not enjoy.

00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:27.738
He was educated in Alexandria, in Egypt, at an exclusive private

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:31.298
school where his classmates would include the future king of Jordan.

00:04:32.718 --> 00:04:36.218
It was at this exclusive school, where he rubbed shoulders with the

00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:40.118
sons of the region’s rich and powerful, that he would come to understand

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:45.188
the power of connection, of brokering a deal between two parties.

00:04:45.948 --> 00:04:51.368
According to his obituary on his personal website, “It was at school that Khashoggi

00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:56.358
first learned the commercial value of facilitating a deal, bringing together a

00:04:56.368 --> 00:05:01.418
Libyan classmate whose father wanted to import towels with an Egyptian classmate

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:07.088
whose father manufactured towels, earning USD $1,000 for the introduction.”

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:15.108
Now, whether this is folklore or not, a carefully curated story that served to plant the idea

00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:21.188
of Khashoggi having some god-given ability to create advantageous deals, that is anyone’s guess.

00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:26.878
What does seem to be true is that this is how he would make most of

00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:32.048
his money, becoming, if you believed him, the richest man in the world.

00:05:33.288 --> 00:05:37.388
He went to university in the United States, but left before he graduated.

00:05:38.328 --> 00:05:44.228
After all, there was money to be made, and Khashoggi sensed that this was his time.

00:05:45.668 --> 00:05:51.368
To quote his personal website again, “In one of his first big deals, a large construction

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:56.638
company was experiencing difficulties with the trucks that it used on the shifting desert sands.

00:05:57.338 --> 00:06:02.978
Khashoggi, using money given to him by his father for a car, bought a number of Kenworth

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:09.618
trucks, whose wide wheels, like a camel's foot, made traversing the desert considerably easier.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:16.468
Khashoggi made his first $250,000 leasing the trucks to the construction

00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:20.355
company, and became the Saudi Arabia-based agent for Kenworth.“

00:06:21.638 --> 00:06:27.308
That $250,000 would be something like $3 million in today’s

00:06:27.308 --> 00:06:31.228
money, by running a desert-based car rental company, essentially.

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:37.908
If this story is to be believed, it must have seemed almost too easy.

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:43.858
Khashoggi was in this unique position not only of having powerful contacts in Saudi

00:06:43.858 --> 00:06:49.278
Arabia but of speaking fluent English and understanding Western business culture.

00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:55.778
He crafted this reputation for himself as a man who could straddle both cultures, who could

00:06:55.778 --> 00:07:01.598
put Saudi buyer and Western seller together, taking a small percentage for himself, of course.

00:07:02.598 --> 00:07:07.148
A small percentage, when we are talking about deals worth tens or hundreds

00:07:07.148 --> 00:07:11.278
of millions of dollars, well these end up being quite significant.

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:20.886
And deals for towels, or deals for large desert trucks, well these can be large, but Khashoggi would

00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:27.346
later discover something that was more expensive, and therefore more lucrative, than anything you

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:34.776
would need for a good night’s sleep or for crossing the desert: war, or rather, the threat of war.

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:41.156
Let’s return to his obituary again, and remember, this is on his “personal website”.

00:07:42.136 --> 00:07:45.616
“Khashoggi became an advocate and negotiator for the

00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:48.986
defence relationship between Saudi Arabia and the West.

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:54.766
Khashoggi provided advice, strategy, and structures for government defence contracts.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:08:01.686
In the 1960s and 1970s, Khashoggi helped develop the Saudi defence sector during a period in

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:06.496
which the young Kingdom felt threatened by the rise of nationalist movements in the region.”

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:13.756
Now, “defence” in this context is somewhat of a euphemism for arms,

00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:19.586
weapons, guns, bombs, planes, tanks, everything that a country needs to

00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:24.966
defend itself from attack, or if it so desires, to attack another country.

00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:30.566
Saudi Arabia didn’t have the capacity to make its own arms, but there were

00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:34.896
plenty of Western companies with great expertise in the area that were more

00:08:34.906 --> 00:08:39.126
than willing to supply the Middle Eastern kingdom with the goods that it needed.

00:08:40.306 --> 00:08:44.096
And this was something encouraged by Western governments as well.

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:51.756
After all, Saudi Arabia had and still has vast oil reserves, so it was in Western

00:08:51.776 --> 00:08:56.786
interests for the kingdom to remain a close ally, and a stable one at that.

00:08:57.826 --> 00:09:00.076
So, who did the kingdom turn to?

00:09:00.696 --> 00:09:06.006
Or rather, who did Western arms companies turn to to sell their wares to the Saudis?

00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:10.356
The man who had made a name for himself as having impeccable

00:09:10.376 --> 00:09:15.407
connections, and a foot in both camps: Adnan Khashoggi.

00:09:16.376 --> 00:09:19.916
Khashoggi became the agent for a variety of different Western

00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:23.786
corporations, representing them in deals with the Saudi government.

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:28.706
One is a company that is still around today, and you may have heard

00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:32.876
of: Lockheed, or Lockheed Martin as it would come to be known.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:39.406
Khashoggi was deeply involved with the company, becoming its agent in the region when he was a mere

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:45.835
26 years old, selling billions of dollars of weapons and equipment to Saudi Arabia in the 1970s.

00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:49.946
And it made him a very rich man.

00:09:51.336 --> 00:10:01.756
His commission varied, from 2.5% up to a reported 15%, and he ended up earning $150 million dollars

00:10:01.806 --> 00:10:08.766
from the company as Saudi Arabia went on an arms-buying spree after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.

00:10:10.094 --> 00:10:13.182
If there was ever an example of the value of connection,

00:10:13.562 --> 00:10:17.552
of putting two parties together, well this was it.

00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:24.022
Now, Lockheed would say that this was simply commission, a price the company was

00:10:24.032 --> 00:10:28.322
willing to pay for someone to sell its goods and services in a different market.

00:10:29.412 --> 00:10:34.322
But for all of this money, $150 million, for it all to

00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:39.572
go to one person, one individual, it seemed…excessive.

00:10:41.062 --> 00:10:44.032
It would turn out that this money would go through

00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:47.242
Khashoggi, but it wouldn’t all end up in his pocket.

00:10:48.642 --> 00:10:54.562
In 1975, when forced to testify in front of a US Senate Subcommittee about

00:10:54.572 --> 00:10:59.822
bribery, the chairman of Lockheed was forced to admit that a proportion of

00:10:59.822 --> 00:11:05.022
Khashoggi’s fees would be earmarked for bribes to high-ranking Saudi officials.

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:10.552
In other words, Lockheed would pay Khashoggi, Khashoggi would transfer

00:11:10.592 --> 00:11:14.542
Saudi officials a kickback, a bribe, into their Swiss bank accounts

00:11:14.772 --> 00:11:18.902
and they would sign off on the multi-million dollar arms purchases.

00:11:19.952 --> 00:11:24.472
And the money wasn’t the only perk of doing business with Khashoggi, and

00:11:24.822 --> 00:11:28.332
this is where this story is going to get slightly sordid, I’m afraid.

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:36.592
He was married, he had five children of his own, but he kept a dozen or so “pleasure wives”,

00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:43.022
mistresses who would be taken around the world and put up in five star hotels, lavished with gifts

00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:50.412
and a five star lifestyle, but part of the deal was that they would need to acquiesce to Khashoggi’s

00:11:50.512 --> 00:11:56.706
every wish, which would often include sleeping with his business associates and government contacts.

00:11:58.082 --> 00:12:02.322
This might be gross and immoral, it might be a dereliction of his

00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:05.342
duty and of the duty of the corrupt officials and businessmen.

00:12:06.072 --> 00:12:09.952
You could even argue that it resulted in a buildup of arms in the region.

00:12:11.072 --> 00:12:14.642
But for many years it was great business.

00:12:15.482 --> 00:12:18.402
It was great business for Lockheed, the arms company.

00:12:18.712 --> 00:12:23.762
It was great business for the Saudi officials who received huge bribes for choosing

00:12:23.762 --> 00:12:28.922
Lockheed, and it was great business for the man in the middle, Adnan Khashoggi.

00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:36.002
Khashoggi took this money and invested it all over the world, speculating in real estate,

00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:42.432
oil refineries, car rental companies, all and any commercial enterprise that he could.

00:12:43.902 --> 00:12:48.652
The problem was, according to someone who would later do business with him, Donald J.

00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:51.952
Trump, Khashoggi was a rubbish businessman.

00:12:53.052 --> 00:12:57.512
He was great at facilitating connections, he was great at bringing people together,

00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:03.542
as well as cultivating his own brand as a hyper connector and power broker, but when

00:13:03.542 --> 00:13:09.372
it came to investing and operating businesses, this wasn’t where his skills lay.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:17.118
Trump got to know Khashoggi, at least from a business perspective, after he bought his yacht.

00:13:18.476 --> 00:13:23.332
Khashoggi had bought this yacht in 1980, and it cost a reported

00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:28.282
$100 million to build, almost $400 million in today’s money.

00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:31.952
It was the peak of luxury, complete with its own

00:13:31.952 --> 00:13:35.322
patisserie, even hospital with an operating theatre.

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:43.342
And of course, it had all of the usual toys and features of the ultra-rich: helipads, a cinema,

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:49.142
and large enough fridges and freezers to carry a three-month supply of food for 100 people.

00:13:50.272 --> 00:13:55.802
It was so opulent that it even featured in the James Bond movie Never Say Never Again.

00:13:57.362 --> 00:14:03.842
For Khashoggi, it was a tool of business, and he would use it to entertain business executives

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:09.262
and government officials, prospective clients, far away from the prying eyes of the media.

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:16.352
On one occasion there were a reported five heads of state being entertained on it at the same time.

00:14:17.442 --> 00:14:24.192
It was a business expense, helping Khashoggi seal deals, but it was a serious expense.

00:14:25.492 --> 00:14:31.642
After he ran into financial difficulties in the late 1980s, he was forced to sell it, and

00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:36.922
this is where he came into contact with Donald Trump, who would go on to buy the yacht.

00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:43.592
According to a story that Trump would happily tell anyone who asked, Trump managed to get

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:49.322
$1 million knocked off the asking price because Khashoggi didn’t want Trump to continue

00:14:49.332 --> 00:14:54.572
using the yacht’s original name, Nabila, because it was Khashoggi’s daughter’s name.

00:14:55.602 --> 00:15:01.302
What Khashoggi didn’t think about, or didn’t know, and this was what Trump thought made

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:06.652
him a bad businessman, was that Trump had no intention of keeping the original name.

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:11.992
If there is anything anyone knows about Donald Trump, it’s that he likes to

00:15:12.002 --> 00:15:17.516
stick his name on everything he owns, and sure enough, he took the $1 million

00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:22.912
reduction in price, and immediately changed the name to “Trump Princess”.

00:15:24.372 --> 00:15:26.102
Now, back to Khashoggi.

00:15:26.732 --> 00:15:30.922
If you remember the start of the episode, the programme claimed that

00:15:30.922 --> 00:15:35.882
he was the richest man in the world, with a fortune of $10 billion.

00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:40.972
How did he get there, you might be asking yourself, if he was a lousy

00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:46.322
businessman and made his money merely as a facilitator between Western companies

00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:50.192
and Saudi government officials, taking a small percentage in commission?

00:15:51.592 --> 00:15:55.222
The simple answer is, most probably, he didn’t.

00:15:55.812 --> 00:15:58.912
He never had anywhere near the riches that he said he had.

00:15:59.422 --> 00:16:03.942
Khashoggi never was the richest man in the world, far from it, but

00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:08.632
he was exceptionally talented at making people believe that he was.

00:16:09.872 --> 00:16:13.712
Sure, he was very rich, but a lot of what he said

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:17.462
he owned was either paid for with credit or rented.

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:23.172
He would be given large loans, people would extend huge credit lines to him.

00:16:24.302 --> 00:16:30.012
After all, he was good for it, the richest man in the world always paid his bills, did he not?

00:16:31.022 --> 00:16:36.982
It turned out that even making huge commissions on arms sales was not enough to pay for

00:16:36.982 --> 00:16:45.142
a lifestyle that was, at one point, costing him a reported $250,000 every single day.

00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:53.852
And from his heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, things started to go downhill for Adnan Khashoggi.

00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:59.462
He was forced to sell the planes and yachts, and to revise his spending.

00:17:00.572 --> 00:17:07.062
He was even arrested in 1988 in Switzerland on charges of racketeering and conspiracy, with

00:17:07.072 --> 00:17:12.602
US federal prosecutors claiming that he had helped the former president of the Philippines and

00:17:12.602 --> 00:17:17.502
his wife run away with over a hundred million dollars that they had stolen from the country.

00:17:18.832 --> 00:17:22.482
He fought the extradition order, and only agreed to be

00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:25.452
extradited when the more serious charges were dropped.

00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:30.502
But the good days were over for this international playboy.

00:17:31.522 --> 00:17:36.172
He never officially declared personal bankruptcy, but he would be chased by

00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:42.732
his creditors for the rest of his life, before dying in 2017, at the age of 81.

00:17:43.842 --> 00:17:50.692
Now, you have heard the story of Adnan Khashoggi, and how a man became spectacularly wealthy, or at

00:17:50.692 --> 00:17:56.372
least managed to live a life of vast luxury, as a middleman between the West and the Middle East.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:18:03.192
You might also recognise his surname, Khashoggi, because of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi

00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:09.512
journalist and dissident who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, with the

00:18:09.512 --> 00:18:15.442
CIA concluding that this was done on the orders of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman.

00:18:16.352 --> 00:18:22.652
Jamal Khashoggi and Adnan Khashoggi are not, in fact, strangers that share a common surname.

00:18:23.162 --> 00:18:24.302
They were related.

00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:28.082
Adnan Khashoggi was Jamal Khashoggi’s uncle.

00:18:29.422 --> 00:18:34.242
As you might remember, the then US president Donald Trump, was under pressure to

00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:39.402
publicly criticise Saudi Arabia for the murder of the dissident journalist, especially

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:44.382
after his own government agency concluded that this was a state-sponsored murder.

00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:51.082
But he did not, instead citing the value of US weapon sales to the country.

00:18:52.612 --> 00:18:58.012
Adnan Khoshoggi died in 2017, a year before his nephew, Jamal.

00:18:59.292 --> 00:19:02.532
But the two men couldn’t have been more different.

00:19:03.632 --> 00:19:08.722
One spoke out against the Saudi regime’s weapons purchases and military intervention.

00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:11.072
The other facilitated it.

00:19:12.002 --> 00:19:18.272
One sold his yacht to Donald Trump, the other was metaphorically abandoned at sea by him.

00:19:19.352 --> 00:19:22.922
One partied with kings and queens in Monte Carlo, and

00:19:23.142 --> 00:19:26.872
died peacefully in a London hospital at the age of 81.

00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:31.412
The other ended up cut into pieces with a bone saw.

00:19:32.292 --> 00:19:36.112
There are certainly a few conclusions that you can draw from that.

00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:41.655
Okay then, that is it for today's episode on Adnan

00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:45.465
Khashoggi, a controversial but certainly colourful character.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.975
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:53.795

00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:57.215

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.690
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.849
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.770
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about JK Rowling.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.809
But we aren’t going to talk about Harry Potter, or at

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.800
least it’s not going to be a major part of the episode.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.440
Instead we are going to talk about her controversial views on the topic of transgenderism.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.620
It’s a story that brings together social media, freedom of speech, gender identity, British

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.179
politics, Scotland, and the question of what it means to be a woman, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:58.280
OK then, JK Rowling and Transgenderism.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:04.855
As you will probably know, JK Rowling is one of the best-selling authors in history.

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:12.845
From 1997 to 2007 she published the Harry Potter series, a 7-part series that has

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:19.955
sold over 600 million copies and by some estimates is worth $25 billion dollars.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:25.845
This success brought with it great fame and fortune, and although

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:29.725
she doesn’t court publicity, she has never been afraid to put her

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:34.415
money and her platform behind political viewpoints that she supports.

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:39.675
She is a staunch supporter of the British Labour Party, has spoken

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:45.185
publicly in favour of Labour politicians and donated to Labour campaigns.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:51.775
She opposed Scottish independence and supported the UK remaining in the European Union.

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:59.115
And she was vocal in her criticism of Donald Trump when he stood for election back in 2016.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:05.895
Of course, this support has attracted criticism from those with differing viewpoints to hers.

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:09.175
She is told that she doesn’t know what she’s talking about,

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:12.915
to stick to her writing and that she is out of her depth.

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:18.105
But nothing that she had done prepared her for the reaction

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.947
she would get when she expressed her views on transgenderism.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:30.945
In December 2019, JK Rowling posted a tweet in support of a lady called Maya Forstater, who had

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:36.885
lost her job because she had expressed views about sex and gender that were deemed offensive.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:44.695
Forstater went to an employment tribunal, essentially a law court, to contest

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:51.775
the decision and the judge ruled against her, saying that her views were, and I’m

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:57.575
quoting directly “incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others”.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:04.825
JK Rowling read about this verdict and then tweeted out, and I’ll read the entire thing for you:

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:07.175
“Dress however you please.

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:09.245
Call yourself whatever you like.

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:12.865
Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:16.585
Live your best life in peace and security.

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:21.355
But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?”

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:28.205
This was in 2019, and the tweet has now been liked over

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:34.245
300,000 times and retweeted more than 120,000 times.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:41.365
Even if she knew that she was wading into some controversial territory, she had no

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:47.155
idea of the extent to which this belief would define the following almost five years.

00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:53.125
Her inbox has been flooded with both messages of support and death threats.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:59.875
Friends and colleagues have both come out to support her and have broken off all contact with her.

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:05.815
Some fans have said that this means that they are even more likely to buy her next book,

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:12.695
while others have thrown them in the rubbish bin, or even posted videos of them burning them.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:16.935
And this has continued ever since.

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:23.452
She has continued to speak out publicly and on social media about her position on transgenderism.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:28.755
To some people, it is vile, and she is trampling on

00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:32.445
an already oppressed and marginalised group of people.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:37.285
To others, she makes perfect sense and is standing up against

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:41.165
a dangerous movement that erodes hard-won women’s rights.

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.215
It is nothing if not controversial.

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:51.155
So over the next 15 minutes or so we are going to unpack what JK Rowling actually believes,

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:58.315
why some people find this so controversial, and why this matters in the context of UK law.

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:04.815
As to the first question, of what JK Rowling believes and why she

00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:08.255
has decided to speak out on the subject, we actually have a pretty

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:12.615
good source for this, as she wrote an extensive article on her blog.

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:17.004
Her five reasons for speaking up are as follows.

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:20.884
First, she has been heavily involved in charity work

00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:23.714
in Scotland, particularly with women and children.

00:05:24.984 --> 00:05:32.554
And she was worried that trans activism will “erode the legal definition of sex and replace it

00:05:32.554 --> 00:05:38.214
with gender”, and this will be damaging to the vulnerable people that she was trying to help.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:42.334
The second reason is because of her background as a teacher.

00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:48.804
She writes, and I’m quoting directly, “Like many others, I have deep concerns

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:54.164
about the effect the trans rights movement is having on education and safeguarding”

00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:58.454
The third is from a freedom of speech perspective.

00:05:59.164 --> 00:06:02.414
She thinks that people should have the freedom to say what they

00:06:02.414 --> 00:06:07.024
think, and this shouldn’t be controlled or restricted by a government.

00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:09.564
The fourth is more personal.

00:06:10.294 --> 00:06:18.424
She talks about her own teenage years and how she struggled to identify as a traditional woman, and

00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:25.154
suggests that–had she been offered the same opportunities as young women today–she might have taken

00:06:25.154 --> 00:06:31.934
the decision to transition into a man, and then would have deeply regretted the decision later on.

00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:36.444
And the fifth reason is more personal still.

00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:42.304
She talks about her life as a survivor of domestic violence at the hands of her ex-husband,

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:49.614
and how she fears what would happen if trans women, or biological men as she calls them, were

00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:56.284
allowed to enter spaces that were traditionally “safe” for women, like women’s public toilets.

00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:03.924
And throughout the article she expresses her sympathy for trans people, how she

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:09.204
understands them and empathises with them, and how she wants trans people to

00:07:09.214 --> 00:07:14.444
live in a way that they feel is true to their wishes, but she has these concerns.

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:21.294
Whatever your views might be on the subject, even if you disagree with everything

00:07:21.294 --> 00:07:26.044
she says, I would certainly recommend you read the article, because it is

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:30.594
very well-written and articulate, and it is the main source for her opinion.

00:07:31.304 --> 00:07:37.524
This is clearly not a position that she has come to lightly, without proper thought, and it is

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:43.304
full of sympathy for trans people as individuals, at least she writes that she is sympathetic.

00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:49.614
However, her outward behaviour, through her primary outlet, Twitter, has been

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:55.363
criticised for not showing the least bit of sympathy for trans people, in particular,

00:07:55.841 --> 00:08:01.984
transwomen, people who were identified as men at birth but now identify as women.

00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:08.124
She has been labelled as transphobic, which is defined as having

00:08:08.144 --> 00:08:12.224
a “dislike of or strong prejudice against transgender people”.

00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:17.484
She has found that many of the actors in Harry Potter, such as the actors who played

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:23.254
Harry, Ron and Hermione, the three main characters in the series, have spoken out against

00:08:23.254 --> 00:08:28.984
her, saying that they vehemently reject her beliefs, and that “transwomen are women”.

00:08:29.874 --> 00:08:32.994
She has also been heavily criticised by her previous

00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:36.824
fans, people who grew up reading and adoring the books.

00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:41.984
To these critics, Harry Potter is a story about a boy who is

00:08:42.034 --> 00:08:47.364
different, a boy who longs to understand himself, and it’s only when

00:08:47.364 --> 00:08:51.674
he realises that he is a wizard that he truly understands himself.

00:08:52.244 --> 00:08:55.964
It's the same as a trans person, her critics argue, how

00:08:55.964 --> 00:08:59.884
can JK Rowling completely misunderstand her own book?

00:09:00.284 --> 00:09:03.924
She literally wrote a book about a child’s struggle to be accepted,

00:09:04.364 --> 00:09:09.204
and there she is criticising a movement that is only about acceptance.

00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:13.624
To these critics, JK Rowling has a simple comeback.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:17.134
It is not her but them that has misunderstood.

00:09:18.064 --> 00:09:23.394
After all, she did spend 17 years writing the books, so she should know what they are about.

00:09:24.694 --> 00:09:32.324
And ever since that first controversial tweet back in 2019, JK Rowling has continued an almost

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:38.744
daily schedule of posting about the subject of transgenderism, offering messages of support to

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:44.254
people who have been criticised for saying that sex and gender are the same thing and sharing

00:09:44.264 --> 00:09:50.074
negative stories about trans women, for example, trans women who are convicted criminals.

00:09:51.314 --> 00:09:57.084
This has got her into a lot of hot water, not just by alienating fans and former

00:09:57.084 --> 00:10:03.564
colleagues, but it has also made her a high-profile target for a new Scottish law.

00:10:05.174 --> 00:10:08.444
As you may remember from our episode on Scotland vs.

00:10:08.454 --> 00:10:13.424
England a few weeks back, Scotland has the power to create its own

00:10:13.434 --> 00:10:18.154
laws; the law is not exactly the same in Scotland as it is in England.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:23.224
One difference is a law that came into effect in April

00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:27.964
of 2024, called The Hate Crime and Public Order Act.

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:35.014
The purpose of this law was to go above and beyond the pre-existing hate crime

00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:39.514
legislation, which protects people from being prejudiced or discriminated

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:45.224
against based on things like their gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.

00:10:46.494 --> 00:10:50.934
And the difference was that transgender identity was added to this.

00:10:52.394 --> 00:11:00.514
What’s more, this law created a new crime for ‘stirring up hatred’ which, and I’m quoting

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:06.504
directly, “criminalises threatening or abusive behaviour and the communication of threatening

00:11:06.514 --> 00:11:11.834
or abusive material which is intended to stir up hatred against a group of people”

00:11:13.334 --> 00:11:16.724
To JK Rowling’s critics, she was guilty of this.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:23.444
For four years she had been posting messages on social media that “trans women were not women”,

00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:30.204
or sharing a picture of a transwoman and calling that person “he”, referring to them as a man.

00:11:31.254 --> 00:11:36.484
This was hate speech, her critics cried, she was literally denying trans

00:11:36.484 --> 00:11:40.424
women’s existence by saying that they are not who they say they are.

00:11:41.954 --> 00:11:47.974
And with her 14 million followers, surely this must meet the legal guidelines for “hate speech”.

00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:53.984
It would only be a matter of time before the police knocked on her door and dragged her away.

00:11:55.194 --> 00:12:00.224
Rowling, who lives in Scotland, was clearly eagerly awaiting this moment.

00:12:01.134 --> 00:12:06.924
On April 1st, just hours after the new law came into effect, she launched into

00:12:06.924 --> 00:12:12.594
a lengthy Twitter thread where she posted the names and details of 10 different

00:12:12.624 --> 00:12:17.864
trans women, only to finish with, and I’m quoting directly, ”April Fools!

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:18.704
Only kidding.

00:12:19.014 --> 00:12:21.064
Obviously, the people mentioned in the above tweets

00:12:21.364 --> 00:12:24.794
aren't women at all, but men, every last one of them.”

00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:29.684
And then adding, “I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written

00:12:29.684 --> 00:12:34.334
here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to

00:12:34.344 --> 00:12:38.314
being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment.”

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:44.014
There she was, egging the Scottish government on to arrest her.

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:49.654
There were multiple complaints from members of the public, the police investigated and

00:12:49.694 --> 00:12:55.114
concluded that these tweets did not meet the legal requirements for “stirring up hatred”.

00:12:56.564 --> 00:13:00.824
Now, as I was writing this episode, new tweets were coming

00:13:00.824 --> 00:13:04.934
out every day, and this is very much a story in development.

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:11.254
It is also one that is emblematic of the complete absence of middle ground.

00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:18.394
To her critics, JK Rowling’s views on transgenderism are hateful towards vulnerable people.

00:13:19.474 --> 00:13:23.294
To say that a trans woman is not a woman is deeply prejudiced

00:13:23.294 --> 00:13:27.124
and hurtful, they say, it undermines their entire identity.

00:13:28.304 --> 00:13:35.554
To JK Rowling, she is fighting to protect what she sees as an invasion by men on female identity.

00:13:36.354 --> 00:13:40.784
She is a sufferer of domestic and sexual abuse at the hands of men,

00:13:41.264 --> 00:13:45.444
and what she is doing is trying to stand up for women’s rights.

00:13:47.024 --> 00:13:50.820
Of course, you could argue that when it comes to transgenderism

00:13:51.104 --> 00:13:54.694
it is hard to find any middle ground, that’s the entire point.

00:13:55.614 --> 00:14:00.694
A person is a man or a woman, it is a biological fact, you cannot choose it.

00:14:01.314 --> 00:14:04.784
Or that a transwoman is a woman, it doesn’t matter

00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:07.294
whether they were assigned a different gender at birth.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:12.834
Gender is different from biological sex, and someone can know that their

00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:17.764
gender is female even if their biological sex is male, so the theory goes.

00:14:18.754 --> 00:14:24.454
Now, similar debates are going on all over the world, most probably in your country too.

00:14:25.304 --> 00:14:30.794
What makes the case of JK Rowling particularly interesting and unique is not

00:14:30.794 --> 00:14:35.424
just her celebrity and millions of followers, but the fact that she was the

00:14:35.494 --> 00:14:40.914
author of a series of books that so many children found particularly appealing.

00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:46.384
Being a child is, as we all know, often a confusing time.

00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:49.824
You are trying to figure out who you are, where you

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:52.734
fit into the world, what your hopes and dreams are.

00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:59.214
And through the Harry Potter series, hundreds of millions of children got to

00:14:59.214 --> 00:15:04.994
experience the innermost feelings of a young boy who was going through exactly that.

00:15:05.714 --> 00:15:08.394
He was different, he could feel that there was something

00:15:08.414 --> 00:15:11.584
different about him, but he didn’t know what it was.

00:15:12.744 --> 00:15:17.424
As any Harry Potter fan knows, readers get very invested in the books.

00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:23.304
After all, there are more than 3,000 pages, over a million words, and

00:15:23.594 --> 00:15:27.584
especially for people who were reading the books as they were being released,

00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:33.404
like me, you grew up with them, you grew up with Harry, Ron and Hermione.

00:15:34.404 --> 00:15:38.754
And the creator of all of this magic, JK Rowling, was a wonderful

00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:43.094
person, how could she not be if she had created this magical world?

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:48.184
And then like a thud, she comes out and says something that

00:15:48.354 --> 00:15:51.654
you believe goes against everything that the books stand for.

00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:59.144
It is, on one level, perfectly understandable why some people are so up in arms.

00:15:59.994 --> 00:16:04.534
But to JK Rowling, and indeed to those who have come out in support of her

00:16:04.574 --> 00:16:09.694
messages of caution against the trans movement, this is a dangerous movement

00:16:09.884 --> 00:16:15.024
that seeks to erode the rights of women and put women in positions of danger.

00:16:16.044 --> 00:16:20.824
She has no “legacy” to protect, so she says; she is doing this for

00:16:20.824 --> 00:16:25.264
the sake of her daughter and the sake of millions of women that she

00:16:25.264 --> 00:16:29.334
feels are in danger from a movement that has been taken to its extreme.

00:16:30.854 --> 00:16:34.514
No doubt to Rowling, people will look back on this period

00:16:34.654 --> 00:16:38.634
in 50 years and thank her for being a voice of reason.

00:16:39.884 --> 00:16:45.264
And to her critics, she will be remembered as a pariah who publicly criticised

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:49.804
a group of already vulnerable people and who was on the wrong side of history.

00:16:50.794 --> 00:16:53.234
Only time will tell which is right.

00:16:54.694 --> 00:16:59.834
OK then, that is it for today's episode on JK Rowling and Transgenderism.

00:17:00.284 --> 00:17:03.664
Just in case you haven’t listened to them, we have made episodes on the

00:17:03.664 --> 00:17:07.864
life of JK Rowling and her struggle to get the Harry Potter books published.

00:17:08.304 --> 00:17:13.624
Those are episode numbers 262 and 263, if you haven’t checked out those already.

00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:17.384
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:20.694
Are there any high-profile voices in the trans debate

00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:24.308
in your country, either in support of or criticising?

00:17:24.574 --> 00:17:27.944
Were you aware of this debate over JK Rowling’s views?

00:17:28.324 --> 00:17:31.604
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

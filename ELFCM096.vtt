Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.949
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.269
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:28.069
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Vikings, the warriors

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.659
from Scandinavia who terrorised large parts of Europe for the best part of 300 years.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.659
You probably know something about the vikings already, but today we are going

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.369
to go a little deeper, talking about who they really were, why they did what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:51.619
they did, how they actually did it, and we’ll discover that the story of the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.929
vikings is actually quite different to how it is represented in popular culture.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:02.880
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:08.855
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcripts, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:14.335
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:19.215
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:24.325
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:30.205
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:34.325
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:38.245
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:44.125
OK then, let’s get started, and talk about the vikings.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:51.345
When you think about the vikings, you might imagine barbarian men with large beards,

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:58.025
red hair, helmets with horns on, jumping out of boats, killing innocent people,

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:04.255
raping and running off with women, and generally terrorising anyone they came across.

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:09.815
Indeed, this is how the story of the vikings is often taught.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:15.425
The story of the vikings is actually one of my first memories of a subject

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:19.285
that I covered in school - I think we must have done a project on it when

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:24.745
I was about 5 years old, and you can see why it appeals to a young child.

00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:30.185
The problem is that not all of this is true, and it’s

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:33.935
a gross oversimplification of the story of the vikings.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:40.685
In reality, the vikings were a sophisticated group of people, a group that had made

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:46.505
some admirable technological advances, probably the first Europeans to arrive in

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:51.985
The Americas, five hundred years before Christopher Columbus, and they operated

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:58.195
a sophisticated system of trade that stretched all the way to modern-day Baghdad.

00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:02.015
But they were also murdering warriors.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:11.735
Until the year 793, people in the British Isles, the modern day UK and Ireland, they didn’t know

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:17.755
much about the vikings, about the people who lived across the sea from them in Norway and Sweden.

00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:23.905
There is a small island just off the north-east coast of England called Lindisfarne.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:29.625
It’s considered a holy island, and there was a monastery on it where

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:34.165
Christian monks passed their days studying the bible and praying.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:41.545
Then on the 8th of June 793, three long ships arrived,

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:47.055
carrying foreign men, men who we now refer to as vikings.

00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:52.395
They rushed out of their boats, swords and spears in hand.

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:57.435
They massacred a large proportion of the monks, and they destroyed the

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:02.745
monastery and church, taking with them all the treasures of the holy buildings.

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:07.095
The local population didn’t know what had hit them,

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:11.395
and they weren’t to know that this was just the start.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:20.445
These raids would continue for the next 300 years, and extend all over modern day England,

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:27.825
Wales and Ireland, as well as France, Spain, Germany, Poland, Russia, and even parts of Italy.

00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:33.205
So, who were these invading warriors, who were the vikings,

00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:37.095
and why did they start attacking monasteries in Britain?

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:42.585
They came from Scandinavia, modern day Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:49.755
Historians are divided over exactly why they decided to get in their boats and

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:54.405
sail across the dangerous North Sea to the British Isles in the first place.

00:04:55.725 --> 00:05:01.665
Some have said it was due to overpopulation in Scandinavia, that there wasn’t enough

00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:08.585
farmland for people to make a living, and so they set off for pastures new, for new land.

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:14.665
Others have said it was to seek women, for men to find wives.

00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:22.685
It’s thought that rich Scandinavian men used to have multiple wives, and dying

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:29.255
during childbirth was sadly pretty common back then, which led to a big imbalance

00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:34.485
between the number of men who wanted a wife and the number of available women.

00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:40.455
So they set off in search of brides, and that’s why they would

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:44.205
capture women on their raids and take them back to their settlements.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:49.725
There’s another theory that it was actually out of revenge.

00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:55.025
The Christian emperor Charlemagne had forced non-Christians to convert

00:05:55.025 --> 00:06:00.885
to Christianity, and had murdered and terrorised anyone who hadn’t.

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:08.135
The vikings were pagan, they weren’t Christian, and so there’s a theory that

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:13.275
they went on these brutal raids out of revenge for what Charlemagne did.

00:06:14.805 --> 00:06:19.965
And there’s another theory that they just saw that there was this opportunity,

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:24.585
that the British Isles and large parts of Western Europe didn’t have

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:29.745
strong defences, but were full of treasures, so why not give it a try?

00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:37.585
Whether there was one overarching reason, or it was a combination of various different factors

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:45.025
at different times, the viking invaders soon found that going on raids was a very profitable

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:51.985
activity, and these raids continued in various shapes and forms until the 11th century.

00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:57.905
But while in a lot of popular culture the vikings are depicted as getting in their

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:03.675
boats, sailing over to Britain, jumping out, killing people, snatching women, stealing

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:10.235
treasure and sailing back again, as the years went on, their expeditions actually

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:17.145
got a lot longer, both in terms of the time spent and the distances they traveled.

00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:24.435
After attacking a town or city, naturally killing anyone who resisted them and taking possession of

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:30.495
anything that caught their eye, they would often stay in the area, trading with the local people.

00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:36.415
Although this might seem strange, Scandinavia is a long way away from Britain.

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:42.335
At its absolute closest point it’s 300km, and from where most of the

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:46.725
vikings came from, in modern-day Sweden, it’s about three times that.

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:55.765
So, it was a long trip, and if you are superior militarily, if you can stay, why not?

00:07:57.135 --> 00:08:01.685
Some would just stay for the winter, and there were other viking communities

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:07.905
that would settle for anything from a few months to a few years to permanently.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:15.305
They would use these settlements as places from which to launch attacks further inland,

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:21.865
using their boats to head inland up rivers, attacking large parts of the south of

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:28.765
England, as well as going up the Seine and attacking Paris in the year 845, after

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:34.705
having formed a base at Nantes, a town just inland from the west coast of France.

00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:40.575
The fact that they could travel such distances with such relative ease

00:08:40.715 --> 00:08:45.285
was due to the technological advances that they had made with their boats.

00:08:46.265 --> 00:08:48.865
You can probably picture a viking boat.

00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:57.185
It’s long, has a sail, and would also have oars, so it worked whether there was wind or not.

00:08:57.985 --> 00:09:03.645
But the main technological advances were really things that you don’t immediately see.

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:10.935
Firstly, the vikings are thought to have invented the keel, the piece

00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:15.565
of wood that extends downwards under a boat to make it more stable.

00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:21.175
The ships were also very low, so they didn’t need to have

00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:24.895
large hulls, the part of the boat that is under the water.

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:30.655
This meant they could travel in water that was just 1 metre deep, which comes

00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:36.325
in handy when you need to rush up onto a beach, or navigate rivers inland.

00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:42.145
The boats were also double-ended, they could travel in either direction,

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:46.255
which was very handy if you needed to quickly go into reverse.

00:09:47.485 --> 00:09:51.845
The ships were also, in many cases, very beautiful, and would

00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:56.915
have dragon heads carved into them, and big, red painted sails.

00:09:57.465 --> 00:10:03.345
But if you lived in a coastal town in northern Europe and you saw one of these beautiful ships

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:08.695
with a big sail in the distance, well, I don’t imagine you would be admiring the artwork.

00:10:10.145 --> 00:10:16.465
As news of the spoils to be had, of the treasures to be taken, as it reached the

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:22.445
communities back in Scandinavia, more and more men joined these raiding parties.

00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:29.035
While it might have been 3 ships that first attacked Lindisfarne, the raiding parties ended

00:10:29.035 --> 00:10:35.415
up being as large as 30 ships, full of warriors ready to jump out and run into battle.

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:40.625
It’s worth spending a little bit of time talking about how

00:10:40.635 --> 00:10:44.115
they actually fought, because this is also interesting.

00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:53.665
Firstly, one of the biggest misconceptions about vikings is that they wore helmets with horns on.

00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:54.955
They didn’t.

00:10:55.515 --> 00:10:59.745
There is absolutely no evidence that they wore these in battle.

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:04.525
There has only been one horned helmet ever found, but it’s

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:07.915
thought to be ceremonial, not used for actual fighting.

00:11:08.405 --> 00:11:12.745
The second interesting fact about vikings in battle is that there are

00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:18.545
reports about them going berserk, going mad, and rushing towards the enemy

00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:24.375
screaming like they were completely crazy, completely unafraid of dying.

00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:31.035
It’s thought that the warriors would often go into a kind of trance state,

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:36.485
a sort of state of madness, to frighten the people they were attacking.

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:44.275
It’s now believed that they were probably either just incredibly drunk or on some kind of

00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:51.105
hallucinogenic drug, perhaps hallucinogenic mushrooms, and this would send them into a sort

00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:58.475
of otherworldly state that made them act like madmen and be completely unafraid of death.

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:05.295
That’s one theory, but they could have just been genuinely unafraid of being killed in battle.

00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:09.315
Our knowledge of viking culture does tell us that there was

00:12:09.315 --> 00:12:14.035
this strong idea of death in battle being the ultimate honour.

00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:20.095
If a viking died in battle, he might be welcomed by the god Odin

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:27.145
to Valhalla, a mythical huge hall that was so big it had 540 doors.

00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:30.005
And what happened in Valhalla?

00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:32.735
Well, mainly fighting and eating.

00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:39.065
Every day in Valhalla the dead would fight against each other, and every night

00:12:39.275 --> 00:12:44.115
their wounds would heal and they would do it all over again the following day.

00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:49.325
Now, this might sound like not that much fun to me or you,

00:12:49.755 --> 00:12:53.225
but evidently for a viking, it was, literally, heaven.

00:12:54.405 --> 00:12:59.565
In addition to the ability to fight all day long, there were drinking horns that never

00:12:59.565 --> 00:13:05.805
emptied, so you could drink alcohol all day long, and a wild boar that would be eaten by

00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:11.775
the warriors and come back to life over and over, so they would never run out of food.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:19.125
So you can understand that if, culturally, there was this huge obsession with fighting,

00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:24.585
and if you died fighting then you would have the chance to go to Valhalla and fight all

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:30.745
day long, then the Vikings were not just pretty keen fighters, but afraid of nothing.

00:13:31.925 --> 00:13:35.985
Evidently, this made them quite a formidable enemy.

00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:40.015
But the vikings weren’t just about violence.

00:13:40.365 --> 00:13:44.245
They were also accomplished traders, and there is evidence

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:48.165
of them going all the way to modern day Baghdad to trade.

00:13:49.755 --> 00:13:55.532
They would take slaves from Britain and France, and then take them to the middle east to be sold.

00:13:56.592 --> 00:14:02.932
The Quran forbade, it didn’t allow muslims to be kept as slaves, but foreign slaves were fine.

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:08.922
So the vikings found very willing buyers in the middle east, and they would

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:14.522
return north with piles of silver, which they had got in exchange for the slaves.

00:14:15.552 --> 00:14:20.072
When they weren’t out on raids, and were back home, in Scandinavia,

00:14:20.452 --> 00:14:25.282
viking culture was divided across three broad social classes.

00:14:25.292 --> 00:14:28.932
Thralls, Karls and Jarls.

00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:33.642
Thralls, the lowest class, were essentially slaves,

00:14:34.062 --> 00:14:38.122
and they made up about 25% of the total population.

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:44.382
The Thralls would be tasked with things like construction, building settlements,

00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:49.502
as well as being household servants to the higher-ranking members of society.

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:53.952
Above them came the Karls, who were the free peasants.

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:56.402
They worked the land, farming.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:02.002
And the Jarls were the viking royalty, the top of the pecking order.

00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:06.782
They ruled over their lands, and would keep Thralls as their slaves.

00:15:07.732 --> 00:15:13.812
When a Jarl died, their Thralls would often be killed and buried with them as a sacrifice.

00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:20.772
We do know quite a lot about the Vikings but our knowledge of them comes mainly from archaeology.

00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:26.342
They didn’t have a strong written culture, although there are some stones,

00:15:26.372 --> 00:15:32.452
called runestones with Norse symbols on them dotted around Norway and Sweden.

00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:38.712
If you can’t imagine Old Norse, the language that the vikings would have spoken,

00:15:39.252 --> 00:15:43.952
it might surprise you to know that you probably have seen it before, and you

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:49.222
probably have some Norse on the device that you’re listening to this episode on.

00:15:50.222 --> 00:15:53.462
Now, I thought that this couldn’t be true until I did a little bit more

00:15:53.462 --> 00:15:59.232
research and confirmed it, but the symbol for Bluetooth, you know the wireless

00:15:59.242 --> 00:16:04.972
system that your headphones might connect to your phone or laptop, that symbol

00:16:05.222 --> 00:16:10.932
actually comes from the name of a legendary viking warrior, Harold Bluetooth.

00:16:12.178 --> 00:16:16.178
If you look closely at the logo for Bluetooth, it becomes obvious,

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:21.408
but it’s actually two different Norse characters on top of each other.

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:27.578
And when it comes to English, the Vikings have left an impressive legacy on the language.

00:16:28.448 --> 00:16:33.208
The names of several days come from the Old Norse of the vikings.

00:16:33.648 --> 00:16:37.748
Thursday means the day of Thor, the Norse god of Thunder.

00:16:38.448 --> 00:16:42.718
Friday is the day of the goddess of Freya, a Norse god

00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.778
associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, and gold.

00:16:48.698 --> 00:16:51.988
Wednesday comes from Woden, or Odin’s day.

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:57.118
Odin is one of the most famous Norse gods, and is Thor’s father.

00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:06.228
And there are hundreds of other words with old Norse origins, from knife to window, husband to Hell.

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:10.088
The legacy lives on through the language we use.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:17.538
A question that is often asked is ‘how did the vikings end?’, and the reality is that

00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:23.988
there wasn’t one single event, or dramatic reason for the end of the viking raids.

00:17:25.308 --> 00:17:28.188
The links between the vikings and the people that they

00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:31.408
had been attacking for 300 years had grown stronger.

00:17:32.228 --> 00:17:36.758
Vikings had spent months and years away from Scandinavia, and

00:17:37.048 --> 00:17:41.548
they had brought back some British and Christian traditions.

00:17:42.498 --> 00:17:47.148
There were vikings who converted to Christianity, and viking kingdoms back

00:17:47.158 --> 00:17:53.118
in Scandinavia slowly became part of the wider European Christian tradition.

00:17:54.078 --> 00:17:58.088
After 300 years, the inhabitants of the British Isles and northern

00:17:58.088 --> 00:18:02.228
France also got better at defending themselves, as you might imagine.

00:18:03.168 --> 00:18:10.738
While it might have been easy in 793 to rush out of your longboat and surprise a lot of

00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:17.488
unarmed monks and steal all of their valuables, people soon cottoned on, they figured

00:18:17.498 --> 00:18:22.558
out what was happening, and it became harder and harder to get the same results.

00:18:23.888 --> 00:18:30.978
Then in the year 1066, on Christmas day in fact, William of Normandy was crowned King of England.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:36.138
He was a strong military ruler, and was able to deflect the

00:18:36.138 --> 00:18:41.348
viking threat, and that’s where the records of viking attacks end

00:18:42.078 --> 00:18:47.348
.
Up until the Victorian era, the vikings were remembered as barbarians,

00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:53.808
savages, violent, bloodthirsty pagan invaders who massacred innocent people.

00:18:54.648 --> 00:18:58.558
Then in the Victorian era things started to change.

00:18:59.298 --> 00:19:04.578
There was a newfound fascination with the vikings, and an understanding

00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:09.998
that, yes, they might have done quite a lot of raping and pillaging, but they

00:19:09.998 --> 00:19:15.928
were humans too, and trying to understand them was an interesting exercise.

00:19:16.988 --> 00:19:21.358
Since then, they have captured people’s imagination, and certainly when I

00:19:21.358 --> 00:19:26.578
was at school it was an important subject that we all learned about, probably

00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:31.008
because it’s quite an easy subject to get a 5-year-old child excited about.

00:19:32.158 --> 00:19:35.918
And the legacy of the vikings lives on not just through

00:19:35.928 --> 00:19:39.568
language and popular culture, but through our DNA.

00:19:41.338 --> 00:19:44.778
William the Conqueror, the Norman who invaded Britain in

00:19:44.778 --> 00:19:49.148
1066 was descended from viking settlers in northern France.

00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:55.368
And there are always slightly ridiculous articles about what percentage of people in Britain

00:19:55.648 --> 00:20:02.198
can directly trace their heritage to the vikings - one article said that around one in thirty

00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:08.938
three men can trace their ancestry back through the father’s side directly to viking invaders.

00:20:09.818 --> 00:20:14.038
Evidently, when you include all of the genealogical combinations,

00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:19.358
from fathers and mothers, then we’re probably all a little bit viking.

00:20:20.318 --> 00:20:22.228
So, there we are, the vikings.

00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:27.938
The inhabitants of the Lindisfarne monastery didn’t know it when they first saw the boat

00:20:27.938 --> 00:20:35.898
arriving on the 8th of June 793, but this people were to have a huge impact on the fabric of

00:20:35.898 --> 00:20:42.058
Europe for the next three hundred years, and leave a legacy that is felt all over the continent.

00:20:43.148 --> 00:20:49.748
Yes they were savage invaders, but they were also traders, explorers, shipbuilding innovators,

00:20:50.028 --> 00:20:56.148
storytellers, and artists, and our history, culture, and traditions are richer thanks to

00:20:56.148 --> 00:21:01.388
them, although I’m not sure that all of the monks on the island of Lindisfarne would agree.

00:21:03.378 --> 00:21:08.108
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on The Vikings.

00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:12.108
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned something new about a

00:21:12.128 --> 00:21:17.018
people that, statistically speaking, you probably share some kind of ancestry with.

00:21:18.228 --> 00:21:23.958
I think it’s fascinating to go beyond the stereotypes that we’re taught, and to think about

00:21:23.968 --> 00:21:30.238
the why: the vikings were humans like you and me after all with their own motivations,

00:21:30.478 --> 00:21:37.578
reasons, and desires, and I hope that today’s episode has shed a little light on some of these.

00:21:38.848 --> 00:21:42.178

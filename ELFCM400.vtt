Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:15.795
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.645
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:25.245
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is episode number 400, so I

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.385
thought we would tackle a particularly thorny, complicated topic.

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:34.765
And that is of two very different outlooks, opinions about

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:38.455
the direction in which humanity needs to go to stay alive.

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:45.908
The first is degrowth, the idea that our obsession with economic growth at all costs is

00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:52.318
killing the planet and will wipe out humanity, and the only way to fix this is by accepting

00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:58.468
and embracing a slowing down, and ultimately reduction in the size of our economies.

00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:04.548
And the second is Effective Accelerationism, or e/acc as it’s known.

00:01:05.508 --> 00:01:11.978
In many ways it couldn’t be further from degrowth, and proposes that the only solution

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:18.418
to our current situation is to intensify and accelerate efforts to drive growth forward.

00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:24.228
So, in the next twenty minutes or so we will explore these two ideas, and

00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:29.608
perhaps, just perhaps, come to some conclusions on how to save the world.

00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:35.438
OK then, Degrowth vs E/Acc and How To Save The World.

00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:40.708
A graph showing the size of the global economy over

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:43.858
the past two thousand years is a remarkable sight.

00:01:45.278 --> 00:01:51.548
For almost all of it, there is hardly any growth at all, it is a straight, flat line.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:58.959
Then somewhere around 1800 you start to see it increase a little bit, then a little

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:06.050
bit more, then a little bit more, and from 1950 onwards it becomes an almost vertical

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.020
line, shooting up, reflecting an almost 100 year period of unbridled economic growth.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.710
Sure, if you zoom in you’ll see some periods with lower levels of growth, or even a reduction

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.560
in size, but the trend is an overwhelmingly fast-growing global economy, with no end in sight.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.660
And if you are a fan of large sounding numbers, the global economy is now over 100

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.630
trillion dollars, a 100x increase from its size at the start of the 19th century,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.190
We, you and I, are of course beneficiaries of this in many ways.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.429
The economic growth has delivered on many counts.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.789
Statistically we will live longer, have better access to education, better opportunities

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:06.029
for leisure, better access to medicine, we are less likely to live in poverty than

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:11.859
our parents, grandparents and great grandparents, and indeed, any of our ancestors.

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.789
Statistically speaking, the quality of life for humanity overall has never been better.

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.939
But going back even 50 years, economists have asked themselves

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.939
the question: how long can this economic growth continue?

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.839
Is it sustainable?

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.429
And what are the alternatives?

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:43.119
In 1973, the Club of Rome and a group of MIT researchers published a report called “The Limits

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:49.229
to Growth”, which suggested that if the global economy increased at the same rate as it had

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:57.009
been doing, there was a real risk of environmental collapse, and with it, the death of humanity.

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.469
The report looked at the earth’s ability to feed its growing population, the decreasing

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.389
amount of natural resources, and the increasing pollution, and came to the conclusion

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.249
that humanity would need to make drastic changes, putting limits on how society

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:21.539
works, in order to maintain a viable equilibrium between humans and the planet.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:30.089
This was 50 years ago, but the report was eerily accurate in many of its predictions.

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:38.779
Indeed, this report was cited in the opening speech at a conference this year, in 2023, in Belgium.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:46.159
The conference was called Beyond Growth, and it sought to, and I’m quoting directly,

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.449
“challenge conventional policy-making in the European Union and to redefine societal

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:58.509
goals across the board, in order to move away from the harmful focus on the sole

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:04.039
economic growth – that is, the growth of GDP – as the basis of our development model.”

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.329
End quote.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.919
This was no small, niche, gathering.

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:16.709
It was held in the European Parliament in Brussels, and the person who cited

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.969
that report in the opening speech of the conference was Ursula von der Leyen,

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.856
the president of the European Commission, essentially the boss of the EU.

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:35.069
This idea, of degrowth, is one that has been gaining increasing momentum especially over the past

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.319
10 years or so, and the conference at the European Parliament was its largest platform to-date.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:46.939
So, what exactly is degrowth, what does it propose,

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:50.049
what are some of the arguments for, and against it?

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:56.699
Well, degrowth is a socio-economic and political concept that challenges the

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.889
traditional focus on continuous economic growth as the primary goal of society.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.189
If you haven’t read much into it, you might think that it is purely

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.699
about preventing environmental collapse, but it’s actually broader.

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:19.679
The idea is that by deliberately reducing both production and consumption of almost

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.829
everything, the world will be not only more environmentally sustainable, but more equal.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:33.419
Ultimately, it will be a better and more sustainable place for all humans, but it does

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:40.011
require  us to first slow down economic growth, and then shrink the size of our economies.

00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:46.630
Clearly, there are a lot of complexities and intricacies to this; proponents

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.250
of degrowth aren’t suggesting that every country needs to start shrinking its

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.950
economy today, and that both an insurance salesman in California and a farmer

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.500
in subSaharan Africa need to make the same adjustments to their lifestyles.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.750
The idea is that less developed countries are given room and time to grow

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.010
their economies to a certain level, while richer countries need to start now.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.986
Indeed, every country needs to switch from focussing on

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:21.590
GDP and economic growth to focussing on sustainable living.

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:30.710
GDP as a measure is harmful, so the idea goes, and it is time to consign it to the history books.

00:07:31.552 --> 00:07:37.482
As a quick side note, if you’d like to learn more about GDP, Gross Domestic Product and how to

00:07:37.492 --> 00:07:43.282
measure growth and prosperity, we actually have an entire episode on that, it’s episode number 98.

00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:46.362
But back to degrowth.

00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:51.852
Although this idea is gaining popularity and momentum, especially

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:56.310
with the younger generation, no mainstream politician to date has

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.423
put their name behind it and made it a cornerstone of their policy.

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:05.303
After all, it’s a difficult message to sell to a voter.

00:08:06.633 --> 00:08:11.703
James Carville, Bill Clinton’s political strategist in the 1992 presidential

00:08:11.703 --> 00:08:17.320
election, famously quipped, “it’s the economy, stupid”, reminding his candidate

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.980
that a healthy economy was the main factor in deciding who to vote for.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.480
Or, as the more recent president Donald Trump put it, “jobs, jobs, jobs”.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.130
Perfectly understandably, most people are not so keen on the idea of taking a

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:40.350
step back, producing less, consuming less, being comfortable in a world with less.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.590
So, what's the alternative?

00:08:44.513 --> 00:08:49.680
Well, one alternative is the status quo, the current situation.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.560
We simply go on as we have been going on.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.830
After all, carbon emissions have peaked in many western countries, carbon emissions

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:06.480
are scheduled to peak in China in around 2025, and India between 2040 and 2045.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.130
Yes, the global temperature will rise, but that is a price that needs to be

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.990
paid for an improvement in global living standards, so the argument goes.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.440
Clearly, there is a strong counterargument to this that accepting the status quo is precisely

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:30.060
what will cause a climate catastrophe, and like the frog that sits in the water as it heats

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.910
up to boiling point, we simply don’t accept or recognise the change until it is far too late.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.700
If you have been sweltering in heat waves this summer I imagine that

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.980
there might have been days where you have been thinking a similar thing.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.960
So, that’s one alternative, the status quo where we keep our fingers

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.010
crossed and hope that what we’re currently doing will lead to some form of

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.810
technological breakthrough that will mitigate the effects of climate change.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.540
But let me talk about another alternative to degrowth that promises to deliver similar

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:12.053
results, it promises to save humanity and the world, but in a radically  different way.

00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:17.873
This is called Effective Accelerationism, or e/acc for short.

00:10:19.113 --> 00:10:24.823
It is an offshoot, or development perhaps, of accelerationism, a theory

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:29.183
and ideology proposed by an English philosopher called Nick Land.

00:10:30.443 --> 00:10:36.943
Effective Accelerationism, or e/acc, originates from a principle in thermodynamics,

00:10:36.943 --> 00:10:44.173
in physics, but, in practical terms, e/acc proposes that all problems facing mankind

00:10:44.523 --> 00:10:49.943
can be solved through technological development and improved capital allocation.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:54.189
To quote a tweet from one of the main voices behind the

00:10:54.189 --> 00:10:58.769
movement, “e/acc is anarcho-capitalism and transhumanism.

00:10:59.229 --> 00:11:03.079
It is a radical libertarianism with techno-progressive underpinnings.

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:09.489
If you believe in e/acc you should Build past biological constraints, Build things without

00:11:09.489 --> 00:11:16.228
permission, Build a future to be proud of as Our lives are too short to waste on nonsense.”

00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:24.339
Let me explain that in practical terms, as there are four major areas e/acc focusses on.

00:11:25.608 --> 00:11:31.448
Firstly, to increase, not decrease, the amount of energy that can be used.

00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:35.858
This doesn’t mean mining more coal or burning more oil.

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:42.958
It means, in the short term, nuclear fission, and in the long term, harnessing the

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:47.848
power of the sun in a drastically more efficient way than current solar panels.

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:55.948
Secondly, it means creating policies that increase, not decrease, the global population.

00:11:56.928 --> 00:12:00.618
The more people, the more opportunities for technological breakthroughs.

00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:05.718
After all, there is more than enough space on Earth, we just don’t use it efficiently.

00:12:07.078 --> 00:12:12.618
Thirdly, it means creating AGI, artificial general intelligence,

00:12:13.028 --> 00:12:16.978
allowing humans to work with AI on the world’s hardest problems.

00:12:18.178 --> 00:12:24.898
After all, humans are limited in their ability to solve problems by biological, human constraints.

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:26.878
AI is not.

00:12:28.268 --> 00:12:33.618
And fourthly and finally, it involves developing interplanetary and

00:12:33.618 --> 00:12:38.568
interstellar transport allowing humanity to spread to other planets.

00:12:39.912 --> 00:12:45.232
These are, to state the obvious, some ambitious goals, things

00:12:45.352 --> 00:12:49.512
that would fundamentally change everything about the way we live.

00:12:50.522 --> 00:12:56.112
But, to the creators and supporters of a/acc, this, not degrowth,

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:59.752
is the solution to the direction humanity is heading in.

00:13:01.082 --> 00:13:05.432
Where e/acc and degrowth do agree is that the current trajectory

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:09.752
of economic growth for economic growth’s sake is unsustainable.

00:13:10.762 --> 00:13:15.916
But where they differ in extreme terms is on what to do about it.

00:13:16.512 --> 00:13:21.312
Should we press the brake pedal and then the reverse, or the accelerator?

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.412
Should we press pause and take a step back into a

00:13:25.432 --> 00:13:28.412
past that we know might be not quite so comfortable?

00:13:29.102 --> 00:13:35.512
Or should we strap a rocket to the side of our car and take a bold step into the unknown?

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:41.082
Should we constrain capitalism, adding limits and restrictions to it,

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:46.132
or should we unleash the capital markets further than ever before?

00:13:47.662 --> 00:13:50.932
Ultimately, what do we need to do to save the world?

00:13:52.152 --> 00:13:57.395
Now, the degrowth movement is a lot larger in number and popularity than e/acc.

00:13:58.412 --> 00:14:02.812
Degrowth, as you heard, was even given a seat at the European Parliament.

00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:08.142
E/acc, on the other hand, exists in a tiny corner of the internet,

00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:11.942
but there are some increasingly prominent voices behind it.

00:14:13.242 --> 00:14:18.652
As of the time of recording this episode, Marc Andreesen, a powerful venture capitalist

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:24.852
and the inventor of Netscape, the first web browser, and one of the cofounders of Notion,

00:14:24.952 --> 00:14:29.922
a hugely popular software company, they have both come out in support of the movement.

00:14:31.282 --> 00:14:35.482
And E/acc, compared to degrowth, takes a very different

00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:38.242
approach to growing awareness and participation.

00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:42.657
It doesn’t try to force governments and institutions to change their

00:14:42.657 --> 00:14:48.207
behaviour, it doesn’t seek permission, instead it is a grassroots movement

00:14:48.377 --> 00:14:53.347
of builders and technology creators, operating outside official channels.

00:14:54.837 --> 00:15:01.317
It agrees with degrowth in that governments and institutions have proved themselves to be incapable

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:08.008
of solving society’s hardest problems,  but where there is a divergence is what to do about it.

00:15:08.979 --> 00:15:13.239
E/acc proposes to sidestep institutions entirely.

00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:15.439
It is a permissionless movement.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:21.549
There is no leader, anyone can take part, the only thing you need to do is build.

00:15:22.719 --> 00:15:29.150
Degrowth, on the other hand, requires working hand in hand with these institutions and governments.

00:15:29.976 --> 00:15:35.489
It might be a movement that comes from the grassroots, but ultimately it needs

00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:40.429
the participation of governments to regulate and slow down economic growth.

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:47.556
At the end of the day, although they seem like completely different ideologies, and no

00:15:47.556 --> 00:15:52.046
doubt people from each side have very little time to listen to the ideas of the other,

00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:58.406
the ultimate goal is, kind of similar: create a better future for all of humanity.

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:01.166
Both are scary.

00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:05.516
We’ve never gone back before, at least, there has never been a

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:09.687
world that has accepted a step back for a prolonged period of time.

00:16:10.687 --> 00:16:16.607
We think we know what it would be like, but what unintended consequences would come along with it?

00:16:17.817 --> 00:16:21.487
And we have never moved forward as fast, accelerated

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:24.627
as quickly, as proponents of e/acc are suggesting.

00:16:25.427 --> 00:16:29.737
An interplanetary future, a future powered by AGI and

00:16:29.737 --> 00:16:33.217
robots, a future where we could live to 500 years old.

00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:36.487
This is the stuff of science fiction novels.

00:16:36.877 --> 00:16:39.137
What would it be like to make this a reality?

00:16:40.107 --> 00:16:42.537
These are two very different futures.

00:16:42.847 --> 00:16:46.897
And the only thing degrowth and e/acc really agree on is that

00:16:46.897 --> 00:16:50.477
radical action is needed to move away from the status quo.

00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:57.087
The only problem is that their visions of what to do next couldn't be more different.

00:16:58.842 --> 00:17:05.602
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Degrowth vs E/Acc, and How To Save The World.

00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:10.322
I hope you’ll excuse the catchy name for this episode, but it does

00:17:10.472 --> 00:17:14.292
encapsulate the big goals of these two very different ideologies.

00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:19.022
As always, I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.242
Had you heard of degrowth before?

00:17:21.712 --> 00:17:22.603
How about E/Acc?

00:17:23.122 --> 00:17:26.952
What were your thoughts when you first heard about what these ideas involved?

00:17:27.552 --> 00:17:30.682
Optimistic, pessimistic, somewhere in between?

00:17:31.292 --> 00:17:34.372
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:37.332

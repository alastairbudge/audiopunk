Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:15.847
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.847 --> 00:00:19.867
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.717
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:28.137
about Marie Antoinette, the 18th century queen of France.

00:00:28.797 --> 00:00:32.737
In popular imagination she was the aristocratic and out

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:36.267
of touch queen who once commented “let them eat cake”.

00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:43.947
But was this all there was to Marie Antoinette, or was there more to this 18th century French queen?

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:47.057
Let’s not waste a minute, and find out.

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:50.927
I have a 4-year-old son.

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.967
He is, at the moment, very keen on castles and soldiers.

00:00:56.507 --> 00:01:00.007
We look at pictures and do puzzles, with one group of

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.837
soldiers attacking a castle and another group defending it.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:09.757
He tells me, “Daddy, these are the good ones and those are the bad ones”.

00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:13.107
The good ones defend, the bad ones attack.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:20.547
And he is at an age where things are either good, they are nice, or they are bad, they are nasty.

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:26.277
You might think, “OK, he’s 4, a child of this age likes

00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:30.577
things to be clear, good or bad, naughty or nice”.

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:37.327
But even as adults, we like to put people in these convenient boxes.

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:39.687
Are they good or are they bad?

00:01:40.317 --> 00:01:42.417
Are they nice or are they naughty?

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:49.397
And this is especially the case with historical characters, people from history, people whose

00:01:49.407 --> 00:01:55.477
stories are told by other people many hundreds of years after they take their last breath.

00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:02.997
With time, and remembered only through second and third-hand accounts, they become

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:08.757
two dimensional, often far removed from the reality of their complex characters.

00:02:10.247 --> 00:02:15.367
And women from history are particularly vulnerable to this fate.

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:21.327
Against a backdrop of male prejudice and without the ability to defend

00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:27.057
themselves and write their own stories, they are often cast as villains.

00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:30.957
Think about Cleopatra or Anne Boleyn.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.927
But there is perhaps no greater example of a woman who has been

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:40.687
painted as, bad and nasty, as a four-year-old might put it, than Marie

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:44.997
Antoinette, the last queen of France prior to the French Revolution.

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:51.217
So in this episode we are going to explore the question of who the real Marie Antoinette

00:02:51.227 --> 00:02:56.957
was, we’ll go beyond the myth and ask ourselves whether she was “naughty or nice”.

00:02:58.047 --> 00:03:02.257
As a spoiler alert, if you don’t want to listen right to the end, it probably

00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:06.247
won’t surprise you to find that the answer is “somewhere in the middle”.

00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:11.487
Now, to answer this question we must first understand a bit more

00:03:11.687 --> 00:03:14.887
about her upbringing and the world in which she found herself.

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:24.477
She was born Maria Antonia in 1755 in Vienna, in Austria, the 15th of 16

00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:29.567
children born to Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Francis I of Austria.

00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:38.497
She was the epitome of European royalty; her father was Holy Roman Emperor, her parents

00:03:38.727 --> 00:03:45.097
jointly ruled the Habsburg Empire, and her godparents were the king and queen of Portugal.

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:51.997
And her surviving siblings would be married off to a wide range of European royalty,

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:58.317
from King Ferdinand IV of Naples to Maria Luisa, the daughter of Charles III of Spain.

00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:06.807
As you may know, the destiny of any child born into this kind of European royalty was to be married

00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:12.827
off to the child of another noble family, so as to strengthen diplomatic relations with them.

00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:19.077
And of course, Maria Antonia, as she was called, was no exception.

00:04:20.587 --> 00:04:26.987
To whom she was to be married would depend on the political situation at the time, and when

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:33.107
she came of marriageable age, the priority for the Habsburg Empire, of which her mother was the

00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:40.307
Empress, was a reconciliation with France, to unite the two powers against Britain and Prussia.

00:04:41.737 --> 00:04:45.007
The other daughters had already been promised to other

00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:48.647
European royalty, so it was Maria Antonia’s turn.

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:54.327
And in February of 1770 it became official.

00:04:56.077 --> 00:05:02.677
Maria Antonia had only just turned 14, but the King of France, Louis XV,

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:08.367
formally requested her hand in marriage on behalf of his grandson, the

00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:13.247
then 15-year-old Dauphin of France, the king in waiting, Louis Auguste.

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:20.167
The pair were officially married a couple of months later, but Louis Auguste wasn’t actually

00:05:20.247 --> 00:05:26.227
at the marriage; it was a proxy marriage, so Maria Antonia’s brother stood in for him.

00:05:27.497 --> 00:05:32.587
The point is, this 14-year-old girl, Maria Antonia, is already

00:05:32.587 --> 00:05:37.127
married to the future king of France, and she has never even met him!

00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:45.857
And, as you might imagine, she has lived a very privileged life completely cut off from

00:05:45.927 --> 00:05:52.647
“normal” society; she hasn’t gone to school, but had private tutors, and her entire

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:58.847
existence has been between the walls of various European royal palaces and country homes.

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:04.227
She travelled to France shortly after, met her husband for

00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:08.077
the first time, and there was an official ceremony in France.

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:13.997
This also included a ceremony called a “ritual bedding”, where the young

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:18.487
couple were brought to their marital bed by the groom’s family with the

00:06:18.497 --> 00:06:24.047
implicit understanding that the teenagers would get on with it and little Maria

00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:28.267
Antonia would do the important job of producing an heir to the French throne.

00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:34.097
In fact, we need to stop calling her Maria Antonia now, as when she first

00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:39.027
arrived in France she adopted the French version of her name, Marie Antoinette.

00:06:40.577 --> 00:06:43.799
She might have given herself a French name, but she

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.969
was always considered a foreigner and an outsider.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.889
And not only that, she was Austrian.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.019
France and Austria had had a difficult relationship for much of the early

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:03.569
18th century, and there was Maria Antonia, now Marie Antoinette, a perpetual

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.783
reminder of this new alliance that not everyone at the French court approved of.

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:15.179
And the French court, like any royal court, was highly political.

00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:22.979
Everyone was vying for power and influence, and the teenage Marie Antoinette was right

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:28.869
in the middle, the most visible representative of France’s powerful rival turned ally.

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:38.459
It didn’t take long for Marie Antoinette to go from queen-in-waiting to queen of France; in 1774,

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:47.199
Louis XV died and his 19-year-old grandson, Louis Auguste, became Louis XVI, king of France.

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:53.879
Marie Antoinette was only 18, but there she was, the Queen of France.

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:59.239
Although she might technically have been the most powerful woman in

00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:03.819
the country, her husband initially kept her away from the business of

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.969
actually running the country, and she had limited political influence.

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:13.539
Instead of bringing his wife closer to him, Louis seemed

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:16.029
like he wanted to keep a suitable distance from her.

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:21.514
He gave her a palace in the grounds of Versailles called “Le Petit

00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:27.829
Trianon”, and gave her free reign to decorate it and use it as she saw fit.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:34.049
This allowed the pair to live semi separate lives, and importantly,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:39.149
allowed the king to avoid any kind of sexual relations with his wife.

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:45.289
Now, there has been a lot written about Marie Antoinette and her husband’s sex life,

00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:51.959
or rather, the lack of it, and there are lots of theories about why this was the case.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.279
We aren’t going to go into the slightly intimate detail of the theories as to

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:04.289
why, but what is certain is that the couple tried everything to avoid any kind

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:09.459
of sexual activity, and there was no sign of Marie Antoinette falling pregnant.

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:12.909
And this was a problem.

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:18.569
France needed an heir, and Marie Antoinette’s popularity

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:21.999
was decreasing with every month that she didn’t produce one.

00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:28.459
It was such a problem that it caused Marie's brother, the Holy Roman Emperor

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:34.539
Joseph II, to come to Versailles in April of 1777 to find out what was going on.

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:42.389
Whatever he said to the pair, it seemed to have had some impact, but not immediately.

00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:46.739
It took 5 months for the marriage to be consummated,

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:50.689
and a year later Marie Antoinette fell pregnant.

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:58.369
In December 1778 she gave birth to a baby girl, Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, which was much to the

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:03.039
joy of the critics who had been muttering that the couple would not be able to produce children.

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:09.409
But it was far from truly endearing Marie Antoinette in the hearts of the French people.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:16.699
She was still viewed with suspicion by many, and this was exacerbated the following

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:22.389
year, when she got involved in a territorial dispute between Bavaria and Austria,

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:28.479
persuading her husband to intervene on the side of France’s old rival Austria.

00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:35.649
To add to this, she was already seen as profligate, extravagant and wasteful

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:40.589
in her spending at a time when the French economy was not in a good state.

00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:46.019
She would gamble and spend her evenings in fashionable salons of Paris.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:51.899
She had decked out Le Petit Trianon in a lavish style, sparing no expense.

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:57.889
There were even rumours that she had had the walls plastered with gold and diamonds.

00:10:58.469 --> 00:11:04.479
These were completely unfounded, but it does demonstrate the public perception of the young queen.

00:11:06.052 --> 00:11:13.342
She finally gave birth to the long-awaited son and heir, Louis Joseph, in 1781, which was a

00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:20.412
huge relief and a point of celebration, but this popularity was fleeting, it would not last.

00:11:21.662 --> 00:11:27.062
And what’s more, the paternity of her children would continue to be questioned, with

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:32.712
suggestions that these were the children not of the French king, but of a Swedish count.

00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:41.072
Moving into the 1780s, she was portrayed in pamphlets as a suspicious and unsympathetic

00:11:41.212 --> 00:11:47.842
high-spending Austrian, there were continued accusations of sexual deviance and her taking lovers.

00:11:48.972 --> 00:11:55.642
In other words, she was portrayed as a dangerous foreigner who was making a mockery of France and

00:11:55.652 --> 00:12:02.142
had absolutely no sympathy or understanding for the life of the average person in the country.

00:12:03.502 --> 00:12:08.342
Now, on that last point, given what we know about the life of Marie Antoinette,

00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:14.182
it’s hard to imagine how anyone who had lived such a secluded and aristocratic

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:18.792
life could have ever understood anything of the life of normal people of France.

00:12:19.452 --> 00:12:26.442
She had lived in palaces her entire life, she had only known nobles and royalty, and let’s

00:12:26.442 --> 00:12:34.607
remember, she had got engaged at the age of 14, was made queen at 18, and she was only 25 in 1780.

00:12:36.392 --> 00:12:40.192
But Marie Antoinette would find that when the public

00:12:40.362 --> 00:12:43.642
turns against you, it’s very hard to turn this around.

00:12:45.196 --> 00:12:50.016
In 1785 she was accused of defrauding a jeweller by

00:12:50.046 --> 00:12:52.736
reneging on an offer to buy a very expensive necklace.

00:12:53.796 --> 00:12:56.566
It turned out that Marie Antoinette was completely

00:12:56.616 --> 00:13:00.586
innocent, but what mattered was that she was accused.

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:05.586
In the eyes of much of the French public, it didn’t matter whether she was

00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:10.816
guilty or innocent; her involvement in the scandal was enough to vilify her.

00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:18.156
Against all of this was a French economy that was going from bad to worse.

00:13:19.505 --> 00:13:25.496
Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette’s husband, had initially looked like he was open to reforms

00:13:25.496 --> 00:13:30.486
of the French state, including requiring the nobles and the clergy to start paying

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:37.596
taxes, but he changed his mind, in part persuaded against doing this by Marie Antoinette.

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:44.006
By this time his wife had started to take a more active role in French politics,

00:13:44.346 --> 00:13:49.046
with her famously indecisive husband seeking her advice on political matters.

00:13:50.256 --> 00:13:55.026
Her influence was well-known to the French public, and she was seen as an

00:13:55.156 --> 00:13:59.906
architect of the dire state of the French national finances to such an extent

00:14:00.376 --> 00:14:06.396
that pamphlets started to refer to her as "Madame Déficit", “Mrs Deficit”.

00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:14.636
And moving to the latter half of the 1780s, Marie Antoinette was not only vastly

00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:19.936
unpopular with the French public, but she had more serious problems closer to home.

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:27.686
Her son and heir to the French throne, the Dauphin Louis Joseph, was in bad health.

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:38.136
He'd been quite a sickly young boy, but by 1786, when he was 5, it seemed like he had tuberculosis.

00:14:39.196 --> 00:14:46.586
The disease grew worse and worse, and the king-in-waiting died in 1789 at the age of 7.

00:14:48.052 --> 00:14:52.706
Marie Antoinette, as any parent would be, was utterly distraught.

00:14:53.816 --> 00:15:02.126
But she was alone in her anguish; as the young prince took his final breath, the country was in

00:15:02.126 --> 00:15:08.336
the middle of great political upheaval, and weeks later The French Revolution would break out.

00:15:09.806 --> 00:15:15.496
By October of that year Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI were put under house arrest

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:20.601
essentially, in this unusual situation in which they were still king and queen of

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:25.636
the country, but the political situation was turning more and more against them.

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:32.996
And, to really condense the story of the French Revolution into a few sentences, Marie Antoinette’s

00:15:33.046 --> 00:15:40.176
attempts to rectify the situation failed, an escape attempt failed, an attempt to bring on an

00:15:40.186 --> 00:15:47.236
invasion of France failed, in September of 1792 the French monarchy was officially abolished,

00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:54.226
and Louis XVI was executed by guillotine in January the following year, January of 1793.

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:58.806
By the way, we do have an entire episode on the French Revolution,

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:04.066
it’s episode number 152, so if you’d like to listen to 28 minutes about

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:09.432
the subject instead of 28 seconds, then the episode number is 152.

00:16:11.106 --> 00:16:18.596
But, to bring the story back to Marie Antoinette, on the 21st of January 1793, this Austrian

00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:24.856
princess, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor, sister of another Holy Roman Emperor, former

00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:31.626
Queen of France, was now without a title, without a husband, without a son, without anyone to

00:16:31.626 --> 00:16:38.586
turn to, and deeply unpopular with a French public that had just sliced off her husband’s head.

00:16:40.116 --> 00:16:44.206
She no doubt knew that her prospects were somewhat dire.

00:16:45.346 --> 00:16:48.356
She had to wait until October that year to be officially

00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:53.296
tried by a Revolutionary Tribunal, but the verdict came back.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:17:00.116
Guilty on three counts: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:05.286
against the internal and external security of the State, and high treason.

00:17:06.696 --> 00:17:13.996
On the 16th of October 1793, she was taken through the streets of Paris, not in the gilded

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:21.388
carriage that she was used to but in an open cart, the crowd jeering and shouting at her.

00:17:22.716 --> 00:17:27.416
Her hands were tied behind her as she was led up the scaffold.

00:17:28.536 --> 00:17:33.756
She was guillotined at 12:15 p.m, her head held up to

00:17:33.756 --> 00:17:38.156
the crowd and her body thrown into an unmarked grave.

00:17:38.976 --> 00:17:40.956
She was only 37 years old.

00:17:42.449 --> 00:17:49.909
Now, as far as the legacy of Marie Antoinette, she is often remembered as a symbol of the excesses

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:56.569
of the French monarchy, extravagance personified, politically naive and out of touch with reality.

00:17:57.519 --> 00:18:00.979
And what’s more, a foreigner who never stopped being

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:04.709
loyal to her motherland, France’s great rival Austria.

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:13.989
As you’ve heard, a lot of this is not without justification: she clearly had a taste for the finer

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:20.589
things in life, she did not understand the daily life of the average French person, and clearly she

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:27.269
massively misjudged the prevailing sentiment in France at the time, and paid for it with her life.

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:35.099
But to paint her as a pleasure-loving free-spending peasant-hating scheming foreigner is

00:18:35.099 --> 00:18:41.989
somewhat of a simplification, and it’s to completely ignore the reality of much of her life.

00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:50.839
To cast her only as a well-meaning victim is perhaps an exaggeration, but it is not so far from

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:58.329
the truth; she was used as a political pawn from when she was a child, forced to marry a man

00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:03.299
she clearly lacked any affection or respect for, certainly at the start of their relationship.

00:19:04.069 --> 00:19:09.049
She was forced to leave her family and country and was thrown into the French court at

00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:14.879
the age of 15, a den of snakes where everyone around her was trying to bring her down.

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:21.549
To take Marie Antoinette’s side for one minute, what chance did she really have?

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:27.339
Clearly, she lacked the maturity to survive in the situation into

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:31.129
which she was thrown, but she was only 15 when she got there!

00:19:32.389 --> 00:19:38.249
To expect her to have had an understanding of the nuances of the French court, to have understood

00:19:38.249 --> 00:19:44.949
politics and economics, both domestic and international, while having lived in a tiny aristocratic

00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:52.679
bubble all her life, it is a lot to ask, and poor Marie Antoinette was clearly not up to the task.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:59.249
From what historians now know about Marie Antoinette, she was actually rather charitable,

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:05.329
donating extensively to charitable causes and providing financial support to struggling families.

00:20:06.419 --> 00:20:10.249
She was a patron of the arts, supporting musicians and playwrights.

00:20:10.969 --> 00:20:17.239
She was, from what we know, a caring and loving mother, and devoted to her children.

00:20:18.609 --> 00:20:22.619
And some of the things that have been written about her, for example that she

00:20:22.629 --> 00:20:27.239
once said “let them eat cake”, when told about French citizens not having enough

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:32.819
to eat, they are simply not true; there is no evidence that she ever said this.

00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:37.701
So, to wrap things up, perhaps we can bring it back to the

00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:41.521
classification of soldiers from right at the start of the episode.

00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:46.431
Marie Antoinette, good or bad, naughty or nice?

00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:51.671
I hope you’ll now agree that the answer probably lies somewhere in the middle.

00:20:54.321 --> 00:21:00.341
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Marie Antoinette, of “let them eat cake” fame.

00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:04.611
As always, I hope it was an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:05.241 --> 00:21:08.181
We've got loads of members from France, so I’d particularly

00:21:08.181 --> 00:21:10.381
like to know what you think of Marie Antoinette.

00:21:10.851 --> 00:21:13.561
What other aspects of her character should we know about?

00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:16.601
How is she remembered in modern France?

00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:17.561
Villain?

00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:18.551
Heroine?

00:21:18.931 --> 00:21:19.751
Somewhere in the middle?

00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:23.251
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

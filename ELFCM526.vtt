Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.967
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:20.187
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:25.877
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about space mining.

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:31.767
It’s the idea that we can mine valuable minerals not from Earth, but from space.

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:37.467
So in this episode we’ll talk about why some people are so excited about it,

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:43.270
how and why it could work, some of its major challenges, and ask ourselves

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.980
whether it will ever go from the realm of science fiction to reality.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.270
OK then, let’s get started and talk about space mining.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.420
The 19th century was an exciting time in terms of space observation.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.250
The first asteroid, Ceres, was spotted in 1801 by the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.060
Half a century later, his countryman Annibale de Gasparis was working in his observatory in Naples.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.580
He saw an asteroid that he named 16 Psyche, after the Greek goddess of the soul.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.440
Now, this was just one of 9 different asteroids that he discovered.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.040
To him, it probably looked like a giant rock, an important

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.600
scientific discovery, but not much more than that.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.860
However, modern astronomers believe 16 Psyche to be

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.380
immeasurably more valuable than was first thought.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:59.080
To be precise, this asteroid is thought to contain precious metals worth 10 quintillion dollars.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.130
A quintillion might sound like a made-up number, something that a child might

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.220
say like a gazillion or a bazillion, which I should add are not real numbers.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.600
But a quintillion is not made up, it is just so big that you’ve probably never heard of it.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:24.291
10 quintillion is 10, followed by 19 zeroes.

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:34.471
Or to put it another way, it is 10,000 trillion, 100 times the value of the entire global economy.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:41.431
And it is right up there, in space, floating around, with nobody guarding it.

00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.391
And not just 16 Psyche.

00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:50.791
There are millions of asteroids, some large, some small, many of which are believed to

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:57.121
contain enough precious minerals to supply humanity for literally millions of years.

00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:03.001
So, what if there were a way to go up there and simply take them?

00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:09.573
This is the story of space mining, or asteroid mining to be precise.

00:03:10.713 --> 00:03:15.883
To some, it seems like science fiction, a fixation on looking to space

00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:19.363
while we have more than enough problems to deal with back on Earth.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.867
But to others it is something that can and will become reality, and a way to solve

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:31.727
many of the problems we have on Earth by taking what already exists in space.

00:03:33.257 --> 00:03:35.707
So, let’s start with some definitions.

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:43.249
Asteroids are objects that orbit the sun, much like planets, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and so on.

00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:47.828
They are essentially remnants of the early solar system,

00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:51.718
chunks of rock and metal that never formed into planets.

00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:58.442
The difference between an asteroid and a planet mainly comes down to size.

00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:03.543
Planets are much bigger, therefore have a larger gravitational

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:07.133
pull, and are circular in shape, because of gravity.

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:14.773
Asteroids are smaller, typically ranging from a few hundred metres or so through

00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:18.953
to the largest known asteroid, which is almost 1,000 kilometres in diameter,

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:24.533
around the same width as France from its most northern to most southern point.

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.323
It’s pretty big, but it’s much smaller than a planet.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:32.856
And because they are much smaller, they have a much lower gravitational

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:36.476
pull, so they’re not typically round but more like a rock.

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:43.206
Most known asteroids are in the asteroid belt, which is between Mars

00:04:43.206 --> 00:04:47.906
and Jupiter, but not all; there are others that come closer to Earth.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:51.276
Some come too close, like the one that is thought to have

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:55.066
hit Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.

00:04:55.786 --> 00:05:00.616
Fortunately, we humans are better than dinosaurs at spotting potential threats in the sky,

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:05.656
so in the event of an asteroid looking like it was on a collision path with Earth, we would

00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:11.276
know about it pretty quickly and be more capable than a diplodocus of changing its trajectory.

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:16.526
So, we know where asteroids are, and because they orbit the sun,

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:20.766
it is fairly easy to model their position at any point in time.

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:27.046
And while 19th-century astronomers might not have known much about the

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:32.641
consistency of an asteroid, or what it is actually made out of, we now do.

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:39.211
Some asteroids are thought to contain incredibly high levels of precious metals.

00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:45.501
When the solar system was formed, heavy elements like gold, platinum,

00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.151
nickel, and iron were distributed throughout the massive cloud

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:52.741
of gas and dust that eventually became the Sun and the planets.

00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:59.771
These elements were created during supernova explosions and collisions of neutron

00:05:59.771 --> 00:06:05.111
stars—cosmic events that forge the universe’s heaviest and most valuable materials.

00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:11.681
When the solar system began to take shape, gravity caused much of the

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:16.861
heavy material to sink towards the cores of the newly forming planets.

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:22.431
On Earth, for example, most of the gold and platinum we know of is thought

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.851
to be buried deep within the planet’s core, out of reach for humans.

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:32.423
But not all of this material ended up inside planets.

00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:37.536
Some of it remained as loose chunks of rock and metal scattered

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:40.336
throughout the solar system—what we now call asteroids.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.630
These asteroids are essentially the leftover building blocks of planets, and many

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.260
contain high concentrations of metals that didn’t make it into planetary cores.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.020
But what makes these asteroids so appealing isn’t just their high metal

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.240
content—it’s that the metals are often much more accessible than on Earth.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.920
Unlike Earth, where heavy metals have sunk to the core, asteroids

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.880
haven’t undergone the same processes of differentiation.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.040
This means that their metals are distributed throughout their

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.490
structure, making them, in theory at least, easier to extract.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.086
As I’m sure you will know, mining almost anything on Earth, and especially mining

00:07:26.086 --> 00:07:32.059
precious metals, is a dirty, intensive and expensive activity, often carried

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:36.949
out by people, sometimes even children, working in pretty awful conditions.

00:07:37.763 --> 00:07:42.132
Cobalt, for example, is a vital part of electric batteries, and

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:46.852
70% of all cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:53.941
And conditions in the Congolese cobalt mines have been likened to modern-day slavery.

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:58.091
Cobalt and Congo are just one example.

00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:04.581
Getting anything out of the Earth’s crust is an intensive, polluting process, so

00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:09.631
wouldn’t it be better, the argument goes, for us just to take it from an asteroid?

00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:13.381
There would be no pollution, no child labour, and

00:08:13.381 --> 00:08:16.591
no destruction of forests to make way for the mines.

00:08:17.443 --> 00:08:20.200
In theory, it all sounds very positive.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.330
A lifetime’s supply of precious metals floating around in the sky, fortunes

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.420
to be made for anyone who can find a way to go up there and get them.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.100
Of course, it's more complicated than that.

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:38.270
First, let’s talk about the practicality of getting to an asteroid.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.420
They are a long way away.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.690
In late 2023 NASA did actually send a mission to the asteroid

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.166
Psyche, the one I mentioned at the start of the episode.

00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:56.726
Its scheduled arrival date is 2029, so it will take 6 years for it to get there.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:03.686
It’s travelling at something like 50,000 kilometres an hour, incredibly fast by Earth

00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:09.856
standards, the problem is that it needs to travel almost 500 million kilometres to get there.

00:09:11.256 --> 00:09:16.606
And it isn’t on a space mining mission, but rather a fact-gathering one.

00:09:17.246 --> 00:09:23.346
No spacecraft has ever been to Psyche before, so the plan is to go and observe it.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:29.961
Given the cost of getting to an asteroid, any mission needs to be fairly sure that it

00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:36.056
will find what it’s looking for, and given that not all asteroids are created equal–some

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:40.846
are rocky, others are icy, and others contain high levels of precious metals–you

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:45.846
need to send a fact-finding mission first before committing to a mining mission.

00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:49.046
Now, let’s talk about costs.

00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:53.367
A large proportion of the cost of any space mission is getting

00:09:53.407 --> 00:09:56.567
out of the Earth’s atmosphere, and then returning safely.

00:09:57.777 --> 00:10:04.459
Sending something to space is expensive, but it is considerably cheaper than it used to be.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:11.999
During the first thirty years or so of space launches, it would typically cost in the region of

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:21.153
$25,000 per kilo to send something to space, but some projects were upwards of $100,000 per kilo.

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:27.693
Companies such as SpaceX have been hyper-focused on reducing the

00:10:27.723 --> 00:10:33.914
cost of going to space so that it now costs around $1,500 per kilo.

00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:40.873
But with reusable rockets and increasing efficiencies in every part of the launch

00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:45.873
process, there are some estimates that this could be brought down to around

00:10:46.153 --> 00:10:53.003
$10 per kilo, less than it would cost to send a 1 kilo parcel within the UK.

00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:58.933
So, yes going to space and therefore getting to an asteroid is very

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:04.403
expensive, but while a few decades ago it would have been so expensive that

00:11:04.403 --> 00:11:08.973
it simply wouldn’t have been economically viable, now it very well might be.

00:11:09.923 --> 00:11:14.213
So, let’s assume that costs have gone down to such an extent

00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:18.203
that the first asteroid mining mission is ready for lift-off.

00:11:18.673 --> 00:11:19.643
How would it work?

00:11:20.423 --> 00:11:25.583
Well, there are several fundamental differences between Earth and Space that mean

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:30.173
an asteroid mine certainly wouldn’t bear much resemblance to any mine on Earth.

00:11:30.969 --> 00:11:35.312
Obviously, there is the problem of how to get all of the equipment there, so it

00:11:35.322 --> 00:11:39.462
simply wouldn’t be possible to boost large trucks and heavy equipment into space,

00:11:39.962 --> 00:11:44.914
and anyhow, this kind of equipment would probably be of little use on an asteroid.

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:51.137
There is no gravity on an asteroid, so everything would need to be tied down to the asteroid.

00:11:51.868 --> 00:11:56.462
Most probably, there would be some kind of great canopy, a tent-like

00:11:56.462 --> 00:12:00.722
structure, that was put over the area that was being mined, otherwise,

00:12:00.802 --> 00:12:04.972
all of the dust and precious metals would simply blow away into space.

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:12.622
And in terms of the mining process, there are several different ideas about how this could work.

00:12:13.257 --> 00:12:18.337
Perhaps it would be lasers that would vaporise material, robotic arms that

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:23.197
grind and collect it, or even specialised bacteria, as they do in terrestrial

00:12:23.207 --> 00:12:28.757
biomining, that break down rock and release valuable metals like nickel or cobalt.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.977
Another significant challenge is that asteroids typically

00:12:32.977 --> 00:12:36.817
rotate, often unpredictably and at varying speeds.

00:12:37.287 --> 00:12:40.917
This constant movement makes it very difficult to safely land

00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:44.707
equipment, maintain stability, or accurately mine materials.

00:12:45.457 --> 00:12:48.637
To address this, the mining team would need to find some

00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:52.487
way of stabilising the asteroid, keeping it in position.

00:12:53.187 --> 00:12:57.717
Maybe this would be using thrusters to slow or stop its rotation.

00:12:57.947 --> 00:13:02.647
Maybe it would be by using large nets or tethers to anchor it, or

00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:06.607
by synchronising mining tools to match the asteroid’s rotation.

00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:11.687
And then there is the question of who would work on the mine.

00:13:12.697 --> 00:13:17.277
This is not a question of whether there would be thousands of astronauts with hammers

00:13:17.277 --> 00:13:22.067
and shovels physically digging the surface themselves, and lugging large sacks back at

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:28.047
the end of the day, but rather whether the mine would be 100% automated, controlled from

00:13:28.047 --> 00:13:33.447
back on Earth or from a space mission closer to Earth, or whether there would be human

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:38.438
astronauts  monitoring the situation from the site, just in case anything went wrong.

00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:41.823
And there is also the legal question.

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:46.515
One of the very first episodes we ever made, more than 5

00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:50.655
years ago now, was about the question of who owns space.

00:13:51.595 --> 00:13:55.865
5 years on, that question still remains largely unanswered.

00:13:57.015 --> 00:14:03.025
The first principle of the 1967 Space Treaty is, and I’m quoting directly, “the

00:14:03.055 --> 00:14:08.255
exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:13.795
in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind”

00:14:15.226 --> 00:14:20.840
And it is shortly followed by “outer space is not subject to national appropriation

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.870
by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means”.

00:14:27.123 --> 00:14:29.923
In other words, nobody owns space.

00:14:30.633 --> 00:14:35.743
But there is a grey area over what this means in terms of asteroid mining.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:42.683
If a company successfully mines an asteroid, who owns the minerals they mine?

00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:47.483
Is it a bit like fishing, where any boat can fish in international

00:14:47.483 --> 00:14:51.373
waters, and they are free to use and sell what they catch?

00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:53.413
Or is it not?

00:14:54.512 --> 00:15:00.652
In 2015, Barack Obama signed something called the SPACE Act, which gives U.S.

00:15:00.652 --> 00:15:05.252
citizens the right to "engage in the commercial exploration and

00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:09.622
exploitation of 'space resources' [including ... water and minerals]

00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:16.122
".
In other words, US citizens can do it, according to US law at least.

00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:20.002
But how does this law play with international law?

00:15:21.362 --> 00:15:28.192
It hasn’t been an issue so far, because nobody has done it, but if asteroid mining turns

00:15:28.252 --> 00:15:34.212
from the theoretical to the practical, it is a question that will need to be addressed.

00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:41.558
Now, let’s assume that it is addressed, and that companies are able to build cost-effective

00:15:41.568 --> 00:15:46.248
ways of getting mining equipment to space, and successfully mining an asteroid.

00:15:47.398 --> 00:15:48.468
What happens next?

00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:53.558
Well, there is also the question of where the minerals go.

00:15:54.938 --> 00:15:59.398
One option is to bring them back to Earth and use them here.

00:16:00.216 --> 00:16:06.107
We need the minerals found on asteroids, especially the platinum group metals, we need them here on

00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:12.705
Earth, for everything from batteries to solar panels to electric cars, so there is a clear demand.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:18.326
Whoever can bring them back cost effectively will become spectacularly wealthy.

00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:24.716
But the other option is to leave them in space, for use in space.

00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:30.308
The more activity there is in space, the more stuff is needed, and this currently

00:16:30.358 --> 00:16:35.338
all needs to be brought from Earth and then sent to space, which is expensive.

00:16:36.468 --> 00:16:39.228
No matter how plentiful and cheap something might be

00:16:39.228 --> 00:16:42.978
on Earth, in space it suddenly becomes very expensive.

00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:46.758
One obvious example is water.

00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:53.448
A kilo of water might be practically free on Earth, but taking a kilo of

00:16:53.448 --> 00:16:58.428
water to space costs the same as taking a kilo of anything else to space.

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:04.452
And in space, water is incredibly important and in short supply.

00:17:05.743 --> 00:17:10.713
Water is needed to keep astronauts hydrated, as well as for cooling and

00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:14.832
regulating the temperature of a spacecraft, and as a radiation shield.

00:17:15.632 --> 00:17:23.403
But perhaps even more important than this are the component parts of water; hydrogen and oxygen.

00:17:24.323 --> 00:17:30.323
The oxygen can be separated from the water, and can be used for breathing on a spacecraft.

00:17:31.073 --> 00:17:36.943
Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the primary propellants of many modern rockets,

00:17:37.293 --> 00:17:43.853
so if water can be found on an asteroid, for example, it becomes incredibly valuable.

00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:50.635
There are no petrol stations in space, all fuel needs to be brought up from Earth,

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:58.333
but if a source of water, in the form of ice or water-rich material, could be found,

00:17:58.722 --> 00:18:04.123
and this could be processed in space into rocket fuel and left in space, where it

00:18:04.123 --> 00:18:09.033
is most useful and valuable, then this would be like a petrol station in space.

00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:14.152
It would bring down the cost of space launches, because they wouldn’t have to take so

00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:20.723
much fuel up from Earth, and it would allow for longer and faster journeys within space.

00:18:22.253 --> 00:18:27.731
And perhaps veering even more into the realms of the ultra-futuristic, in a

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:32.535
universe in which there were settlements on other planets, Mars, for example, it

00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:38.705
makes much more sense to manufacture what is needed in space rather than on Earth.

00:18:39.313 --> 00:18:43.758
If you need to build a settlement, it could be a lot more cost effective to take the

00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:48.948
raw materials from a nearby asteroid than shooting them up from a rocket on Earth.

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:53.668
So, one option is to leave the mined materials in space.

00:18:54.307 --> 00:18:59.498
But what would happen if these rare minerals were brought back down to Earth?

00:19:00.318 --> 00:19:04.888
You heard at the start that just one asteroid contains precious metals

00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:10.238
worth 100 times the entire global economy, enough for every person on

00:19:10.238 --> 00:19:17.338
Earth to receive around $1.25 billion, so what would be the impact of that?

00:19:18.278 --> 00:19:22.585
Well, everyone on Earth wouldn’t receive $1.25 billion.

00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:28.338
This 10 quintillion dollar number is the estimated total value of

00:19:28.495 --> 00:19:32.778
all the precious metals in that asteroid at current market prices.

00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:39.938
If it were all brought back to Earth at once, it would flood the market, and the price would come

00:19:39.938 --> 00:19:45.098
crashing down because we would have more iron, platinum and cobalt than we knew what to do with.

00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.908
But that isn’t going to happen.

00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:54.848
Because of the timelines of getting there, the cost of a mission, and the fact that a spacecraft is

00:19:54.848 --> 00:20:01.338
limited to how much it can carry back, it would take hundreds if not thousands of years for even a

00:20:01.358 --> 00:20:07.398
fraction of the precious metals on an asteroid this size to be mined and then brought back to Earth.

00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:13.435
Still, there are some commentators who have pointed out that, even with a relatively

00:20:13.435 --> 00:20:18.785
small haul of precious metals, asteroid mining could be very detrimental to

00:20:18.825 --> 00:20:23.305
lower-income countries that have so-far relied on natural resource extraction.

00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:28.755
Mines back on Earth would be closed, millions of people would be out of a job,

00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:33.405
and there would need to be some sort of mechanism for these countries to be

00:20:33.445 --> 00:20:38.535
compensated by the countries or companies that enjoyed the spoils of asteroid mining.

00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:44.205
There are also environmental concerns, but these are mainly the concerns

00:20:44.215 --> 00:20:49.315
about space pollution, of debris from the mines floating around in space.

00:20:50.695 --> 00:20:55.776
In terms of environmental concerns on Earth, it seems pretty clear-cut.

00:20:56.745 --> 00:21:03.145
Yes, sending a rocket into space and then bringing it back into the atmosphere releases a lot

00:21:03.165 --> 00:21:09.315
of CO2, but these are the only significant emissions that would be caused by space mining.

00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:16.495
According to one study, mining a kilo of platinum from an asteroid would result

00:21:16.655 --> 00:21:22.885
in around 60 kilogrammes of CO2, and this is against 40,000 kilogrammes of

00:21:22.885 --> 00:21:27.975
CO2 to get every kilo of platinum out of the Earth’s crust like we do today.

00:21:29.265 --> 00:21:33.585
In other words, yes, you might think of a rocket blasting off into space

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:38.415
and think, “Well, that must be very environmentally unfriendly”, but it is

00:21:38.435 --> 00:21:43.375
approximately 700 times better for the environment than the way we currently do it.

00:21:44.655 --> 00:21:49.995
So, if it all sounds so good in theory, why is it not already happening?

00:21:51.225 --> 00:21:52.365
It comes down to money.

00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:58.225
Building all of the technology, actually figuring out how to do it, and then doing

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:04.205
test after test after test will require hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.

00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:07.145
And with no certain return.

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:12.135
Several companies have started this process, but none

00:22:12.145 --> 00:22:14.835
have made the progress that they had initially promised.

00:22:16.175 --> 00:22:21.175
Most investors aren’t very good at being patient, especially when

00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:26.115
there is no guarantee of any return, and despite the huge potential

00:22:26.115 --> 00:22:30.175
prize, there is a lack of funding for asteroid mining companies.

00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:38.405
Still, as you listen to this episode, assuming that it isn’t the year 2029 yet, a NASA

00:22:38.405 --> 00:22:45.519
spacecraft is on its way to an asteroid that was first spotted in 1852, 16 Psyche.

00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:52.049
It will return with news, news that might just change the world.

00:22:53.729 --> 00:22:57.749
OK then, that is it for today's episode on space mining.

00:22:58.022 --> 00:23:00.247
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that it might

00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:03.312
have given you a new perspective on the night sky.

00:23:04.052 --> 00:23:06.712
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:07.172 --> 00:23:09.682

00:23:10.202 --> 00:23:12.942

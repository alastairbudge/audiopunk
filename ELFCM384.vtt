Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:15.904
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:19.934
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:26.034
I'm Alastair Budge, and this episode is going to be released on July 14th.

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:30.054
If you’re French, you already know why this is an important day.

00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:32.588
Even if you’re not French, you may well know.

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:37.278
It’s La fête nationale française, the National Day of France,

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:40.978
or Bastille Day as it’s known in the English-speaking world.

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:45.988
So today, on this most French of days, we are going to talk about a

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:51.468
man who, to many, is the epitome of Frenchness, a man who is still

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:56.268
held as an example of the glories of France 200 years after his death.

00:00:56.928 --> 00:00:59.658
We are talking, of course, about Napoleon.

00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:04.524
OK then, the life of Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:13.344
On Sunday the 18th of June, 1815, near the Belgian village of Waterloo, at around

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:19.294
8pm in the evening, a 45-year-old French general took stock of his surroundings.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.144
He saw the bodies of his soldiers strewn across the fields.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:30.254
Horses, bloodied corpses, smoke billowing from burning farmhouses.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:35.084
He heard the cries of the retreating French army, thrown into

00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:39.254
chaos as the soldiers ran for their lives from the advancing enemy.

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:46.609
111 days earlier, this very same French general had escaped from the island of

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:52.799
Elba, raised an army, and declared himself as Emperor of France for the second time.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.809
His reign wouldn’t last for long.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.839
Just days after this final, decisive defeat, Napoleon would be exiled

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.709
for good to St Helena, an island a 9-week boat trip away from France.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.040
Less than six years later he would be dead, a few months after his 51st birthday.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.930
He might have lived a relatively short life, even by 19th century standards, but

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.380
there are few people in French history who have had such an impact on the country’s

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.630
national psyche, few people who are held up to this very day as models to emulate.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.640
Given this, it might surprise you to learn that Napoleon Bonaparte was not born Napoleon

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.010
Bonaparte, he was born Napoleone Buonaparte, he had an Italian, not a French name.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.740
The reason for this all lies in his Corsican heritage, the fact that he was from Corsica.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.520
Corsica, in case you need a reminder, is an island in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.110
the Mediterranean that lies between Italy and France.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.820
There are two large islands between Italy and France, one above the other.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.930
Corsica is the northern one, and Sardinia is the southern one.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.600
Both islands, in fact, are much closer to Italy than France.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.250
In Corsica’s case, it’s very close to Italy, just

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.030
85km from the Italian mainland but 145 km from France.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.450
Now, Corsica today is part of France, and Sardinia is part of Italy, but, as you might expect,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.750
it hasn't always been this way, and control of these two islands has varied over the years.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.110
And indeed, Napoleon’s early life and ideals were characterised by this

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.460
tension between France, Italy, and a sense of Corsican independence.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.750
When he was born, in 1769, Corsica was an independent state.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.970
It had gained independence from the kingdom of Genoa, a kingdom of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.410
Italy, in 1755, but this only lasted for 14 years before the island

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.210
was conquered by the French and turned into a province of France.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.303
And the Corsicans, the people of Corsica were looked down upon by the mainland French.

00:04:25.843 --> 00:04:31.753
They were considered to be barbarous, an inferior, uncivilised island people.

00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:36.603
There are, as you might imagine, still some traces of the same

00:04:36.603 --> 00:04:42.003
sentiments in modern France, but 250 years ago it was much more extreme.

00:04:43.023 --> 00:04:48.863
And this was something that the young Napoleon felt intensely, this sense not

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:54.253
only of being different, but of being looked down upon by the mainland French.

00:04:55.663 --> 00:05:01.843
For starters, he couldn’t speak French properly, and only learned the language when he moved

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:07.283
to the mainland at the age of 9, after his father had won him a scholarship to study in France.

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:12.663
For his entire life he would speak French with a thick Corsican

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:16.733
accent, and reportedly never learned to write French properly.

00:05:17.653 --> 00:05:23.623
So, perhaps a brief language-learning motivational lesson we can take from this is that

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:28.453
if having a strange accent and not knowing how to spell properly didn’t stop Napoleon from

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.563
conquering most of Europe, it shouldn’t stop you from achieving whatever you want to do.

00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:35.693
Right, back to the subject at hand.

00:05:36.463 --> 00:05:41.733
From an early age, Napoleon was pro-Corsican independence, he wanted

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:46.393
his homeland to be liberated from its French oppressors, as he saw them.

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:51.203
From an early age, he showed his talents as a leader, able

00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:54.823
to group his friends around a mission and inspire others.

00:05:56.363 --> 00:06:03.253
His first step career-wise, after finishing normal school, would be to enrol at the famous École

00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:09.153
Militaire, the military school in Paris, from which he would be the first Corsican to graduate.

00:06:10.673 --> 00:06:16.143
This was in 1785, a mere four years before revolution would break out.

00:06:17.613 --> 00:06:20.823
He would prove himself to be a talented young soldier,

00:06:21.123 --> 00:06:24.473
but idealistically he was in a difficult position.

00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:29.853
See, his first political ambition in life was not becoming the emperor of

00:06:29.853 --> 00:06:35.583
France or European domination; it was the liberation of Corsica from the French.

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:42.193
He asked for a leave of absence from the army to return to Corsica, which was granted.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:49.873
But after he returned to his homeland and saw the situation on the ground, his opinion changed.

00:06:51.023 --> 00:06:57.223
He started to sympathise with the French, thinking that this French "oppression" wasn't

00:06:57.243 --> 00:07:03.840
as bad as he had previously thought, and he actually started to oppose independence,

00:07:05.193 --> 00:07:07.733
it was about this time that he changed his name.

00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:13.473
No longer was he Napoleone Buonaparte, pro-Corsican independence

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:17.903
supporter; this was Napoleon Bonaparte, French sympathiser.

00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:23.413
As you might imagine, this didn't make him particularly popular in his

00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:28.343
homeland, and he had to flee from the island, seeking refuge in France.

00:07:29.473 --> 00:07:33.113
And it would be in France, during the period known as the

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:36.533
French Revolutionary Wars, that he would make his name.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:44.143
As a quick very brief reminder of what was going on here, the French Revolution started in

00:07:44.143 --> 00:07:53.093
1789, then for a 10-year-period from 1792 to 1802 the French army fought against the monarchies

00:07:53.093 --> 00:07:58.176
of Europe, who had looked at the activities of the French revolutionaries and thought, “hmm,

00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:04.613
we don’t want to meet the same fate as our French cousins”, and had declared war on France.

00:08:05.913 --> 00:08:12.293
We are going to skip over most of the detail of what happened here, but suffice it to say that it

00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:18.543
was in this period that Napoleon distinguished himself to such an extent that he became general at

00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:26.433
the age of 24, then First Consul of France, essentially ruler of France, in 1799, at the age of 30.

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:31.533
So, I hope you’ll forgive me for having sped through that so quickly,

00:08:31.903 --> 00:08:36.373
but this is kind of just the start for our young hero, or at least the

00:08:36.393 --> 00:08:39.793
subject of this episode if you disagree with him being described as a hero.

00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:46.653
By November of 1799 he was in command of the country that he had hated as

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:51.323
a young boy, a country awash with revolutionary spirit, the first country

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:55.903
in modern Europe to do away with its monarch through a national revolution.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.583
It must have been exciting, but nerve-wracking at the same time.

00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:06.023
On the one hand, he was incredibly popular, being seen by the French public as a

00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:10.953
genius military leader who had led the country to countless military victories.

00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:16.773
On the other hand, he had seen what had happened to the last rulers of France - they

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:21.613
had lost their heads - so he must have been quietly cautious about his next steps.

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:27.543
And his actions do suggest a certain level of caution.

00:09:28.163 --> 00:09:34.153
His rule has been described by one prominent historian as "dictatorship by plebiscite",

00:09:34.753 --> 00:09:40.083
essentially it was a dictatorship, but one in which people had a theoretical vote.

00:09:41.223 --> 00:09:46.093
In any case, his actions soon started to resemble the actions of the

00:09:46.093 --> 00:09:49.453
unelected monarchs who had felt the cold steel of the guillotine.

00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:55.913
In 1804 he gave himself the title of Emperor of France, and the following

00:09:55.923 --> 00:10:00.173
year he also became King of Italy, which didn’t include all of Italy

00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:03.976
as we know it today, but just the majority of the northern part.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:08.793
All this time he continued to develop the French army.

00:10:09.623 --> 00:10:13.923
Remember, Napoleon was first and foremost a soldier; he had joined

00:10:14.023 --> 00:10:17.983
the military academy at the age of 16, he had distinguished himself

00:10:18.253 --> 00:10:23.493
as a military commander, and he was well-known as a tactical genius.

00:10:24.923 --> 00:10:30.203
We’ll come to look at the extent to which this is true shortly, but it’s undeniable

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:35.443
that he built up the ranks of the French army and turned it into a well-oiled machine.

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:42.413
He needed to, as there was still the threat of the British, the Austrians, and the Prussians.

00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:47.913
And closer to home, not only were there the Royalists, people who had

00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:52.603
previously supported the French royal family, but also those who believed

00:10:52.843 --> 00:10:57.673
that Napoleon’s ambitions were leading the country in a dangerous direction.

00:10:59.203 --> 00:11:05.988
He might have had his critics, but for an almost 10 year period, from around 1803 through

00:11:05.988 --> 00:11:12.383
to 1812, it seemed like Napoleon could do little wrong from a military perspective at least.

00:11:13.753 --> 00:11:19.713
He was hailed as a strategic genius after defeating the Russian-Austrian army at Austerlitz in

00:11:19.863 --> 00:11:27.043
1805 in a battle where he tricked his adversaries perfectly and ended up inflicting huge damage.

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:32.273
And time after time, his military strategies brought the

00:11:32.273 --> 00:11:35.663
French army victory after victory on the battlefield.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:43.623
Fast forward to 1812, this Corsican 43-year-old effectively controlled Western

00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:47.843
continental Europe, with the exception of Portugal, which was a British ally.

00:11:49.103 --> 00:11:55.593
Up until then, with a few exceptions, such as the Battle of Trafalgar, he could do no wrong.

00:11:55.973 --> 00:12:01.893
His tactics and military genius had led to the French empire controlling the European continent.

00:12:03.443 --> 00:12:07.833
Napoleon, by this stage, was drinking his own Kool-Aid, he

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:11.043
believed in his own genius just as much as the next man.

00:12:11.703 --> 00:12:16.163
He had hunches and intuitions, he had ideas about what should be done.

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:22.153
He might listen to his advisors, but it was always he who made the final decision.

00:12:23.313 --> 00:12:29.593
But, to quote Proverbs, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall".

00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:33.303
In other words, pride comes before a fall.

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:38.413
And this fall, for Napoleon and for the country he had come to call his

00:12:38.413 --> 00:12:44.443
own, came in June of 1812, with his decision to march East, into Russia.

00:12:45.683 --> 00:12:48.913
As the French army marched into Russia, they weren’t

00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:53.083
confronted by a proud and fierce army or violent resistance.

00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:59.143
There were battles along the way, but most of all they were confronted by…nothing.

00:12:59.973 --> 00:13:05.233
The Russian army simply retreated east, drawing the French army further and further

00:13:05.443 --> 00:13:10.303
into Russia and further and further away from supplies and reinforcements in France.

00:13:11.613 --> 00:13:15.253
Along the way, the Russian army destroyed supplies that

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.653
could possibly be used by the advancing French army.

00:13:18.523 --> 00:13:24.743
And when the French army arrived all the way to Moscow, almost 3,000 kilometres

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:30.453
from Paris, they found the city not just practically deserted, but on fire.

00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:35.014
They had conquered the Russian capital but…there was

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:38.684
nobody there and the place was burning to the ground.

00:13:39.754 --> 00:13:42.834
It’s almost like a philosophical question: have you

00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:46.204
really captured a capital city if there is nothing there?

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:52.486
Soon enough, it became a very real question for Napoleon and his troops.

00:13:53.706 --> 00:14:00.446
On October 19th, 1812, with winter approaching, very limited supplies, a demoralised

00:14:00.616 --> 00:14:07.286
and unruly army and a long way back to Paris, the French army left the ashes of Moscow.

00:14:08.676 --> 00:14:13.036
It was still over 100,000 men strong, but these men

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:17.326
were tired, homesick, hungry, and increasingly cold.

00:14:17.866 --> 00:14:20.876
Not exactly in prime condition for fighting.

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:26.366
And as they started the long march back, and with the

00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:29.676
temperature dropping, their condition only worsened.

00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:34.366
Horses died of starvation or were killed for their meat.

00:14:34.826 --> 00:14:38.756
Tens of thousands of soldiers also died of starvation,

00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:42.796
exhaustion, hypothermia or a combination of all three.

00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:47.346
Others were killed or taken prisoner by Russian peasants.

00:14:48.526 --> 00:14:52.526
The Russian army barely had to fight; obstructing the French

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:56.146
retreat and destroying all potential supply lines was enough.

00:14:57.653 --> 00:15:02.243
The result was the complete and utter destruction of the French army.

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:09.133
Now, historians have differing views on the numbers here, but it’s estimated that

00:15:09.153 --> 00:15:16.593
anywhere from 400 to 600,000 French soldiers marched into Russia in June of 1812.

00:15:17.753 --> 00:15:19.493
And how many returned?

00:15:20.523 --> 00:15:25.153
It’s hard to say, because some simply deserted, but some

00:15:25.183 --> 00:15:29.903
estimates have as few as 10,000 making it back alive.

00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:36.103
For a man who had prided himself as being a tactical genius,

00:15:36.453 --> 00:15:41.633
this was a tactical disaster, a colossal miscalculation.

00:15:43.103 --> 00:15:47.733
As you will know if you’ve spent much time reading about this period, or if you’ve

00:15:47.733 --> 00:15:53.163
read War and Peace, let’s say, there are countless theories and hypotheses about why

00:15:53.313 --> 00:15:58.783
Napoleon made such a miscalculation, and what could have been done to avoid this,

00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:05.553
but the end result was the worst and most humiliating military defeat of his career.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:12.350
A year later he would suffer another defeat at the Battle of Leipzig, against Austrian,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.290
Prussian, Swedish and Russian forces, and he would be forced to abdicate his position as

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.840
Emperor of France, the monarchy was restored to France, and Napoleon was exiled to the

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:30.000
island of Elba, a tiny island sandwiched between his homeland of Corsica and mainland Italy.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.300
This was in April of 1814, yet this was not the end for

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.410
our hero, or villain, depending on your point of view.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.660
The following year he managed to escape from Elba with a small crew of 1,000 supporters.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:52.350
He marched on Paris, was welcomed with open arms, as the new Bourbon monarchy was not particularly

00:16:52.350 --> 00:17:00.290
well-liked, and on 20th of March 1815, he proclaimed himself Emperor of France for a second time.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.850
It wouldn’t last long.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:10.920
He had raised an army that numbered around 200,000, and he marched northwards to try to split up

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:16.350
the British army, which was coming from the north, and the Prussians, who were coming from the East.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.440
This culminated, on the 18th of June, 1815, with the Battle

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.320
of Waterloo, as you heard at the start of the episode.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.840
It was decisive, but not in the way Napoleon had imagined.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.039
The French army was defeated once and for all, Napoleon was forced to abdicate

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.890
yet again, and on the 15th of July 1815 he surrendered to the British.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.280
The British decided to send him as far away as they possibly could,

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.160
to the island of St Helena in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.400
From here there was no escape.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.870
And the conditions were a far cry from the luxurious ones he had

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.000
enjoyed as French Emperor at his palace in Fontainebleau, outside Paris.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.270
It was cold, damp, and windy.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:16.890
Napoleon spent his days writing his memoirs, playing cards, and drafting a book about Julius Caesar.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.000
It seemed that he still dreamed of a return.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.210
He was allowed to hold dinner parties, but every man who came to the dinner

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:31.600
party had to wear military uniform, almost as if he simply didn’t want to admit

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.000
that he was no longer in charge of the most powerful military force in Europe.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.990
And on the 5th of May 1821, at the age of 51, he

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.440
died, with the official verdict being stomach cancer.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.780
As to his legacy, well there is a lot to unpack.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.210
We didn’t have the chance to talk about this yet, but he laid

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.190
the foundations of the modern French state and its institutions.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.980
The civil code that he set out is still the model for modern France,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.030
and parts of it are used in parts of Belgian, Polish and Italian law.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:17.820
In the popular imagination, he is an inspirational character, someone who epitomises French spirit.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.920
Yet, like anyone who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands,

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.660
if not millions of people, he is not without his fair share of critics.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.850
He has been called “a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.930
before the coming of Hitler”, an enabler of slavery, and a dangerous tyrant.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.640
Undeniably, had he not sent his men into Russia, hundreds of thousands of his own

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.690
people’s lives would have been saved, let alone the Russian and Austrian casualties.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.830
But in France, he remains an incredibly popular character, albeit one with clear flaws.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.510
In 2021 the French president, Emanuel Macron, clearly laid out the

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:12.630
difficulties of his legacy, saying “Napoleon was both ogre and eagle,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:18.510
Alexander and Nero … the soul of the world and the demon of Europe,”

00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:24.361
Whatever your view on Napoleon, it’s hard to deny that he lived an

00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:28.851
impressive life, in the literal sense of making a mark on the world.

00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:36.621
He was a man with deep convictions in his own ability, a man who believed he was unstoppable.

00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:41.951
So, we will leave this episode with a quote from Napoleon that,

00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:47.361
depending on your opinion of him, underlines his egomania or simply

00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:51.551
demonstrates the confidence that one has to have to achieve what he did.

00:20:52.911 --> 00:21:00.331
“Impossible”, he said, “is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools”.

00:21:03.338 --> 00:21:07.958
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:21:08.438 --> 00:21:11.508
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:18.268
This was actually part two of a three-part mini-series to mark Bastille Day, July 14th.

00:21:18.818 --> 00:21:22.988
Part one was on Joan of Arc, the famous French freedom fighter who was

00:21:22.988 --> 00:21:27.438
burned at the stake, and Part Three will be on the Dreyfus Affair, the

00:21:27.618 --> 00:21:31.608
political scandal that shocked the country at the end of the 19th century.

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:36.764
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:37.234 --> 00:21:42.064

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:16.621
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:21.001
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.431
I'm Alastair Budge and today, if you are listening to this

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.331
episode on the day it’s released, is the 1st of January.

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.711
So, happy new year, I hope today is going to be a great day

00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:38.141
for you, and that 2021 will be a fantastic year for you too.

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:46.911
To kick off 2021 we are going to tell the story of Vespa, the iconic Italian scooter.

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:54.081
It’s a pretty amazing story, and takes us from World War I right through to

00:00:54.091 --> 00:01:00.501
today, involving Hollywood, British music, and some fantastic Italian engineering.

00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:06.761
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:12.221
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, that transcript and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:17.191
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.956
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:26.936
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:31.976
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:36.716
So if that is of interest, and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:41.066
wouldn't be, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:43.983
OK then, Vespa.

00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:47.743
Now, you probably know what a Vespa is.

00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:52.613
Perhaps you’ve driven one before, or maybe you even own one.

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:56.103
They are small, Italian scooters.

00:01:56.473 --> 00:02:00.653
Like mini motorbikes, but that you can sit on a

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.693
little bit like a chair, with your legs in the front.

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:10.173
If you think of Vespa, you probably think of people whizzing around the

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:15.933
streets of Rome, well-dressed men and women going along narrow streets.

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:22.993
It’s a brand and a name that will be forever associated with Italy, and

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:30.143
indeed the British newspaper The Times once described Vespa as “a completely

00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:34.923
Italian product, such as we have not seen since the Roman chariot”

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:40.873
To understand where Vespa comes from, we need to go all the way

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:45.923
back to the end of the 19th century, to Genoa, in northern Italy.

00:02:47.273 --> 00:02:54.133
In 1884 there was a factory built by a 22 year old man called Rinaldo Piaggio.

00:02:55.153 --> 00:03:01.043
It initially fitted out luxury ships, and by the start of the twentieth

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:06.753
century it was also making railway carriages, vans, and engines.

00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:14.243
In 1914 the First World War arrived, so there was evidently less

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:19.773
demand for luxury ship fittings and railways carriages, so the factory

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:25.303
switched to manufacturing aircraft, aeroplanes, for the war effort.

00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:32.593
When the war was over, Piaggio had become a specialist in the manufacture of aeroplanes

00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:40.223
and parts for planes, so it continued to do this, building new factories in Tuscany.

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:46.323
In 1938, Rinaldo Piaggio, the Piaggio who had founded the

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:51.593
company, died, leaving it to his two sons, Enrico and Armando.

00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:58.303
When World War II started, these Piaggio factories were prime targets for

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:03.663
Allied bombers - they were producing planes and parts for planes that would

00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:08.863
be used in the war effort, and the factories were continually attacked.

00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:17.023
And on August 31st 1943, they were bombed to smithereens, they were completely destroyed.

00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:25.573
This was only 9 days before the Italian surrender, on September the 8th of 1943.

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:31.153
With World War II in Italy finally over, it was time to

00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:36.053
rebuild, and the Piaggio brothers didn’t waste much time at all.

00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:40.723
Enrico, who had been given the task of rebuilding

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:44.673
the destroyed factories, asked the Allies for help.

00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:51.533
Italy, like much of continental Europe, was in terrible condition at the end of the

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:57.763
Second World War, and Enrico Piaggio had no money to rebuild his destroyed factories.

00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:06.113
Whatsmore, a lot of the machinery from his factories had been removed and taken to Germany.

00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:12.593
The Allies helped bring it back, and work was able to start on the Piaggio factory.

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:16.693
But Enrico Piaggio had an idea.

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:25.203
He foresaw a future in which there was demand for a convenient, simple, and affordable

00:05:25.293 --> 00:05:31.063
mode of personal transportation for the masses, and decided that he would build it.

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:41.023
He enlisted the help of one of his engineers, Renzo Spolti, in 1944 to design this dream scooter.

00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:48.483
They nicknamed it Paperino, which is the word for Donald Duck, or

00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:50.503
duckling, or little duck,

00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:51.373
in Italian.

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:59.983
By 1945 Spolti had a prototype ready, but when he showed it to Enrico

00:06:00.013 --> 00:06:04.841
Piaggio he wasn’t blown away, he didn’t think it was that great.

00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:10.751
From the front it looked quite similar to the Vespa that you would

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:16.501
recognise today, but it had its engine between the front and back

00:06:16.531 --> 00:06:22.041
wheels, so you sat with your legs on either side, a bit like a motorbike.

00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:30.561
This wasn’t the home run design that Piaggio was hoping for, so he changed engineers,

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:37.101
enlisting an aeronautical engineer, a man called Corradino D’Ascanio, to have a go.

00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.341
D’Ascanio was what we would today call a first principles thinker.

00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:50.511
Instead of just designing something because that was the way it had always been done, he approached

00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:56.161
everything from the point of view of ‘what would the most sensible way of doing this be’?

00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:02.961
He wanted the driver to be able to sit comfortably, but with the previous design

00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:08.221
there was the engine between the driver’s legs, like it is on a motorbike.

00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:16.111
D'Ascanio’s genius move was to place the engine on the back of the scooter, to the right of the

00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:22.731
rear wheel, and meant that he could create a space for luggage to the left of the rear wheel.

00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:29.851
And crucially, moving the engine out from between the two wheels meant that the

00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:36.201
driver could sit comfortably, more as if they were sitting on a chair than on a horse.

00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:43.061
This wasn’t only more comfy, but meant that women who were wearing skirts, which

00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.891
most women were, they could also ride the scooter without being uncomfortable.

00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:54.411
The name for D'Ascanio’s invention, legend has it, comes from when

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:59.281
he first presented it to his boss, Enrico Piaggio - he exclaimed

00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:04.391
‘Sembra una vespa!’, which means ‘it looks like a wasp’ in Italian.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:09.561
And thus, the invention immediately had a name.

00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:15.461
Looking at a Vespa, there are certainly similarities with wasps.

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:20.941
The Vespa has two fat parts of its body, joined in the middle

00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:25.771
by a thin part, and the mirrors look like a wasp’s antennae.

00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:33.971
This isn’t an episode for petrol heads, for car and motorbike lovers, but there are some

00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:38.785
important design elements in the Vespa that made it so successful, and are worth pointing out.

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:48.058
Firstly, you could sit comfortably, enabled by the fact that the engine was gone from the middle.

00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:53.516
This also meant that there wasn't any chain required to go from

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:57.296
the motor to the wheel; the motor was attached to the wheel.

00:08:57.798 --> 00:09:02.428
So unlike with motorbikes you wouldn’t get oil all over your legs.

00:09:03.538 --> 00:09:08.598
And secondly, there was this big mudguard at the front, a big

00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:14.468
shield, which protected your legs from splashes, mud and so on.

00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:21.138
Thirdly, the shaft for changing gears was on the handlebars, where

00:09:21.138 --> 00:09:26.018
your hands were, so you didn’t have to reach down to change gears.

00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:32.058
And finally, the wheels were put on an arm more similar to an

00:09:32.148 --> 00:09:37.578
aeroplane than a motorbike, which made changing the tyres easier.

00:09:38.688 --> 00:09:45.788
D'Ascanio had created something that was, in many ways, a scooter inspired by a plane.

00:09:46.888 --> 00:09:52.298
It was comfy, it was easy to ride, anyone could do it, men and

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:56.498
women, no matter what they were wearing, and you didn’t get dirty.

00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:03.218
The Vespa made its debut on the front cover of the popular Italian magazine

00:10:03.508 --> 00:10:11.548
La Moto, in April 1946, and in the same month Piaggio filed a patent for it.

00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:15.798
Piaggio didn’t wait for the public’s reaction, and

00:10:16.118 --> 00:10:20.248
he ordered for 2,000 units to be built immediately.

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:27.358
Although there were some initial sceptics, these scooters flew off the shelf.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:37.928
In the first year 2,500 were produced and sold, then the next year 10,000, 20,00 by

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:45.348
the end of the following year, and by 1956 Vespa had produced a million scooters.

00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:53.048
It had also inspired copycats from around the world, with similar designs of scooters

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:59.698
being produced in Germany, Japan, Britain, and of course by other companies in Italy.

00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:06.798
You’ve probably heard of some of these makes and companies - Lambretta and the Fuji rabbit.

00:11:07.788 --> 00:11:13.048
But none of them ever got anywhere close to the popularity of the Vespa.

00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:15.828
So why was that?

00:11:17.088 --> 00:11:23.498
A large part of it can be put down to the relationship between the Vespa and Hollywood.

00:11:24.808 --> 00:11:30.368
Piaggio made sure that Vespa was associated with models and high fashion,

00:11:30.718 --> 00:11:36.638
often appearing in photoshoots, and being an aspirational urban object.

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:44.238
In 1953 a film called Roman Holiday was released, which had Gregory

00:11:44.248 --> 00:11:50.098
Peck and the cult actress Audrey Hepburn riding through Rome on a Vespa.

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:58.408
This really put it on the world stage, and its popularity across the globe continued to grow.

00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:03.948
Piaggio started something called Vespa Clubs, which were clubs for

00:12:04.128 --> 00:12:10.518
Vespa owners, which had over 50,000 members, all passionate Vespa fans.

00:12:11.668 --> 00:12:18.488
The Vespa was more than a way of getting from A to B, it was an aspirational

00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:24.208
symbol of freedom, a tool to allow you to live your life in the way you wanted,

00:12:24.548 --> 00:12:29.988
allowing you to go where you wanted, when you wanted, at any time you wanted.

00:12:31.088 --> 00:12:37.178
And still now it is synonymous with Italy, Italian chic, and stylish living.

00:12:38.248 --> 00:12:43.408
It would take too long to list the celebrities who have either been filmed or

00:12:43.408 --> 00:12:49.418
photographed on a Vespa, but it’s everyone from Audrey Hepburn of course, through

00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:55.768
to Antonio Banderas, Joan Collins, Gérard Depardieu, Charlton Heston, and Sting.

00:12:56.498 --> 00:13:01.748
And perhaps most famously, Anita Ekberg in the cult film La Dolce Vita.

00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:08.768
With a brand that was so synonymous with cool, Vespa seemed unstoppable.

00:13:09.858 --> 00:13:15.648
It also developed some strange, or at least, unexpected fans.

00:13:16.618 --> 00:13:24.808
In the UK in the 1960s there were two, opposing subcultures, the Mods and the Rockers.

00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:31.778
These two subcultures were very different, they dressed differently, they listened

00:13:31.828 --> 00:13:37.248
to different music, and importantly, they drove different kinds of motorbikes.

00:13:37.838 --> 00:13:45.258
The Rockers drove big motorbikes, and the Mods adopted the Vespa as their motorbike of choice.

00:13:46.378 --> 00:13:50.978
The Mods were more stylish, more appearance-conscious, and they

00:13:50.978 --> 00:13:54.938
would customise their Vespas with extra mirrors and lights.

00:13:56.198 --> 00:14:00.608
Indeed, the UK is still Vespa's second largest market.

00:14:01.218 --> 00:14:03.608
Italy, naturally, is still number one.

00:14:04.828 --> 00:14:11.378
And Piaggio, the company that makes Vespa, has gone on to produce lots of different

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:17.778
kinds of Vespa, but the general principle, and the general style, hasn’t changed

00:14:17.778 --> 00:14:23.548
dramatically from the one D’Ascanio presented to Enrico Piaggio back in 1945.

00:14:24.568 --> 00:14:28.148
If you’ve been to Italy, especially in the south of Italy,

00:14:28.418 --> 00:14:31.698
you will know that Vespas are still incredibly popular.

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:39.888
You only need to be 14 years old in Italy to ride a 50cc Vespa, and many Italian

00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:44.778
teenagers are anxious to turn 14 so that they can get their first scooter.

00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:49.848
There is even a popular Italian pop song with lyrics

00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:53.508
all about how amazing riding around on a Vespa is.

00:14:54.218 --> 00:15:01.658
The word Vespa is now far more commonly associated with Vespa the scooter than Vespa

00:15:01.838 --> 00:15:08.718
the word for wasp, and Vespa has become for many a term that just means ‘scooter’.

00:15:10.028 --> 00:15:16.868
People have set all sorts of weird and wonderful records in Vespas too.

00:15:16.878 --> 00:15:21.448
In 1952 a Frenchman built an amphibious Vespa and crossed

00:15:21.608 --> 00:15:25.138
the English Channel, the water between the UK and France.

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:32.148
An Italian student got to the Arctic Circle on his Vespa, an Argentine crossed

00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:38.378
the Andes, and people are forever going on hugely ambitious adventures on

00:15:38.558 --> 00:15:43.938
this little scooter that was only ever really designed for short, urban trips.

00:15:45.188 --> 00:15:52.908
Like many Italian manufacturers, Piaggio has had its share of problems with bad investments and poor

00:15:52.908 --> 00:16:00.748
productivity, and almost went bankrupt in 2003, before being saved by a wealthy Italian businessman.

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:07.758
But it survived, it has been going from strength to strength, and no doubt millions of

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:13.848
people will enjoy riding their little wasps, their little Vespas, for many years to come.

00:16:16.178 --> 00:16:21.008
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the history of Vespa.

00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:24.668
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:16:25.038 --> 00:16:29.868
and that this has inspired you to rent one if and when you visit Italy.

00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:34.958
At least now you will know a little bit more about this iconic little scooter.

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:41.842
I want to do just a quick shout-out in this episode - it was a request from

00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:47.332
an amazing Spanish/Italian member of Leonardo English, a lady named Silvana.

00:16:47.692 --> 00:16:51.122
So, Silvana, thank you for this suggestion, I hope you enjoyed it.

00:16:51.942 --> 00:16:56.382
And as a final reminder, if you are looking to improve your English in a more interesting

00:16:56.382 --> 00:17:02.412
way, to join a community of curious minds from all over the world to unlock the transcripts,

00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:08.592
the subtitles and key vocabulary, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:10.182 --> 00:17:14.722
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English

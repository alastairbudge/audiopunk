Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:16.621
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:21.001
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.431
I'm Alastair Budge and today, if you are listening to this

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.331
episode on the day it’s released, is the 1st of January.

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.711
So, happy new year, I hope today is going to be a great day

00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:38.141
for you, and that 2021 will be a fantastic year for you too.

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:46.911
To kick off 2021 we are going to tell the story of Vespa, the iconic Italian scooter.

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:54.081
It’s a pretty amazing story, and takes us from World War I right through to

00:00:54.091 --> 00:01:00.501
today, involving Hollywood, British music, and some fantastic Italian engineering.

00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:05.431
Before we get right into that though, I just wanted to tell

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.821
you about something else I'm really, really excited about.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.731
Leonardo English has teamed up with an absolutely awesome English teacher

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:20.696
called Amy, from Vancouver, and she has kindly agreed to give a one

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:26.096
hour private lesson to anyone who becomes a Learner member for the year.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:34.076
If you are thinking that 2021 will be the year that you really improve your English and you are

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:40.706
ready to do it with podcasts, transcripts, subtitles, and key vocabulary, then you are in luck.

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:46.631
Until January the 31st, if you join as an annual Learner member, you

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:50.981
will get a one hour private lesson with Amy where she will assess

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:56.231
your level, help you define your goals and set you up for success.

00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:01.781
Just one word of warning though, because Amy is in super high

00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:05.891
demand we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:08.726
I guess they will fill up pretty fast.

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:13.496
So if that is of interest and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:17.846
wouldn't be, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:21.046
OK then, Vespa.

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:24.806
Now, you probably know what a Vespa is.

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:29.676
Perhaps you’ve driven one before, or maybe you even own one.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.166
They are small, Italian scooters.

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:37.716
Like mini motorbikes, but that you can sit on a

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:40.756
little bit like a chair, with your legs in the front.

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:47.236
If you think of Vespa, you probably think of people whizzing around the

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:52.996
streets of Rome, well-dressed men and women going along narrow streets.

00:02:54.136 --> 00:03:00.056
It’s a brand and a name that will be forever associated with Italy, and

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:07.206
indeed the British newspaper The Times once described Vespa as “a completely

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:11.986
Italian product, such as we have not seen since the Roman chariot”

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:17.936
To understand where Vespa comes from, we need to go all the way

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:22.986
back to the end of the 19th century, to Genoa, in northern Italy.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:31.196
In 1884 there was a factory built by a 22 year old man called Rinaldo Piaggio.

00:03:32.216 --> 00:03:38.106
It initially fitted out luxury ships, and by the start of the twentieth

00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:43.816
century it was also making railway carriages, vans, and engines.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:51.306
In 1914 the First World War arrived, so there was evidently less

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:56.836
demand for luxury ship fittings and railways carriages, so the factory

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:02.366
switched to manufacturing aircraft, aeroplanes, for the war effort.

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:09.656
When the war was over, Piaggio had become a specialist in the manufacture of aeroplanes

00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:17.286
and parts for planes, so it continued to do this, building new factories in Tuscany.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:23.386
In 1938, Rinaldo Piaggio, the Piaggio who had founded the

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:28.656
company, died, leaving it to his two sons, Enrico and Armando.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:35.366
When World War II started, these Piaggio factories were prime targets for

00:04:35.406 --> 00:04:40.726
Allied bombers - they were producing planes and parts for planes that would

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:45.926
be used in the war effort, and the factories were continually attacked.

00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:54.086
And on August 31st 1943, they were bombed to smithereens, they were completely destroyed.

00:04:55.476 --> 00:05:02.636
This was only 9 days before the Italian surrender, on September the 8th of 1943.

00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:08.216
With World War II in Italy finally over, it was time to

00:05:08.506 --> 00:05:13.116
rebuild, and the Piaggio brothers didn’t waste much time at all.

00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:17.786
Enrico, who had been given the task of rebuilding

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:21.736
the destroyed factories, asked the Allies for help.

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:28.596
Italy, like much of continental Europe, was in terrible condition at the end of the

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:34.826
Second World War, and Enrico Piaggio had no money to rebuild his destroyed factories.

00:05:35.956 --> 00:05:43.176
Whatsmore, a lot of the machinery from his factories had been removed and taken to Germany.

00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:49.656
The Allies helped bring it back, and work was able to start on the Piaggio factory.

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:53.756
But Enrico Piaggio had an idea.

00:05:54.956 --> 00:06:02.266
He foresaw a future in which there was demand for a convenient, simple, and affordable

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:08.126
mode of personal transportation for the masses, and decided that he would build it.

00:06:09.376 --> 00:06:18.086
He enlisted the help of one of his engineers, Renzo Spolti, in 1944 to design this dream scooter.

00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:25.546
They nicknamed it Paperino, which is the word for Donald Duck, or

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:27.566
duckling, or little duck,

00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:28.436
in Italian.

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:37.046
By 1945 Spolti had a prototype ready, but when he showed it to Enrico

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:41.903
Piaggio he wasn’t blown away, he didn’t think it was that great.

00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:47.813
From the front it looked quite similar to the Vespa that you would

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:53.563
recognise today, but it had its engine between the front and back

00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:59.103
wheels, so you sat with your legs on either side, a bit like a motorbike.

00:07:00.423 --> 00:07:07.623
This wasn’t the home run design that Piaggio was hoping for, so he changed engineers,

00:07:07.953 --> 00:07:14.163
enlisting an aeronautical engineer, a man called Corradino D’Ascanio, to have a go.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:19.403
D’Ascanio was what we would today call a first principles thinker.

00:07:20.663 --> 00:07:27.573
Instead of just designing something because that was the way it had always been done, he approached

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:33.223
everything from the point of view of ‘what would the most sensible way of doing this be’?

00:07:34.613 --> 00:07:40.023
He wanted the driver to be able to sit comfortably, but with the previous design

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:45.283
there was the engine between the driver’s legs, like it is on a motorbike.

00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:53.173
D'Ascanio’s genius move was to place the engine on the back of the scooter, to the right of the

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:59.793
rear wheel, and meant that he could create a space for luggage to the left of the rear wheel.

00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:06.913
And crucially, moving the engine out from between the two wheels meant that the

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:13.263
driver could sit comfortably, more as if they were sitting on a chair than on a horse.

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:20.123
This wasn’t only more comfy, but meant that women who were wearing skirts, which

00:08:20.283 --> 00:08:24.953
most women were, they could also ride the scooter without being uncomfortable.

00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:31.473
The name for D'Ascanio’s invention, legend has it, comes from when

00:08:31.473 --> 00:08:36.343
he first presented it to his boss, Enrico Piaggio - he exclaimed

00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:41.453
‘Sembra una vespa!’, which means ‘it looks like a wasp’ in Italian.

00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:46.623
And thus, the invention immediately had a name.

00:08:47.743 --> 00:08:52.523
Looking at a Vespa, there are certainly similarities with wasps.

00:08:52.913 --> 00:08:58.003
The Vespa has two fat parts of its body, joined in the middle

00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:02.833
by a thin part, and the mirrors look like a wasp’s antennae.

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:11.033
This isn’t an episode for petrol heads, for car and motorbike lovers, but there are some

00:09:11.053 --> 00:09:15.847
important design elements in the Vespa that made it so successful, and are worth pointing out.

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:25.120
Firstly, you could sit comfortably, enabled by the fact that the engine was gone from the middle.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:30.579
This also meant that there wasn't any chain required to go from

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:34.359
the motor to the wheel; the motor was attached to the wheel.

00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:39.491
So unlike with motorbikes you wouldn’t get oil all over your legs.

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:45.661
And secondly, there was this big mudguard at the front, a big

00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:51.531
shield, which protected your legs from splashes, mud and so on.

00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:58.201
Thirdly, the shaft for changing gears was on the handlebars, where

00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:03.081
your hands were, so you didn’t have to reach down to change gears.

00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:09.121
And finally, the wheels were put on an arm more similar to an

00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:14.641
aeroplane than a motorbike, which made changing the tyres easier.

00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:22.851
D'Ascanio had created something that was, in many ways, a scooter inspired by a plane.

00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:29.361
It was comfy, it was easy to ride, anyone could do it, men and

00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:33.561
women, no matter what they were wearing, and you didn’t get dirty.

00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:40.281
The Vespa made its debut on the front cover of the popular Italian magazine

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:48.611
La Moto, in April 1946, and in the same month Piaggio filed a patent for it.

00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:52.861
Piaggio didn’t wait for the public’s reaction, and

00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:57.311
he ordered for 2,000 units to be built immediately.

00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:04.421
Although there were some initial sceptics, these scooters flew off the shelf.

00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:14.991
In the first year 2,500 were produced and sold, then the next year 10,000, 20,00 by

00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:22.411
the end of the following year, and by 1956 Vespa had produced a million scooters.

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:30.111
It had also inspired copycats from around the world, with similar designs of scooters

00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:36.761
being produced in Germany, Japan, Britain, and of course by other companies in Italy.

00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:43.861
You’ve probably heard of some of these makes and companies - Lambretta and the Fuji rabbit.

00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:50.111
But none of them ever got anywhere close to the popularity of the Vespa.

00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:52.891
So why was that?

00:11:54.151 --> 00:12:00.561
A large part of it can be put down to the relationship between the Vespa and Hollywood.

00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:07.431
Piaggio made sure that Vespa was associated with models and high fashion,

00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:13.701
often appearing in photoshoots, and being an aspirational urban object.

00:12:15.051 --> 00:12:21.301
In 1953 a film called Roman Holiday was released, which had Gregory

00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:27.161
Peck and the cult actress Audrey Hepburn riding through Rome on a Vespa.

00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:35.471
This really put it on the world stage, and its popularity across the globe continued to grow.

00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:41.011
Piaggio started something called Vespa Clubs, which were clubs for

00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:47.581
Vespa owners, which had over 50,000 members, all passionate Vespa fans.

00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:55.551
The Vespa was more than a way of getting from A to B, it was an aspirational

00:12:55.561 --> 00:13:01.271
symbol of freedom, a tool to allow you to live your life in the way you wanted,

00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:07.051
allowing you to go where you wanted, when you wanted, at any time you wanted.

00:13:08.151 --> 00:13:14.241
And still now it is synonymous with Italy, Italian chic, and stylish living.

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:20.471
It would take too long to list the celebrities who have either been filmed or

00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:26.481
photographed on a Vespa, but it’s everyone from Audrey Hepburn of course, through

00:13:26.481 --> 00:13:32.831
to Antonio Banderas, Joan Collins, Gérard Depardieu, Charlton Heston, and Sting.

00:13:33.561 --> 00:13:38.811
And perhaps most famously, Anita Ekberg in the cult film La Dolce Vita.

00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:45.831
With a brand that was so synonymous with cool, Vespa seemed unstoppable.

00:13:46.921 --> 00:13:52.711
It also developed some strange, or at least, unexpected fans.

00:13:53.681 --> 00:14:01.871
In the UK in the 1960s there were two, opposing subcultures, the Mods and the Rockers.

00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:08.841
These two subcultures were very different, they dressed differently, they listened

00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:14.311
to different music, and importantly, they drove different kinds of motorbikes.

00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:22.321
The Rockers drove big motorbikes, and the Mods adopted the Vespa as their motorbike of choice.

00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:28.041
The Mods were more stylish, more appearance-conscious, and they

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:32.001
would customise their Vespas with extra mirrors and lights.

00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:37.671
Indeed, the UK is still Vespa's second largest market.

00:14:38.281 --> 00:14:40.671
Italy, naturally, is still number one.

00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:48.441
And Piaggio, the company that makes Vespa, has gone on to produce lots of different

00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:54.841
kinds of Vespa, but the general principle, and the general style, hasn’t changed

00:14:54.841 --> 00:15:00.611
dramatically from the one D’Ascanio presented to Enrico Piaggio back in 1945.

00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:05.211
If you’ve been to Italy, especially in the south of Italy,

00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:08.761
you will know that Vespas are still incredibly popular.

00:15:10.051 --> 00:15:16.951
You only need to be 14 years old in Italy to ride a 50cc Vespa, and many Italian

00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:21.841
teenagers are anxious to turn 14 so that they can get their first scooter.

00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:26.911
There is even a popular Italian pop song with lyrics

00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:30.571
all about how amazing riding around on a Vespa is.

00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:38.721
The word Vespa is now far more commonly associated with Vespa the scooter than Vespa

00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:45.781
the word for wasp, and Vespa has become for many a term that just means ‘scooter’.

00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:53.931
People have set all sorts of weird and wonderful records in Vespas too.

00:15:53.941 --> 00:15:58.511
In 1952 a Frenchman built an amphibious Vespa and crossed

00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:02.201
the English Channel, the water between the UK and France.

00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:09.211
An Italian student got to the Arctic Circle on his Vespa, an Argentine crossed

00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:15.441
the Andes, and people are forever going on hugely ambitious adventures on

00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:21.001
this little scooter that was only ever really designed for short, urban trips.

00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:29.971
Like many Italian manufacturers, Piaggio has had its share of problems with bad investments and poor

00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:37.811
productivity, and almost went bankrupt in 2003, before being saved by a wealthy Italian businessman.

00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:44.821
But it survived, it has been going from strength to strength, and no doubt millions of

00:16:44.831 --> 00:16:50.911
people will enjoy riding their little wasps, their little Vespas, for many years to come.

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:58.071
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the history of Vespa.

00:16:58.681 --> 00:17:01.731
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:06.931
and that this has inspired you to rent one if and when you visit Italy.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:12.021
At least now you will know a little bit more about this iconic little scooter.

00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:18.904
I want to do just a quick shout-out in this episode - it was a request from

00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:24.394
an amazing Spanish/Italian member of Leonardo English, a lady named Silvana.

00:17:24.754 --> 00:17:28.184
So, Silvana, thanks for this suggestion, I hope you enjoyed it.

00:17:29.004 --> 00:17:35.434
And if you would like to be more like Silvana, and you are ready to make 2021 the year you really

00:17:35.444 --> 00:17:40.634
improve your English, then you should also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:45.094
Not only does this mean you'll get immediate access to all of our bonus

00:17:45.094 --> 00:17:49.084
episodes and all of the fantastic learning materials that come with them.

00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:55.294
But I've managed to persuade the amazing Amy to give a one hour English strategy

00:17:55.294 --> 00:18:00.214
lesson to anyone who becomes an annual Learner member before the end of January.

00:18:01.024 --> 00:18:04.534
As I said at the start, Amy is in super high demand, so

00:18:04.654 --> 00:18:07.714
we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:10.264
I guess these will all go quite quickly.

00:18:10.414 --> 00:18:14.614
So if this is of interest and it certainly would be, if I

00:18:14.614 --> 00:18:18.294
were you, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:24.389
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English

00:18:25.369 --> 00:18:30.459
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

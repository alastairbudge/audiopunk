Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:16.447
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:21.057
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:26.247
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the time in

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:31.867
the 17th and 18th centuries where young, aristocratic British men used to

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:37.537
go on long tours through Europe, taking in art, culture, and all sorts of

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:42.407
other pleasures that were either unavailable, or not allowed, back at home.

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.959
The name of this tradition was The Grand Tour.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:52.447
It is a fascinating topic, and we’ll learn about where exactly these men went, and

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:58.287
why, how they travelled, what they did, and what the goal was for such an adventure.

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:04.037
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:09.057

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:49.097
So,I would love for you to join me if that is of interest, - and I can't see

00:01:49.097 --> 00:01:53.897
a reason why it wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:55.787 --> 00:01:57.517
So, The Grand Tour.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:03.167
It’s a particularly interesting subject to us today for two reasons.

00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:09.557
Firstly, as for many of us, especially in Europe, in normal times

00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:14.615
international travel has changed from a luxury to a normality.

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:22.055
Cheap flights, smartphones, things like Airbnb mean that travelling from one country to another

00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:28.155
is something that can be done relatively cheaply, easily, and in a short period of time.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:31.625
The Grand Tour was the complete opposite.

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:37.355
And secondly, for much of the last year, and for who knows how much

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:41.945
longer, international travel has been something that has been out of reach

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:45.875
for most of us, it is something that we simply haven’t been able to do.

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:53.015
So for those of you longing for foreign trips, perhaps this episode will give you some inspiration,

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:58.515
and make you think a little bit more about the kind of trips that you might like to take.

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:01.045
Let’s start with some dates.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:10.133
The expression “Grand Tour” was coined – or used for the first time – in 1670 by an Englishman

00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:16.243
called Richard Lassels, who wrote one of the early guidebooks, ‘The Voyage of Italy’.

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:22.043
Lassels was describing a phenomenon which was becoming increasingly common in

00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:27.683
Britain of the 17th century and continued right through to the start of railways

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:33.203
in the 1840s, but with a long, unexpected break brought about by the French

00:03:33.203 --> 00:03:40.050
Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars [so, the period from 1789–1815].

00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:46.923
This phenomenon, of The Grand Tour, was one of a large, extended cultural

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:52.243
trip that became an expectation initially for the very wealthiest

00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:56.823
of British aristocrats, for the people right at the top of society.

00:03:57.753 --> 00:04:04.333
Some Swedish and Germans took part as well, and towards the final stages of the Grand Tour,

00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:11.203
some wealthy Americans also participated, but in general it was very much a British affair.

00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:15.723
Young gentlemen, and it was mainly men, not women,

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:19.513
would set off from London on this mighty adventure.

00:04:20.273 --> 00:04:25.799
They would travel by horse and carriage, with a large group of servants behind them.

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:31.609
The routes would vary, but they would typically go south to Paris,

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:35.729
some would stop off in The Netherlands, some to Switzerland and

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.989
Germany, and the more adventurous might go to Spain, Greece, or Turkey.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:48.179
But the most important destination, and the place they could not miss, was Italy.

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.679
Why, you might ask?

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:55.020
Well, the reasons were similar, but slightly different

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.630
to the reasons that most modern tourists go to Italy.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.720
The education of the British upper classes had always been based on a rigorous

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.380
study of Latin and Greek, with an accompanying knowledge of classical antiquity.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.950
It was through a knowledge of the classics that an aristocratic British man was expected

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.740
to understand the world, and going to Italy was a way of experiencing it all firsthand.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.140
Most young men of the aristocratic or upper-class would not be expected

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.060
to go to university – or if so, it was mainly for reasons that were

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.100
more to do with pleasure and social connections, rather than study.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.430
However, especially because of the influence of Enlightenment writers such as John Locke, who

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:54.150
emphasised the importance of learning through experience, the attraction of travelling abroad grew;

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:01.930
how much better, they thought, to see these classical wonders and other beautiful things firsthand.

00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:08.214
There’s a quotation from the famous Dr Samuel Johnson [who was the author

00:06:08.344 --> 00:06:12.234
of the most famous English Dictionary] that sums it up quite nicely.

00:06:13.034 --> 00:06:15.114
He wrote, in 1776:

00:06:15.724 --> 00:06:21.214
“A man who has not been in Italy, is always conscious of an inferiority,

00:06:21.504 --> 00:06:25.644
from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see.”

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:32.834
So, there was this expectation that a man should see Italy, he should go and witness the great

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:38.784
works of art, the buildings, so that he could understand ancient Rome, and therefore, the world.

00:06:39.804 --> 00:06:44.904
To do this, he needed to go there, of course, but most of these young travellers

00:06:44.994 --> 00:06:50.294
would also be accompanied by a private tutor, called a Cicerone, a guide

00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:54.894
who would educate these young men and explain these great works to them.

00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:58.514
These guides would accompany the young men for their

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:02.436
whole trip, which would typically take about 2 years.

00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:06.806
We’re not talking about having a private guide for a couple of hours in a

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:12.236
museum - we’re talking about a full, private tutor for two entire years.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.946
As well as visiting these great sights, these young men would

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:22.126
often be expected to buy certain things to take home, as souvenirs.

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:28.996
But, again, we're not talking about mini replicas of the Colosseum or postcards, they

00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:35.696
would often buy large marble statues, Renaissance paintings, and real Roman antiquities.

00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:41.896
Much like some people nowadays might collect fridge magnets, or might buy

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:46.886
a t-shirt from every city they travel to, these young men might buy full

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:52.176
statues and works of art to take back home and display in their large houses.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:57.696
One of the early Grand Tourists, a man called Thomas Howard,

00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:03.076
otherwise known as the 14th Earl of Arundel, set off in 1613.

00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:10.246
By the time that he died in 1646 he had 700 paintings that he had collected

00:08:10.336 --> 00:08:15.016
during his travels, and had earned the nickname “The Collector Earl”.

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:22.186
Since there were few museums anywhere in Europe before the close of the eighteenth century, Grand

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:29.046
Tourists often saw paintings and sculptures by gaining admission to private collections, and

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:36.061
many were eager to acquire examples of Greco-Roman and Italian art for their own collections.

00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:41.871
There was already a well organised system in the major Grand Tour city

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.791
destinations of Rome and Venice that ensured that these wealthy visitors

00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:51.121
could buy the fine paintings of the places that they had visited.

00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:58.331
These oil paintings were even given a name in Italian – “vedute” or what they’d seen;

00:08:58.691 --> 00:09:04.841
the famous Venetian painter Canaletto specialised in such city view oil paintings.

00:09:05.771 --> 00:09:09.591
In addition they could have grandiose paintings taken of

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:13.891
themselves, sometimes standing by notable works of art.

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:21.191
Although the costs involved are very different, the motivation would have been similar

00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:27.241
to anyone today who takes a picture of themselves on holiday and shares it on Instagram.

00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:33.121
It’s basically the 17th or 18th century equivalent of taking a selfie

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:37.191
and putting it on social media, albeit a much more expensive one.

00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:43.571
When they returned to Britain, of course these young Grand Tourists would want to put their

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:50.561
paintings and statues on display, for everyone to see, and you can trace the influence

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:56.771
that various Italian styles have had on British architecture - it is due in a large

00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:02.001
part to these Grand Tourists returning with objects they had bought on their travels.

00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:08.141
Now, if this all sounds incredibly sophisticated, and you are thinking that it’s

00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:13.941
amazing that these young men were so interested in art and culture, when young people

00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:18.991
today aren’t travelling for the same cultural reasons, there is another aspect to

00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:24.501
The Grand Tour that was a big attraction, and expectation, for these young men.

00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:29.791
These young men were very rich, they had no responsibilities,

00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:33.981
and were very far away from home, and from anyone they knew.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:40.821
When they returned home, they would typically get married to another aristocratic young woman,

00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:48.321
and return to society life, so it does not take much imagination to think that many took their

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:54.911
time on the Grand Tour to experience pleasures that were not so readily available at home.

00:10:55.941 --> 00:11:02.632
Gambling, sex, and excessive drinking were expectations for these young men, and there are

00:11:02.682 --> 00:11:09.382
multiple reports of men striking up relationships with local women, and taking advantage

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:14.932
of the fact that they were so far away from home and nobody would know what they got up to.

00:11:15.962 --> 00:11:22.172
Of all the grand tourists, the most notorious pleasure-seeker, who acquired status

00:11:22.192 --> 00:11:28.249
and fame equivalent to the most outrageous of rock stars was the poet Lord Byron.

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:35.434
Not long after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, in 1815, he set off to travel in Italy

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:41.919
and in particular to live in Venice, where his multiple affairs, often with the wives

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:46.719
of prominent Venetian citizens, were written up in his letters which he sent home.

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:51.959
A footnote here has to do with the long-term influence of the

00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:55.969
classical world of Italy and Greece on the British imagination.

00:11:56.864 --> 00:12:03.939
Byron’s love of these countries and their civilisations, which was shared by fellow, radical poet,

00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:10.949
Percy Shelley, became influential, not only in the support that these two dashing poets gave to the

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:17.009
nationalist liberation movements of the first few decades of the 19th century, but the affection

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:22.579
and high standing in which the British upper classes held Greek civilisation in particular.

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:29.769
This is thought to have been a major factor behind the British support of Greek independence, which

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:37.193
was crucial in enabling Greece to break free from Ottoman rule and secure its independence in 1830.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:43.859
Now, you will be, I am sure, wondering about some of the practicalities of the whole business.

00:12:44.589 --> 00:12:47.669
How did they actually get from one city to another?

00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:49.009
Where did they stay?

00:12:49.729 --> 00:12:51.749
What did they do on a daily basis?

00:12:52.493 --> 00:12:54.113
How was tourism different?

00:12:55.173 --> 00:13:00.973
Although the Grand Tour was only possible for men with considerable wealth and leisure,

00:13:01.463 --> 00:13:07.093
considerable free time, the actual travelling itself would not have been comfortable.

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:12.583
To give you some indication of how long it would take to cover one stage

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:17.313
of the journey, the passage from London to Paris would take at least three

00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:22.463
days – now, you can do the same trip in just over two hours on the Eurostar.

00:13:23.233 --> 00:13:26.643
In general, a Grand Tourist could expect to cover a

00:13:26.653 --> 00:13:31.043
maximum of 20 miles each day, around 30 kilometers a day.

00:13:31.783 --> 00:13:37.543
Although, when in the major cities, the grand tourist would rent luxurious accommodation,

00:13:37.843 --> 00:13:42.933
he had to put up with whatever was available when in transit, when he was on the road.

00:13:43.773 --> 00:13:51.003
There are many accounts of fierce arguments about costs, as the hosts – the innkeepers or hoteliers

00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:57.203
would understandably be wanting to charge as much as possible, given the wealth of their guests.

00:13:57.963 --> 00:14:03.023
Perhaps the most dramatic stage in the journey was crossing the Alps: the

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:08.383
most luxurious way of doing this was to hire a sedan chair – a chair on

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:13.177
sticks - which was carried by at least four strong men, in which you would be

00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:18.957
carried via Mont Cenis, which is close to the well-known ski resort, Val d’Isère.

00:14:20.047 --> 00:14:21.817
Security was also an issue.

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:27.787
As you can imagine, given how easily identifiable these rich people were, they

00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:32.697
would be targeted by thieves and people seeking to trick them out of their money.

00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:39.701
As well as often hiring local guides and protectors, they tried to avoid carrying too

00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:45.691
much cash on them, but relied on what were called letters of credit, provided by their

00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:52.531
bank in London and enabling bankers in Rome or Venice to issue them with local currency.

00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:58.421
Having crossed the Alps and full of anticipation for Italy’s treasures,

00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:03.461
both animate and inanimate, they proceeded first to Turin or Milan.

00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:07.751
Tourists would aim for famous festivals such as the

00:15:07.751 --> 00:15:11.871
Carnival in Venice each early Spring or Holy Week in Rome.

00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:18.881
They would then make their way slowly south through Lucca, Florence, Siena and Rome.

00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:24.201
Naples became a popular destination after the discovery and

00:15:24.211 --> 00:15:29.988
excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii in 1738 and 1748.

00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:37.621
In the latter part of the 18th century, the tourists had the additional excitement of seeing

00:15:37.631 --> 00:15:44.081
the volcano at Mount Etna erupting, and they would return to Britain with samples of lava.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:50.001
A different attraction in the last two decades of the 18th century was

00:15:50.021 --> 00:15:55.531
provided by the lavish entertainment of the British ambassador in Naples,

00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:59.988
Sir William Hamilton, and his beautiful young wife, Lady Emma Hamilton.

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:05.468
She not only became the mistress of the naval commander and hero, Horatio

00:16:05.468 --> 00:16:10.598
Nelson, but sensationally lived with him and her diplomatic husband.

00:16:11.808 --> 00:16:18.088
Sometimes, the grand tourists were able to load their paintings and sculptures onto a convenient

00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:25.418
British sailing ship at Naples and return home by sea; more often than not they would return on

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:32.758
land, revisiting Rome before heading to Venice through cities such as Loreto, Ancona and Ravenna.

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:36.588
Tourists would leave Italy through Vicenza, Verona,

00:16:36.878 --> 00:16:40.978
Mantua, Bologna, Modena, Parma, Milan, and Turin.

00:16:41.528 --> 00:16:48.228
And then the return itinerary might also include Vienna, Dresden, Berlin and Flanders.

00:16:48.768 --> 00:16:53.808
The grand tour had many consequences for British life, and laid

00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:58.498
some of the groundwork for the kind of tourism that exists today.

00:16:59.548 --> 00:17:03.358
One consequence that is rarely mentioned happened because

00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:06.898
of the restrictions brought about by the Napoleonic Wars.

00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:13.168
Because the grand tourists were barred from the European continent, and the habit

00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:17.518
of touring had been established over the previous hundred years, aristocratic

00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:21.778
Brits had to visit their own country, they had to stay in Great Britain

00:17:22.668 --> 00:17:28.748
This coincided with the beginnings of the Romantic movement in poetry which celebrated

00:17:28.918 --> 00:17:34.878
the beauty of wild and mountainous places; therefore the British upper classes started

00:17:34.878 --> 00:17:40.388
visiting the Lake District in Northern England – a rugged wild and uncultivated

00:17:40.388 --> 00:17:45.768
place celebrated particularly in the inspiring poetry of William Wordsworth.

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:49.888
They also visited some of the wonders of the early

00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:53.428
Industrial Revolution – bridges and factories in particular.

00:17:54.398 --> 00:18:01.177
This boost to domestic tourism will have been a factor, along with the start of railways, in the

00:18:01.177 --> 00:18:08.767
beginnings of mass tourism, initially pioneered by a man called Thomas Cook whose railway tours of

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:15.650
Italy were amongst the first foreign holidays offered to groups of middle-class tourists in 1864.

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:21.647
The Grand Tour also had a profound influence on the development of British

00:18:21.687 --> 00:18:26.337
artistic taste, affecting everything from the rise of the great country

00:18:26.347 --> 00:18:31.577
house to such products as Wedgewood pottery with its classical designs.

00:18:32.137 --> 00:18:36.197
Neoclassical architecture, imported from Italy, affected not only

00:18:36.197 --> 00:18:39.516
domestic architecture in the UK but also, as the British Empire grew,

00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:39.692
the architecture of its far-off colonies, such as India and South Africa.

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:53.547
At a human level, these wealthy young men returned to the homes, sometimes carrying with them

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:59.687
unfortunate and debilitating diseases acquired as a result of their adventures; perhaps the

00:18:59.887 --> 00:19:05.707
sketchbooks and diaries that they had taken had received less attention than was ideal, but

00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:11.817
the civilising effect of contact with the great artefacts of the classical and Renaissance

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:17.687
world will, for many of them, have improved their emotional life – their sensibility, to

00:19:17.687 --> 00:19:22.907
use a word that was fashionable at the time for describing their character and feelings.

00:19:23.647 --> 00:19:27.457
And in terms of global influence, The Grand Tour was

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:31.207
an influential step on the path towards modern tourism.

00:19:32.017 --> 00:19:37.027
It was, in many ways, the complete opposite of modern tourism, where you can

00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:41.817
hop on a plane with just a rucksack and land in another country in a couple

00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:46.687
of hours, wander around the city, eat some nice food, and then return home

00:19:46.697 --> 00:19:50.977
the next day without really knowing anything about where you have just been.

00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:55.477
But there are, of course, many things that are exactly the same.

00:19:55.687 --> 00:19:59.437
The wish to experience new things, the desire to

00:19:59.437 --> 00:20:02.827
remember what you have seen, and the joy of adventure.

00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:09.647
Luckily, such joys are much more available to everyone than they were in the time of the Grand Tour,

00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:16.697
where only the very richest in society could participate, but this has of course come at a cost.

00:20:17.817 --> 00:20:23.507
Tourism is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions - most of which

00:20:23.507 --> 00:20:28.457
comes from flying - and many of the world’s most beautiful tourist destinations

00:20:28.717 --> 00:20:33.687
are flooded with so many tourists that the character of the city has been changed.

00:20:34.527 --> 00:20:41.837
Venice, one of the must-see destinations for the Grand Tourists, is a modern-day Disneyland, and

00:20:41.837 --> 00:20:48.197
although tourism does bring €2 billion a year to the city, it has forever changed its character.

00:20:49.297 --> 00:20:54.317
For cities such as Venice, Florence, and Rome, cities that were cherished

00:20:54.527 --> 00:21:00.267
by the grand tourists, the impact of COVID-19, and the huge drop in inbound

00:21:00.297 --> 00:21:05.567
tourism, has helped them remember what life was like before mass tourism.

00:21:06.457 --> 00:21:10.757
Of course, for many, especially those involved in the tourism industry,

00:21:11.067 --> 00:21:15.447
the effects have been devastating, but for others it has been a

00:21:15.447 --> 00:21:19.677
refreshing reminder of what their city is really like at its core.

00:21:20.577 --> 00:21:25.227
And for those of us who are tourists, perhaps not being able to travel

00:21:25.227 --> 00:21:30.757
internationally has made us more appreciative of the real luxury that cheap travel

00:21:30.777 --> 00:21:36.217
is, and has made us more appreciative of the beauties that exist nearer to home.

00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:42.377
When you think of these Grand Tourists, who would spend months at a time just to see the

00:21:42.417 --> 00:21:46.972
artistic wonders of ancient Rome for the first time, perhaps this will make all of us

00:21:47.027 --> 00:21:52.407
all the more appreciative and careful of the treasures that we are lucky enough to visit.

00:21:56.035 --> 00:22:00.646
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Grand Tour.

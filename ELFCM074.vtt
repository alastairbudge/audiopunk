Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:15.442
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:20.922
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:28.482
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about QAnon, the strange

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:34.932
conspiracy theory about a deep state that has gone from being a fringe, niche

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.942
idea, to having candidates for Congress, proclaiming that they believe in it.

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:45.512
It is a weird phenomenon, but it is rather scary to

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.992
see how it has managed to gain quite so many followers.

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:54.677
Before we get right into that though, let me just remind you that you

00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:59.267
can get all of the bonus episodes, plus subtitles, transcripts, and

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:03.717
key vocabulary, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:08.297
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:14.097
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:19.487
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:23.597
So if that is of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:27.687
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:30.717
OK then, QAnon.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:35.017
If you have heard of it, I wouldn’t be that surprised.

00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:40.767
It has been getting a lot more attention in recent years, and has not quite

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:46.817
gone mainstream, but it has gone from hiding in tiny corners of the internet

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:53.237
through to cable news, Trump rallies, and a powerful presence on social media.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:02:00.287
The story of QAnon starts in October 2017, when someone

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:03.637
calling themself ‘Q’ posted on the message board 4chan.

00:02:06.037 --> 00:02:12.827
The message was a little cryptic, but said that on October the 30th, in a few days'

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:18.997
time from the original message, Hillary Clinton would be arrested by US Marines.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.500
For years, there have been conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, and if you’ve listened

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.940
to our episode on conspiracy theories from a few months ago, you might remember PizzaGate.

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:39.835
The name PizzaGate makes it sound almost innocent, but it was quite the opposite.

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:47.070
There were rumours circling on far right message boards that a Washington DC

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.990
pizza restaurant was the centre of a child sex ring run by Hillary Clinton.

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:58.187
To me or you, these rumours might sound completely ridiculous,

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:02.557
but they didn’t to a man called Edgar Maddison Welch.

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:09.777
He drove 360 miles from his home in North Carolina to

00:03:09.777 --> 00:03:14.377
Washington DC, armed with a shotgun and an assault rifle.

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:17.797
He wanted to investigate this for himself.

00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:25.227
So he turned up, on a Sunday at this family pizza restaurant, armed to the teeth.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:33.787
He was expecting to open the door and find dozens of captured children in horrible conditions.

00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:39.037
Instead, he found families enjoying pizza, or at least, enjoying

00:03:39.037 --> 00:03:41.947
it until he arrived looking like he was going to kill everyone.

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:51.637
Q’s message, on October 28th of 2017, was a continuation of this original idea,

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:58.247
that there is a global elite, composed of people like Hilary Clinton, Barack Obama,

00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:05.217
and George Soros, that are enabled by the mainstream media, who are essentially

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:11.027
paedophiles and that there is really only one man who can stop them: Donald Trump.

00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:14.337
Now it might sound ridiculous.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:18.452
It might sound funny and it might be funny were it

00:04:18.452 --> 00:04:21.667
not actually genuinely believed by so many people.

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.077
So, to go back to the original prophecy from Q, on October

00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:32.637
28th of 2017, Q said that Hillary Clinton would be arrested.

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:35.967
In case you need a reminder, this didn’t happen.

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:42.897
Since then, this anonymous Q has continued to post on different message

00:04:42.897 --> 00:04:48.227
boards on various parts of the internet attracting a devoted following.

00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:56.262
Q is referred to by followers as he, so I'll also assume Q is a man.

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:02.712
Anyway, Q wants people to think that he is someone who has one of the highest

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:07.912
levels of security clearance in the United States, someone who knows what’s

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:13.912
really happening, and he is the only person who is prepared to tell the world.

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:23.272
Q has seen this huge, global conspiracy, and he is doing something to alert the common man.

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:28.252
But Q doesn’t always give precise instructions.

00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:35.752
There are a lot of riddles, a lot of clues, and a lot of confusing, ambiguous statements.

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:41.842
And of course, almost all of the time, his predictions don’t come true.

00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:46.025
Yet still, his following grows.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.035
Now, we aren’t going to spend that much time discussing the actual

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:55.965
conspiracy theories proposed by Q, but I'll give you a little summary.

00:05:57.135 --> 00:06:02.275
So, there’s this idea that there is a global paedophile ring led by Hillary Clinton,

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:08.195
that all world leaders know about, and that the mainstream media won’t talk about.

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:14.635
They believe that Donald Trump knows about it, and he is tirelessly fighting

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:19.985
to bring down the establishment, to bring down the deep state as they call it.

00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:27.677
Q’s followers look for clues in everything that Trump does, and they interpret

00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:34.097
things like Trump wearing a yellow tie to mean that the Coronavirus isn’t real, to

00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:41.697
there being a Q Clock, which is used by some QAnon fans to try to take some meaning

00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:47.637
from the exact times that either Q posts a message, or Donald Trump sends a tweet.

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:55.997
There are parts of the QAnon faction that believe that JFK, President Kennedy,

00:06:56.407 --> 00:07:03.567
actually faked his death, that he may even be Q himself, and that he will return to

00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:09.767
the world stage to be Donald Trump’s running mate for re-election in November 2020.

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:18.447
And, perhaps even harder to believe is that Trump is actually Q, and he is

00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:23.527
busy giving encrypted messages about national security to his followers.

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:29.367
The people who believe this do so because they look at his

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:33.927
tweets and see references to him admitting that he is Q.

00:07:35.207 --> 00:07:42.057
For example Trump tweeted “I am giving consideration to a quarantine’, then the next

00:07:42.057 --> 00:07:46.727
day he tweeted "I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen and the United Kingdom".

00:07:48.227 --> 00:07:54.497
The theory goes that if you cut out most of the words and letters, you can make the sentence.

00:07:54.747 --> 00:07:55.877
"I am Q".

00:07:56.757 --> 00:08:01.827
So with the tweet “I am giving consideration to a quarantine”, if you remove “giving

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:07.757
consideration to a”, and then all the letters after ‘q’ of ‘quarantine’, you get “I am Q”.

00:08:09.057 --> 00:08:15.067
Now, to you or me, I hope at least, these ideas might seem ridiculous.

00:08:15.827 --> 00:08:20.447
But to millions of people in America, they represent the truth.

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:26.442
There was a report by the Guardian newspaper that found that there were

00:08:26.677 --> 00:08:31.547
3 million members of QAnon Facebook groups, and that’s just Facebook.

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:35.677
The most popular QAnon Twitter accounts have hundreds

00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:39.027
of thousands of followers, as do the ones on YouTube.

00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:46.637
We aren’t going to get into a discussion here about the rights and wrongs of whether

00:08:46.637 --> 00:08:52.397
social media platforms have the responsibility to take down content based on conspiracy

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:59.817
theories, but what is undeniably true is that Facebook and YouTube have helped introduce

00:08:59.817 --> 00:09:06.237
people to ideas like QAnon who would probably never have encountered them without it.

00:09:07.737 --> 00:09:11.887
The way in which the algorithms of these platforms work is

00:09:11.887 --> 00:09:14.772
that they show you things that they think you would like.

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:19.652
And companies that make money from your attention, they

00:09:19.682 --> 00:09:22.622
want to keep you on their platform for as long as possible.

00:09:23.832 --> 00:09:28.762
But, this report by the Guardian found that you don’t need to join

00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:33.762
QAnon groups to be recommended QAnon groups by the Facebook algorithm.

00:09:34.322 --> 00:09:40.472
If the Facebook algorithm sees that your behaviour is similar to the behaviour of

00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:45.722
members of QAnon groups, then you can be suggested to join QAnon related groups.

00:09:46.342 --> 00:09:53.082
Facebook will introduce you, without you having shown any prior interest actually in QAnon.

00:09:54.582 --> 00:10:00.297
Similarly, with YouTube, that dangerous bar of ‘recommended videos’ that

00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:04.907
I’m sure we have all been occasionally caught up by will also show you QAnon

00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:10.436
videos if the algorithm thinks you might enjoy watching them, and that they

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:14.688
can generate advertising revenue from you sticking around to watch them.

00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:23.048
Now, whether this is right or wrong is a different question, but it certainly has meant that a

00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:29.468
lot of people have been hooked in to QAnon by the algorithms of these social media platforms.

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:34.248
What is worth talking about though, is some of the

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:37.998
reasons why QAnon has attracted so many followers.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:46.028
Firstly, Q, the person, encourages his followers to do their own research.

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:53.678
He claims to be providing facts about goings on at a high level of government, however the

00:10:53.678 --> 00:11:00.958
big thing about Q is that he wants to empower normal people to find out things on their own.

00:11:02.018 --> 00:11:07.298
The only commandments are to not trust the mainstream media, and be

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:10.448
sceptical about anything that you might hear from the government.

00:11:11.948 --> 00:11:17.878
This is extremely powerful, as not only does it make the entire thing seem

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:23.688
like a big scavenger hunt, a big game where you are looking for clues, but

00:11:23.878 --> 00:11:29.658
it also makes it far easier to just ignore any evidence that you might read

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:35.228
about in the news, putting it down as completely false, just ‘fake news’.

00:11:36.858 --> 00:11:42.598
If you get into a state where the only truth is the truth that you want to find, based

00:11:42.598 --> 00:11:48.988
on this global conspiracy that you know to be true, and anything that anyone says to

00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:55.288
contradict this is just a lie, then it must be difficult to escape from this situation.

00:11:57.898 --> 00:12:04.438
One other thing that I was surprised to find out about QAnon is that some of the biggest

00:12:04.468 --> 00:12:11.398
supporters of it, some of the most visible personalities that talk about QAnon do

00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:17.264
actually seem quite calm and level headed , at least from an outsider's perspective.

00:12:18.764 --> 00:12:24.724
The most famous one, who has over 700 thousand followers between YouTube and

00:12:24.974 --> 00:12:31.134
Facebook, is someone called David Hayes, who goes by the username ‘praying monk’.

00:12:32.634 --> 00:12:37.654
Now, I watched a few of his videos on YouTube, and I was expecting to

00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:43.104
see someone shouting, gesticulating madly, and who seemed a little crazy.

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:50.414
Yet he was actually very composed, calm, and seemed relatively rational.

00:12:51.164 --> 00:12:56.454
So there are these people who are the ‘front’ of Q, who have really

00:12:56.454 --> 00:13:01.224
helped legitimise what would otherwise be a completely mad idea.

00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:09.084
And this legitimacy has led to supporters from more and more mainstream parts of society,

00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:16.694
and QAnon has moved from obscure corners of internet forums to the political stage.

00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:21.569
There were 50 congressional candidates who pledged support for QAnon,

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:28.589
you see QAnon flags at Trump rallies, and Mike Pence, the Vice President,

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:33.539
even retweeted a picture of him meeting a man with a QAnon badge.

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:40.449
So it is getting everywhere, and this is something that a lot of people are quite afraid of.

00:13:41.859 --> 00:13:48.344
In 2018, it was classified by the FBI as a domestic terror threat in an

00:13:48.344 --> 00:13:52.924
internal memo, given that a lot of its followers have committed crimes

00:13:52.954 --> 00:13:57.104
in the name of conducting their own investigations, inspired by Q.

00:13:58.654 --> 00:14:04.624
Shortly before this a Californian man had been arrested with bomb-making materials,

00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:11.544
claiming he was going to launch an attack to make people aware of Pizzagate, and there

00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:28.232
was another incident of a QAnon follower in Nevada who was found in an armoured truck

00:14:28.232 --> 00:14:28.707
blocking the Hoover dam and demanding the release of the report on Hillary Clinton's emails.

00:14:28.707 --> 00:14:34.504
So while Q still remains anonymous, providing supposedly top-secret clues about the

00:14:34.514 --> 00:14:40.362
goings on of the deep state, his followers continue to grow, gaining more and more power,

00:14:40.362 --> 00:14:46.944
and enabled by a president who retweets their memes, and distributes their message.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.864
Q’s supporters believe a great awakening is coming,

00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:55.544
all will be revealed, and the world will be righted.

00:14:57.044 --> 00:15:05.034
I’m not so sure about that, but what I will do is end this episode with one of Q’s catchphrases.

00:15:06.484 --> 00:15:07.484
Trust the plan.

00:15:07.984 --> 00:15:09.074
Enjoy the show.

00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:11.844
Nothing can stop what is coming.

00:15:15.301 --> 00:15:19.441
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on QAnon.

00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:26.121
It is a pretty weird, scary idea, but the fact that so many people

00:15:26.371 --> 00:15:30.801
do believe it means it’s at least worth trying to understand.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:38.077
As a quick reminder, if you would like the subtitles, transcript, key vocabulary, and all of

00:15:38.077 --> 00:15:44.037
the bonus episodes, then you can find all of that lovely stuff over at leonardoenglish.com.

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:50.717
And one final reminder, if you do want to do something very kind that will only take

00:15:50.727 --> 00:15:55.787
you 30 seconds, then please do leave a review of the show on your favourite podcast app.

00:15:56.217 --> 00:16:00.417
I read every single one, and they all leave a smile on my face.

00:16:01.948 --> 00:16:06.563
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:08.213
I’m Alastair Budge.

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:12.083
You stay safe and I'll catch you in the next episode.

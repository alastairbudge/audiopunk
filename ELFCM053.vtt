Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to

00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:10.758
English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:16.698
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to talk about the Dark Web.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:23.778
When you hear the phrase, the Dark Web, you might think of all sorts of things.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:28.458
Bitcoin, Alastair Budge: people buying fake credit cards,

00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:33.348
drugs, guns, and all sorts of not very nice things.

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:38.178
Alastair Budge: Or you might think that it is the last place for free

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:43.938
expression on the internet, a place where governments and the authorities can't

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:49.548
interfere in your own business and where your privacy is actually respected.

00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:57.968
Alastair Budge: Today we are going to talk about what the Dark Web actually is, how it works,

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:07.163
why people use it, and whether it's actually always as bad as the media might make it out to be.

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:12.923
This is normally the part where I tell people that they can become a member of

00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:18.113
Leonardo English, but as this is a member only episode, I don't need to do that.

00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:21.983
All I will do is say, thank you very much for your membership.

00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:26.753
You make Leonardo English possible and you are the reason that I do the show.

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:32.088
Okay, then let's talk about the Dark Web.

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:40.908
I imagine you've heard the phrase Dark Web or dark net more and more over the past few years,

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:48.188
but Alastair Budge: despite all of the news articles you might have read about it, it is

00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:56.103
misunderstood by many, and lots of people would have a hard time explaining exactly what it is.

00:01:58.383 --> 00:02:05.043
For starters, the Dark Web isn't really a place or location on the internet.

00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:13.473
A more accurate way of thinking about what it is is that it is a way of using the internet

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:20.913
an anonymous way of accessing the internet that means that nobody can see who you are.

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:28.693
To explain how this actually works, let's just start with the normal internet.

00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:34.093
Alastair Budge: If you have a website, Leonardoenglish.com for example,

00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:40.378
you can just access the website through whatever browser you want: Google

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:45.118
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, internet Explorer, or whatever it might be.

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:46.918
And it's easy.

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:48.418
There's not much to do.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:54.250
Alastair Budge: It's easy for you, but this does come at their cost.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.330
And this cost is Alastair Budge: your privacy

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.430
Alastair Budge: Your internet service provider, the company that provides

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.785
your internet, Alastair Budge: it can see pretty much all of your activity.

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:13.515
It knows the websites you visit, when you visited them, and a large

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:19.065
number of ISPs, the internet service providers, they will sell on your

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:24.705
data to advertisers, so these advertisers can try and sell you things.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.960
So your internet usage is really not very private at all.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.840
And yes, even if you are using incognito mode or private

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.650
browsing, your internet company can still see what you're doing.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.260
Alastair Budge: For you, this might not matter very much.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.920
I have no doubt that all members of Leonardo English

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.490
are upstanding citizens, and you might say, 'who cares?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.580
I'm not doing anything interesting or wrong.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.230
So what does it matter if my internet company can see that I've visited

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.130
leonardoenglish.com Alastair Budge: and listened to a few podcasts?'

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.150
But if you are someone who really didn't want anyone to be able to see what

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.435
you were doing, either because you just believed that they shouldn't or because

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:27.335
what you were doing was illegal, well, this is where the Dark Web comes in.

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:34.925
With the Dark Web, there are layers of encryption that mean

00:04:34.955 --> 00:04:40.655
that your identity and browsing history is hidden from everyone.

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:49.505
Without getting too technical, this is achieved by something called onion routing,

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:56.111
Alastair Budge: How this works in practice is that the data is sent through different

00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:04.141
layers, and each layer can only see the layer before and the layer after, meaning

00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:11.251
that it is very difficult to actually identify the sender and receiver of the data.

00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:20.161
One parallel that I think is useful to think about this is with organised crime gangs,

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:27.436
where, if you're in the gang, you might only know the identity of the person above you and

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:33.886
the person below you so that if the police catch you, you don't know who the big bosses are.

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:38.896
There are, of course, some differences, but I think this is a useful analogy.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:46.366
How it works isn't that important though, at least for the purposes of today's episode.

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:53.865
Alastair Budge: The important thing is that the end result is that you are completely anonymous.

00:05:54.285 --> 00:05:58.185
Nobody can see what websites you've visited and the

00:05:58.185 --> 00:06:01.935
websites that you are visiting can't see who you are.

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:07.715
These websites are normal websites from the point of

00:06:07.715 --> 00:06:11.495
view of they are just constructed like any other website.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.490
But you can always tell that they are a Dark Web website by a very simple sign.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.400
They all end in the same way, the address all ends in the same way.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.180
It's not .com, it's not .co.uk and it's not .DarkWeb or something like that.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.270
It is dot onion.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.603
Alastair Budge: If you happen to find a website that is a dot onion,

00:06:40.213 --> 00:06:44.343
Alastair Budge: that website will only be accessible, you can only get to it,

00:06:44.823 --> 00:06:51.393
via a special type of browser that allows you to access websites on the Dark Web.

00:06:52.983 --> 00:07:00.003
The most famous one is a browser called Tor T O R, or the onion router.

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:06.883
Alastair Budge: Interestingly enough, this was actually developed by the United States Navy

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:12.653
in order to protect online communications Alastair Budge: between its information officers.

00:07:13.253 --> 00:07:20.423
It certainly wasn't intended to be used as a way to enable some of the things that it now enables.

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:25.045
Alastair Budge: So we've figured out how to get onto the

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:29.655
Dark Web, how we access these mysterious dot onion websites.

00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:34.345
It's that you download your Tor browser and you are ready to go.

00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:39.595
But once you are there, what can you actually do?

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:45.755
Well, given that it is completely anonymous, and governments can't

00:07:45.785 --> 00:07:51.545
easily trace the activities of people on the Dark Web, this naturally

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:56.975
has meant that it has attracted people who want to remain anonymous.

00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:02.924
Alastair Budge: And these people broadly fall into three categories.

00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:11.564
Firstly, people who want to remain anonymous for ideological reasons, they

00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:17.954
don't think that it is right that third parties should be spying on them.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:25.780
Alastair Budge: Secondly, people who want to access the internet in countries with authoritarian

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:33.630
governments, who want to access services that aren't available through the normal internet and

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:40.530
who want a safe place to communicate without the government being able to see what they are doing.

00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:47.001
Alastair Budge: And thirdly, people who are actually doing pretty illegal stuff.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:57.441
They have migrated activity that might happen on street corners and dark, shady rooms, online.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:05.145
Alastair Budge: Much like how you might buy books, clothes, even groceries online

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:10.990
now, because it is more convenient and saves you time, if you were the sort of

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:17.080
person that wanted to buy something that wasn't quite as legal as books, clothes, or

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:24.700
groceries, then the Dark Web is the place where you can find and buy almost anything.

00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:31.582
Alastair Budge: From drugs to guns, stolen credit cards to fake passports,

00:09:32.007 --> 00:09:37.017
there is practically nothing that isn't for sale on the Dark Web.

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:42.394
Alastair Budge: However, one question you might have is about payments.

00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:47.044
If you want to stay anonymous, how can you actually pay for stuff?

00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:53.704
A credit card wouldn't work because that could be tracked by the government and it

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:58.474
would defeat the entire purpose of covering your tracks, of trying to be anonymous.

00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:03.009
And you probably wouldn't want to send cash in an envelope

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:07.329
because what if the seller just said they didn't receive it?

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:10.536
You couldn't go to the police and say that your Alastair Budge:

00:10:10.536 --> 00:10:14.201
parcel of drugs or fake passports hadn't arrived.

00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.431
Alastair Budge: The answer, if you weren't aware, is Bitcoin.

00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:26.581
A proper discussion of Bitcoin is probably a subject for another episode, but it

00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:32.491
has one major selling point that makes it attractive for users of the Dark Web.

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:36.555
Alastair Budge: And that is that it is anonymous,

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:40.445
Alastair Budge: it can't be traced just like the Dark Web itself.

00:10:42.015 --> 00:10:47.605
So, purchases on the Dark Web happen primarily through

00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:52.075
Bitcoin or other non-traceable cryptocurrencies.

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:56.395
E-commerce, Alastair Budge: buying and selling stuff on

00:10:56.485 --> 00:11:00.385
the Dark Web wouldn't really have been possible without it.

00:11:01.587 --> 00:11:06.512
Alastair Budge: Now, Alastair Budge: as you would expect with people who make a living through

00:11:06.662 --> 00:11:15.332
illegal means, there is quite a lot of dodgy behaviour reported by users of the Dark Web with some

00:11:15.572 --> 00:11:23.342
sellers just running off with buyer's money and then setting up another shop 10 minutes later.

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:29.697
Because everyone's identities are hidden, this means that it is

00:11:29.697 --> 00:11:34.467
a lot easier to do this than it would be on the normal internet.

00:11:35.197 --> 00:11:39.457
Alastair Budge: And like we said before, you can't go to the police and say that

00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:43.987
someone hasn't delivered the stolen credit card numbers that you had paid them for.

00:11:45.197 --> 00:11:51.449
Alastair Budge: However, there are certainly reports of lots of sellers on the Dark Web actually

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:58.769
behaving in a way very similar to how people would behave on the internet, on the normal web.

00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:01.773
They know it's Alastair Budge: important to keep your

00:12:01.773 --> 00:12:05.703
customers happy because that's the only way they'll come back.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:12.617
Alastair Budge: And so, instead of not delivering the illegal goods and running off with the money,

00:12:13.157 --> 00:12:20.207
they might send an extra gift or make sure that they message the buyer to leave a positive review.

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:26.567
They would do the kinds of things that any good eBay or Amazon seller would.

00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:33.797
So business is business, no matter whether you are selling very legal

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:39.512
household appliances Alastair Budge: or very illegal firearms or heroin.

00:12:40.082 --> 00:12:42.092
The customer always comes first.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:49.552
Alastair Budge: This e-commerce, the online shopping on the Dark Web happens in

00:12:49.552 --> 00:12:55.102
different places, in different markets, different websites all over the Dark Web.

00:12:55.882 --> 00:13:00.292
Alastair Budge: But the most famous one was called Silk Road,

00:13:00.603 --> 00:13:05.463
Alastair Budge: named after the trading path between East and West where

00:13:05.463 --> 00:13:10.233
everything was bought or sold, where you could buy almost anything.

00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:18.166
Alastair Budge: You may have heard of the name of Silk Road, because its founder, a man

00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:26.716
called Ross Ullbright, also known as Dread Pirate Roberts, was finally arrested by the FBI.

00:13:28.476 --> 00:13:33.086
Alastair Budge: Ullbright is now serving five concurrent life sentences

00:13:33.236 --> 00:13:37.826
in an American prison, so it's unlikely that he will ever get out.

00:13:38.966 --> 00:13:44.876
Alastair Budge: But before he was put behind bars, he was the founder and mastermind

00:13:45.176 --> 00:13:50.516
of Silk Road, Alastair Budge: the largest online drugs market in the world,

00:13:51.106 --> 00:13:56.006
Alastair Budge: where, apparently, people could buy any types of drug that they wanted.

00:13:58.006 --> 00:14:03.046
Silk Road became so big that it reportedly did over

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:07.996
a billion dollars of sales in its two year existence.

00:14:08.686 --> 00:14:11.026
All these sales were in Bitcoin, of course.

00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:17.106
So there is obviously a lot of bad stuff on the Dark Web.

00:14:17.866 --> 00:14:22.612
Guns, drugs, stolen credit cards, Alastair Budge: child pornography,

00:14:23.302 --> 00:14:28.162
which to state the obvious, is horrible and should be condemned.

00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:32.348
Alastair Budge: But there is also quite a lot of the Dark Web

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:37.598
that, in my opinion, at least, does serve a valid purpose.

00:14:38.858 --> 00:14:46.598
It is used by lots of journalists, for example, to receive encrypted information from sources.

00:14:48.136 --> 00:14:52.306
Alastair Budge: As I said earlier, in countries where the governments really can't

00:14:52.306 --> 00:14:59.296
be trusted to not be always snooping on people's internet browsing, it does provide

00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:05.625
privacy Alastair Budge: for those people to live their lives, to communicate with other

00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:12.255
people about completely legal things in a way that their governments can't overhear.

00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:19.381
Alastair Budge: And not all websites on the Dark Web are bad and full of criminal activity.

00:15:20.401 --> 00:15:27.151
One website that exists on the Dark Web, which also has a far more popular version on

00:15:27.151 --> 00:15:33.661
the main internet is one that you probably use and you will definitely have heard of.

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:35.791
It's Facebook.

00:15:36.991 --> 00:15:43.651
Facebook has a Dark Web version, meaning that people who live in authoritarian

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:48.001
countries, or who don't want their governments snooping into their internet

00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:54.031
history, they can access Facebook completely anonymously, at least from the

00:15:54.031 --> 00:15:58.861
point of view of anyone being able to see what pages they were accessing.

00:16:00.173 --> 00:16:05.693
Alastair Budge: Another service that exists on the Dark Web is one that I imagine

00:16:05.693 --> 00:16:11.753
you will also have heard of, but you probably haven't used, and that is WikiLeaks.

00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:15.883
Alastair Budge: Whatever you might think of some of the things that have been

00:16:15.883 --> 00:16:22.933
published by it, it is a service that believes in people's rights to expose

00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:29.173
government corruption and malpractice, basically governments doing bad things.

00:16:30.603 --> 00:16:35.733
Alastair Budge: And having a completely encrypted site on the Dark Web means that

00:16:35.793 --> 00:16:40.173
whistleblowers, Alastair Budge: people who want to submit information that they

00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:45.393
believe should be in the public domain, but don't necessarily want their name

00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:51.663
to be attached with the publication of it, the Dark Web allows them to do this.

00:16:53.643 --> 00:16:58.053
So these types of sites serve a valid purpose.

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:02.733
Just look what happened during the Trump Ukraine scandal.

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:08.603
Alastair Budge: There was a whistleblower who went through the official channels, but their

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:16.963
identity was revealed by lots of far right news outlets and individuals, and even Donald Trump

00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:24.418
and members of his administration said that the identity of the whistleblower should be revealed.

00:17:26.006 --> 00:17:30.326
Alastair Budge: Now I'm sure that this has made a lot of potential whistleblowers

00:17:30.656 --> 00:17:36.866
think twice about doing so, knowing that a similar thing would likely happen to them.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:44.516
So WikiLeaks on the Dark Web means that everything is encrypted, Alastair Budge:

00:17:44.516 --> 00:17:49.376
their identity can be completely hidden, and the fact that no one can see

00:17:49.376 --> 00:17:54.506
their browsing history means no one knows they've even gone on WikiLeaks.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:59.409
Alastair Budge: And the fact that this means that people can submit information,

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:06.559
hold governments accountable without fear of reprisals, fear of things

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:11.509
coming back to them, that has to be a good thing in terms of transparency.

00:18:13.264 --> 00:18:18.664
Alastair Budge: Now I want to add two linguistic points to conclude today's episode.

00:18:19.654 --> 00:18:23.689
Firstly, because they are interesting on their own.

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:28.489
And secondly, because they are interesting from an English learner's point of view.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:34.549
Alastair Budge: So to start, it is called the Dark Web, but

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:40.009
lots of people misinterpret and misunderstand the 'dark' here.

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:48.559
Dark can mean bad, illegal, nasty, but of course it also means without light.

00:18:49.069 --> 00:18:49.879
Hard to see.

00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:54.769
And the dark of Dark Web is the latter.

00:18:55.879 --> 00:19:03.109
Dark doesn't mean bad in itself, it just means that it is the part of the web that you can't see.

00:19:05.369 --> 00:19:11.639
And secondly, a lot of people, including TV shows and newspapers,

00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:16.229
Alastair Budge: they confuse the Dark Web with the Deep Web.

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.839
So Dark Web, Deep Web.

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.369
They do have similarities, but they are very, very different.

00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:29.939
And it is an important differentiation to make because you see statistics like

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:37.409
97% of the web is below the surface, it's on the Deep Web, and some people

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:42.284
Alastair Budge: think this is the same as the Dark Web and jump to the conclusion

00:19:42.494 --> 00:19:48.224
that the majority of the internet is just people selling illegal things.

00:19:49.334 --> 00:19:51.074
Of course, this is incorrect.

00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:56.204
The Deep Web is just the web pages, the pages on the

00:19:56.204 --> 00:20:00.674
internet, that aren't visible to Google and search engines.

00:20:01.364 --> 00:20:08.414
Mainly hidden pages that are accessible through logging in to accounts and so on.

00:20:09.434 --> 00:20:14.089
So your Leonardo English dashboard, for example, Alastair Budge: what you see when

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:19.999
you log in, that is part of the Deep Web, but it's certainly not on the Dark Web.

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:26.569
And if you are going to go to that webpage on the hunt for fake credit cards

00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:30.289
or drugs, Alastair Budge: I think you would find yourself quite disappointed.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.560
Alastair Budge: I should say that obviously this podcast and Leonardo English

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.450
does not support any of the illegal activity that happens on the Dark Web.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.050
However, there certainly is an argument to be made for more privacy on the internet.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:56.430
At the moment, we are all in a bit of a Faustian pact where we accept, consciously

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:04.410
or unconsciously, that the price of such easy internet access is a lack of privacy.

00:21:05.406 --> 00:21:11.406
Alastair Budge: At least the Dark Web offers a way for people who live in or authoritarian countries

00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:18.036
with governments that they can't trust to browse the internet with a little bit more privacy.

00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:22.386
And that, in my view, at least, has to be a good thing.

00:21:24.386 --> 00:21:28.016
Okay then that is it for today's episode.

00:21:28.676 --> 00:21:33.746
I hope that it has been an interesting one and at least you know now

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:37.376
a little bit more about the Dark Web than you did 20 minutes ago.

00:21:38.478 --> 00:21:41.928
Alastair Budge: As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:21:42.288 --> 00:21:45.888
You can email, hi@leonardoenglish.com.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:50.298
I've just got a couple more things to say before we end.

00:21:50.658 --> 00:21:55.248
Firstly, we will be doing our first members Q&A live session

00:21:55.248 --> 00:21:58.968
later on this month, so keep an eye on your inbox for that one.

00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:02.868
It is going to be a lot of fun and I hope that you will be able to make it.

00:22:03.918 --> 00:22:10.398
Secondly, as you may have seen, you can now request an episode in your Leonardo English dashboard.

00:22:11.118 --> 00:22:15.768
We want to make podcasts about the topics that you want to listen to.

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:19.878
So if there is anything in particular that you think we

00:22:19.878 --> 00:22:23.448
should do an episode on, please do submit the request.

00:22:25.498 --> 00:22:31.108
Okay then, you've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:22:31.588 --> 00:22:37.378
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe and I'll catch you in the next episode.

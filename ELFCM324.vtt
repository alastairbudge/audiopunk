Hello, hello hello, and welcome
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.720
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.000
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.540
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.130
I'm Alastair Budge, and today
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.790
about Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.296
At the start of December, I got
access to a tool called ChatGPT,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.730
an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.960
I played around with it for much of the
weekend, and it is absolutely amazing.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.370
So, in this episode I am going to talk
about Artificial Intelligence, and the

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.460
way in which I think this technology
is going to impact language learning.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.700
Long story short, I think it will
provide some fantastic opportunities

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.960
for language learners, and it’s one
of the most exciting developments

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.690
in language learning history.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.560
So, I’m super excited to share
my thoughts with you today.

00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:13.127
OK then, Artificial Intelligence
and language learning.

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:18.267
Now, what better way to start an
episode about Artificial Intelligence

00:01:18.384 --> 00:01:23.614
and language learning than the
words, literally, of a robot, an AI.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:29.894
I asked an AI chatbot “What impact
will AI have on language learning?”

00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:34.704
I literally typed those words,
and within a couple of seconds,

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:36.304
the response came back.

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:39.754
AI [Artificial Intelligence] is
expected to have a significant

00:01:39.774 --> 00:01:40.934
impact on language learning.

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:46.074
AI technologies, such as natural language
processing and machine learning, are

00:01:46.074 --> 00:01:50.114
already being used in language learning
tools, such as language learning

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:52.294
apps and online tutoring platforms.

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:56.754
These tools can provide personalized
and adaptive learning experiences,

00:01:56.864 --> 00:02:00.894
by analyzing the user's language
abilities and providing customized

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:02.294
feedback and recommendations.

00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:07.214
In addition, AI can be used to create
virtual language learning assistants,

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:12.024
such as language tutors or conversation
partners, who can interact with language

00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:15.464
learners in real-time and provide
feedback on their language skills.

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:19.144
These assistants can help language
learners improve their speaking,

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:23.464
listening, reading, and writing skills,
and can provide a more engaging and

00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:25.344
interactive learning experience.

00:02:25.814 --> 00:02:30.144
Overall, the use of AI in language
learning is expected to improve

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:33.794
the efficiency and effectiveness
of language learning, by providing

00:02:33.964 --> 00:02:38.064
personalized, adaptive, and interactive
language learning experiences.

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:42.494
OK, human me, it's
Alastair here, I’m back.

00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:49.094
This was literally the response
of a robot, this was Artificial

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:51.684
Intelligence responding to my question.

00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:55.084
Could you tell that it was a robot?

00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:57.084
Did it sound unnatural?

00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:58.974
No, it didn’t.

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:04.554
It provided a pretty good answer, in
perfect, grammatically correct English.

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:06.724
Nice work, Robot.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:12.104
If you have tried “language learning
AI chatbots” in the past, they are

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:16.704
almost always frustrating to use,
they don’t understand what you are

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:21.764
saying, and it’s a significantly worse
experience than speaking with a human.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:26.924
This one, ChatGPT, is
completely different.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.474
So, what does this mean?

00:03:29.884 --> 00:03:34.434
How is this going to affect language
learning, and what does it mean for you?

00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:40.594
Well, you heard the AI’s response,
now it’s time for my human response.

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:46.824
To approach this question, I want
to first start with a brief overview

00:03:46.824 --> 00:03:52.004
of what AI actually is, and how
it has developed over the years.

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:57.894
Then, we’ll talk very briefly about how
language learning has changed over time.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:02.354
And then we’ll get to the best
bit, some practical examples of

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:07.524
how you can use this now, and how
it will affect you in the future.

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:13.484
Right, so what actually is AI,
what is Artificial Intelligence?

00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:20.194
AI is the ability of a computer or
machine to seem intelligent, to answer

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:23.024
questions or do things like a human.

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:28.394
Think about how you, as a human
being, respond to a question.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:33.034
You listen, understand what you
are being asked, and then you

00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:37.453
consult the information available
to you, based on your experience

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:39.193
and knowledge, to give an answer.

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:45.083
Perhaps this is an easy question, like:
“What’s your name, or is it raining?”

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:51.323
Or maybe it’s a harder one, like: “What
were the reasons for the Great Depression

00:04:51.543 --> 00:04:56.573
or what circumstances could have led
to the Titanic not sinking so quickly?”

00:04:57.283 --> 00:05:03.613
Or maybe it’s an even harder one, like,
“How can we reduce global warming or how

00:05:03.613 --> 00:05:06.363
can our country improve health outcomes?”

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:12.683
In all of these cases, to try to
answer these questions, you consult the

00:05:12.683 --> 00:05:17.953
information available to you, analyse
that information, and provide an answer.

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:23.113
Artificial Intelligence
works on a similar principle.

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:29.523
It is a set of algorithms that analyse
a large amount of data, learn from

00:05:29.523 --> 00:05:34.903
this data, and then do things, do
whatever you ask, based on that data.

00:05:35.863 --> 00:05:39.123
Now, AI has been around
for quite a long time.

00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:45.253
The idea was first explored back
in 1956, but it is only in the past

00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:49.393
few years that it has really got
to a point where it is able to be

00:05:49.763 --> 00:05:52.673
reliably used to replace humans.

00:05:53.383 --> 00:05:58.723
You already use AI-powered products,
even though you might not realise it.

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:03.893
You might use something like Grammarly
to help correct your English writing,

00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:08.983
that uses Artificial Intelligence to
give you suggestions about your writing.

00:06:09.923 --> 00:06:14.663
If you use Google and you start
typing in something and you see some

00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:19.783
suggested similar queries, that is
powered by artificial intelligence.

00:06:20.743 --> 00:06:25.833
Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa,
these services all make use

00:06:25.943 --> 00:06:27.903
of AI to help you do stuff.

00:06:28.913 --> 00:06:34.093
But, no offence to Siri or Alexa,
what they do is quite simple.

00:06:34.273 --> 00:06:39.113
You tell them to play a song or
read you a message or tell you the

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:41.903
capital of Iceland, and they do it.

00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:48.573
The difference between this and what is
coming next, and what you can already see

00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:53.243
with ChatGPT is seismic, it’s very large.

00:06:54.243 --> 00:06:57.033
So, a quick note on ChatGPT.

00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:02.303
First, I guess I should have said this
at the start, but I have no commercial

00:07:02.313 --> 00:07:07.203
relationship with ChatGPT, they aren’t
paying me to say this, I just think it’s

00:07:07.203 --> 00:07:09.043
amazing and want to tell you about it.

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:17.343
The second practical point is that ChatGPT
is available to everyone, it’s free [or

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:22.333
at least, it was free when I used it],
and the best way of experiencing what

00:07:22.403 --> 00:07:26.253
I’m talking about is by going to the
website and playing with it yourself.

00:07:26.673 --> 00:07:28.543
I’ll put a link in the show notes.

00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:35.733
ChatGPT is an assistant powered
by AI, by Artificial Intelligence.

00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:41.123
It is a product of a company
called OpenAI, a research institute

00:07:41.303 --> 00:07:47.073
founded in 2015 by Elon Musk and
another influential Silicon Valley

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:49.103
entrepreneur called Sam Altman.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.543
OpenAI has developed a
series of AI algorithms.

00:07:55.023 --> 00:08:00.793
There’s one that can create images from
text prompts, so you can say “draw a

00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:06.713
picture of Napoleon eating a banana
in a pop-art style”, or “create some

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:10.438
professional-looking headshots based
on this photo of me at the beach”.

00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:15.748
It can generate music based on
inputs, and it can tell you how

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:18.008
to fix bugs in your computer code.

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:24.068
These are all amazing, but until
recently they were not particularly

00:08:24.288 --> 00:08:28.728
accessible to anyone without the
necessary technical knowledge.

00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:36.188
Then, at the very end of November,
2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT.

00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:43.698
It looks like any messaging app, you
type in a command in normal English,

00:08:43.768 --> 00:08:46.408
and you will receive a response back.

00:08:47.148 --> 00:08:49.698
And the possibilities are endless.

00:08:49.918 --> 00:08:54.938
It can write fictional stories, it can
correct computer code, it can give you

00:08:55.148 --> 00:09:00.928
love advice, it can give you recipes
based on allergies, it can write songs,

00:09:00.988 --> 00:09:03.378
this list could continue for years.

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:08.838
So, instead of listing everything
that this chatbot can do, we are

00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:11.028
going to focus on language learning.

00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:17.318
So, how can this help you, as a language
learner, as someone learning English?

00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:23.828
The first thing to say is that I think
it’s excellent news for language learners,

00:09:24.068 --> 00:09:28.208
and perhaps the best and most exciting
development for language learners

00:09:28.218 --> 00:09:29.968
in the history of language learning.

00:09:31.248 --> 00:09:35.058
You might think that this
is an exaggeration, but I

00:09:35.058 --> 00:09:36.108
really don’t think it is.

00:09:37.408 --> 00:09:42.598
100 years ago, as someone trying to
learn English in, let’s say Brazil or

00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:48.648
Japan or Turkey, you might never hear
anyone speaking native English, even

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:50.578
if you learned it your entire life.

00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:56.078
50 years ago, as someone learning
English, you would probably rely

00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:58.598
on one person, your teacher.

00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:03.798
This teacher might have some
textbooks, and some tapes of native

00:10:03.818 --> 00:10:05.558
English speakers in conversation.

00:10:06.478 --> 00:10:13.358
Now, or even 10 years ago, you can watch
English movies, listen to English podcasts

00:10:13.388 --> 00:10:18.298
like this one, and you can find an English
teacher online at the click of a button.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:23.448
Great, wonderful, you have more
access to content and to native

00:10:23.448 --> 00:10:25.138
speakers than ever before.

00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:30.588
But, it’s still a bit tricky to
find out when you make mistakes.

00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:35.498
You need another human to help you,
someone to say “Hey Francois, it’s

00:10:35.498 --> 00:10:39.948
better to say “my brother’s dog”
than “the dog of my brother””, so

00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:44.258
someone to point you in the right
direction when you make a mistake.

00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.855
AI can serve this purpose.

00:10:48.628 --> 00:10:52.808
Not only can it correct you when
you make a mistake, but it can

00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:57.038
explain it to you for the future, so
you don’t make this mistake again.

00:10:58.218 --> 00:11:03.888
And I’m not talking about some expensive
product that you need to buy, or some

00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:08.828
Chrome extension that just tells you
when you're going wrong, but you can

00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:12.718
do this now, for free, with ChatGPT.

00:11:13.978 --> 00:11:19.668
Now, at the moment it’s a chatbot,
it works via text input, you write

00:11:19.668 --> 00:11:21.678
something and it responds in writing.

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:27.258
Clearly, this is a bit limiting,
it's a bit restrictive, because

00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:30.778
you learn a language to be
able to communicate verbally,

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:33.428
speaking, not only in written form.

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:39.938
But again, it’s only a matter of time
before you can speak to it and it will

00:11:39.938 --> 00:11:45.578
be able to respond to you in natural,
spoken English, exactly like you were

00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:47.778
having a conversation with a human being.

00:11:48.678 --> 00:11:52.618
Now, I can imagine that you might
be sitting there listening to me

00:11:52.818 --> 00:11:57.908
squirming, being uncomfortable, thinking
“I would never do that”, I want to

00:11:57.908 --> 00:12:00.178
talk to a real person, not a robot.

00:12:01.478 --> 00:12:07.758
Maybe you’ve seen films like Ex Machina
or Her, and you thought it was creepy

00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:13.208
and weird that anyone could form a
human-like relationship with a computer.

00:12:14.098 --> 00:12:17.378
I don’t blame you, I feel
exactly the same way.

00:12:18.108 --> 00:12:24.438
At the moment it does feel unusual
and strange, but how I think you

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:29.068
should think about this is that it
presents a wonderful opportunity.

00:12:30.178 --> 00:12:36.148
Now, I want to pause for a moment and ask
you to imagine a world where you could

00:12:36.148 --> 00:12:40.518
listen to someone talking in English,
at exactly the speed that you could

00:12:40.518 --> 00:12:45.898
understand, you could ask them to pause
and repeat something, you could ask them

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:50.528
questions, they could ask you questions,
they would correct you if you made a

00:12:50.528 --> 00:12:55.168
mistake, they would explain that mistake
to you, and you would learn from it.

00:12:56.478 --> 00:13:00.458
At the moment, I’m describing
something that does exist already.

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:05.478
It’s the experience of speaking with
someone in English, a private tutor for

00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:11.288
example, which is great, but it’s not
always free, it can be quite  expensive,

00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:13.224
and there are limitations to it.

00:13:14.244 --> 00:13:19.974
Now, imagine a world in which this was
accessible to anyone in the world, at

00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:25.354
any time of day, for free, and you were
talking to someone with a superhuman

00:13:25.424 --> 00:13:29.844
knowledge, someone who was able to
talk about everything from the Ancient

00:13:29.874 --> 00:13:35.464
Egyptians to Formula One, someone who
was endlessly patient with you, and

00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:40.194
would correct your mistakes, someone
who would never get bored or need to

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.354
go to the toilet or who would get ill.

00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:50.014
Yes, this “person” might not be a person
at all, it might be an AI assistant, but

00:13:50.214 --> 00:13:56.584
it is hugely democratising, it means that
anyone, anywhere, can learn to speak a

00:13:56.584 --> 00:14:04.144
language; cost, time and location become
no object, they are no longer factors.

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:10.704
Now, this is perhaps a futuristic
example, and one that you might

00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:11.954
not be so comfortable with.

00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:16.944
But there are plenty of examples
of how AI can help you today,

00:14:17.204 --> 00:14:20.664
examples that I am confident that
you will be very comfortable with.

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.954
For example, written English.

00:14:24.594 --> 00:14:29.274
If you need to use English at work, you
probably need to send emails in English.

00:14:30.284 --> 00:14:33.794
When we made our Business English
course a few months ago, one of

00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:38.364
the biggest pieces of feedback we
got was about emails in English.

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.484
What tone should you take?

00:14:40.704 --> 00:14:43.064
How long or short should an email be?

00:14:43.354 --> 00:14:46.814
Should I write Dear Sir or
should I write “Hi Jim”?

00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:52.544
And how can I check that my written
English is clean and error free?

00:14:53.964 --> 00:14:58.214
The great news is that, with an AI
Chatbot like this, you do not have

00:14:58.214 --> 00:15:03.694
to worry about that any more, or at
least this becomes infinitely easier.

00:15:04.554 --> 00:15:09.094
You can ask the Chatbot to write
an email for you and it will do it.

00:15:10.014 --> 00:15:13.614
Tell it what you want to say, the
tone that you want it to write

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:18.204
it in, formal, friendly etc.,
and ta-da, it will write it.

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:25.064
This is super exciting, because it means
that you can focus on more important

00:15:25.074 --> 00:15:30.514
things than the tone of your emails, and
it levels the playing field, it means that

00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:35.094
you shouldn’t be treated any differently
as a non-native English speaker at work.

00:15:36.484 --> 00:15:41.444
Similarly, if you are a non-native English
speaker who needs to write in English at

00:15:41.514 --> 00:15:47.114
university, let’s say, you can focus more
on the quality of your ideas than on the

00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:49.564
grammatical correctness of your writing.

00:15:50.674 --> 00:15:54.794
Again, this is excellent news,
because it levels the playing field,

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:59.704
it means that the focus is on the
arguments you are making rather

00:15:59.704 --> 00:16:01.374
than the language you make them in.

00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:07.224
The elephant in the room, perhaps,
is that if you start to rely on AI

00:16:07.524 --> 00:16:12.564
to write for you, if you are never
forced to learn for yourself, then

00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:14.894
you won’t learn, you won’t improve.

00:16:15.444 --> 00:16:19.714
If you don’t make mistakes because
you ask an AI to write for you, there

00:16:19.714 --> 00:16:21.154
will be no mistakes to learn from.

00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:24.324
Clearly, this is problematic.

00:16:24.804 --> 00:16:28.604
It’s problematic in written English,
because you will never learn to

00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:32.524
write properly, you won’t pick up
new words and phrases when writing.

00:16:32.934 --> 00:16:37.534
But it’s especially problematic when
it comes to listening and speaking.

00:16:38.544 --> 00:16:42.324
With reading and writing, you have
the time to process information

00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:44.394
and formulate a response.

00:16:44.864 --> 00:16:46.504
An AI can help you.

00:16:47.534 --> 00:16:52.594
With listening and speaking, especially
when it comes to real human-conversation,

00:16:52.854 --> 00:16:56.894
which is after all the main point
of language learning, you don’t.

00:16:57.474 --> 00:17:01.694
You have to listen and understand,
and then respond yourself,

00:17:02.084 --> 00:17:04.254
an AI can’t do this for you.

00:17:05.404 --> 00:17:09.334
You might be thinking that there is
a world in the future where an AI

00:17:09.514 --> 00:17:14.414
translates in real-time straight into your
brain, and you can simply think about a

00:17:14.414 --> 00:17:18.974
response and this AI will automatically
translate it to perfect English.

00:17:19.364 --> 00:17:23.834
But we are quite some way off from
there yet, even if that sounds

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:25.864
like a appealing proposition.

00:17:26.564 --> 00:17:30.294
So, how can you use AI now?

00:17:30.964 --> 00:17:36.124
Well, if you are prepared to put in
the work, to learn how to learn from

00:17:36.124 --> 00:17:41.234
your mistakes and to self-correct, then
there are some amazing opportunities.

00:17:42.124 --> 00:17:46.714
Use an AI to write for you,
then compare what you would have

00:17:46.714 --> 00:17:48.534
said with what it suggested.

00:17:49.374 --> 00:17:50.724
But don’t leave it here.

00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:55.274
If you don’t understand something,
ask the AI to explain it for you.

00:17:55.694 --> 00:17:58.544
Ask an AI for feedback on your work.

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:05.024
And make sure that you combine this with
activities that will help you retain,

00:18:05.024 --> 00:18:09.784
remember this knowledge - make sure
that you use these corrections in your

00:18:09.904 --> 00:18:14.694
written and spoken English, so that they
are being retained, they are not just

00:18:14.904 --> 00:18:17.094
going in one ear and out of the other.

00:18:18.414 --> 00:18:24.734
Ultimately, an AI can help you in a myriad
of ways, it can correct you and explain

00:18:24.934 --> 00:18:27.484
your mistakes, but it can’t learn for you.

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:33.564
It can make the journey to fluency
shorter, more accessible, and reduce the

00:18:33.564 --> 00:18:36.414
cost, but there will always be a journey.

00:18:37.464 --> 00:18:41.514
You’ve probably heard me say this
before, but the more you can learn

00:18:41.524 --> 00:18:47.554
to enjoy this journey, and enjoy the
process of learning and creating the

00:18:47.554 --> 00:18:53.344
knowledge inside your own head, then the
more satisfying not just the journey,

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:56.184
but also the final results will be.

00:18:57.214 --> 00:18:58.154
Think about it this way.

00:18:58.884 --> 00:19:05.144
An AI assistant like ChatGPT might be able
to write you a perfectly correct email or

00:19:05.424 --> 00:19:10.674
sales letter to a customer, and win the
admiration of your boss and colleagues,

00:19:10.904 --> 00:19:12.934
it might even help get you a promotion.

00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:18.324
But will you really have learned
anything from it, will there be any

00:19:18.564 --> 00:19:21.234
huge inner satisfaction that you feel?

00:19:22.334 --> 00:19:26.504
Perhaps, but it’ll probably
be temporary, and you won’t

00:19:26.514 --> 00:19:28.674
necessarily have internalised it.

00:19:29.644 --> 00:19:35.994
But if you treat this technology as
another way to improve your own linguistic

00:19:35.994 --> 00:19:41.344
knowledge, of improving your grammar and
vocabulary, and then the next time you

00:19:41.344 --> 00:19:48.234
can get there without AI, not only will
that be hugely satisfactory on an internal

00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:51.364
level, but it’ll be far more long-lasting.

00:19:52.404 --> 00:19:57.234
Ultimately, almost everyone learning
a language is doing so because they

00:19:57.234 --> 00:19:59.224
want to connect with other humans.

00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:07.134
Robots and AI can certainly help with
this, to some extent, but remember,

00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:12.464
to go all the way, you can’t rely
just on artificial intelligence.

00:20:14.693 --> 00:20:20.293
OK then, that is it for today's
episode on AI and language learning.

00:20:20.563 --> 00:20:23.743
I hope it's been an interesting one,
and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:24.543 --> 00:20:29.823
This is actually going to be part
one of a two-part exploration of AI.

00:20:30.203 --> 00:20:33.983
Next up is going to be an episode
where we will ask the question of

00:20:34.143 --> 00:20:36.463
whether an AI can write a podcast.

00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:41.133
A quick spoiler alert is
that, yes, it can…sort of.

00:20:41.693 --> 00:20:44.873
If you don’t want to wait for that
one, I’d encourage you to check out

00:20:44.883 --> 00:20:50.193
the Leonardo English blog, where you
can watch a video of me trying to

00:20:50.193 --> 00:20:55.813
get an AI chatbot to write a podcast
episode in real time using ChatGPT.

00:20:56.533 --> 00:21:00.733
And on that note, I would certainly
encourage you to check out ChatGPT.

00:21:00.963 --> 00:21:05.643
I’ll put the link in the show notes,
or you can just google Chat OpenAI.

00:21:05.953 --> 00:21:09.523
That really is the best way to
see what this is all about, and

00:21:09.623 --> 00:21:12.113
it does feel somewhat magical.

00:21:12.864 --> 00:21:16.473
As always, I would love to know
what you thought about this episode.

00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:20.133
Do you think AI is a positive
thing for language learners?

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:22.303
How can you see yourself using it?

00:21:22.993 --> 00:21:27.773
And what about society more
broadly, how do you think AI will

00:21:27.773 --> 00:21:29.653
change the way we live our lives?

00:21:30.263 --> 00:21:33.923
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

00:21:34.463 --> 00:21:37.133
You can head right into our
community forum, which is at

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:41.843
community.leonardoenglish.com and get
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:47.433
You've been listening to English Learning
for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:48.053 --> 00:21:52.893
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and
I'll catch you in the next episode.

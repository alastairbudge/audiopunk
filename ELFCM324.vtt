Hello, hello hello, and welcome
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.870
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.390
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.090
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:26.280
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it
is the start of another three-part

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.910
mini-series, this time on three
iconic British children’s authors.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.640
In part one, today’s episode,
we’ll be exploring the curious and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.599
controversial life of Lewis Carroll,
the author of Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:46.349
Next up, in part two, we’ll look at
the life of Enid Blyton, the hugely

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.499
successful author behind the book series
such as The Famous Five and Noddy.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.509
And in the final part of our series,
part three, we’ll explore the life

00:00:56.529 --> 00:01:01.860
of Roald Dahl, a man you may know as
the author of books like Charlie and

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.970
the Chocolate Factory and Matilda.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:10.414
OK then, let’s get right into it
and go back to Victorian England

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:14.794
and kick this mini-series off
with the story of Lewis Carroll.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:21.580
To be precise, we need to go
back to the 4th of July of 1862.

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:27.924
It was a hot summer afternoon
in Oxford, a city nestled in the

00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:30.204
countryside along the river Thames.

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:36.854
The sun was shining, and a rowing
boat made its way down the river.

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:44.824
In it was 30-year-old Lewis Carroll,
his friend Robinson Duckworth, and three

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:49.164
young girls, Lorina, Edith and Alice.

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:54.294
The group were going for one of their
regular picnics on the riverbank.

00:01:54.904 --> 00:01:59.654
And to pass the time, Carroll
was telling the sisters a story

00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:05.364
about a girl named Alice who had
followed a white rabbit down a hole.

00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:12.454
This hole led to a magical land where
Alice had many bizarre adventures

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:18.654
and met many strange creatures like a
smoking caterpillar and a marching hare.

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:24.854
The girls loved the story, and
Alice was thoroughly delighted to

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:29.034
hear the tales about her namesake,
the character named after her.

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:34.974
And while it was not the first time
Carroll had entertained the girls

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:39.544
with stories, Alice’s adventures
were clearly their new favourites.

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:44.804
Alice begged him to write down the
stories so they would not be forgotten.

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:51.234
This, as you may have guessed, would
become one of the most famous children’s

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:54.534
stories in history, Alice in Wonderland.

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:59.634
The book has now been translated
into more than 170 different

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:02.694
languages in over 300 editions.

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:07.637
I’m sure many of you would have
read the story yourselves, or you

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:09.644
may have seen the film adaptation.

00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:14.184
And it can all be traced
back to this one boat ride.

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:20.874
However, the trip also captures why
Carroll has become such a controversial

00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:26.984
figure, with many now questioning
why he, a 30-year-old man, spent so

00:03:26.984 --> 00:03:29.404
much time with these young girls.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:33.929
He wasn’t their father,
their uncle, or their cousin.

00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:37.144
In fact, they weren’t in any way related.

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:41.424
They weren’t his family and he
wasn’t their guardian, in fact

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.094
he described them as his friends.

00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:48.294
The youngest of these girls
was a mere 8 years old.

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:53.404
Naturally, this has led to some
serious speculation over his

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:55.934
motives, what he was actually doing.

00:03:56.804 --> 00:04:01.344
So what was he doing, and how did
he meet the girl who became the

00:04:01.344 --> 00:04:04.904
subject of one of the most famous
children’s books in history?

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:10.284
For starters, his real name
wasn’t even Lewis Carroll.

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:12.504
It was Charles Dodgson.

00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:19.124
He was born in 1832, into a wealthy family
in Cheshire, in the north of England.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:24.814
Growing up he was one 10 children
which, as I’m sure you can imagine,

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:27.364
made for a very busy homelife.

00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:33.724
From a young age Carroll entertained
his family, telling stories, drawing

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:36.334
silly cartoons and making up games.

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:40.984
As we will see, these were hobbies
that would last his whole life.

00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:47.321
At home, Carroll was confident and
happy but outside he became shy

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:52.701
and introverted, struggling due to
his stammer, or speech impediment.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:58.221
Some historians believe that this
stammer, this speech impediment,

00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:02.571
could actually be traced back to
the fact that he was left-handed.

00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:09.971
In the Victorian period, left-handedness
was believed to be uncivilised or even

00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:15.411
the work of the devil, so children
would often be beaten and forced

00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:17.261
to use their right hand instead.

00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:22.351
Most probably, Carroll would have
suffered such punishments, leaving

00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:26.271
him with trauma that could have
contributed to developing a stammer.

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:32.941
This young boy who loved to tell stories
found himself struggling to even speak.

00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:38.871
And sadly, Carroll’s social struggles
got even worse when he fell ill and

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:43.671
became deaf in one ear, he stopped
being able to hear from one ear.

00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:48.621
And as you might expect, when
he was shipped off to a boarding

00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:54.201
school in Warwickshire, life was
not easy for this shy young boy with

00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:56.141
difficulty speaking and hearing.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:02.331
He spent his school years trying
to avoid school bullies, but it was

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:07.991
at school that he would discover
a new talent, one for mathematics.

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:14.191
He excelled in his studies of algebra,
geometry and logic, which led to him

00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:16.271
winning a place at Oxford University.

00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:22.731
He graduated from Oxford with a first
class degree, top of his class, and he

00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:27.431
was offered a teaching position at the
university, he was asked to stay on.

00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:32.207
He did stay on at Oxford,
continuing as a teacher.

00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:36.737
His students, however, we're
not particularly fond of

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:38.297
their new, young teacher.

00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:44.507
He had a reputation for being a boring,
strict, no nonsense teacher, which

00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:49.307
is perhaps surprising given that his
Alice stories are anything but boring.

00:06:50.457 --> 00:06:55.227
His students might not have liked him
very much, but he developed a reputation

00:06:55.247 --> 00:07:01.467
for himself as a well respected scholar
and academic, publishing papers and books

00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:03.927
under his real name of Charles Dodgson.

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:10.687
And mathematics was clearly a passion
that pursued him at every hour of the day.

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:17.617
At night, his mind would race with ideas
about numbers and equations, sometimes to

00:07:17.617 --> 00:07:19.487
the point that he couldn’t get to sleep.

00:07:20.437 --> 00:07:24.467
But, Carroll would later explain,
that it was during these sleepless

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:29.057
nights that he came up with many
of his ideas and concepts, which

00:07:29.087 --> 00:07:33.377
he would later publish in a book
appropriately named Pillow Problems.

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:38.657
And some of the conundrums he
pondered over at night even led to

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:43.637
him designing puzzle games, which he
eventually collected into a puzzle book.

00:07:44.477 --> 00:07:50.187
But Carroll’s puzzles and mathematical
problems weren’t his only creative output.

00:07:51.027 --> 00:07:58.217
For in 1856, aged just 24, a national
magazine published his first literary

00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:01.637
work, a romantic poem entitled Solitude.

00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:08.047
And this was the first time he used
his pen name, or fake name, his

00:08:08.147 --> 00:08:13.217
pseudonym of Lewis Carroll, which was
chosen to keep his creative writing

00:08:13.437 --> 00:08:15.387
separate from his mathematical works.

00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:21.257
But as if all of this was not already
impressive enough, Carroll was a

00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:23.347
celebrated artist in another way.

00:08:23.887 --> 00:08:27.617
And no, I’m not talking about his
career as a children’s author.

00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:29.087
We’ll get to that shortly.

00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:32.027
Carroll was also a
well-known photographer.

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:36.377
He had been fascinated by cameras
for his entire life, utterly

00:08:36.407 --> 00:08:38.487
amazed by this new technology.

00:08:39.237 --> 00:08:44.147
After all, the first camera had
only been invented in 1816, just

00:08:44.327 --> 00:08:46.107
16 years before he was born.

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:52.397
And, like most things that he tried,
Carroll excelled at taking photographs.

00:08:53.597 --> 00:08:58.897
Over the course of his life, he took
over 3000 photos, including pictures of

00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:04.107
celebrities like the poet Alfred Tennyson,
or even the Crown Prince of Denmark.

00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:10.347
And it was his use of this new flashy
technology that led him to the life

00:09:10.347 --> 00:09:12.857
changing friendship of Alice Liddel.

00:09:13.757 --> 00:09:19.437
One day in 1856, Carroll was taking
pictures of the Christ Church Cathedral,

00:09:19.697 --> 00:09:23.317
the large church in the university
college that he was attached to.

00:09:24.157 --> 00:09:27.547
He noticed a group of
young girls playing nearby.

00:09:28.337 --> 00:09:32.687
It was Alice and her two sisters,
and Carroll believed they would

00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:34.477
make the perfect photograph.

00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:40.817
The girls were daughters of the dean, or
head, of Christ Church, the same college.

00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:46.337
Determined to get his shot, Carroll
approached the family and offered

00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:49.957
to take the girls’ photograph,
much to the children’s delight.

00:09:50.777 --> 00:09:56.757
And although she was just 4 years old
at the time, Carroll found Alice to be

00:09:56.757 --> 00:09:59.047
a brilliant subject for his pictures.

00:10:00.177 --> 00:10:04.917
From that day on, he formed a
close friendship with the family,

00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:08.207
especially the young girls,
coming to see them frequently.

00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:13.687
It's even said that when he was in the
company of the children his stammer would

00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:16.427
stop and he could speak freely at length.

00:10:17.377 --> 00:10:21.697
Instead of spending time with
adults, people his own age, he would

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:26.567
take the sisters for picnics, on
boat trips, and have photography

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:28.467
sessions with them in his studio.

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:33.677
And no matter the occasion, Carroll
would entertain them with magical

00:10:33.677 --> 00:10:38.527
stories for hours on end as they
eagerly listened to every word.

00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:44.137
But it is the story of that sunny
afternoon we mentioned in the beginning

00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:48.217
of this episode that was the most
praised by the girls, it was the story

00:10:48.217 --> 00:10:50.627
of Alice that they liked the best.

00:10:51.757 --> 00:10:56.107
And following Alice’s request to write
the story down so it wasn’t forgotten,

00:10:56.527 --> 00:10:58.737
Carroll decided to put pen to paper.

00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:05.757
However, shortly after he began
to write in 1863, a sudden rift,

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:10.117
or falling out, between Carroll
and Alice’s family emerged.

00:11:10.747 --> 00:11:16.147
After many years of friendship with the
girls, and seeing them frequently, Carroll

00:11:16.337 --> 00:11:18.917
suddenly stopped seeing them altogether.

00:11:19.987 --> 00:11:26.147
Nobody knows what happened or why, as
many pages of Carroll’s diary from that

00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:28.787
time have been mysteriously ripped out.

00:11:30.007 --> 00:11:33.377
And of course, this has
led to much speculation.

00:11:34.217 --> 00:11:39.337
The most common theory is that Alice’s
family grew concerned over the close

00:11:39.357 --> 00:11:44.207
relationship between their 11-year-old
daughter and the 31-year-old man.

00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:50.627
Some even theorise that Carrol had
actually proposed to Alice, he had

00:11:50.807 --> 00:11:52.557
asked the young girl to marry him.

00:11:53.497 --> 00:11:58.477
Whatever the reason for this rupture,
this break, it didn’t stop Carroll

00:11:58.477 --> 00:12:03.017
from carrying out Alice’s wish,
and putting her story to paper.

00:12:03.817 --> 00:12:08.827
He continued to write out the stories and
intended to give the completed book to

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:11.557
her as a Christmas gift later that year.

00:12:12.247 --> 00:12:17.187
He carefully hand wrote 15,000
words and decorated many pages

00:12:17.187 --> 00:12:21.357
with illustrations, or drawings,
of the characters in the story.

00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:27.957
The final product was a masterpiece
and Alice was thrilled with the book,

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:33.317
despite its rather mundane title
of Alice’s Adventures Underground.

00:12:34.347 --> 00:12:39.327
In the story, Carroll transformed
the people in the sisters’ lives into

00:12:39.337 --> 00:12:41.537
the creatures of his fantasy land.

00:12:42.347 --> 00:12:46.327
Alice was, of course, the main
character, the hero of the book.

00:12:46.927 --> 00:12:51.327
Her nanny, Mary Prickett, was
imagined as The Red Queen, an

00:12:51.457 --> 00:12:53.607
authoritative and angry character.

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:58.777
Robinson Duckworth, Caroll’s friend
who had joined the group on the

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:03.067
boat, was presented as a duck,
due to his surname, “Duckworth”.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.636
And Carroll didn’t forget to
include himself in the story.

00:13:08.276 --> 00:13:13.446
He and the girls had often laughed
about his stammer, and his inability

00:13:13.466 --> 00:13:18.742
to pronounce his surname, Dodgson, and
how he called himself Do-do-dodgson.

00:13:19.452 --> 00:13:23.182
So, he became a dodo, the extinct bird.

00:13:24.252 --> 00:13:29.352
In the story, Carroll also included
much inspiration from his academic

00:13:29.352 --> 00:13:31.562
career, and interest in maths.

00:13:32.172 --> 00:13:36.282
You may remember that the
story is full of absurd logic

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.332
and riddles, puzzles to solve.

00:13:39.522 --> 00:13:43.582
When Alice needs to eat the correct
amount of a mushroom to grow her neck

00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:49.392
and shrink her torso to the perfect size,
some believe Carroll is alluding to his

00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:52.342
textbooks on proportions and algebra.

00:13:52.952 --> 00:13:56.972
And there are also times in
the story, when numbers don’t

00:13:56.982 --> 00:13:58.962
even function in normal ways.

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:04.432
For example, multiplications stop
making sense when Alice tries to

00:14:04.432 --> 00:14:08.822
remember them, and Alice is confused
when measurements of things become

00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:11.532
varied and are no longer constant.

00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:17.412
Some have even theorised that this
strangeness was Carroll mocking,

00:14:17.452 --> 00:14:22.182
making fun of new concepts in
symbolic algebra that he opposed.

00:14:22.982 --> 00:14:26.732
Clearly, it was a wonderful
story for Caroll and the girls,

00:14:26.842 --> 00:14:29.842
as they could recognise people
from their own life in it.

00:14:30.872 --> 00:14:36.572
But this bizarre and nonsensical world
would turn out to be one that was loved

00:14:36.612 --> 00:14:41.772
and enjoyed by children from all over the
world, who had no idea about the original

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:43.402
people the characters were based on.

00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:49.272
Caroll, of course, had no idea about how
much of a resounding success it would

00:14:49.282 --> 00:14:51.652
be when he first started writing it.

00:14:52.572 --> 00:14:57.452
After writing the story, and unsure
about what to do with it, Carroll spoke

00:14:57.452 --> 00:15:01.732
to his friend George Macdonald who
was a successful author at the time.

00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:06.522
Macdonald took home the copy of
Alice’s Adventures Underground

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:08.932
to read it to his 6-year-old son.

00:15:10.182 --> 00:15:14.902
Unsurprisingly, and this seems to
be a theme with children’s books,

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:17.416
the boy absolutely loved it.

00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:22.132
He said he ‘wished there were
60,000 volumes of it’, in other

00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:24.322
words, he wished it would never end.

00:15:25.252 --> 00:15:29.062
So, Carroll decided to prepare
the work for publication.

00:15:29.932 --> 00:15:35.352
He added some new stories and characters
such as the Mad Hatter’s tea party and

00:15:35.564 --> 00:15:37.872
Alice’s meeting with the Cheshire Cat.

00:15:38.682 --> 00:15:43.162
He also began to think of a new
title, with possibilities being

00:15:43.382 --> 00:15:48.742
Alice Among the Fairies or Alice’s
Golden Hour but he finally settled

00:15:48.742 --> 00:15:51.592
on Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

00:15:52.832 --> 00:15:58.112
For the book, he also enlisted a man
called John Tenniel, a cartoonist,

00:15:58.112 --> 00:16:02.542
or illustrator, from the comedy
magazine Punch and one who was

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:06.302
famous for his animal illustrations
in the book Aesop’s Fables.

00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:14.272
By November 1865 the book was published
and it did not take long for the initial

00:16:14.282 --> 00:16:16.662
print of 5000 copies to sell out.

00:16:17.832 --> 00:16:22.722
Among the earliest fans of the book were
Oscar Wilde and even Queen Victoria.

00:16:23.722 --> 00:16:28.312
And the book’s popularity only
grew after its sequel, Through the

00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:31.426
Looking Glass, was published In 1871

00:16:32.672 --> 00:16:37.972
And although Carroll was hesitant about
growing famous, and despite the fact

00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:43.622
that he used a pen name, a pseudonym,
by the time of his sudden death in 1898

00:16:43.812 --> 00:16:46.012
he had become something of a celebrity.

00:16:46.942 --> 00:16:49.472
So what made the books so popular?

00:16:50.222 --> 00:16:56.682
Well, this format of a magical children’s
world might seem obvious to us now, but

00:16:56.862 --> 00:17:01.582
back in the late 19th century it was
like nothing people had seen before.

00:17:02.702 --> 00:17:07.112
Firstly, Alice was the first
children’s novel with a strong

00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:09.762
and confident female protagonist.

00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:16.022
Clearly, for girls who simply hadn’t ever
read stories about strong and independent

00:17:16.022 --> 00:17:18.612
girls before, it must have been wonderful.

00:17:19.842 --> 00:17:24.852
Secondly, the book was hugely innovative
through its nonsense, through the fact

00:17:24.852 --> 00:17:28.692
that it didn’t make a huge amount of
sense, and that was the beauty of it.

00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:35.022
Traditionally, Victorian children’s books
had always been dogged with some sort

00:17:35.022 --> 00:17:37.872
of moral lesson for children to learn.

00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:42.502
Books were viewed as a way for
children to be taught how to behave.

00:17:43.582 --> 00:17:47.362
Carroll’s book, however, was
written purely to entertain

00:17:47.652 --> 00:17:49.772
and delight his young audience.

00:17:50.532 --> 00:17:54.262
For the first time, children
were being encouraged to simply

00:17:54.262 --> 00:17:56.552
let their imagination run wild.

00:17:57.632 --> 00:18:02.012
And this has been a recipe for
success for centuries afterwards,

00:18:02.172 --> 00:18:07.182
with Alice in Wonderland remaining
in print since 1865 and selling at

00:18:07.192 --> 00:18:09.782
least 100 million copies worldwide.

00:18:10.962 --> 00:18:15.402
If you read it as a child, or if
you’ve seen the movie adaptation,

00:18:15.632 --> 00:18:17.332
you can probably understand why.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.282
But while the success of Alice has
stood the test of time, Carroll’s

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:28.452
own reputation has not, as debates
around his relationship with children

00:18:28.462 --> 00:18:31.022
have cast a shadow over his career.

00:18:31.862 --> 00:18:36.452
Not only did he spend large amounts
of time with young children, he took

00:18:36.462 --> 00:18:38.452
a lot of pictures of the young girls.

00:18:39.382 --> 00:18:43.422
And by modern standards at
least, they are quite shocking.

00:18:44.212 --> 00:18:49.212
One shows a 6-year-old Alice posing
like an adult with her dress positioned

00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:51.872
in a way which reveals her upper body.

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:56.652
Another picture of a fully nude
girl of around 12 years old

00:18:56.854 --> 00:19:00.415
has also been discovered and is
believed to belong to Carroll.

00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:06.205
While images like these would certainly
not be acceptable in this day and

00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:11.205
age, some historians have pointed out
that in the Victorian period this was

00:19:11.345 --> 00:19:13.635
not as shocking as it might now seem.

00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:19.785
Many people believed children were symbols
of innocence, and naked children could

00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:24.526
be found on birthday cards, Christmas
cards, and in all manner of art.

00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:29.545
It wasn’t, so the argument
goes, in any way sexual.

00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:34.155
Now, I should add that there’s
no evidence that Carroll ever did

00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:38.425
anything other than spend time with
and photograph any of these children,

00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:43.265
and Alice for instance, never had
anything negative to say about him.

00:19:44.345 --> 00:19:49.145
But his behaviour still raises
alarm bells to modern eyes, and the

00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:52.705
debate around Carroll’s relationship
with Alice still rages on.

00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:57.815
Ultimately, the question of
who Lewis Carroll actually

00:19:57.815 --> 00:19:59.985
was still remains unsolved.

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:05.585
He was a gifted mathematician, a
talented photographer, a half-decent

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.125
poet, and a magical author.

00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:12.805
He was also an unmarried adult
who was friends with children.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:17.295
Was that all there was to it,
or did he want something more?

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:22.805
In all probability, we will never
know, and the riddle, the puzzle

00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:25.635
will endure for as long as his books.

00:20:26.965 --> 00:20:32.725
As his creation, Alice, would
famously say “Who in the world am I?

00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:35.865
Ah, that’s the great puzzle.”

00:20:38.315 --> 00:20:42.375
Ok then, that is it for part
one of this mini-series, on the

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.245
bizarre life of Lewis Carroll.

00:20:44.775 --> 00:20:48.795
Next up it’s going to be the two-faced
life of the best selling children’s

00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:53.725
author of the 20th century, Enid Blyton,
and after that it’ll be Roald Dahl.

00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:57.445
As always I would love to know what
you thought about this episode.

00:20:57.805 --> 00:20:59.555
Have you read Alice in Wonderland?

00:21:00.045 --> 00:21:03.395
Did you know Alice in Wonderland
was based on a real Alice?

00:21:03.815 --> 00:21:07.285
Do you think the controversy
surrounding Carroll’s reputation should

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:09.295
impact the popularity of his books?

00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:13.155
I would love to know, so let’s

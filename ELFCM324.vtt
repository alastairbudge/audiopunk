I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is the start of another three-part

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.910
mini-series, this time on three iconic British children’s authors.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.640
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll be exploring the curious and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.599
controversial life of Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:46.349
Next up, in part two, we’ll look at the life of Enid Blyton, the hugely

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.499
successful author behind the book series such as The Famous Five and Noddy.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.280
And in the final part of our series, part three, we’ll explore the life of Roald Dahl, a

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.970
man you may know as the author of books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.549
OK then, let’s get right into it and go back to Victorian England

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.929
and kick this mini-series off with the story of Lewis Carroll.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.715
To be precise, we need to go back to the 4th of July of 1862.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.340
It was a hot summer afternoon in Oxford, a city nestled in the countryside along the river Thames.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.990
The sun was shining, and a rowing boat made its way down the river.

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:25.260
In it was 30-year-old Lewis Carroll, his friend Robinson

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.300
Duckworth, and three young girls, Lorina, Edith and Alice.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.430
The group were going for one of their regular picnics on the riverbank.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.309
And to pass the time, Carroll was telling the sisters a story about

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.500
a girl named Alice who had followed a white rabbit down a hole.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.860
This hole led to a magical land where Alice had many bizarre adventures and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.790
met many strange creatures like a smoking caterpillar and a marching hare.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.990
The girls loved the story, and Alice was thoroughly delighted to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.170
hear the tales about her namesake, the character named after her.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.110
And while it was not the first time Carroll had entertained the girls

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.680
with stories, Alice’s adventures were clearly their new favourites.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.940
Alice begged him to write down the stories so they would not be forgotten.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.050
This, as you may have guessed, would become one of the most

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.670
famous children’s stories in history, Alice in Wonderland.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.830
The book has now been translated into more than 170 different languages in over 300 editions.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.779
I’m sure many of you would have read the story yourselves, or you may have seen the film adaptation.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.319
And it can all be traced back to this one boat ride.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.890
However, the trip also captures why Carroll has become such a controversial figure, with

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:11.539
many now questioning why he, a 30-year-old man, spent so much time with these young girls.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.065
He wasn’t their father, their uncle, or their cousin.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.280
In fact, they weren’t in any way related.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.230
They weren’t his family and he wasn’t their guardian, in fact he described them as his friends.

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.429
The youngest of these girls was a mere 8 years old.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.070
Naturally, this has led to some serious speculation over his motives, what he was actually doing.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.480
So what was he doing, and how did he meet the girl who became the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.040
subject of one of the most famous children’s books in history?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.419
For starters, his real name wasn’t even Lewis Carroll.

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.639
It was Charles Dodgson.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.260
He was born in 1832, into a wealthy family in Cheshire, in the north of England.

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.500
Growing up he was one 10 children which, as I’m sure you can imagine, made for a very busy homelife.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.390
From a young age Carroll entertained his family, telling

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.470
stories, drawing silly cartoons and making up games.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.120
As we will see, these were hobbies that would last his whole life.

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:29.456
At home, Carroll was confident and happy but outside he became shy

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:34.836
and introverted, struggling due to his stammer, or speech impediment.

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:40.356
Some historians believe that this stammer, this speech impediment,

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:44.706
could actually be traced back to the fact that he was left-handed.

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:52.333
In the Victorian period, left-handedness was believed to be uncivilised or even the work

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:59.396
of the devil, so children would often be beaten and forced to use their right hand instead.

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:04.486
Most probably, Carroll would have suffered such punishments, leaving

00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:08.406
him with trauma that could have contributed to developing a stammer.

00:06:09.576 --> 00:06:15.076
This young boy who loved to tell stories found himself struggling to even speak.

00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:20.886
And sadly, Carroll’s social struggles got even worse when he fell ill

00:06:20.886 --> 00:06:25.806
and became deaf in one ear, he stopped being able to hear from one ear.

00:06:26.676 --> 00:06:32.176
And as you might expect, when he was shipped off to a boarding school in Warwickshire,

00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:38.276
life was not easy for this shy young boy with difficulty speaking and hearing.

00:06:39.726 --> 00:06:44.466
He spent his school years trying to avoid school bullies, but it was

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:50.126
at school that he would discover a new talent, one for mathematics.

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:55.126
He excelled in his studies of algebra, geometry and logic,

00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:58.406
which led to him winning a place at Oxford University.

00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:04.866
He graduated from Oxford with a first class degree, top of his class, and he

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:09.566
was offered a teaching position at the university, he was asked to stay on.

00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:14.343
He did stay on at Oxford, continuing as a teacher.

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:20.433
His students, however, we're not particularly fond of their new, young teacher.

00:07:20.943 --> 00:07:26.643
He had a reputation for being a boring, strict, no nonsense teacher, which

00:07:26.703 --> 00:07:31.443
is perhaps surprising given that his Alice stories are anything but boring.

00:07:32.593 --> 00:07:39.293
His students might not have liked him very much, but he developed a reputation for himself as a well

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:46.063
respected scholar and academic, publishing papers and books under his real name of Charles Dodgson.

00:07:47.173 --> 00:07:52.823
And mathematics was clearly a passion that pursued him at every hour of the day.

00:07:53.893 --> 00:07:58.073
At night, his mind would race with ideas about numbers and

00:07:58.083 --> 00:08:01.623
equations, sometimes to the point that he couldn’t get to sleep.

00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:06.603
But, Carroll would later explain, that it was during these sleepless

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:11.413
nights that he came up with many of his ideas and concepts, which he

00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:15.513
would later publish in a book appropriately named Pillow Problems.

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:21.033
And some of the conundrums he pondered over at night even led to him

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:25.773
designing puzzle games, which he eventually collected into a puzzle book.

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:32.323
But Carroll’s puzzles and mathematical problems weren’t his only creative output.

00:08:33.163 --> 00:08:39.063
For in 1856, aged just 24, a national magazine published

00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:43.772
his first literary work, a romantic poem entitled Solitude.

00:08:44.933 --> 00:08:51.873
And this was the first time he used his pen name, or fake name, his pseudonym of Lewis

00:08:51.873 --> 00:08:57.523
Carroll, which was chosen to keep his creative writing separate from his mathematical works.

00:08:58.563 --> 00:09:01.783
But as if all of this was not already impressive

00:09:01.803 --> 00:09:05.483
enough, Carroll was a celebrated artist in another way.

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:09.753
And no, I’m not talking about his career as a children’s author.

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:11.223
We’ll get to that shortly.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.163
Carroll was also a well-known photographer.

00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:20.622
He had been fascinated by cameras for his entire life, utterly amazed by this new technology.

00:09:21.372 --> 00:09:28.242
After all, the first camera had only been invented in 1816, just 16 years before he was born.

00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:34.532
And, like most things that he tried, Carroll excelled at taking photographs.

00:09:35.732 --> 00:09:41.032
Over the course of his life, he took over 3000 photos, including pictures of

00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:46.242
celebrities like the poet Alfred Tennyson, or even the Crown Prince of Denmark.

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:51.462
And it was his use of this new flashy technology that

00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:54.992
led him to the life changing friendship of Alice Liddel.

00:09:55.892 --> 00:10:01.572
One day in 1856, Carroll was taking pictures of the Christ Church Cathedral,

00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:05.452
the large church in the university college that he was attached to.

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:09.682
He noticed a group of young girls playing nearby.

00:10:10.472 --> 00:10:16.612
It was Alice and her two sisters, and Carroll believed they would make the perfect photograph.

00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:22.952
The girls were daughters of the dean, or head, of Christ Church, the same college.

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:28.472
Determined to get his shot, Carroll approached the family and offered

00:10:28.572 --> 00:10:32.092
to take the girls’ photograph, much to the children’s delight.

00:10:32.912 --> 00:10:37.472
And although she was just 4 years old at the time, Carroll

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:41.182
found Alice to be a brilliant subject for his pictures.

00:10:42.312 --> 00:10:47.052
From that day on, he formed a close friendship with the family,

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:50.342
especially the young girls, coming to see them frequently.

00:10:51.252 --> 00:10:54.422
It's even said that when he was in the company of the children

00:10:54.652 --> 00:10:58.562
his stammer would stop and he could speak freely at length.

00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:05.122
Instead of spending time with adults, people his own age, he would take the sisters

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:10.602
for picnics, on boat trips, and have photography sessions with them in his studio.

00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:15.812
And no matter the occasion, Carroll would entertain them with magical

00:11:15.812 --> 00:11:20.662
stories for hours on end as they eagerly listened to every word.

00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:27.042
But it is the story of that sunny afternoon we mentioned in the beginning of this episode

00:11:27.122 --> 00:11:32.762
that was the most praised by the girls, it was the story of Alice that they liked the best.

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:37.222
And following Alice’s request to write the story down so

00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:40.872
it wasn’t forgotten, Carroll decided to put pen to paper.

00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:47.892
However, shortly after he began to write in 1863, a sudden rift,

00:11:47.912 --> 00:11:52.252
or falling out, between Carroll and Alice’s family emerged.

00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:56.722
After many years of friendship with the girls, and seeing them

00:11:56.732 --> 00:12:01.052
frequently, Carroll suddenly stopped seeing them altogether.

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:07.062
Nobody knows what happened or why, as many pages of Carroll’s

00:12:07.072 --> 00:12:10.922
diary from that time have been mysteriously ripped out.

00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:15.512
And of course, this has led to much speculation.

00:12:16.352 --> 00:12:21.472
The most common theory is that Alice’s family grew concerned over the close

00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:26.342
relationship between their 11-year-old daughter and the 31-year-old man.

00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:31.552
Some even theorise that Carrol had actually proposed

00:12:31.742 --> 00:12:34.692
to Alice, he had asked the young girl to marry him.

00:12:35.632 --> 00:12:40.162
Whatever the reason for this rupture, this break, it didn’t stop

00:12:40.232 --> 00:12:45.152
Carroll from carrying out Alice’s wish, and putting her story to paper.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:49.482
He continued to write out the stories and intended to give

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:53.692
the completed book to her as a Christmas gift later that year.

00:12:54.382 --> 00:12:59.322
He carefully hand wrote 15,000 words and decorated many pages

00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:03.492
with illustrations, or drawings, of the characters in the story.

00:13:04.882 --> 00:13:09.752
The final product was a masterpiece and Alice was thrilled with the

00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:15.452
book, despite its rather mundane title of Alice’s Adventures Underground.

00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:20.152
In the story, Carroll transformed the people in the

00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:23.672
sisters’ lives into the creatures of his fantasy land.

00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:28.462
Alice was, of course, the main character, the hero of the book.

00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:35.742
Her nanny, Mary Prickett, was imagined as The Red Queen, an authoritative and angry character.

00:13:36.902 --> 00:13:40.822
Robinson Duckworth, Caroll’s friend who had joined the group on

00:13:40.822 --> 00:13:45.202
the boat, was presented as a duck, due to his surname, “Duckworth”.

00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:49.771
And Carroll didn’t forget to include himself in the story.

00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:55.701
He and the girls had often laughed about his stammer, and his inability to

00:13:55.701 --> 00:14:00.877
pronounce his surname, Dodgson, and how he called himself Do-do-dodgson.

00:14:01.587 --> 00:14:05.317
So, he became a dodo, the extinct bird.

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:10.247
In the story, Carroll also included much inspiration

00:14:10.277 --> 00:14:13.697
from his academic career, and interest in maths.

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:20.467
You may remember that the story is full of absurd logic and riddles, puzzles to solve.

00:14:21.657 --> 00:14:27.707
When Alice needs to eat the correct amount of a mushroom to grow her neck and shrink her torso to

00:14:27.707 --> 00:14:34.477
the perfect size, some believe Carroll is alluding to his textbooks on proportions and algebra.

00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:41.097
And there are also times in the story, when numbers don’t even function in normal ways.

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:47.677
For example, multiplications stop making sense when Alice tries to remember them, and

00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:53.667
Alice is confused when measurements of things become varied and are no longer constant.

00:14:54.457 --> 00:14:59.547
Some have even theorised that this strangeness was Carroll mocking,

00:14:59.587 --> 00:15:04.317
making fun of new concepts in symbolic algebra that he opposed.

00:15:05.117 --> 00:15:08.867
Clearly, it was a wonderful story for Caroll and the girls,

00:15:08.977 --> 00:15:11.977
as they could recognise people from their own life in it.

00:15:13.007 --> 00:15:17.717
But this bizarre and nonsensical world would turn out to be one

00:15:17.887 --> 00:15:21.927
that was loved and enjoyed by children from all over the world, who

00:15:21.927 --> 00:15:25.537
had no idea about the original people the characters were based on.

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:30.617
Caroll, of course, had no idea about how much of a resounding

00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:33.787
success it would be when he first started writing it.

00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:39.587
After writing the story, and unsure about what to do with it, Carroll spoke

00:15:39.587 --> 00:15:43.867
to his friend George Macdonald who was a successful author at the time.

00:15:45.057 --> 00:15:51.067
Macdonald took home the copy of Alice’s Adventures Underground to read it to his 6-year-old son.

00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:59.552
Unsurprisingly, and this seems to be a theme with children’s books, the boy absolutely loved it.

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:06.457
He said he ‘wished there were 60,000 volumes of it’, in other words, he wished it would never end.

00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:11.197
So, Carroll decided to prepare the work for publication.

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:16.117
He added some new stories and characters such as the Mad

00:16:16.127 --> 00:16:20.007
Hatter’s tea party and Alice’s meeting with the Cheshire Cat.

00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:27.017
He also began to think of a new title, with possibilities being Alice Among the Fairies

00:16:27.107 --> 00:16:33.727
or Alice’s Golden Hour but he finally settled on Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:40.247
For the book, he also enlisted a man called John Tenniel, a cartoonist,

00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:44.677
or illustrator, from the comedy magazine Punch and one who was

00:16:44.677 --> 00:16:48.437
famous for his animal illustrations in the book Aesop’s Fables.

00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:54.847
By November 1865 the book was published and it did not

00:16:54.877 --> 00:16:58.797
take long for the initial print of 5000 copies to sell out.

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:04.857
Among the earliest fans of the book were Oscar Wilde and even Queen Victoria.

00:17:05.857 --> 00:17:09.607
And the book’s popularity only grew after its sequel,

00:17:09.907 --> 00:17:13.561
Through the Looking Glass, was published In 1871

00:17:14.807 --> 00:17:21.027
And although Carroll was hesitant about growing famous, and despite the fact that he used a pen

00:17:21.027 --> 00:17:28.147
name, a pseudonym, by the time of his sudden death in 1898 he had become something of a celebrity.

00:17:29.077 --> 00:17:31.607
So what made the books so popular?

00:17:32.357 --> 00:17:38.397
Well, this format of a magical children’s world might seem obvious to us now,

00:17:38.597 --> 00:17:43.717
but back in the late 19th century it was like nothing people had seen before.

00:17:44.837 --> 00:17:51.897
Firstly, Alice was the first children’s novel with a strong and confident female protagonist.

00:17:52.767 --> 00:17:56.687
Clearly, for girls who simply hadn’t ever read stories about

00:17:56.687 --> 00:18:00.747
strong and independent girls before, it must have been wonderful.

00:18:01.977 --> 00:18:06.717
Secondly, the book was hugely innovative through its nonsense, through the

00:18:06.717 --> 00:18:10.827
fact that it didn’t make a huge amount of sense, and that was the beauty of it.

00:18:12.027 --> 00:18:15.737
Traditionally, Victorian children’s books had always been

00:18:15.947 --> 00:18:20.007
dogged with some sort of moral lesson for children to learn.

00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:24.637
Books were viewed as a way for children to be taught how to behave.

00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:31.907
Carroll’s book, however, was written purely to entertain and delight his young audience.

00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:38.687
For the first time, children were being encouraged to simply let their imagination run wild.

00:18:39.767 --> 00:18:45.657
And this has been a recipe for success for centuries afterwards, with Alice in Wonderland

00:18:45.797 --> 00:18:51.917
remaining in print since 1865 and selling at least 100 million copies worldwide.

00:18:53.097 --> 00:18:59.467
If you read it as a child, or if you’ve seen the movie adaptation, you can probably understand why.

00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:07.097
But while the success of Alice has stood the test of time, Carroll’s own reputation has

00:19:07.097 --> 00:19:13.157
not, as debates around his relationship with children have cast a shadow over his career.

00:19:13.997 --> 00:19:17.397
Not only did he spend large amounts of time with young

00:19:17.397 --> 00:19:20.587
children, he took a lot of pictures of the young girls.

00:19:21.517 --> 00:19:25.557
And by modern standards at least, they are quite shocking.

00:19:26.347 --> 00:19:30.437
One shows a 6-year-old Alice posing like an adult with her

00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:34.007
dress positioned in a way which reveals her upper body.

00:19:34.867 --> 00:19:38.787
Another picture of a fully nude girl of around 12 years old

00:19:38.989 --> 00:19:42.550
has also been discovered and is believed to belong to Carroll.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:49.990
While images like these would certainly not be acceptable in this day and age, some historians

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:55.770
have pointed out that in the Victorian period this was not as shocking as it might now seem.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.790
Many people believed children were symbols of innocence, and naked children

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:06.661
could be found on birthday cards, Christmas cards, and in all manner of art.

00:20:07.481 --> 00:20:11.680
It wasn’t, so the argument goes, in any way sexual.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.890
Now, I should add that there’s no evidence that Carroll ever did anything

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.310
other than spend time with and photograph any of these children, and

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.400
Alice for instance, never had anything negative to say about him.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.280
But his behaviour still raises alarm bells to modern eyes, and the

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.840
debate around Carroll’s relationship with Alice still rages on.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:42.120
Ultimately, the question of who Lewis Carroll actually was still remains unsolved.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:50.260
He was a gifted mathematician, a talented photographer, a half-decent poet, and a magical author.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.940
He was also an unmarried adult who was friends with children.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.430
Was that all there was to it, or did he want something more?

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.990
In all probability, we will never know, and the riddle,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.770
the puzzle will endure for as long as his books.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.860
As his creation, Alice, would famously say “Who in the world am I?

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.000
Ah, that’s the great puzzle.”

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:26.380
Ok then, that is it for part one of this mini-series, on the bizarre life of Lewis Carroll.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.930
Next up it’s going to be the two-faced life of the best selling children’s

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:35.860
author of the 20th century, Enid Blyton, and after that it’ll be Roald Dahl.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.580
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

Have you read Alice in Wonderland?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.530
Did you know Alice in Wonderland was based on a real Alice?

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.310
Do you think the controversy surrounding Carroll’s

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.430
reputation should impact the popularity of his books?

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.290

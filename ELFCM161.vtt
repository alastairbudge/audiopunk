Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:17.167
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:22.167
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:28.017
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about cricket.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:35.997
Now, because you are most likely not from the UK, the sport of cricket might seem a little strange.

00:00:36.687 --> 00:00:39.077
Perhaps you have no idea what it is.

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:46.587
Or perhaps you have seen clips on TV or YouTube of people dressed in white on a large

00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:52.197
grass field running up and down after a ball, but you don’t really know what’s going on.

00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:56.907
In either case, in today’s episode we will learn about,

00:00:57.197 --> 00:01:01.377
and try to demystify this weird and wonderful game.

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:09.347
It’s hard to think of a sport that is more quintessentially English than cricket, and I hope

00:01:09.577 --> 00:01:15.847
that in 20 minutes' time you’ll have a much better understanding of where it comes from, how

00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:22.757
cricket actually is played, some of the controversies that have surrounded the sport, and this

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:29.317
will all help you understand why it is such a culturally important part of life in the UK.

00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:35.037
Right, we have a lot to learn about today, so let's get started.

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:42.617
Let me start by telling the story of perhaps the most famous cricket match in recent

00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:48.147
English history, which gives you an idea about quite how strange this game is.

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:57.427
On the 12th of September, 2005, 11 Englishmen stood in a very large green field.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:03.847
In the middle of the field were two Australians, each holding a large piece of wood.

00:02:05.017 --> 00:02:09.977
These men had been standing in 5 different fields across England for

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:16.007
21 days, watched by thousands of people in the crowds, and millions of

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:21.007
people on TVs around the world, but mainly in England and Australia.

00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:28.097
A tall Englishman held a hard red ball in his hand, then ran fast

00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:33.467
towards one of the Australians, and threw the ball as fast as he could.

00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:40.257
The ball flew towards the Australian at 145 km per hour.

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:46.917
The Australian swung his bat, hit the ball slightly, lifting it up a little bit.

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:52.697
Behind him stood an Englishman with very large gloves,

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:56.667
who dived down to the ground to catch the ball.

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:05.847
He caught it, a man dressed in a white shirt and tie put up his finger, and the crowds went wild.

00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:09.557
Finally, the England team had won the game.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:13.047
And what was their prize for this victory?

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:23.517
A very small wooden trophy, just 15cm high, containing some ash, the remains of some burnt wood.

00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:30.477
Now, when described like this the game of cricket doesn’t make a huge amount of sense.

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:35.507
But the beauty of cricket is that a lot of it doesn’t make much

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:40.397
sense, and intentionally so, it doesn’t try to make much sense.

00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:45.877
This doesn’t stop it being one of the most popular sports in the UK,

00:03:46.207 --> 00:03:51.087
the most popular sport in the world’s second largest country, India, and

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:55.867
a sport with hundreds of millions of devoted fans all over the world.

00:03:56.947 --> 00:04:01.177
I should say that I am not one of those massively devoted fans.

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:05.417
I played cricket when I was younger, but was never very good at it.

00:04:05.957 --> 00:04:09.257
I also started playing cricket in Scotland.

00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:15.003
Cricket involves a lot of standing around waiting for things to happen, and if

00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:20.523
you are standing around for hours at a time wearing not very much in Scotland,

00:04:20.903 --> 00:04:25.023
well, you’ll get quite cold and probably not have a huge amount of fun.

00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:31.943
But this doesn’t stop one from admiring the sport, and it certainly

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:35.723
should not stop you from understanding where it comes from, and

00:04:35.873 --> 00:04:40.343
why it is such a culturally significant part of life in the UK.

00:04:41.643 --> 00:04:44.373
So, where did it all begin?

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:50.673
Its origins are obscure, but it seems that it was well underway

00:04:50.683 --> 00:04:54.443
in southern England by the second half of the 17th century.

00:04:55.103 --> 00:05:00.743
Like theatre, dancing and gambling, it re-emerged with the Restoration

00:05:00.903 --> 00:05:06.603
of Charles II, the king nicknamed the Merry Monarch, in 1660.

00:05:07.593 --> 00:05:15.373
Before the return of Charles II, Britain had experienced two decades of rule by the Puritans,

00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:22.343
a group with hardline religious views who basically outlawed anything that was too much fun.

00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:28.413
Having too much fun was considered sinful, and therefore bright

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:33.433
clothing, theatre, and enjoyable sports were off the menu.

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:41.453
At this time, cricket involved the ball being rolled along the ground and hit with a rounded

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:48.403
stick which would’ve looked a bit more like a modern hockey stick, a stick with a rounded end.

00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:55.683
The game was played by village teams in the south of England - villages would play

00:05:55.683 --> 00:06:02.193
each other, and as travel became easier, through developments like an improved railway

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:07.823
network, cricket teams would be able to travel further to play against each other.

00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:13.798
From its early days, it was a game that attracted gambling, with

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:18.008
people betting large amounts of money on the result of a game.

00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:24.168
Indeed, in 1664 parliament had to pass a law limiting

00:06:24.178 --> 00:06:27.538
the amount that could be bet on a single cricket match.

00:06:28.328 --> 00:06:34.398
The amount was £100, which is about €2,500 in today’s money.

00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:40.278
It might not sound like a massive amount of money, but it was more

00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:45.528
than the annual wage of 99% of the country’s population at the time.

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:50.508
This gives us a bit of an indication about who was

00:06:50.518 --> 00:06:54.048
playing the sport, or at least who was gambling on it.

00:06:54.528 --> 00:06:56.438
The wealthier people in society.

00:06:57.218 --> 00:07:01.001
Now, you might say, “obviously - the poorest people in

00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:05.021
society didn't have the time or money to play sport".

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.840
But it wasn’t only the rich who were playing.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.870
In the early days, there were actually two different categories of player.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.920
There was the so-called ‘amateur’ cricket player, and the ‘professional’ player.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.260
The ‘amateurs’ were the rich, the noble, players.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.900
The ‘professionals’ were the poorer, working-class players.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.420
The richer players realised that they needed the best quality players on

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.590
their teams in order to have the best chance of winning their matches,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.010
and would therefore recruit cricket players from the lower social classes.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:51.420
But they would make sure that there was a clear distinction between the two.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:58.580
The amateurs wouldn’t be paid to play, they could only claim expenses, in theory at least.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.170
And the two different classes of player would even

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.080
have separate changing rooms and dining facilities.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.530
This really gives you an idea about the strangeness of the

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.460
game, and its relationship with the British social class system.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:23.680
Moving on to the development of cricket, it spread from the villages

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.030
of southern England further north, and some of the most passionate

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:32.060
cricketing regions can now be found in the north of the country.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.720
And, of course, with the British empire, it spread

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.387
abroad, to the countries that Britain had colonised.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:48.790
The British soldiers and diplomats living in these countries often didn’t have a huge amount to do.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:56.300
The weather was good, and cricket was a leisurely sport, an activity that would

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.700
take up quite a long time and not require a huge amount of physical effort.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:09.720
It was no doubt quite a lot of fun to be outside in the sun for a few days at a time, only

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.740
breaking for a large lunch, tea, and plenty of drinking when it was all over in the evening.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.800
Naturally, it became popular almost everywhere it was played.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.900
Indeed, the list of the top cricketing countries in the

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.400
world has a large overlap with a list of ex-British colonies.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.370
It’s currently New Zealand, Australia, India, England, South Africa,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.040
Pakistan, Bangladesh, The West Indies, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.080
It might sound like a strange game to have become so popular.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.800
You do need a large space to play it, it takes quite

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.780
a long time in general, and you need several people.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.700
If you contrast it to football, for example, with football you can

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.130
have some fun playing it on your own or just with a few people, you

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.800
only really need one ball, and you don’t need much space to do it.

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:13.484
It is in many ways unlikely that cricket became so popular.

00:10:14.524 --> 00:10:20.544
But, you only need to go to a small Indian village to see how popular it really is.

00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:27.764
Culturally, it is now incredibly important in countries such as India, and the sporting

00:10:27.814 --> 00:10:34.694
idol of a young Indian boy, the person who they would look up to the most, that person

00:10:34.814 --> 00:10:41.324
is more likely to be the cricketer Sachin Tendulkar than a footballer like Lionel Messi.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:47.824
Now, let’s briefly pause to discuss how cricket actually works.

00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:55.324
It is a complicated game, and there are numerous rules, but I’ll provide you with an outline here.

00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:58.694
There are two teams, two sides.

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:03.944
Each side has 11 players, so there are 22 players in total,

00:11:04.394 --> 00:11:09.594
but no more than 13 players are on the pitch at any one time.

00:11:10.206 --> 00:11:16.556
11 from one side, which is doing what’s called ‘fielding’, and two from the other

00:11:16.616 --> 00:11:21.696
side, which is doing what’s called ‘batting’, they are trying to hit the ball.

00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:26.596
The remaining nine are sitting on the side, waiting their turn.

00:11:27.696 --> 00:11:32.406
Back on the pitch, which is technically called a cricket field, there

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:36.916
is a piece of ground in the middle where all the action takes place.

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:43.436
Long story short, one person from the fielding side runs up

00:11:43.696 --> 00:11:47.386
and throws the ball at one of people on the batting side.

00:11:48.156 --> 00:11:52.836
That person tries to hit the ball as far as they can, away from

00:11:52.836 --> 00:11:56.736
all of the other players who are standing around trying to stop it.

00:11:57.406 --> 00:12:04.356
If they manage to hit it, they can choose to run up and down, and this is how they score points.

00:12:05.406 --> 00:12:09.866
They also have another objective, another goal, which is

00:12:09.886 --> 00:12:13.936
to stop the ball hitting three wooden sticks behind them.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:22.496
The aim of the person throwing the ball is to throw it so fast, or in such a complicated way

00:12:22.816 --> 00:12:30.366
that the person batting can’t hit it properly, and the ball either hits the sticks behind

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:36.026
them, or they hit the ball into the air and one of the players on the other side catches it.

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:40.896
If the ball is caught by the other team, or if it hits the sticks

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:46.296
behind them, the batsman is ‘out’, and is replaced by another player.

00:12:47.346 --> 00:12:52.256
Now, the rules are more complicated than that, but this is the general idea.

00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:57.976
What you may have noticed is that there are only a few people who are

00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:03.786
actively involved in every part of it, the rest are watching from a distance.

00:13:04.456 --> 00:13:10.316
If you are on the team that is fielding, that is stopping the ball, yes you need to

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:15.456
pay attention, but there is a lot of standing around until the ball comes your way.

00:13:16.236 --> 00:13:20.496
You could say that this is one of the reasons that cricket never became

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:25.776
quite so popular in Scotland as it is in England, as anyone standing

00:13:25.796 --> 00:13:29.696
around waiting for something to happen is likely to get pretty cold.

00:13:30.996 --> 00:13:35.056
Another peculiarity about cricket is that it can take a very

00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:40.716
long time for anything to actually happen, for a team to win.

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:44.416
There are different types of cricket matches, but

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:47.936
the classic one is something called a ‘test’ match.

00:13:48.736 --> 00:13:52.516
Now, with this type of cricket match it is possible to play

00:13:52.516 --> 00:13:57.106
for 5 days in a row and for there still to be no winner.

00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:03.156
And with some cricket matches they are really extended competitions.

00:14:04.046 --> 00:14:10.036
With the one I mentioned at the start of the episode, which is called the Ashes, that

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:16.336
can go on for 25 days in total and it’s possible for there still to be no winner.

00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:21.496
So, being a cricket fan does require some patience!

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:29.686
Now, in terms of cricket today, and how things have developed since the early days of it being a

00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:36.966
sort of ‘two-tiered’ sport, it has retained a lot of its reputation of being a gentleman’s game.

00:14:37.756 --> 00:14:44.006
Unlike something like football, where some players might fall over to try to trick the

00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:50.776
referee and win a penalty, there was an unwritten rule that cricketers weren’t like this.

00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:55.266
There was a code of honour, an unwritten law between

00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:58.946
players not to cheat, and to always remain honorable.

00:14:59.756 --> 00:15:05.126
But, although cricket may have the reputation of being a ‘gentleman’s

00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:10.396
game’, there are numerous instances where it doesn’t live up to the name.

00:15:11.566 --> 00:15:17.966
Firstly, like in many sports, there have been multiple occasions of bribery and

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:24.966
match-fixing, or players accepting money to change the outcome, the result of a match.

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:30.616
For some supposed gentlemen, the temptation of being paid large

00:15:30.616 --> 00:15:35.246
amounts of money to accidentally miss the ball proved too much.

00:15:36.466 --> 00:15:39.766
Secondly, it’s possible to cheat during the game.

00:15:40.516 --> 00:15:48.516
The most common way of doing this is by intentionally damaging the ball so that it moves in the air.

00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:57.756
Back in 2018 two Australian cricketers received lengthy bans, they were forbidden of playing the

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:05.946
sport for a long time, for using sandpaper to make one side of the ball rougher than the other.

00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:13.736
The explanation of what they were doing, and why, is that if there is one side of

00:16:13.736 --> 00:16:19.866
the ball that is a different texture to the other, as it moves through the air the

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:25.756
resistance on one side of it is different to the other, meaning it will move in an

00:16:25.816 --> 00:16:31.616
unpredictable way, making it harder for the batsman to understand where it will finish.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:38.456
And the final not-so-gentlemanly act, which is really an ongoing

00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:42.826
thing, is something that hasn't stopped, is something called sledging.

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:49.346
Now, if you look up the word ‘sledging’ in a dictionary, the first definition

00:16:49.506 --> 00:16:54.236
will probably be something like ‘go on a sledge’, which is the mode of

00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:59.486
transport most commonly associated with Father Christmas and winter sports.

00:17:00.656 --> 00:17:04.866
But in cricket sledging is something very different.

00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:10.876
It means to insult other players, to say rude things to them to try

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:15.856
to distract them, to put them off, and cause them to make mistakes.

00:17:16.626 --> 00:17:21.666
Of course, this is something that happens in many sports, but in cricket it

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:27.256
does tend to have a certain style to it, there is often something a little

00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:32.546
more witty and intelligent about it compared to straight-forward insults.

00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:37.636
But, I should add, it is against the rules of the sport, it is

00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:42.056
banned, and it does detract from the sportsmanship of the game.

00:17:42.946 --> 00:17:47.276
So, that is a brief history of the sport, and how it works.

00:17:47.936 --> 00:17:51.616
From a cultural perspective, you can find traces of cricket

00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:54.866
throughout British, and especially English, culture.

00:17:55.476 --> 00:18:01.786
Many English villages will have a cricket pitch, and the tradition of village cricket continues

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:07.626
to this day, in fact it normally starts about when this podcast will be released in May.

00:18:08.686 --> 00:18:12.616
The Cricketers is a common name for a pub, and the pub

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:15.446
in a village I used to live in was called The Cricketers.

00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:22.476
And for many people, even those who might not be avid cricket fans themselves, there

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:27.976
is something slightly timeless about cricket, something about the sport that makes

00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:34.066
you imagine that its essence hasn’t changed so much from the days of The Restoration.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:40.326
Now, our final point to add is on its linguistic legacy, because

00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:44.336
cricket has also left its impression on the English language.

00:18:45.516 --> 00:18:50.606
Firstly, you might hear someone say that something is “just not cricket”.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:54.476
This means that it’s dishonest, or it’s unfair.

00:18:55.756 --> 00:19:01.416
This comes, of course, from cricket’s reputation as being a gentleman’s, honest sport.

00:19:02.496 --> 00:19:06.826
Secondly, you might hear the phrase “he had a good innings”.

00:19:07.066 --> 00:19:12.336
An “innings” is the period of time where a cricket team plays, and

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:16.596
so this means that “he had a good period of time doing something”.

00:19:16.946 --> 00:19:21.306
It’s often used to describe someone’s life, so “my grandmother

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:25.266
lived until she was 109 years old - she had a great innings”.

00:19:26.506 --> 00:19:31.663
And our final gift from cricket to the English language, which is probably

00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:36.093
the most common of the three, and most people wouldn’t know comes from

00:19:36.123 --> 00:19:40.723
cricket, is to say that someone did something “off their own bat”.

00:19:41.733 --> 00:19:47.563
“Off your own bat” means on your own, without someone telling you that you needed to do it.

00:19:48.943 --> 00:19:51.513
So, there you go, that is cricket.

00:19:52.153 --> 00:19:58.233
A sport that, on one level, makes absolutely no sense, and is confusing to

00:19:58.293 --> 00:20:02.543
almost anyone who hasn’t been brought up in a country where it is popular.

00:20:03.773 --> 00:20:09.123
Nevertheless, it is a sport that has a devoted army of passionate fans.

00:20:09.683 --> 00:20:17.083
Fans so passionate, in England’s case, that they are called The Barmy Army, the mad army.

00:20:17.793 --> 00:20:23.593
I have no expectation that the past 20 minutes will have turned you into a passionate cricket

00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:30.183
fan, and that you will be signing up for the Barmy Army, but I certainly hope that you now

00:20:30.193 --> 00:20:36.473
have a better idea of the weird and wonderful story of this quintessentially English sport.

00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:44.193
OK then, that is it for today's episode on cricket.

00:20:44.813 --> 00:20:48.303
I imagine that you might not yet be a cricket fan, but I

00:20:48.303 --> 00:20:51.193
would still love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:51.463 --> 00:20:54.393
Have you ever watched even part of a game of cricket?

00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:56.643
Did you understand what was going on?

00:20:57.273 --> 00:21:00.863
Have you ever heard of anyone from your country playing cricket?

00:21:01.683 --> 00:21:03.083
I would love to know.

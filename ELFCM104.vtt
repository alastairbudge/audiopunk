Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.974
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:20.914
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.284 --> 00:00:28.214
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Survivalism, or

00:00:28.264 --> 00:00:35.488
Prepping, the idea or mindset that the world is unstable, unpredictable, and

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:39.258
that we should all be prepared for what happens when things go wrong.

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:45.838
It’s actually a request from an awesome member of Leonardo English, a German lady

00:00:45.848 --> 00:00:50.468
living in Italy called Marlene, so thanks for the idea Marlene, I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:56.848
Before we get right into the wonderful topic of survivalism though, if you’re not yet

00:00:56.858 --> 00:01:01.098
a member of Leonardo English let me quickly remind you that you can get all of the

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:06.578
bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:11.608
episode and all of the other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:16.898
Becoming a member of Leonardo English not only gives you access to all of the learning

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:22.088
materials, but it means joining a community of curious minds from all over the world,

00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:27.998
doing meetups, exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more

00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:33.818
interesting way, and of course you can do stuff like request episodes, like Marlene did.

00:01:34.418 --> 00:01:37.108
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:37.108 --> 00:01:40.748
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:45.028
OK then, Survivalism, or Prepping.

00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:49.658
On an administrative note, I’ll use these two words interchangeably

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.494
Survivalism” and “Prepping” - they mean the same thing.

00:01:55.914 --> 00:02:00.974
What we’re going to do in today’s episode is first define exactly what it

00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:08.444
is, how it works, where this idea originated from, how the events of 2020

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:13.804
have changed public perceptions towards it, and why it’s the United States,

00:02:14.094 --> 00:02:18.754
instead of any other country, that is the Survivalism capital of the world..

00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:21.464
So, what is survivalism?

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:28.594
At its core it's the idea that the world we live in is unstable, that there is

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:34.504
the probability that something will happen that will make our normal lives not

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:39.954
feasible anymore, and that we should prepare for this event in order to survive.

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:47.404
The kind of events that might cause this vary greatly - from a collapse in the financial

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:54.544
system to a global pandemic, from a nuclear war to a series of large earthquakes.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:03:00.204
The results of this potential event could be devastating: food and

00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:06.024
water shortages, power shortages, civil war, and anything in between.

00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:12.984
And survivalists want to be prepared for this situation far in advance.

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:19.734
Now, the term survivalist, or prepper is generally used to group

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:24.334
a very wide range of people together, and stick a label on them.

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:31.424
But there is a huge variety, a huge difference in attitudes between different types

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:38.667
of survivalists, and the line between who is a survivalist and who isn’t is unclear.

00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:45.077
There are people who like to always have a few weeks or months extra food supplies

00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:49.867
in their cupboards ‘just in case’, and there are people who invest millions of

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:55.237
dollars in underground bunkers, shelters under the ground, that are kitted out

00:03:55.287 --> 00:04:01.057
with bullet-proof windows and assault weapons for when a civil war breaks out.

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:08.167
Clearly it doesn’t make a huge amount of sense to give these two people the same name,

00:04:08.577 --> 00:04:14.527
but this is just to illustrate that there’s a big variety in the world of survivalists.

00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:22.117
While you could reasonably say that the idea of stockpiling supplies, of building up reserves

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:29.447
of supplies, in case it’s not so easy to get them anymore is as old as humans are, the idea

00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:36.627
of survivalism, or prepping really comes down to the idea that the reason that it’s going to

00:04:36.627 --> 00:04:43.517
be difficult to get these supplies is due to some large collapse in the way society works.

00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:48.337
Not just that your supermarket has run out of a particular kind of

00:04:48.337 --> 00:04:52.227
tomato sauce you like or that you don’t like running out of sugar.

00:04:53.057 --> 00:04:57.997
The idea really started to emerge in the 1960s, in America.

00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:06.147
It was started during the Cold War, when there was the very real threat that the US and the Soviet

00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:12.667
Union might start firing nuclear weapons at each other, that there would be some kind of nuclear

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:20.917
winter, food, water and power supplies would break down, and society as we knew it would collapse.

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:26.747
People started to stockpile the supplies that they would need to survive

00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:33.067
in this new world, from food and water to weapons to defend their land,

00:05:33.377 --> 00:05:37.717
family and possessions from other people who weren’t quite so prepared.

00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:43.477
Survivalism isn’t just about having extra food and water though.

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:48.917
It’s also the idea that humans should be more prepared from the

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:53.247
point of view of knowing how to survive than we currently are.

00:05:54.647 --> 00:06:01.137
From knowing how to do stuff like start a fire to build a shelter, from knowing

00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:08.577
how to grow crops to how to treat common injuries, survivalism is this idea

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:13.587
that we should be more self-sufficient, because in the event of a collapse

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:18.517
of society, there won't be anyone else to turn to to help you with this.

00:06:19.017 --> 00:06:20.797
You need to know how to do it yourself.

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:27.337
Starting from the 1960s there was also an increasing lack of trust

00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:31.577
in the US government to keep society ticking over, to keep it going.

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:37.797
There were the oil crises in the 1970s, which made people realise that it

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:43.717
wasn’t written in stone that Americans could have a constant flow of cheap fuel.

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:52.747
Then in the 1980s, as inflation increased and hit almost 15% there was an increasing

00:06:52.757 --> 00:06:59.457
belief that the monetary system, the financial system, could collapse and that all

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:04.187
of the paper dollars that you had in the bank would become completely worthless.

00:07:05.477 --> 00:07:11.387
Just as a reminder, if inflation is at 15% every year this means that

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:16.567
your money is worth 15% less every year, and if that continues, well

00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:20.087
there’s soon going to be a collapse in trust in the financial system.

00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:26.347
Evidently, if you believed that this was a probable scenario, then it

00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:31.237
made sense to get prepared for it by getting your supplies ready, and

00:07:31.627 --> 00:07:36.627
doing stuff like buying gold, which isn’t tied to the monetary system.

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:42.257
And as the years went by, there were more and more events that made the

00:07:42.437 --> 00:07:47.277
already cautious even more likely to believe that they needed to get prepared.

00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:55.577
There was the millennium bug, the idea that when the clocks went from 23.59 on the 31st of December

00:07:55.577 --> 00:08:03.217
1999 to midnight on the 1st of January 2000 there were going to be huge apocalyptic events.

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:09.657
Then the Twin Towers attack of 2001, the financial crisis of 2007, the

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:16.077
Ebola outbreak of 2014, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:22.617
Until recently, survivalists, or preppers were a group that it was easy

00:08:22.617 --> 00:08:28.567
to ridicule, and indeed there were lots of articles, documentaries and TV

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:33.427
shows that followed survivalists around and generally poked fun at them.

00:08:34.257 --> 00:08:38.437
There was a show called Doomsday Preppers on National

00:08:38.437 --> 00:08:44.097
Geographic that went on for 4 seasons, from 2012 to 2014.

00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:52.517
It told the stories of people who had taken what seemed to most people then as incredibly

00:08:52.547 --> 00:08:59.237
extreme measures - from spending millions of dollars on creating airtight fortresses to live

00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:06.297
in to keeping bags full of gold in the event of a meltdown of the global financial system.

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:14.767
These kinds of shows shone a light onto what a big business survivalism, or prepping, had become.

00:09:15.877 --> 00:09:23.927
In 2013 it’s estimated that Americans spent $400 million a year just on survival

00:09:23.927 --> 00:09:30.607
foods, and 20% of Americans had spent money on survival materials that year.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:35.347
Prepping was also for all levels of society.

00:09:36.047 --> 00:09:41.047
There was the firefighter from New York who kept a cupboard full of emergency

00:09:41.057 --> 00:09:46.327
gear for his family to the Silicon Valley billionaires who had bought up

00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:52.367
multi-million dollar apartments in a converted US missile silo in Kansas.

00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:56.847
To a lot of people, though, it seemed ridiculous.

00:09:57.827 --> 00:10:02.707
This was the 21st century, in a world where you could order something on the

00:10:02.717 --> 00:10:07.267
internet and it would arrive on your doorstep half an hour later, where you could

00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:13.727
stream a video in milliseconds, of course you had running water and electricity.

00:10:14.537 --> 00:10:19.167
Wasn’t it a bit mad to think that this could all collapse in an instant?

00:10:20.237 --> 00:10:28.647
Then, in March of 2020, after the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, and businesses, shops

00:10:28.707 --> 00:10:35.647
and offices in entire cities across large parts of the world closed, the fact that there could

00:10:35.657 --> 00:10:43.097
be an unexpected event that would disrupt the status quo suddenly didn’t seem quite so mad.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:51.230
As supermarkets started to run out of things like toilet paper and pasta, the person who had been

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:58.490
quietly buying toilet paper and food supplies for the past 5 years suddenly seemed quite smart.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:04.340
Indeed, there’s a scene in the documentary I mentioned earlier, Doomsday Preppers,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:10.980
which focuses on an American mother who is talking about her fear of a huge pandemic,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:17.510
and talking about her supplies of protective equipment and N95 masks for her children.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:26.050
No doubt the objective of the documentary was to paint her as a madwoman, overcome

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.200
by fear of an event that could just never happen, and then less than 10 years

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.380
later, I’m sure those N95 masks and protective equipment did come in quite handy.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.530
Searches for ‘preppers’ on Google went up by 10 times in the week after the

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.420
WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, and suddenly everyone was a prepper.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:56.360
Or rather, they weren’t really a prepper, because you can’t really ‘prepare’

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.980
for something if it’s already happening, but at least everyone was trying

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.050
to do what these preppers, these survivalists, had been doing for years.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.350
The events of 2020 have certainly shown that there are things that come completely out

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:20.260
of the blue, and that being prepared, within reason of course, probably is no bad thing.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:27.030
This doesn’t mean that everyone needs to have a bag prepared with emergencies and a

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:33.190
special bunker in the countryside, but it has certainly made a lot of people more aware

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:39.390
of how fragile a lot of our supply networks are, and how interconnected everything is.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.610
One of the theories about why prepping, or survivalism, is particularly popular with

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:53.717
the Silicon Valley elite is that they have seen firsthand quite how fragile a lot

00:12:53.717 --> 00:12:59.060
of these systems are, and how technology powers literally everything that we do.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:07.170
Whether it’s regulating the temperature of a truck containing milk, or directing someone carrying

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:13.740
blood between hospitals, managing financial transactions across borders, or regulating the

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:21.440
cooling of a nuclear reactor, just one thing going wrong can have disastrous consequences, and

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:29.200
even though the risk of an event happening may be small, the impact is disproportionately large.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:36.790
Peter Thiel, the secretive billionaire founder of Paypal, and another secretive company, Palantir,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:44.440
which we actually did an episode on back in February, is a famous prepper who owns a large amount

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:51.320
of land in New Zealand, he once declared that freedom and democracy are no longer compatible.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:58.280
Indeed, while the original reasons to push people towards survivalism, towards

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:05.090
prepping, were about more external threats - the threat of nuclear war or a financial

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:10.960
meltdown - a lot of current thinking around prepping is more around the idea that

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.030
society is going to destroy itself from within, that we will do this to ourselves.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:24.930
From inequality through to climate change, from deep fractures in democracies through to the

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:31.820
increasing automation of work that some people believe will cause society to split indefinitely

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:37.200
into those that own the robots and those who have been replaced by robots, the reasons

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:43.170
that people are turning to survivalism are very different to what they were 60 years ago.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.340
Prepping, or Survivalism, is becoming more popular outside the States too.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.690
The pandemic has, of course, affected almost every country

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.530
in the world, and underlined the fragility of society.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:04.480
But America is still the true home of prepping, and where survivalism is most popular.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.830
It’s interesting to think a little about why this is, and I think there are some unique aspects

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:18.820
to the American story that have caused this idea to be so comparatively popular in America.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.870
Firstly, the United States is a relatively new

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.380
country, especially compared to those of us in Europe.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.020
Although there has always been this idea of American superiority, that the United

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:38.260
States was created to be a better version of Europe, there is this feeling that

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.140
it could all come crumbling down and that every American has a duty to protect it.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.920
Secondly, the fact that America is just so much bigger in terms of geography than

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.440
most other countries and much richer makes it a lot easier to be a survivalist.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.520
Whether it’s a question of buying some land and putting a bunker on it, or just

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.450
having an extra cupboard to store your food in, that’s a lot easier if you live

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:12.660
in a country with 35 people per square kilometre than if you live in a country

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.700
like I do, Malta, with a population density of 1,200 people per square kilometre.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.890
It’s all well and good saying that people should have a spare cupboard with food and water

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:30.210
for a few months, but try saying that to someone living in a flat in a European city.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.970
It’s not quite so easy, even if they wanted to.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.750
And thirdly, trust in government is much lower in the US than in most countries.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.970
Just 33% of US citizens say that they have confidence in the national

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:54.810
government vs 59% in Germany, 62% in Canada, and 82% in Switzerland.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.320
If you don’t trust the government to provide for you in times of need,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.380
well a logical next step is to make sure that you can provide for yourself.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.250
So the United States remains the world capital of prepping.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.710
The numbers I gave earlier, that 20% of Americans had spent money on survival

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:21.260
equipment and they spent $400 million a year on survival food, they were from

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:29.090
2013, 7 years before COVID-19, so no doubt these will be much, much higher now.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.240
So that is it for the world of prepping, the world of survivalism.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.970
Luckily for everyone, at least in terms of our entire society collapsing,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.610
food, water and power supplies being exhausted and people fighting with their

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:50.020
neighbours over who gets to eat the last sewer rat, COVID-19 hasn’t been as

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:56.260
bad as survivalists' worst fears, it hasn’t been a complete global apocalypse.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:03.360
But one thing that we can probably all take from the mentality of a prepper, from a survivalist,

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:09.760
is that having some extra toilet paper ‘just in case’ is probably not a bad idea indeed.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.880
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Survivalism, on Prepping.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.540
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.470
It is a weird, mysterious world, but as always, it’s quite

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.520
interesting, and I think there’s quite a bit that we can learn from it.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.900
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

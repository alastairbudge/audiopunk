Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:17.215
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:21.655
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:28.285
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about 3D printing.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:35.765
It has been hailed as the technology that will usher in a Fourth Industrial Revolution, will

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:42.855
help take humans to Mars, help us live longer, happier lives, and revolutionise manufacturing.

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:47.575
But people have been saying this for quite some time now, and

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.495
the technology is actually a lot older than you might think.

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:58.215
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about how 3D printing actually works,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:04.055
what people think it will allow us to do, some of the fears that people have about

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:09.975
3D printing, and discuss how, if at all, it will change the world we live in.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.895
I should say that this episode is a member request, it’s from an awesome

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:18.865
member of Leonardo English, a guy from the Czech Republic called Jachym.

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:22.275
So, Jachym, I hope you enjoy this episode.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:29.065
And if you want to be a bit more like Jachym, and do things like request episodes, listen

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:35.145

So, if that sounds like fun then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.846
Right, 3D printing.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:10.696
One of the main differences between humans and animals is that we make things.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:15.616
We create tools from the natural world to help us do things.

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:21.956
From a caveman making an axe out of some wood and stone right through to the creation

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:27.496
of the phone or computer that you are listening to this episode on, humans make things.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:33.676
An animal might make a nest, it might dig a hole to create a house, but the creation

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:40.536
of objects is something that’s relatively unique to us, that's unique to human beings.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:46.256
To state the obvious, as time has gone on, and technology has developed,

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:50.736
each generation has got better and better at producing objects.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.226
3D printing, to its proponents, to its greatest fans, is the most

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:01.966
advanced and important manufacturing technology that currently exists.

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:07.516
It allows anyone, anywhere, with the right machine, to produce

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:12.896
custom-built objects, in a huge variety of different materials.

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:18.766
So, how does it actually work, and why is this important?

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:24.236
One way of thinking about the actual 3D printing process is

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:28.996
that it is the opposite of traditional or classic manufacturing.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:33.356
Think of traditional manufacturing like sculpture,

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:37.326
carving an object out of a piece of stone or marble.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:41.986
There is a block of material, and you cut pieces away

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:44.996
until you are left with the object that you want.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:50.936
If we continue with the example of a sculpture, let’s take Michelangelo’s

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:56.276
David, for example, this was carved out of a large piece of marble, it was

00:03:56.296 --> 00:04:02.486
smoothed and sanded until what remained was the form of David that we see today.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.446
3D printing is the opposite.

00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:09.716
You start with nothing, and matter is added and

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:13.986
added until the desired shape, or object, is created.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:19.306
To call it printing is actually a little bit deceptive.

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:27.536
To the uninitiated, to those who don’t know huge amounts about it, it makes you think of a printer.

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:36.706
There are some shared concepts between 3D printing and traditional printing, but it’s probably

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:45.746
more useful to think about the “printing” in 3D printing as building, creating, or simply “making”.

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:51.370
Indeed the technical term for 3D printing is Additive

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.870
Manufacturing - manufacturing by adding, rather than taking away.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.950
Although you might have seen headlines and news

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.930
programmes in the last 10 years

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.340
or so about the huge impact that 3D printing is going to

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.700
have, the technology has actually been around since the 1980s.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.770
Early versions of 3D printing were similar to typical 2D printing at a conceptual level.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.930
If you are printing a document or a photo, there is a computer record

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.810
of the text or image to be printed, then the printer adds ink to the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.220
paper in the right places, and ta-da, you have a printed document.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.420
Early 3D printing worked in a similar way.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.130
You would create your computer file in 3D of the object to be printed.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.810
But the 3D printer didn't just go across the page at one level, it added

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.930
matter vertically, so that gradually an object could be created from nothing.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.130
Although this was groundbreaking technology, in its early days

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.490
it was too expensive and slow to be practical for widespread use.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.670
As one might expect, the technology continued to be improved and improved,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.410
and new forms of 3D printing would be created, and patented, they would be

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.700
protected by a patent, a legal device to protect others from copying it.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.910
As you may know, and you are probably extra familiar with this if you have listened

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.010
to the episode on patents, patents all have a fixed term, they don’t last forever.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.780
This gives the inventor the opportunity to benefit from a time-limited monopoly on it,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.810
but they have to provide clear instructions for others on how to replicate the technology.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:58.840
Now, coming back to 3D printing, having a patent meant that the inventor of a particularly

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.550
sophisticated 3D printing technique could charge higher prices for people to use their machines.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.400
In the 2000s, even though 3D printing objects could be very expensive,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.990
for some use cases it was still cheaper than traditional manufacturing.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.560
For example, one of the earliest obvious uses of 3D printing is for

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.743
prototyping, for building a version one, a test version, of a product.

00:07:30.147 --> 00:07:34.790
With traditional manufacturing, you need to find a factory to build it.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.970
This factory needs to have expensive machinery, which needs to either be built

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:46.950
or calibrated, and the entire process takes a long time and is expensive if

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.600
you only want to build one unit, if you only want to make something once.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.850
With 3D printing, you can do this very quickly, and even with what we would now consider to be very

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:06.110
high costs of 3D printing, it could still be more cost effective than traditional manufacturing.

00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:11.707
But, in 2009 the patent for the most advanced 3D printing

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:16.241
technique, called fused deposition modeling expired.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.620
These machines used to cost around $10,000 to buy, but

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.280
almost overnight the price dropped to around $1,000.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.340
Still, not cheap, and not the sort of thing that anyone

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.840
would buy to use at home, but a significant reduction.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:43.320
This not only meant that using 3D printing technology became a lot cheaper, but it also opened up

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:52.190
the market to hobbyists, to people who wanted to 3D print objects for fun or for personal curiosity.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.800
Suddenly, there was renewed interest in the technology, and it became more

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.350
accessible to companies of all sizes, across a huge variety of industries.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.030
Let’s talk through some of the examples of how it was used.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.120
Firstly, let’s continue with manufacturing, as this

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.270
is the sector for which 3D printing is most exciting.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:23.590
For prototyping, a company could now buy their own 3D printer, and rapidly iterate

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:29.280
on products, they could improve something continuously over a short period of time.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.740
An engineer could design a new product, and the next day a version of it could

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:41.560
be produced, it could go from idea, to software, to physical product in a

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.046
tiny amount of time compared to the status quo, to the normal way of doing it.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.050
It’s also thought that 3D printing will completely

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.590
revolutionise the global manufacturing supply chain.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.060
If we take the example of a British car manufacturer, it currently

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.350
buys parts for its cars from different factories all over the world.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.480
Perhaps a factory in China makes the windscreen wipers, a factory in

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.310
Brazil might make the seat belts, a factory in Germany might produce

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.510
the electrical wires, an Italian factory might produce the brakes.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:27.590
Our economy has developed in this way, so that factories, or indeed entire companies,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.510
specialise in making just one or two components, which they ship all over the world.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.940
There are even entire cities in China which specialise in producing only

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.320
one product, there’s cigarette lighter city, condom city, and so on.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.930
The economics of this currently make sense, and with our example of the British

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.940
car company, it is cheaper for it to buy all of these parts from all over

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.070
the world, and they are shipped to the factory where they are put together.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:06.720
For this car company to build its own factories to make all of the unique parts

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.400
would be incredibly expensive, and so it doesn’t make sense for it to do it.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.450
But, what if it could 3D print these parts closer to home?

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.670
What if the cost to 3D print the parts was so low that it

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.685
made no sense to buy them from the other side of the world?

00:11:27.005 --> 00:11:32.260
3D printing isn’t quite there yet, but it is currently at the level where if

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.160
a company needs only a few units, it can print them itself, rather than having

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.100
to order hundreds of thousands of them from the other side of the world.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:48.260
Obviously, when 3D printing does become cheaper than buying a product from a factory

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.990
on the other side of the world, this will have huge implications for global trade.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.700
Producing goods closer to home means less transport, fewer emissions, and a

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.150
complete rethinking of the global trade system that we currently live with.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:10.570
3D printing also means you can produce a much greater variety of products.

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:17.521
There are some shapes and forms that are just very difficult to produce using traditional

00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:23.861
manufacturing processes, given that you have to cut, or bend, or fix things together.

00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:30.121
Due to the fact that with 3D printing you are literally creating

00:12:30.121 --> 00:12:33.501
a shape from nothing, you can make practically anything.

00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:39.261
And when it comes to what you can make, 3D printing isn’t only

00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:43.751
about making quicker prototypes or a greater variety of products.

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:48.921
It’s also already meaning that we can "print", in inverted

00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:52.261
commas, print things that we couldn’t previously do.

00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:58.161
It’s now possible to print or make human body parts.

00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:03.561
Whether it’s an ear or a part of an organ, the technology now

00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:08.151
allows us to take cells and literally create new body parts.

00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:14.081
There is always a mismatch, a disparity, between the number of people who

00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:19.491
need new body parts and the number of available body parts, and advocates

00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:24.341
of 3D printing suggest that the technology will allow us to close this gap.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.011
Need a new tube going into your heart?

00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.071
No problem, we can print one for you.

00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:32.741
It would certainly revolutionise global healthcare.

00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:38.631
And, moving further afield, out of this world even, 3D printing is a

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.461
technology that is already playing an important role in space exploration.

00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:52.041
At the moment, everything that is taken into space is manufactured on Earth and shot up into space.

00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:58.844
A spacecraft needs to take everything it needs with it, because there obviously

00:13:58.874 --> 00:14:03.444
isn’t an easy way to get a new piece of equipment when you are circling the Earth.

00:14:04.604 --> 00:14:10.904
But, with a 3D printer, you can literally make any object you need, you can use that object,

00:14:10.944 --> 00:14:16.664
and when you no longer need it you can melt the material down and create something else.

00:14:17.654 --> 00:14:18.514
Amazing, right?

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:23.704
And it’s not just for making spare parts on spaceships

00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:30.571
. 
It is thought that 3D printing will play a very important role in a human settlement on Mars.

00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:36.201
These settlements would have to be created somehow, and it isn’t

00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:41.841
feasible to shoot up an entire pre-built settlement and fly it to Mars.

00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:50.081
Instead, so the theory goes, 3D printers would be used to create new settlements directly on Mars.

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:56.111
So, how is 3D printing going to affect you and me, assuming

00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.951
that we are unlikely to be personally colonising Mars?

00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:03.651
Will we literally be able to print anything we want?

00:15:04.211 --> 00:15:08.381
Will we all have machines in our houses and we can press a button

00:15:08.381 --> 00:15:12.861
to create a cup, a new ear, or even a full English breakfast?

00:15:13.632 --> 00:15:16.802
Now, let’s actually take these three examples first,

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:20.032
because they are all important in their own different ways.

00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:27.382
It is already possible to buy a 3D printer, the cheapest ones start at around €100

00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:33.112
nowadays, so it is not completely inconceivable that you could have one in your house.

00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:36.962
You could certainly print a cup, that’s an easy one.

00:15:37.732 --> 00:15:43.992
It’s also possible to print a new ear, although that obviously requires some pretty complex

00:15:44.022 --> 00:15:50.642
medical knowledge as well, and your €100 3D printer probably wouldn’t be up to the challenge.

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:56.752
And in terms of printing yourself a full English breakfast, or creating food out of

00:15:56.752 --> 00:16:02.297
nothing,  this has been a theme that has interested science fiction writers for years.

00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:08.947
If you are a Star Trek fan you will be familiar with a device called The Replicator,

00:16:09.147 --> 00:16:13.677
which was similar to a microwave oven, but could create objects from nothing.

00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:21.737
There are several companies that are already working on 3D printing meat, and the first 3D printed

00:16:21.737 --> 00:16:28.287
steak is set to appear on dinner plates at certain European restaurants by the end of 2021.

00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:32.816
The comparison might sound a little disgusting, but

00:16:32.966 --> 00:16:36.546
the process is similar to that of creating a human ear.

00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:42.756
You take a sample of the tissue, and from that you can create a replica of the original.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:49.186
I couldn’t find an example of any company that is focussing on 3D printing full English

00:16:49.186 --> 00:16:54.486
breakfasts, but there is no reason that the technology shouldn’t be possible in the future.

00:16:55.406 --> 00:17:01.036
Now, as with anything new, there are the usual fears about what this might lead to.

00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:07.816
If anyone can create anything for themselves, what sort of dangerous implications will there be?

00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:15.956
The most commonly cited example of this with 3D printing is of people printing their own guns.

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:23.506
It is very possible to 3D print a gun, and these guns can often be hard to detect.

00:17:24.186 --> 00:17:31.366
Indeed, an Israeli journalist demonstrated this in 2013 by 3D printing a gun,

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:36.856
going to a press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister,

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:42.536
where he managed to take the gun through the metal detector without it beeping.

00:17:43.186 --> 00:17:46.846
In the video of the event you can see the journalist

00:17:46.996 --> 00:17:50.406
holding the gun and secretly pointing it at Netanhayu.

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:56.286
It would have been very easy for him to stand up, fire the gun and kill him.

00:17:57.386 --> 00:18:01.276
Netanyahu criticised this as an “an irresponsible act”,

00:18:01.546 --> 00:18:05.776
but 3D printing certainly does pose some security problems.

00:18:06.546 --> 00:18:12.296
In most countries in the world, apart from the one very obvious exception, gun ownership

00:18:12.516 --> 00:18:18.686
is very tightly regulated, and the idea that anyone, anywhere could get their hands

00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:23.716
on a gun is something that most governments haven’t had to properly confront yet.

00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:29.206
But to think that people are going to start printing guns and shooting people

00:18:29.516 --> 00:18:34.186
just because they now have a 3D printer seems a little bit unrealistic.

00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:41.076
If you are intent on killing someone then I’m sure you can find a way without a 3D printer.

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:49.246
And there is the familiar critique of any new technology, that it is going to take jobs from humans.

00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:56.096
If we no longer need large factories with humans manning the equipment to produce the parts, or

00:18:56.256 --> 00:19:02.936
humans assembling the parts, this will cause these people to lose their jobs, so the argument goes.

00:19:03.666 --> 00:19:08.366
Of course these machines will replace the jobs of humans, that’s the entire point.

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:15.570
The job of any machine is to reduce the work of a human, whether it’s a fishing net or a 3D

00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:22.336
printer, the reason for creating machines is to reduce the amount of work a human needs to do.

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:29.646
But to criticise 3D printing, or to legislate against it because it will lead to some

00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:35.566
job losses in the manufacturing sector is pretty shortsighted, and is comparable to

00:19:35.786 --> 00:19:40.936
regulating against driverless cars because they will put truck drivers out of work.

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:47.026
This is such a familiar criticism of any new technology, and the economic system

00:19:47.036 --> 00:19:51.446
has a pretty good track record of creating new jobs to replace the old ones.

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:56.751
Now, even though 3D printing as a technology has been

00:19:56.761 --> 00:20:01.071
around for over 40 years now, it is just getting started.

00:20:02.111 --> 00:20:09.831
It was worth around $14 billion dollars in 2020, and is predicted to grow at around 21% every year.

00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:16.510
Right now most of us probably don’t see the impact that it is having, but behind the

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:22.240
scenes, in healthcare, manufacturing, space travel, and multiple other industries,

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:27.670
it is helping us build products more quickly, more cheaply, and more efficiently.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:34.420
Only time will tell when the day will come when we can print  our own full English breakfasts.

00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:41.999
OK then, that is it for the magical technology of 3D printing.

00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:45.589
It might have got off to a slow start, but it is

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:48.739
playing an ever greater role in the world we live in.

00:20:49.609 --> 00:20:53.119

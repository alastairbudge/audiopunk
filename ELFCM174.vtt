Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:17.215
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:21.655
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:28.285
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about 3D printing.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:35.765
It has been hailed as the technology that will usher in a Fourth Industrial Revolution, will

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:42.855
help take humans to Mars, help us live longer, happier lives, and revolutionise manufacturing.

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:47.575
But people have been saying this for quite some time now, and

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.495
the technology is actually a lot older than you might think.

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:58.215
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about how 3D printing actually works,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:04.055
what people think it will allow us to do, some of the fears that people have about

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:09.975
3D printing, and discuss how, if at all, it will change the world we live in.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.895
I should say that this episode is a member request, it’s from an awesome

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:18.865
member of Leonardo English, a guy from the Czech Republic called Jachym.

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:22.275
So, Jachym, I hope you enjoy this episode.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:29.065
And if you want to be a bit more like Jachym, and do things like request episodes, listen

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:35.145

So, if that sounds like fun then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.846
Right, 3D printing.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:10.696
One of the main differences between humans and animals is that we make things.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:15.616
We create tools from the natural world to help us do things.

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:21.956
From a caveman making an axe out of some wood and stone right through to the creation

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:27.496
of the phone or computer that you are listening to this episode on, humans make things.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:33.676
An animal might make a nest, it might dig a hole to create a house, but the creation

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:40.536
of objects is something that’s relatively unique to us, that's unique to human beings.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:46.256
To state the obvious, as time has gone on, and technology has developed,

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:50.736
each generation has got better and better at producing objects.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.226
3D printing, to its proponents, to its greatest fans, is the most

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:01.966
advanced and important manufacturing technology that currently exists.

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:07.516
It allows anyone, anywhere, with the right machine, to produce

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:12.896
custom-built objects, in a huge variety of different materials.

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:18.766
So, how does it actually work, and why is this important?

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:24.236
One way of thinking about the actual 3D printing process is

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:28.996
that it is the opposite of traditional or classic manufacturing.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:33.356
Think of traditional manufacturing like sculpture,

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:37.326
carving an object out of a piece of stone or marble.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:41.986
There is a block of material, and you cut pieces away

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:44.996
until you are left with the object that you want.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:50.936
If we continue with the example of a sculpture, let’s take Michelangelo’s

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:56.276
David, for example, this was carved out of a large piece of marble, it was

00:03:56.296 --> 00:04:02.486
smoothed and sanded until what remained was the form of David that we see today.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.446
3D printing is the opposite.

00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:09.716
You start with nothing, and matter is added and

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:13.986
added until the desired shape, or object, is created.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:19.306
To call it printing is actually a little bit deceptive.

00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:27.536
To the uninitiated, to those who don’t know huge amounts about it, it makes you think of a printer.

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:36.706
There are some shared concepts between 3D printing and traditional printing, but it’s probably

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:45.746
more useful to think about the “printing” in 3D printing as building, creating, or simply “making”.

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:51.370
Indeed the technical term for 3D printing is Additive

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.870
Manufacturing - manufacturing by adding, rather than taking away.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.950
Although you might have seen headlines and news

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.930
programmes in the last 10 years

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.340
or so about the huge impact that 3D printing is going to

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.700
have, the technology has actually been around since the 1980s.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.770
Early versions of 3D printing were similar to typical 2D printing at a conceptual level.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.930
If you are printing a document or a photo, there is a computer record

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.810
of the text or image to be printed, then the printer adds ink to the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.220
paper in the right places, and ta-da, you have a printed document.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.420
Early 3D printing worked in a similar way.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.130
You would create your computer file in 3D of the object to be printed.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.810
But the 3D printer didn't just go across the page at one level, it added

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.930
matter vertically, so that gradually an object could be created from nothing.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.130
Although this was groundbreaking technology, in its early days

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.490
it was too expensive and slow to be practical for widespread use.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.670
As one might expect, the technology continued to be improved and improved,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.410
and new forms of 3D printing would be created, and patented, they would be

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.495
protected by a patent, a legal device to prevent others from copying it.

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:30.705
As you may know, and you are probably extra familiar with this if you have listened

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:36.805
to the episode on patents, patents all have a fixed term, they don’t last forever.

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:43.575
This gives the inventor the opportunity to benefit from a time-limited monopoly on it,

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:50.605
but they have to provide clear instructions for others on how to replicate the technology.

00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:58.635
Now, coming back to 3D printing, having a patent meant that the inventor of a particularly

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:05.345
sophisticated 3D printing technique could charge higher prices for people to use their machines.

00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:12.195
In the 2000s, even though 3D printing objects could be very expensive,

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:16.785
for some use cases it was still cheaper than traditional manufacturing.

00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:23.355
For example, one of the earliest obvious uses of 3D printing is for

00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:28.538
prototyping, for building a version one, a test version, of a product.

00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:34.585
With traditional manufacturing, you need to find a factory to build it.

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:40.765
This factory needs to have expensive machinery, which needs to either be built

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:46.745
or calibrated, and the entire process takes a long time and is expensive if

00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:51.395
you only want to build one unit, if you only want to make something once.

00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:59.645
With 3D printing, you can do this very quickly, and even with what we would now consider to be very

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:05.905
high costs of 3D printing, it could still be more cost effective than traditional manufacturing.

00:08:06.317 --> 00:08:11.502
But, in 2009 the patent for the most advanced 3D printing

00:08:11.502 --> 00:08:16.036
technique, called fused deposition modeling expired.

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:22.415
These machines used to cost around $10,000 to buy, but

00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:27.075
almost overnight the price dropped to around $1,000.

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:32.135
Still, not cheap, and not the sort of thing that anyone

00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:35.635
would buy to use at home, but a significant reduction.

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:43.115
This not only meant that using 3D printing technology became a lot cheaper, but it also opened up

00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:51.985
the market to hobbyists, to people who wanted to 3D print objects for fun or for personal curiosity.

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:57.595
Suddenly, there was renewed interest in the technology, and it became more

00:08:57.595 --> 00:09:03.145
accessible to companies of all sizes, across a huge variety of industries.

00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:07.825
Let’s talk through some of the examples of how it was used.

00:09:08.485 --> 00:09:11.915
Firstly, let’s continue with manufacturing, as this

00:09:11.945 --> 00:09:16.065
is the sector for which 3D printing is most exciting.

00:09:16.785 --> 00:09:23.385
For prototyping, a company could now buy their own 3D printer, and rapidly iterate

00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:29.075
on products, they could improve something continuously over a short period of time.

00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:35.535
An engineer could design a new product, and the next day a version of it could

00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:41.355
be produced, it could go from idea, to software, to physical product in a

00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:46.841
tiny amount of time compared to the status quo, to the normal way of doing it.

00:09:48.115 --> 00:09:51.845
It’s also thought that 3D printing will completely

00:09:51.845 --> 00:09:55.385
revolutionise the global manufacturing supply chain.

00:09:56.165 --> 00:10:00.855
If we take the example of a British car manufacturer, it currently

00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:05.145
buys parts for its cars from different factories all over the world.

00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:11.275
Perhaps a factory in China makes the windscreen wipers, a factory in

00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:16.105
Brazil might make the seat belts, a factory in Germany might produce

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:20.305
the electrical wires, an Italian factory might produce the brakes.

00:10:21.085 --> 00:10:27.385
Our economy has developed in this way, so that factories, or indeed entire companies,

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:33.305
specialise in making just one or two components, which they ship all over the world.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:39.735
There are even entire cities in China which specialise in producing only

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:44.115
one product, there’s cigarette lighter city, condom city, and so on.

00:10:45.025 --> 00:10:50.725
The economics of this currently make sense, and with our example of the British

00:10:50.765 --> 00:10:55.735
car company, it is cheaper for it to buy all of these parts from all over

00:10:55.735 --> 00:10:59.865
the world, and they are shipped to the factory where they are put together.

00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:06.515
For this car company to build its own factories to make all of the unique parts

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:11.195
would be incredibly expensive, and so it doesn’t make sense for it to do it.

00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:16.245
But, what if it could 3D print these parts closer to home?

00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:21.465
What if the cost to 3D print the parts was so low that it

00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:25.479
made no sense to buy them from the other side of the world?

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:32.055
3D printing isn’t quite there yet, but it is currently at the level where if

00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:37.955
a company needs only a few units, it can print them itself, rather than having

00:11:37.955 --> 00:11:41.895
to order hundreds of thousands of them from the other side of the world.

00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:48.055
Obviously, when 3D printing does become cheaper than buying a product from a factory

00:11:48.205 --> 00:11:52.785
on the other side of the world, this will have huge implications for global trade.

00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:59.495
Producing goods closer to home means less transport, fewer emissions, and a

00:11:59.525 --> 00:12:03.945
complete rethinking of the global trade system that we currently live with.

00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:10.365
3D printing also means you can produce a much greater variety of products.

00:12:10.926 --> 00:12:17.316
There are some shapes and forms that are just very difficult to produce using traditional

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:23.656
manufacturing processes, given that you have to cut, or bend, or fix things together.

00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:29.916
Due to the fact that with 3D printing you are literally creating

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.296
a shape from nothing, you can make practically anything.

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:39.056
And when it comes to what you can make, 3D printing isn’t only

00:12:39.056 --> 00:12:43.546
about making quicker prototypes or a greater variety of products.

00:12:44.426 --> 00:12:48.716
It’s also already meaning that we can "print", in inverted

00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:52.056
commas, print things that we couldn’t previously do.

00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:57.956
It’s now possible to print or make human body parts.

00:12:58.616 --> 00:13:03.356
Whether it’s an ear or a part of an organ, the technology now

00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:07.946
allows us to take cells and literally create new body parts.

00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:13.876
There is always a mismatch, a disparity, between the number of people who

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:19.286
need new body parts and the number of available body parts, and advocates

00:13:19.316 --> 00:13:24.136
of 3D printing suggest that the technology will allow us to close this gap.

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:26.806
Need a new tube going into your heart?

00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:28.866
No problem, we can print one for you.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.536
It would certainly revolutionise global healthcare.

00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:38.426
And, moving further afield, out of this world even, 3D printing is a

00:13:38.446 --> 00:13:43.256
technology that is already playing an important role in space exploration.

00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:51.836
At the moment, everything that is taken into space is manufactured on Earth and shot up into space.

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:58.639
A spacecraft needs to take everything it needs with it, because there obviously

00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:03.239
isn’t an easy way to get a new piece of equipment when you are circling the Earth.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:10.699
But, with a 3D printer, you can literally make any object you need, you can use that object,

00:14:10.739 --> 00:14:16.459
and when you no longer need it you can melt the material down and create something else.

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:18.309
Amazing, right?

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:23.499
And it’s not just for making spare parts on spaceships

00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:30.366
. 
It is thought that 3D printing will play a very important role in a human settlement on Mars.

00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:35.996
These settlements would have to be created somehow, and it isn’t

00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:41.636
feasible to shoot up an entire pre-built settlement and fly it to Mars.

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:49.876
Instead, so the theory goes, 3D printers would be used to create new settlements directly on Mars.

00:14:50.986 --> 00:14:55.906
So, how is 3D printing going to affect you and me, assuming

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:59.746
that we are unlikely to be personally colonising Mars?

00:15:00.196 --> 00:15:03.446
Will we literally be able to print anything we want?

00:15:04.006 --> 00:15:08.176
Will we all have machines in our houses and we can press a button

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:12.656
to create a cup, a new ear, or even a full English breakfast?

00:15:13.427 --> 00:15:16.597
Now, let’s actually take these three examples first,

00:15:16.777 --> 00:15:19.827
because they are all important in their own different ways.

00:15:20.537 --> 00:15:27.177
It is already possible to buy a 3D printer, the cheapest ones start at around €100

00:15:27.197 --> 00:15:32.907
nowadays, so it is not completely inconceivable that you could have one in your house.

00:15:34.077 --> 00:15:36.757
You could certainly print a cup, that’s an easy one.

00:15:37.527 --> 00:15:43.787
It’s also possible to print a new ear, although that obviously requires some pretty complex

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:50.437
medical knowledge as well, and your €100 3D printer probably wouldn’t be up to the challenge.

00:15:51.287 --> 00:15:56.547
And in terms of printing yourself a full English breakfast, or creating food out of

00:15:56.547 --> 00:16:02.091
nothing,  this has been a theme that has interested science fiction writers for years.

00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:08.741
If you are a Star Trek fan you will be familiar with a device called The Replicator,

00:16:08.941 --> 00:16:13.471
which was similar to a microwave oven, but could create objects from nothing.

00:16:14.212 --> 00:16:21.532
There are several companies that are already working on 3D printing meat, and the first 3D printed

00:16:21.532 --> 00:16:28.082
steak is set to appear on dinner plates at certain European restaurants by the end of 2021.

00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:32.611
The comparison might sound a little disgusting, but

00:16:32.761 --> 00:16:36.341
the process is similar to that of creating a human ear.

00:16:37.111 --> 00:16:42.551
You take a sample of the tissue, and from that you can create a replica of the original.

00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:48.981
I couldn’t find an example of any company that is focussing on 3D printing full English

00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:54.281
breakfasts, but there is no reason that the technology shouldn’t be possible in the future.

00:16:55.201 --> 00:17:00.831
Now, as with anything new, there are the usual fears about what this might lead to.

00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:07.611
If anyone can create anything for themselves, what sort of dangerous implications will there be?

00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:15.751
The most commonly cited example of this with 3D printing is of people printing their own guns.

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:23.301
It is very possible to 3D print a gun, and these guns can often be hard to detect.

00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:31.161
Indeed, an Israeli journalist demonstrated this in 2013 by 3D printing a gun,

00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:36.651
going to a press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister,

00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:42.331
where he managed to take the gun through the metal detector without it beeping.

00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:46.641
In the video of the event you can see the journalist

00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:50.201
holding the gun and secretly pointing it at Netanhayu.

00:17:51.081 --> 00:17:56.081
It would have been very easy for him to stand up, fire the gun and kill him.

00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:01.071
Netanyahu criticised this as an “an irresponsible act”,

00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:05.571
but 3D printing certainly does pose some security problems.

00:18:06.341 --> 00:18:12.091
In most countries in the world, apart from the one very obvious exception, gun ownership

00:18:12.311 --> 00:18:18.481
is very tightly regulated, and the idea that anyone, anywhere could get their hands

00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:23.511
on a gun is something that most governments haven’t had to properly confront yet.

00:18:24.401 --> 00:18:29.001
But to think that people are going to start printing guns and shooting people

00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:33.981
just because they now have a 3D printer seems a little bit unrealistic.

00:18:34.721 --> 00:18:40.871
If you are intent on killing someone then I’m sure you can find a way without a 3D printer.

00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:49.041
And there is the familiar critique of any new technology, that it is going to take jobs from humans.

00:18:49.821 --> 00:18:55.891
If we no longer need large factories with humans manning the equipment to produce the parts, or

00:18:56.051 --> 00:19:02.731
humans assembling the parts, this will cause these people to lose their jobs, so the argument goes.

00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:08.161
Of course these machines will replace the jobs of humans, that’s the entire point.

00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:15.364
The job of any machine is to reduce the work of a human, whether it’s a fishing net or a 3D

00:19:15.551 --> 00:19:22.131
printer, the reason for creating machines is to reduce the amount of work a human needs to do.

00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:29.441
But to criticise 3D printing, or to legislate against it because it will lead to some

00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:35.361
job losses in the manufacturing sector is pretty shortsighted, and is comparable to

00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:40.731
regulating against driverless cars because they will put truck drivers out of work.

00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:46.821
This is such a familiar criticism of any new technology, and the economic system

00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:51.241
has a pretty good track record of creating new jobs to replace the old ones.

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:56.546
Now, even though 3D printing as a technology has been

00:19:56.556 --> 00:20:00.866
around for over 40 years now, it is just getting started.

00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:09.626
It was worth around $14 billion dollars in 2020, and is predicted to grow at around 21% every year.

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:16.304
Right now most of us probably don’t see the impact that it is having, but behind the

00:20:16.304 --> 00:20:22.034
scenes, in healthcare, manufacturing, space travel, and multiple other industries,

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:27.464
it is helping us build products more quickly, more cheaply, and more efficiently.

00:20:28.304 --> 00:20:34.214
Only time will tell when the day will come when we can print  our own full English breakfasts.

00:20:36.704 --> 00:20:41.794
OK then, that is it for the magical technology of 3D printing.

00:20:42.224 --> 00:20:45.384
It might have got off to a slow start, but it is

00:20:45.394 --> 00:20:48.534
playing an ever greater role in the world we live in.

00:20:49.404 --> 00:20:52.914

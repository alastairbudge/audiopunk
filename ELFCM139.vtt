Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.418
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:20.948
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:27.208
I'm Alastair Budge and, hot off the heels of our last mini-series on Disney, I

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.428
come to you with the excellent news that this is the first episode of another

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:38.048
3-part mini series, this time on language invention, creation, and discovery.

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:43.798
Now, because talking about basic grammar and vocabulary is a little

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:48.818
bit boring, and we are here to listen to weird and wonderful, slightly

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:53.578
unorthodox, stories, this mini-series is going to be a little bit different.

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:58.388
In the first episode, in this episode, we’ll talk about

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:02.008
Invented Languages, languages that are completely made up.

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:08.778
In the second episode, we’ll talk about Cockney Rhyming Slang, the strange dialect,

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:14.078
some might say actual language, spoken in a small part of London’s East End.

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:20.138
And in the final episode you will learn all about The Rosetta Stone, the stone

00:01:20.298 --> 00:01:25.018
that allowed us to finally understand the writings of the ancient Egyptians.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:30.608
This series has been a particularly fun one to make, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:39.708
OK then, let’s not waste any time and dive into the mysterious world of invented languages.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:47.398
Now, if you are thinking that every language is invented by humans, you are of course right.

00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:51.358
Every language we speak was developed, normally over an

00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:55.208
extended period of time by an extended group of people.

00:01:55.868 --> 00:02:00.118
If you listened to the episode on the history of the English language, you’ll

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:05.208
remember all of the different inputs and influences that went into creating the

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:09.718
English that you are learning now, and how the language is still developing.

00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:15.608
But the subject of today’s episode isn’t how languages are developed in

00:02:15.608 --> 00:02:21.478
general, but what’s often called “Constructed language”, language that was

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:27.478
invented by one person, or a small group of people, with a specific purpose.

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:32.978
In this episode we’ll dive deep into the stories of three of these

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:37.428
languages, three of these inventors of languages, and through this

00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:43.038
we’ll better understand what, why, and for whom languages are invented.

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:50.258
Our first example is of probably the most prolific inventor of languages, and

00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:54.668
I’m going to start by playing a couple of clips of languages that he invented.

00:02:55.413 --> 00:02:56.533
Ok, here's the first one.

00:02:57.665 --> 00:03:06.065
[Person speaking Elvish language]

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.797
So that's our first language that he invented, and here comes the second.

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:29.644
Now, can you guess who this is?

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:33.694
Perhaps the dramatic music in the background gives it away.

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:38.784
These were clips from the languages invented by J.R.R.Tolkien,

00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:43.254
the author of books such as Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit.

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:49.044
If you have read the books or seen the films, you’ll remember that most of the

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:54.174
dialogue is in English, but different types of characters also speak different

00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:59.464
languages, languages that you can’t understand and that sound very strange to you.

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:06.954
That’s because these are completely invented languages, languages created entirely by Tolkein.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:14.304
Now, if you have read any of Tolkein’s books or watched any of the film adaptations, you might

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:20.244
think that these unknown words that some of the characters were saying were just random, strange

00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:26.854
sounding words that were inserted for dramatic effect, to make the characters sound more exotic.

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:29.424
But you would be mistaken.

00:04:30.014 --> 00:04:33.484
These aren’t just random sounds, they are actual languages,

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:37.214
languages with their own vocabulary and grammar rules.

00:04:38.484 --> 00:04:43.574
In Tolkein’s lifetime, he created anywhere between 2 and 20 languages.

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:51.604
Now, the reason I’ve said between 2 and 20 is that this depends on your definition of language.

00:04:52.714 --> 00:04:58.424
If, by language, one means a collection of words and grammar that can be used to

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:04.184
convey some meaning, then you could certainly argue that Tolkein created 20 languages.

00:05:05.134 --> 00:05:09.894
But if you define a language as something that you could use to communicate any

00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:16.384
idea, to translate any text, then you’d probably say he created no languages.

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:21.114
If we define language as a collection of words and grammar that can be

00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:26.504
used for practical communication, it’s fair to say that Tolkein created two

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:32.108
fully-formed languages,  two languages that can be used for practical purposes.

00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:36.638
These are Quenya and Sindarin, which are both Elvish

00:05:36.648 --> 00:05:40.338
languages, languages spoken by the elves in his books.

00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:44.958
Now, when I say that you can use these languages for practical

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:49.058
purposes, I mean practical purposes for the characters that use them.

00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:53.598
You couldn’t translate this episode, or a newspaper, but

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:57.378
the languages Tolkein created existed in a different world.

00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:01.198
Evidently there was no need for Tolkein to create a

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:05.768
word for podcast or Internet in his Elvish languages.

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:11.678
From a young age, Tolkien was completely fascinated with language, playing around

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:16.508
with other invented languages, and creating his own while he was still a teenager.

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:22.958
His first job after leaving the army at the end of the First World War was

00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:28.218
for the English Dictionary, afterwards becoming a professor in Anglo-Saxon

00:06:28.368 --> 00:06:32.128
and then English language and literature at the University of Oxford.

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:38.058
Tolkien himself was a very capable linguist, he spoke and understood

00:06:38.068 --> 00:06:44.178
many languages, including Latin, Greek, Finnish, Welsh and Ancient Norse.

00:06:44.928 --> 00:06:50.388
The languages that he spoke and understood had a large impact on the languages that he

00:06:50.388 --> 00:06:57.858
created - you can see elements of Welsh and Finnish in the languages spoken by the elves.

00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:07.478
For Tolkein, evidently the task of creating a language was deeply satisfying in itself, but he also

00:07:07.518 --> 00:07:15.378
believed strongly in the mythical power of languages, and the power of language to convey meaning.

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:21.988
Of course, Tolkein could have made everyone in Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit

00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:27.448
speak the same language, but then a huge amount of the story would have been missed.

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:32.918
Much like if we all spoke the same language, if we were all brought up speaking the

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:38.168
same language, parts of our traditions, our storytelling, our cultural heritage,

00:07:38.428 --> 00:07:43.358
and of course the misunderstandings that exist between different countries precisely

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:48.708
because we speak different languages, they would be gone, or at least greatly reduced.

00:07:49.898 --> 00:07:54.558
So, of course all of his different characters needed to have their own language.

00:07:55.268 --> 00:08:01.018
For the Tolkein fans out there, this is no doubt old news, you knew this already.

00:08:01.578 --> 00:08:06.338
If you are a die-hard Tolkein fan you might even have tried learning one of

00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:11.788
these Elvish languages yourself - there are hundreds, thousands even, of fan

00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:18.138
websites out there in Elvish, meetups for Tolkein fans to speak Elvish languages

00:08:18.138 --> 00:08:22.868
to each other, and opportunities to use these languages that Tolkein created.

00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:29.278
Indeed, although the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit are fantastic stories in their

00:08:29.278 --> 00:08:34.268
own right, there are people that have suggested that the entire stories were almost

00:08:34.288 --> 00:08:40.578
an excuse for Tolkien to create this world full of his own linguistic creations, that

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:45.818
the different languages almost came first, then the narrative was added afterwards.

00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.578
So, that is J.R.R.

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:52.788
Tolkein, the author of Lord of The Rings and the creator of

00:08:52.788 --> 00:08:56.378
some of the most famous mythical languages of the modern era.

00:08:57.518 --> 00:09:03.108
Our second invented language is one that was created for very different reasons, and

00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:08.658
indeed, it was a language that Tolkien ended up being very disapproving of, calling it

00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:15.328
“far deader than ancient unused languages, because its author never invented any legends”.

00:09:16.408 --> 00:09:20.818
Just as Tolkein’s languages existed to show the diversity of different

00:09:20.828 --> 00:09:25.368
groups of people, this language was created to try to bring people together.

00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:27.168
Can you guess what it is?

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:29.478
I’ll play a little clip of it now.

00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:30.524
[Woman speaking Esperanto]

00:09:47.106 --> 00:09:53.941
OK, it is Esperanto, the auxiliary language created by L.L Zamhenof in 1887.

00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:59.201
Now, a quick administrative point is that there is an entire episode

00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:04.761
dedicated to Esperanto, it’s Episode 69, so if you want a full dose

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.771
of Esperanto, that’s one to listen to if you haven’t done so already.

00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:15.611
As I hinted at, Esperanto was invented for very different reasons to Tolkein’s languages.

00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:20.971
While Tolkein’s were there for mythical, storytelling purposes, to give a

00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:26.211
voice and a language to an invented people, Esperanto was created to make

00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:30.591
communication easier between people who didn’t speak the same language.

00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:37.031
The entire philosophy of Esperanto was that language barriers divided people.

00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:42.241
Zamenhof was born in a town called Białystok, which was part of

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:46.491
Russia, but is now part of Poland, near the border with Belarus.

00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:53.261
Białystok was a melting pot of different languages, cultures, and ethnicities, and

00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:58.961
Zamenhof believed that if everyone could speak the same language, then it would be

00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:03.851
easier to communicate, there would be less fighting, and everyone would be happier.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:11.591
He set out to create a very easy language to pick up, to learn, so easy that an

00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:16.941
illiterate peasant working in the fields could learn it with just 10 minutes a day.

00:11:17.831 --> 00:11:22.561
Esperanto is based on Romance, Germanic, and Slavic languages.

00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:26.441
The idea was that if you spoke a language from any of

00:11:26.441 --> 00:11:30.091
these language families, it should come pretty naturally.

00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:38.161
He also removed pretty much all of the annoying, difficult aspects from other languages.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:42.301
There are no phrasal verbs or irregular endings.

00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:45.901
There are no subjunctives, or genders of objects.

00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:51.091
And it works on the basis of ‘root’ words, which then have

00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:55.201
prefixes and suffixes added to them to change their meanings.

00:11:56.131 --> 00:12:02.791
So, to give you an example if you add ‘mal’, ‘m a l‘, to the start of a word, this

00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:08.051
changes the definition to be the opposite of what the word without ‘mal’ means.

00:12:08.731 --> 00:12:18.581
So juna ‘j u n a’ is young, but maljuna, with ‘mal’ at the front, the opposite of young is….old.

00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:23.971
And blanka is white, malblanka, the opposite of

00:12:23.971 --> 00:12:27.531
‘white’ is, well you might have guessed it, it’s black.

00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:34.261
The result of this is that you only need around 500 root words to

00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:39.871
get by, to manage, so you can learn 500 words, and if you know the

00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:44.781
rules about suffixes and prefixes, ta-da, you can speak Esperanto.

00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:53.391
It is a logical language, things make sense, it’s easy, it’s functional, and this was exactly why

00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:59.671
Tolkein, although he was initially supportive of it, it was exactly why he ended up criticising it.

00:13:00.368 --> 00:13:06.218
It didn’t have magic, it had no story behind it, it existed just to facilitate communication.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:12.264
And for Tolkein, that was removing a large part of the beauty of language.

00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:15.284
But, that is just Tolkein’s opinion.

00:13:15.724 --> 00:13:19.704
For the hundreds of thousands, or perhaps even millions of people

00:13:19.854 --> 00:13:24.624
who do speak Esperanto, it is an absolutely fantastic invention.

00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:29.534
It lowers the barriers to language learning, and lowers the

00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:33.000
barrier to communicating with people who can’t speak your language.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.354
And if that’s not the point of language, then what is, an Esperanto purist might say.

00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:44.484
Now, our third invented language is in a very different category.

00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:52.084
Tolkien invented languages to give a voice to his fictional characters, to create myths and stories.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:57.888
Zamenhof created Esperanto to facilitate communication, to make it easier

00:13:57.928 --> 00:14:01.578
for people who didn’t understand each other to understand each other.

00:14:02.378 --> 00:14:06.398
Our third example of an invented language is something called Láadan.

00:14:07.702 --> 00:14:11.532
Unless you are a big fan of invented languages I imagine you might

00:14:11.532 --> 00:14:15.832
not have heard it before, but here’s a little clip of it being spoken.

00:14:17.988 --> 00:14:40.938
Person speaking Láadan.

00:14:50.964 --> 00:14:53.994
Láadan is a language created by a lady called Suzette

00:14:54.214 --> 00:14:58.944
Haden Elgin in the 1982 science fiction book Native Tongue.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:06.860
The reason I think this language, or at least the idea of this language is so interesting is

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:13.630
that it was created to test something called the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, which is the idea

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:20.030
that the structure of the language you speak changes your worldview, and your behaviour.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.640
English, as a language, is quite a male-dominated language.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.350
We often use male words to describe things that apply to both

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.021
men and women - mankind, for example, instead of womankind.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:44.410
And even in that example, of man and woman, the root of the word is man, it's the male part.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:52.191
The philosophical idea that Elgin wanted to experiment with, with her creation of Láadan is of a

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:59.281
language that put women at its centre, and made it easier for women to use and express themselves.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:04.959
To do this, Láadan is constructed completely differently to English.

00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:10.929
At the start of a sentence in Láadan you need to use a word that introduces what you

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:15.789
are going to be saying in the sentence, and at the end of the sentence you need to

00:16:15.789 --> 00:16:21.459
add another word that explains how sure you are about what you have just said, whether

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:26.509
it’s something you know to be true, or whether you have just heard someone else say it.

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:33.019
Elgin believed that male-dominated language means women often have to repeat

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:38.619
and clarify themselves, whereas in her invented language of Láadan women

00:16:38.849 --> 00:16:43.729
wouldn’t need to do this because the meaning is right there in the sentence.

00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:49.989
Láadan now does have some die-hard fans, some people who are absolutely passionate

00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:55.309
about what it is and what it represents, but Elgin’s idea wasn’t for this to

00:16:55.309 --> 00:17:01.279
become some widespread language that took over from English or Spanish or Mandarin.

00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:10.579
Instead, she created it as an example to get us thinking about how what we say affects how we think.

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:19.299
If a language is dominated by male words, male roots of words, and men find it an easier language

00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:25.439
to use than women, how does this affect the behaviour of men and women who use that language?

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.559
The answer to this question might be ‘it doesn’t affect it at

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:34.109
all’, but Elgin’s idea was to at least get us thinking about it.

00:17:34.829 --> 00:17:38.419
And as far as that is concerned, she definitely succeeded.

00:17:39.609 --> 00:17:45.589
Now, we actually have a fourth, bonus invented language to talk about today, and it’s a

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:51.639
bonus one because it’s not completely invented, or at least it isn’t invented from scratch.

00:17:52.229 --> 00:17:55.419
I’ll play a clip of it now, and I’m sure you will recognise it.

00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:57.729
Where are you from?

00:17:59.169 --> 00:18:04.929
I am from a big city speak and say your city.

00:18:05.782 --> 00:18:07.132
Now, it’s English, right?

00:18:07.532 --> 00:18:09.262
Well, yes and no.

00:18:09.732 --> 00:18:15.592
It’s actually something called Learning English, but was first called Special English.

00:18:16.632 --> 00:18:22.951
It was created in 1959 by the Voice of America broadcasting service, and intended

00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:28.554
to be a very basic, simple form of English that helped people learn the language.

00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:37.034
As you can hear, it is spoken slowly, very clearly, and the vocabulary is basic.

00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:44.424
While this isn’t an entirely invented language, it is something called a controlled language.

00:18:45.134 --> 00:18:49.714
It’s based on something called Basic English, which was developed after

00:18:49.714 --> 00:18:54.354
World War II by a linguist and philosopher called Charles Kay Ogden.

00:18:55.474 --> 00:19:02.114
Similar to Zamenhof and Esperanto, Ogden believed that world peace and prosperity would

00:19:02.114 --> 00:19:06.994
come from everyone speaking one language and being able to communicate more easily.

00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:12.714
But he took a more colonial approach, and believed that language

00:19:12.724 --> 00:19:17.204
should be English, either in its basic or in its complete form.

00:19:18.414 --> 00:19:22.424
He said, and I'm quoting directly here “What the world needs

00:19:22.564 --> 00:19:27.714
most is about 1,000 more dead languages—and one more alive.”

00:19:28.874 --> 00:19:33.264
So, although this is by no means accusing the Voice of America of

00:19:33.264 --> 00:19:37.594
wanting to kill off every language other than English, the origin of its

00:19:37.614 --> 00:19:42.374
Learning English, or Special English is Ogden, and his Basic English.

00:19:43.654 --> 00:19:48.974
These four are of course only a tiny selection of the man-made, invented languages.

00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:54.354
We haven’t talked about Valyrian or Dothraki, the two invented languages

00:19:54.364 --> 00:20:00.314
in Game of Thrones, or Newspeak, the language created by Orwell in 1984.

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:06.722
All of these languages are created for slightly different reasons, they serve different purposes.

00:20:07.894 --> 00:20:10.564
Some are mythical, others are functional.

00:20:11.154 --> 00:20:15.794
Some use different sentence structures, others restrict what you can say.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.390
What they do all teach us, though, is that language is imperfect.

00:20:21.924 --> 00:20:26.844
We might try to simplify it to make it easy for everyone to understand,

00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:32.264
but then it loses some flexibility, we don’t have the words to say

00:20:32.304 --> 00:20:36.754
exactly what we want and we end up saying things that we do not mean.

00:20:37.944 --> 00:20:42.134
We might try to make it more complicated, but if it’s too complicated,

00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:47.514
if it's too hard to learn and to use, people cannot say what they mean.

00:20:48.416 --> 00:20:53.596
And often you find words in languages that don’t quite translate to your own.

00:20:54.216 --> 00:20:57.656
I imagine you will have experienced this with English, or

00:20:57.826 --> 00:21:00.406
with another foreign language that you have been learning.

00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:05.306
You find a word or expression, you might find a definition,

00:21:05.316 --> 00:21:09.586
or a translation, but the true meaning won’t be exactly right.

00:21:10.706 --> 00:21:17.516
I have an ongoing game with my wife, whose mother tongue is Italian, where I always take a little

00:21:17.516 --> 00:21:23.396
pleasure if there’s a word in English that you can’t completely translate into Italian, and she will

00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:28.766
take the same pleasure if she can find one in Italian that doesn’t quite translate into English.

00:21:29.606 --> 00:21:33.776
One might think that languages are complete, that their development over

00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:37.866
thousands of years has meant that we are able to say whatever we want to say.

00:21:38.586 --> 00:21:45.276
But of course the experience of anyone who speaks more than one language, and certainly anyone who

00:21:45.276 --> 00:21:51.306
has gone to the trouble of inventing their own languages, knows that this is far from the truth.

00:21:54.109 --> 00:22:01.399
OK then, that is it for today's episode on invented languages, the first part of this three-part

00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:07.629
mini series on unorthodox language stories, language invention, creation and discovery.

00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:12.079
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that

00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:16.429
it’s made you think slightly differently about how language is constructed.

00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:20.639
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:21.449 --> 00:22:26.819
What words or expressions do you have in your language that have no direct translation to English?

00:22:27.459 --> 00:22:30.769
And similarly, are there expressions in English that

00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:33.229
don’t directly translate into your mother tongue?

00:22:33.979 --> 00:22:34.989
I would love to know.

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:38.239

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.690
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.090
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.460
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.280
I'm Alastair Budge, and today
we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.840
AI, Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.230
This is partially a follow-up episode to
the one last week, where we talked about

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.200
Artificial Intelligence and language
learning, but it is also a follow-up

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.500
episode to a blog article and a video
that you can find on leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.880
In today’s episode, we are going to
talk about how AI did when I gave it a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.780
very specific task, the task of writing
a podcast, and we’ll ask ourselves

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.220
how this technology might impact the
world not just of podcasting, but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.120
the world of creation more generally.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.010
Let’s get right into it.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.790
Now, as you may remember from the last
episode, a company called OpenAI released

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.940
a chatbot powered by AI, where you can
type almost anything into the chat, and

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.710
you receive back a human-like response.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.683
You can ask it to respond to an
email, you can ask it to tell you

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:32.793
about a period of history, explain a
scientific concept, give you a recipe,

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:37.653
almost anything you could ask a human
being, you can ask this chatbot.

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:45.273
So, I thought, well, I wonder if it can
write a podcast episode, I wonder how

00:01:45.303 --> 00:01:50.853
it will do if I ask it to write a script
for English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:56.553
Currently, as you may know or you can
probably imagine, there are many hours of

00:01:56.763 --> 00:02:02.153
research, writing, editing and rewriting
that go into writing a script for this

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:07.353
podcast, and the process typically
involves multiple talented people.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:13.783
It’s a lot of work, so I was very
curious, somewhat scared even, if

00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:19.463
all of this could simply be replaced
by an AI, replaced by a robot.

00:02:20.523 --> 00:02:26.083
If an AI could do as well, if not
better than me and the Leonardo English

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:29.803
team, well that would be quite scary.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.203
So, how did it do?

00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:38.413
I actually recorded the entire process
of me doing this, so if you haven’t seen

00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:42.503
this already, you can watch it if you
like, it’s over on the Leonardo English

00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:45.193
blog, and you can find a link below.

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:50.373
It was a pretty amazing experience,
and I’d certainly recommend checking

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:52.273
it out if you haven’t done so already.

00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:58.413
Anyway, long story short, I told
the AI a little bit about English

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:03.053
Learning for Curious Minds, about
who listens to the podcast, and I

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:05.303
gave it some examples of topics.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:08.923
Then, I asked it to suggest some new ones.

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:14.943
I have to say, the results, the
topic suggestions, were pretty good.

00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:21.163
It suggested an article on spying, the
history of cars, and it even suggested

00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:25.783
a couple that we have done already
- the mysterious world of cryptids

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:28.183
and one on the science of dreams.

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:35.113
Anyway, one title particularly stood
out to me: "The History of the Circus:

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.563
From Ancient Rome to the Modern Day"

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:39.533
Interesting, I thought.

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:45.723
OK, let’s see if the AI can
actually write a script.

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:52.163
Now, I first asked it to create
an outline for me, a plan of what

00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:53.843
it would cover in the episode.

00:03:54.673 --> 00:03:59.133
It did a really good job, following
a structure that I might have chosen

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.123
had I been writing the episode.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:07.163
I did need to give it quite specific
instructions, quite detailed instructions,

00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:09.533
but the results were encouraging.

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.508
But, that was the easy bit.

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:17.958
How would it manage when it actually
had to write in perfectly correct

00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:23.078
English, using a varied vocabulary,
using interesting words and phrases,

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:28.208
repeating harder words, and writing
a script that would be spoken out

00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:33.388
loud, not simply a blog article or
something that would sound unnatural?

00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:38.598
And how would it manage to fill
the script with a mixture of

00:04:38.898 --> 00:04:43.148
interesting facts and trivia,
combined with a compelling narrative?

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:46.708
Ultimately, would it tell a good story?

00:04:47.918 --> 00:04:51.738
On this count, again it
did surprisingly well.

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:57.132
It wrote each section individually,
I was able to give it feedback after

00:04:57.142 --> 00:05:03.122
each one, asking it to make some small
changes, and the results were encouraging.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:08.982
There were some factual inconsistencies,
some things that weren’t quite right or

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:15.822
seemed a little strange, but overall it
followed instructions well, and it did

00:05:15.822 --> 00:05:18.322
a better job than lots of humans would.

00:05:19.162 --> 00:05:23.712
I say this, actually, because I have
seen the work of many, many human

00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:28.592
scriptwriters, researchers and writers
who have applied to Leonardo English

00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:34.342
to help me write episodes, and this AI
was a better writer than lots of them.

00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:40.672
We’ll move onto the consequences of
this, the impact of this, in a minute.

00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:43.422
So, the finished product.

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:50.752
This AI chatbot, this AI robot, did
manage to write an entire script for an

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:52.772
episode on the history of the circus.

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:58.462
The script was quite good
overall, I’d give it 6/10 perhaps.

00:05:58.912 --> 00:06:03.632
If you’d like to see it for yourself, you
can read the finished script on the blog.

00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:08.632
I'll put a link in the notes, but you
can find it at leonardoenglish.com/blog.

00:06:09.462 --> 00:06:15.432
It was a pretty amazing experience
to see this robot, this artificial

00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:20.982
intelligence, in action, and for me
it was a kind of life-changing moment

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:23.992
to see how human-like this AI was.

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:27.142
Now, what does this all mean?

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:31.642
Firstly, if you are worried that
episodes of English Learning for

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:37.812
Curious Minds are going to be written by
robots, by AI in the future, fear not.

00:06:38.002 --> 00:06:39.142
That’s not going to happen.

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:45.652
At the moment, this AI isn’t capable
of original thought, it can’t really

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:48.412
provide opinions or data like that.

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:54.442
It can analyse lots of information and
provide conclusions and summaries, it

00:06:54.442 --> 00:06:59.842
has access to the archives of history
and knows fascinating stories, but it

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:02.012
isn’t a particularly great storyteller.

00:07:02.992 --> 00:07:04.052
Yet, at least.

00:07:04.732 --> 00:07:08.602
So, don’t worry, our episodes
will continue to be written by

00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:10.472
humans, nothing is changing there.

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:16.332
But, let me use this example, the
example of English Learning for Curious

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:21.732
Minds, to ask you to take part in
an interesting thought experiment.

00:07:22.872 --> 00:07:29.102
How would it change your opinion about a
podcast, a journalist, a writer, if you

00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:35.612
found out that their writing wasn’t their
writing, it was the writing of an AI?

00:07:36.432 --> 00:07:40.872
Let’s say you had been reading someone’s
books, or listening to a podcast for

00:07:40.872 --> 00:07:45.922
years, really enjoying it, and then
you found out that it had actually

00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:48.872
been written by AI, by a computer?

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:54.622
If you didn’t know that it was until
you were told, how would that change

00:07:54.622 --> 00:07:58.492
your experience, how would that
change the way it made you feel?

00:07:59.652 --> 00:08:02.702
Feel free to press pause
for a minute and think.

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:09.852
It’s a really important question,
because the line between what is created

00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:15.762
by humans and what is created by AI
is going to be more and more blurred.

00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:21.242
Ultimately, does it matter who,
or what, created something?

00:08:22.472 --> 00:08:24.562
Yes, you probably think, it does.

00:08:25.022 --> 00:08:30.182
If you listen to a heart-breaking story
of young romance and you are led to

00:08:30.182 --> 00:08:35.682
believe that  this is true, then you
find out it was all invented by an AI,

00:08:36.012 --> 00:08:41.182
I imagine that you would feel tricked,
you’d feel duped, you would feel misled.

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:46.822
But if you never found out that it
had been written by an AI, those

00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:51.612
feelings you felt were true, they
were real, does it really matter

00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:56.162
if the entire story was fictional
and created by a smart technology?

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:02.062
Let me give you another example,
one that might sound more basic.

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:08.232
Most of the products we use, from
the clothes we wear to the cars we

00:09:08.232 --> 00:09:14.062
drive to the food we eat is made in a
great part by technology, by robots.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:20.802
If it was made exclusively by humans,
without the intervention of robots, it

00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:22.702
would be substantially more expensive.

00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:25.012
Let’s take the example of clothes.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:28.702
Pure handmade clothes are expensive.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:35.012
Mass-produced clothes, made in large part
via automated machines, can be very cheap.

00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:40.592
Most people around the world choose
mass-produced clothes, because they

00:09:40.592 --> 00:09:45.162
are a utility, people don’t care
about how they were made, they only

00:09:45.162 --> 00:09:47.272
care about the finished product.

00:09:48.092 --> 00:09:54.212
Sure, you can choose to shop in a more
ethical way, to make sure that the people

00:09:54.212 --> 00:09:58.642
involved in the process of creating
your clothes are treated well and paid

00:09:58.642 --> 00:10:05.172
fairly, but ultimately you care about
the final product, not the process.

00:10:06.382 --> 00:10:11.582
In some cases, for example with cars,
I imagine many people would probably

00:10:11.582 --> 00:10:16.532
prefer the idea of a robot making the
car rather than it being “handmade”.

00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:22.772
So, why can’t an AI write a
play, paint a picture, or dare

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:24.432
I even say it, make a podcast?

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:30.202
Maybe you’re thinking, well,
I guess they can then, but let

00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:31.542
me give you my point of view.

00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:37.632
At the moment at least, we still care
about the process of creation, and

00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:42.242
the more creative the process is,
the more we care about the process.

00:10:43.302 --> 00:10:49.152
For example, if you visit a small village
and go to a small workshop where a

00:10:49.162 --> 00:10:55.022
family has been making chocolate, let’s
say, for 100 years, and you can see the

00:10:55.092 --> 00:11:00.942
intricate process of lovingly crafting
this chocolate, you are probably more

00:11:00.942 --> 00:11:05.892
willing to buy it, and pay more for
it, than you would if you went to the

00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:10.022
supermarket and bought a mass-produced
chocolate bar from the shelf.

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:16.152
It’s because you care about the process
of creation, you have a connection

00:11:16.382 --> 00:11:21.162
with the human beings you’ve seen going
through the process of creation, a much

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:25.562
bigger connection than you have with a
multinational company that makes hundreds

00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:27.422
of millions of chocolate bars every week.

00:11:28.262 --> 00:11:33.172
So, let’s bring this back to AI,
and the title of this episode,

00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:35.722
“Can A Robot Write A Podcast?”

00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:41.802
Yes, ultimately, a robot can
write a podcast episode, it can

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.272
do a pretty good job, in fact.

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:48.882
I’m sure that there will be plenty of
podcasters, writers, journalists, who

00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:53.772
will use AI tools like this to write
parts or the entirety of their work.

00:11:54.492 --> 00:11:56.232
In fact, we’ve seen this already.

00:11:56.712 --> 00:12:02.582
An early but less sophisticated version
of this tool, this AI, was released in

00:12:02.582 --> 00:12:09.022
2020, and there was a flood of products
built that allowed entire blog articles

00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:11.812
to be written based of different prompts.

00:12:12.572 --> 00:12:17.052
You could tell the AI to “write a blog
article about the best sandwich shops

00:12:17.072 --> 00:12:22.832
in London” or the “top 10 activities
for young families in Paris”, and the AI

00:12:22.972 --> 00:12:27.732
would write out a basic article on the
subject that sounded almost like a human.

00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:34.202
The purpose of this was purely to create
content for websites, so that they would

00:12:34.202 --> 00:12:38.922
get more people to them and make more
money, there was pretty much no care

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.082
given to the quality of the content.

00:12:41.882 --> 00:12:46.662
And this is why you might have seen
so much low-quality content if you

00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:50.722
searched Google over the past few
years - all the AI was doing was

00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:56.172
rehashing, reformatting existing
content, it wasn’t creating anything new.

00:12:57.052 --> 00:13:01.578
And this is one of the big
criticisms, or at least limitations

00:13:01.718 --> 00:13:03.738
of the current version of AI.

00:13:04.148 --> 00:13:09.158
It's very capable of analysing
existing information and providing

00:13:09.448 --> 00:13:15.008
summaries, but it isn’t yet capable
of creating anything new or original.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:21.668
With the example of the “best sandwich
shops in London” or “top 10 activities for

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:27.048
young families in Paris”, it has no way
of going to a new sandwich shop, tasting

00:13:27.048 --> 00:13:32.308
their sandwich and reviewing it, or taking
a young family to an attraction in Paris

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.398
and writing its own opinion about it.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:40.848
All it does is it takes the information
that currently exists and gives

00:13:40.848 --> 00:13:42.538
it to you in a different format.

00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:46.953
So, at least right now,
there are limitations to what

00:13:47.058 --> 00:13:48.548
Artificial Intelligence can do.

00:13:49.423 --> 00:13:55.008
But it is, to use the cliche,
a game changer, it is going to

00:13:55.008 --> 00:14:00.318
fundamentally change society, and the
world of work, for almost everyone.

00:14:01.548 --> 00:14:06.698
When robots started to replace humans
in factories, people like journalists,

00:14:06.858 --> 00:14:12.228
lawyers and writers no doubt felt
some sorrow about this, but felt

00:14:12.388 --> 00:14:14.398
that their jobs were perfectly safe.

00:14:14.948 --> 00:14:18.618
After all, a robot could never
completely replace them, right?

00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:25.118
But it’s clear that, at least on the
lower end, the more mass-produced

00:14:25.118 --> 00:14:28.838
and unoriginal end, yes they can.

00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:33.738
We’ve seen this already with
generic blog content, but it

00:14:33.738 --> 00:14:35.568
has even spread to newspapers.

00:14:36.228 --> 00:14:41.778
Many news articles about things like
lower league sporting fixtures or company

00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:47.968
reports are completely written by AI,
because people don’t really care about who

00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:53.158
wrote it, they just want the information
about what happened, they want the detail,

00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:59.208
the facts, the figures, who scored, did
a company make or lose money, and so on.

00:15:00.328 --> 00:15:05.588
And an AI is perfectly capable of
creating this kind of content, indeed,

00:15:05.758 --> 00:15:10.318
most people don’t know they are
actually reading AI-written content.

00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:17.568
As of yet, opinions, analysis and original
thought has remained the preserve of human

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:23.568
beings, there isn’t a robot columnist or
a best-selling AI non-fictional author.

00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:29.428
And, there aren’t yet, as far as
I’m aware, any real podcasts written

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.878
and presented exclusively by AI.

00:15:32.748 --> 00:15:37.468
And this podcast isn’t going to become
the first, so please do not worry

00:15:37.468 --> 00:15:43.328
about this; this is not a coded message
from me informing you that a robot

00:15:43.478 --> 00:15:47.938
has taken over control of Leonardo
English, and that from now on, an

00:15:47.968 --> 00:15:50.428
AI will be writing every episode.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:57.358
But, an interesting thought that I want to
leave you with today is, what if it had?

00:16:00.068 --> 00:16:05.208
OK then, that is it for today's
episode on AI, and specifically,

00:16:05.348 --> 00:16:07.478
whether an AI can write a podcast.

00:16:08.148 --> 00:16:12.458
If you haven’t done so already, I would
recommend you check out the episode before

00:16:12.458 --> 00:16:17.678
this, on AI and language learning, and
you read the blog article where I wrote

00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:22.168
about my experience trying to get an AI
to write an episode, and you can read the

00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:24.618
full script with what it came up with.

00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:28.881
I think it’s absolutely fascinating
to think about how this technology

00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:32.752
is going to change the world, and I’d
love to know what you think as well.

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:37.042
What impact will AI have
on you, and your job?

00:16:37.362 --> 00:16:42.402
Do you think a robot could ever
replace you at work, and if so, how?

00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:45.422
If not, are you so sure about it?

00:16:46.102 --> 00:16:49.662
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:52.722
You can head right into our
community forum, which is at

00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:57.632
community.leonardoenglish.com and get
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:16:58.612 --> 00:17:03.172
You've been listening to English Learning
for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:03.492 --> 00:17:08.422
I'm Alastair Budge, I’m not a robot,
and I'll catch you in the next episode.

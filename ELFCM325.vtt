Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.873
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:21.123
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:25.193
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our

00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:29.113
three-part mini-series on British children’s authors.

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:36.253
In part one, we explored the unusual life of Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.560
In part three, we’ll follow Roald Dahl and how he became the famous

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.520
author of books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.876
And today, in part two, we’ll look at the life and work of a lady called Enid Blyton.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.490
Now, she might be the least famous of the three outside the UK, but she is one of the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.800
best-selling children’s authors of the 20th century, selling more than 600 million

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.690
books, and in fact she is the 7th most commercially successful author of all time.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.230
She was loved by millions of children, but loathed by many parents.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.440
From the outside, she was the perfect wife and mother,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.230
writing about her marvellous life and her love of children.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.860
Yet behind the scenes, the reality was very, very different.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.650
So, let’s get right into it and learn about the life and work

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180
of Enid Blyton, Britain’s Most Divisive Children’s Writer.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.080
In 1952 at the age of 55, Enid Blyton wrote in her autobiography:

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.400
“As you can imagine we are a happy little family.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.815
I could not possibly write a single good book for children if I were

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.590
not happy with my family, or if I didn’t put them first and foremost.”

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.443
Indeed, it’s true that Blyton had written many good books, a whopping 700

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.720
throughout her whole career, and she had cultivated tens of millions of young fans.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.600
To her fans, she was a wholesome mother sharing sweet stories with

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.760
the world, but behind closed doors, the reality was anything but.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.220
While she wrote stories urging children to be kind and generous, to act as

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.660
good, moral citizens, in her private life, she did not heed the same advice.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.200
And over time, it would appear that Blyton’s books of fun,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.870
adventure and friendship were masking a very different reality.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.080
And this reality started with a broken home, a dysfunctional childhood of her own.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.490
She was born in London, in 1897, but her childhood was not a happy one.

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:06.802
She would hear her parents have ferocious arguments, then one

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:12.302
day, when she was 13, her father left, he walked out for good.

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:18.112
Blyton was heartbroken and felt she had lost her best friend.

00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:23.942
She blamed her mother for her father’s departure, and she never forgave her for it.

00:03:25.092 --> 00:03:30.362
To distract herself, she retreated to her bedroom and spent most of her time writing.

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:35.742
And it was not long before she had won a poetry competition and when

00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:39.972
she was just 14 her work was published in a children’s magazine.

00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:46.362
She was thrilled and from that moment on she knew she wanted to be a writer.

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:53.732
But her mother was not supportive of her daughter’s dream, believing that as a young woman, her

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:59.772
daughter’s focus should’ve been on learning household chores and learning how to look after a home.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:06.732
Essentially, she should have focused on following the traditional Victorian path of finding a

00:04:06.752 --> 00:04:12.912
husband, raising children, and devoting her attention to looking after the house and her family.

00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:19.022
Blyton wasn’t so keen on this idea and soon she could think

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:23.212
of nothing but leaving her home and striking out on her own.

00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:31.262
By the time she was 19 she did just that, when in 1916 she left home to begin

00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:35.592
training as a primary school teacher, never to speak to her mother again.

00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:41.622
Alongside her teaching job, she continued writing and entering competitions.

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:49.352
By 1921, things were starting to look up, the situation was more positive.

00:04:50.412 --> 00:04:54.792
She won another competition and the following year would see the publication

00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:59.792
of her first book, a collection of 28 poems called Child Whispers.

00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:05.112
And over the next decade, her writing career would really

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:08.012
take off, it really became commercially successful.

00:05:08.878 --> 00:05:14.698
This was helped by the start of her regular contributions to a magazine called Teachers’ World.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.298
The magazine provided teachers with a variety of material

00:05:19.488 --> 00:05:22.008
written for children to be used in their classrooms.

00:05:23.368 --> 00:05:28.088
Blyton wrote short stories, poems, and essays and soon

00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:31.048
her column became an incredible piece of marketing.

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:36.168
Teachers’ World really gave Blyton the opportunity to design

00:05:36.318 --> 00:05:40.118
her own image and attract fans who would buy her books.

00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:45.118
Her brand was one of a wholesome writer who offered

00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.518
whimsical, or playful, descriptions of the world around her.

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:53.928
She combined the familiar settings of schools, playgrounds, and

00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:58.388
the outdoors with exciting stories of mysteries and adventure.

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:04.228
Sometimes she would write about nature or natural history but often

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:09.028
the world became animated with flowers, fairies and talking animals.

00:06:09.998 --> 00:06:16.318
Her most popular contributions were, in fact, letters written from her little dog called Bobs.

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:22.578
And over the years Blyton continued to write for the magazine and increasingly

00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:27.308
told her readers more about her life, making everything sound wonderful.

00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:32.548
She would often mention her husband, her perfect daughters Gillian

00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:36.798
and Imogen, and how happy they all were in their beautiful home.

00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:44.048
And her strategy clearly worked, as just two years after she began writing in Teachers’ World

00:06:44.368 --> 00:06:51.538
she was making £1,200 a year, which is the equivalent of around 60,000 euros a year today.

00:06:53.048 --> 00:06:57.908
There are, interestingly enough, many parallels between Enid Blyton in the

00:06:57.908 --> 00:07:04.558
1920s, and modern day influencers, YouTubers or TikTokers 100 years later.

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:11.498
Enid Blyton offered her fans an almost real-time intimate glance

00:07:11.548 --> 00:07:16.558
into the details of her life, her family, and her thought process.

00:07:17.108 --> 00:07:21.698
Instead of likes and followers, though, Blyton received thousands

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:25.118
of letters from children which she spent hours replying to.

00:07:26.638 --> 00:07:33.358
But, much like some modern influencers, you might say, things weren’t quite as they seemed.

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:40.808
By the 1930s her life was more like a soap opera than a fairy tale, and it was

00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:45.748
certainly far from the harmonious one the public read about in Teachers’ World.

00:07:47.188 --> 00:07:52.448
After the birth of her first daughter Gillian in 1931, Blyton’s

00:07:52.468 --> 00:07:57.078
marriage to her first husband, Hugh Pollock, was starting to fall apart.

00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:03.198
Her husband had fought in the First World War, and, like so many men who had

00:08:03.198 --> 00:08:08.818
survived the war, was still likely suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:17.758
As a way to cope, he turned to the bottle, and fell deeper and deeper into a spiral of alcoholism.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:23.118
To make matters worse, he also started an affair with his secretary.

00:08:23.998 --> 00:08:31.058
Blyton was furious, also starting a series of affairs herself, but none of this would be revealed

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:37.508
until much later, nothing would get in the way of the clean and perfect public image she presented.

00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:42.888
And while she would write about being the perfect mother, and the

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:48.228
importance of motherhood, Blyton rarely saw her own children, preferring

00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:53.018
writing or responding to letters from other children than seeing her own.

00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:58.748
The children were looked after by a team of nannies, and Blyton would only

00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:04.348
see her daughter at designated times, usually only for one hour after dinner.

00:09:05.668 --> 00:09:13.408
And after the birth of her second daughter, Imogen, in 1934, things had continued to go downhill.

00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:20.588
Blyton saw her daughters even less and her husband had taken to drinking secretly in the cellar.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:26.578
Later in life, her daughter Imogen would admit that as a young girl she saw

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:31.948
so little of her mother that she did not even realise that she was her mother.

00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:37.931
And although you might think, well perhaps she preferred other children to

00:09:37.961 --> 00:09:42.871
her own, it seems that she wasn’t even very keen on other children either.

00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:46.901
There’s a story of Blyton getting cross with a little girl

00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:50.901
who lived next door to her because she was singing too loudly.

00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:55.261
Blyton shouted at her, demanding she be quiet.

00:09:56.291 --> 00:10:00.311
When the girl would not, she demanded the girl’s mother do something.

00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:03.981
But the mother didn’t see anything wrong.

00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:08.201
The girl was singing, and surely Blyton, as the country’s

00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:11.931
leading example of how to be a good parent, could understand.

00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:17.191
Enraged, Blyton retaliated in the best way she knew.

00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:25.231
She wrote a nasty story about the girl, transforming her into a character called Lucy Loud-Voice.

00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:32.071
Now, we’ve heard a bit about her personal life, what of her writing, you may be thinking?

00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:35.111
Well, firstly, it was prolific.

00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:40.411
She was known to write anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 words a day.

00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:46.351
And let’s not forget she would be writing on a typewriter, which certainly wasn’t easy.

00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:51.447
Throughout the Second World War, despite the fact that paper was

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:56.547
rationed, it was in limited supply, Blyton never stopped writing.

00:10:57.787 --> 00:11:03.787
In 1942 she published 22 books, and managed another 23 a year later.

00:11:04.517 --> 00:11:10.087
And these were always alongside countless magazine articles, interviews and poems.

00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:16.057
It’s not hard to see how she became one of the most prolific children’s authors of all time.

00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:23.487
And it's fair to say that by the end of the war in 1945, Blyton, aged 48,

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:28.167
was quite the celebrity and was enjoying an incredible amount of success.

00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:32.587
She was regularly producing new adventure books for series

00:11:32.587 --> 00:11:36.317
like The Famous Five, The Faraway Tree, and Malory Towers.

00:11:37.237 --> 00:11:43.297
By 1949, Blyton had also written the first Secret Seven and Noddy books.

00:11:43.827 --> 00:11:48.417
She was like a machine, writing tens of thousands of words every week.

00:11:49.147 --> 00:11:52.857
At her peak, she was writing around 50 books a year.

00:11:53.487 --> 00:11:58.537
People began rumours that she actually had a team of ghost writers but she always denied this.

00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:04.367
The popularity of her books likely stemmed from children enjoying the adventures

00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:09.217
of protagonists their own age in settings British children were familiar with.

00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:14.867
Many of Blyton’s books, such as The Famous Five, take place in the English

00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:20.357
countryside or at the seaside, the main holiday destinations for families at the time.

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:26.977
Other stories, such as those of Malory Towers, are set in schools and involve

00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:33.797
friendship, mischief, and growing-up, all relatable topics for Blyton’s young audience.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:37.937
If you’ve read any of them, you’ll know that the books are

00:12:37.947 --> 00:12:41.937
simple, the stories are easy for a young audience to understand.

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:47.937
Compared to the works of Roald Dahl or Lewis Carroll, with at times

00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:53.017
difficult language and complicated plots, there isn’t much depth to them.

00:12:53.487 --> 00:12:58.977
They’re not amazing stories, they are quite basic adventure stories, predictable,

00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:04.377
and not super interesting, they’re very different from the truly magical worlds

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:09.317
created by the other authors in this mini-series, and later of course by J.K.

00:13:09.317 --> 00:13:09.657
Rowling.

00:13:11.067 --> 00:13:15.527
As you might imagine, this meant that Enid Blyton was frequently

00:13:15.627 --> 00:13:20.657
dismissed, criticised, by adults as an author not worth reading.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:28.497
For a 30-year period she was actually banned by the BBC, because they considered that her

00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:35.457
work didn’t have “much literary value”, and that she was, quote, "a tenacious second-rater".

00:13:36.157 --> 00:13:40.347
Essentially, her books were without substance, they weren't very good.

00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:48.137
But this didn’t stop her commercial success, because her readers, children, loved her.

00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:55.477
For her adult supporters, they put forward the argument that children don’t always want or need

00:13:55.587 --> 00:14:01.537
complicated plots; they enjoy familiarity, they like the idea of knowing what might happen,

00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:08.427
and this is why Blyton’s extensive body of work was so loved by teen readers, teenage readers.

00:14:09.427 --> 00:14:13.547
And she would, in time, create something for an even younger

00:14:13.577 --> 00:14:17.087
audience that would make her even more of a household name.

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:22.537
In 1949, she created the Noddy series.

00:14:23.397 --> 00:14:28.737
In case you don’t know Noddy is a toy with a blue hat and a red shirt,

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:33.687
he lives in a place called ToyLand and has a friend called Big Ears.

00:14:34.327 --> 00:14:37.637
For the French listeners, you might know him as Oui-Oui.

00:14:38.977 --> 00:14:44.647
The important thing for our story is that he was a huge commercial success, there are still

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:51.507
Noddy TV series, toys, and merchandise, and he made Enid Blyton even more of a household name.

00:14:52.597 --> 00:14:58.087
But, much like all of Blyton’s other work, Noddy wasn’t unanimously loved,

00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:04.047
with the character being described by one 1960s critic as "the most egocentric,

00:15:04.257 --> 00:15:09.127
joyless, snivelling and pious anti-hero in the history of British fiction".

00:15:10.597 --> 00:15:12.777
Nevertheless, young children loved him.

00:15:13.357 --> 00:15:17.477
And as if Blyton wasn’t doing enough by writing countless books

00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:21.907
for her series, in 1953 she started her own magazine as well.

00:15:22.847 --> 00:15:27.487
Her contributions to the magazine were as impressive as her books but the

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:31.197
real achievement of the publication was the money it raised for charity.

00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:36.317
Blyton invited children to join different clubs and each would raise

00:15:36.317 --> 00:15:40.877
money for either animals, disabled children or a children’s care home.

00:15:42.037 --> 00:15:48.047
And by the end of the magazine in 1959, £35,000 had been

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:51.377
raised, the equivalent of almost a million euros today.

00:15:52.817 --> 00:15:57.667
Aside from her huge commercial success, and charitable work, she would

00:15:57.667 --> 00:16:02.667
continue to have her fair share of haters, critics, throughout her career.

00:16:03.657 --> 00:16:06.657
Yes, there were those who thought her work was without

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:10.087
substance, that it was vapid and uninteresting.

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:16.127
But she would later be accused of being much worse than an uninteresting author.

00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:21.367
She would be accused of being xenophobic, racist, and homophobic.

00:16:22.587 --> 00:16:28.997
In one book, the explanation for the villains being thieves was simply because they were foreign.

00:16:29.907 --> 00:16:34.437
In another, she wrote about a doll that was hated by his owners

00:16:34.647 --> 00:16:39.967
due to his, and these are Blyton’s exact words, “ugly black face”.

00:16:40.987 --> 00:16:48.277
Indeed, in 2019, the Royal Mint ,which produces all of Britain’s coins, refused to

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:53.547
honour Enid Blyton on a commemorative 50 pence coin, explaining that they consider

00:16:53.617 --> 00:16:59.437
her to be “a “racist, sexist homophobe and not a very well-regarded writer.”

00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:05.967
It’s not clear exactly where they got the homophobic part from, as this wasn’t specified,

00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:10.817
plus she was also rumoured to have had a lesbian relationship with one of her nannies,

00:17:11.137 --> 00:17:15.907
but the xenophobic and racist comments are certainly not without justification.

00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:22.887
Despite all this controversy, she is the 7th most successful author in the world, there have been

00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:30.067
over 600 million copies of her books sold and she has been translated into over 90 languages.

00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:35.227
So, the story of Enid Blyton is one of contradictions.

00:17:35.817 --> 00:17:40.507
Her books were dismissed as second-rate and simple by a generation

00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:44.597
of adults and she was banned by the country’s largest broadcaster.

00:17:45.787 --> 00:17:51.127
Despite this, she went on to be the best-selling British author of the 20th century.

00:17:52.327 --> 00:17:56.817
On a personal level, the contradictions were perhaps even greater.

00:17:57.897 --> 00:18:01.337
In public, she raised huge amounts of money for charity.

00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:05.617
In private, she was clearly vindictive and mean.

00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:09.097
In public, she was the perfect mother.

00:18:09.727 --> 00:18:14.167
In her private life, despite being one of the most popular children’s authors

00:18:14.317 --> 00:18:19.297
in history, her own daughter didn’t even realise her mother was her mother.

00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:24.547
And while evaluating the life and work of Enid Blyton, there are

00:18:24.547 --> 00:18:29.207
certainly two distinct camps, strong arguments on both sides.

00:18:30.017 --> 00:18:37.507
While she clearly held some views we now consider at best outdated and at worst disgraceful,

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:44.037
she provided an entire generation of children with a huge body of adventure books, and can

00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:49.767
claim responsibility for turning a generation of young minds into a generation of readers.

00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:57.387
She passed away in 1968, it’s been more than 50 years since she died, and it seems

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:02.407
that the controversy around her life and work will continue for many years to come.

00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:08.427
Ok then, that is it for part two of this mini-series,

00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:11.387
on the controversial life and works of Enid Blyton.

00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:14.947
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you learned

00:19:14.957 --> 00:19:18.287
a bit about the real life of this hugely successful author.

00:19:19.102 --> 00:19:22.504
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:22.874 --> 00:19:25.044
Have you read any Enid Blyton books?

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:26.324
What did you think about her?

00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:29.924
Can you see why she and her works are controversial?

00:19:30.534 --> 00:19:35.364
What role do you think adults should play in deciding what books children should read?

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:41.834
Should kids decide for themselves, or should simplistic books like Enid Blyton’s be avoided?

00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:45.574
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

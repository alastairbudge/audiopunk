Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:14.031
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be looking at a Russian oligarchs.

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.781
Specifically, how did they get so incredibly rich?

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:24.806
At the end of the Soviet Union there were 150 million people living in Russia.

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:30.865
All, in theory at least, equal as private property had largely been abolished.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:41.168
Within a few years, 22 individuals ended up owning 39% of the entire economy with a large part of

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:43.598
the rest of the population living in poverty.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:47.473
Today, we are going to be looking at how that happened.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.290
But before we get right into it, I just want to remind those of you listening to this podcast on

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.398
Spotify, Apple Podcasts or whatever other podcasts app you might be listening to it on that you can

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:04.818
get a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which is

00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:06.038
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:12.593
The website is also full of loads of helpful tips, tricks, and guides about learning English with

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:17.653
podcasts, so if you haven't checked that out, it's well worth doing so, if I may say so myself.

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:23.445
If you're already listening to this on the website, then congratulations, you're one step ahead of

00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:24.285
the game already.

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:27.502
Okay, so oligarchs.

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:30.605
The word oligarchy comes from the Greek.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:35.040
Oligoi means few, and arkhein means to rule.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.665
So it means the rule of a few, and an oligarch, well, an oligarch is one of the few who rule.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:49.295
When we talk about Russian oligarchs, we're talking about the men, and I'm afraid it is almost

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:56.339
exclusively men who managed to achieve vast wealth after the fall of the Soviet union in 1991.

00:01:57.256 --> 00:02:04.376
Names you may be familiar with include Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky, Friedman or the owner of Chelsea

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:06.506
football club, Roman Abramovich.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.869
To properly understand how the oligarchs managed to amass such riches, it's important to understand

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:18.289
a bit, not just about Russia, but also the world in 1991.

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:23.495
The Soviet Union or the USSR was formed in 1922.

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:30.772
For almost 70 years it had existed as a socialist republic and in the postwar period it had been

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:38.032
pretty economically stagnant while much of neighbouring Western Europe and archrival the US had been

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.992
enjoying the economic spoils of capitalism.

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:48.428
In 1991 Russia was still a very poor country, or rather, Russians were very poor.

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:55.095
GDP per capita was three and a half thousand dollars, about a seventh of that of America.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.668
When the USSR collapsed, Russia wanted some of that economic growth that the West had been enjoying.

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.471
However, private ownership as a concept didn't exist in the same way.

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:12.657
Everything from schools to shops to the factories you worked in.

00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:15.197
Everything was owned by the state.

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:22.749
Although some privatisation initiatives had been launched by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s it

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:28.346
wasn't until the early 1990s that the real push towards privatisation began.

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:35.941
As everything had historically been owned by the Russian state, the state had to figure out a way to

00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:41.231
transfer ownership from itself directly to the people.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.930
In theory, the aim for this was to be as equitable, as equal, as possible, but in practice it was

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.950
far from it.

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:56.686
They didn't want to sell the state assets to the highest bidder as they feared that this would lead

00:03:56.686 --> 00:04:00.956
to ownership being concentrated among the Russian mafia and bureaucrats.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:08.086
So they had to figure out a way of transferring ownership away from the state in a way that gave it

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:10.716
directly to the Russian people.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:17.588
Although they went about this in a number of ways, one of the most interesting, and one of the ways

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:23.038
in which the oligarchs managed to get so much power in such a short period was through something

00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:24.528
called the voucher system.

00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:28.203
The system was actually pretty simple.

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:35.901
To transfer assets from the state to the people, the Russian government gave a voucher to every man,

00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:37.071
woman, and child.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:45.269
These vouchers formed 30% of the state owned enterprises in Russia, of the state businesses in

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.549
Russia.

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:52.241
The idea here was that the Russian state was passing ownership back to the people.

00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:58.271
Ultimately the state belonged to the people, and this was a way of formalising the transfer of

00:04:58.271 --> 00:04:58.681
ownership.

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:06.437
The vouchers had a nominal price of around $20 and there were 150 million of them.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.050
If you're doing the maths, this means that there were a total of $3 billion worth of vouchers for

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.660
almost a third of the Russian economy making the entire Russian economy worth $10 billion.

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:28.135
For a country that now has an economy of one and a half trillion dollars, and with a quarter of the

00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:34.115
world's natural gas reserves and 10% of the world's oil, that's quite a bargain price.

00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:41.176
As most normal Russians didn't have any real understanding of how share ownership worked, it wasn't

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:44.416
really clear that they could do anything with these vouchers.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.530
And they had more pressing concerns, like having enough food and drink, and a huge number of these

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.070
vouchers were sold off to other enterprising Russians who would typically then sell them off for a

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.800
small profit.

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:05.038
Ultimately, these shares from the voucher scheme ended up in the hands of a small group of investors

00:06:05.238 --> 00:06:11.397
and powerful individuals, who managed to get ownership of 30% of the Russian economy and paid

00:06:11.397 --> 00:06:14.467
significantly less than what the assets were actually worth.

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:20.087
It's exactly the opposite of what was intended, at least in theory by the Russian state.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.204
That wasn't the only way though.

00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:29.614
By the time this had happened, a small group of men had managed to amass a large amount of wealth,

00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:36.204
through a series of what some might call ingenious schemes, others might call well, somewhere

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:38.504
between scheming and plain theft.

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:45.559
As we know, Russia was transitioning from a centrally planned and state run economy to a market

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:46.009
economy.

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:54.270
Very few people in Russia had any idea of how to do this, and there were many, many loopholes that

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.920
were exploited by enterprising Russians.

00:06:58.597 --> 00:07:04.517
Khodorkovsky, for example, one of the most famous oligarchs and one who ended up getting on the

00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:11.320
wrong side of Vladimir Putin, managed to set up his own bank after having found a loophole in

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.023
factory subsidies, and he amassed a pile of cash.

00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:22.091
As one of the only private banks in Russia, he managed to get vast amounts of money from the Russian

00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:28.586
state, with which he would then speculate on the currency markets and make a sizable profit from.

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:35.237
Others had managed to make millions through arbitraging the cost of Russian goods.

00:07:35.937 --> 00:07:42.058
That means they would buy something that was cheap in Russia, and cheap, typically because it was

00:07:42.058 --> 00:07:47.548
subsidised by the state, and then sell it on the world markets where it could command a much higher

00:07:47.548 --> 00:07:47.938
price.

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:56.331
By the mid 1990s there were around two dozen incredibly wealthy oligarchs in Russia, a group of whom

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:58.821
controlled practically all of the media.

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:07.005
At the same time the president, Boris Yeltsin, was deeply unpopular with the Russian people and

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:10.665
heading for defeat in the presidential elections of 1996.

00:08:11.718 --> 00:08:18.698
Yeltsin's challenger was a man called Gennady Zyuganov, who ran on an anti-oligarch pro-communist

00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:19.218
message.

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:22.824
The oligarchs stood to lose everything.

00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:30.324
And so the powerful men controlling the media threw all of their weight behind Yeltsin, and he came

00:08:30.324 --> 00:08:31.894
back to win a second term.

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:38.621
The agreement between Yeltsin and the oligarchs, according to many commentators, was, give me a

00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:43.351
second term and you'll get free rein to do whatever you want.

00:08:45.084 --> 00:08:52.527
Indeed, by the year 2000 a group of seven bankers known in Russia is semibankirskina controlled

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:57.967
anything from 50 to 70% of all Russian financial activity.

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:05.782
But how did they amass such incredible wealth and how did their wealth continued to grow in the

00:09:05.782 --> 00:09:07.472
latter half of the 1990s?

00:09:08.817 --> 00:09:14.668
Well, yes, they had managed to get control of cut-price Russian assets partly through the voucher

00:09:14.668 --> 00:09:17.785
scheme, but there are two more ways that we're going to cover today.

00:09:20.505 --> 00:09:23.615
Firstly, something called investment tenders.

00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:31.045
Even after the voucher scheme, the government left 20% of every state company still owned by the

00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:31.475
state.

00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:40.076
By the mid 1990s they were so anxious to continue the sell-off of state assets they would sell the

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:44.906
remaining 20% to anyone who promised to invest in the company.

00:09:45.862 --> 00:09:50.876
As we know, a large proportion of the state owned enterprises were very unproductive.

00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:57.996
They were just really bad, inefficient companies, and they needed a large amount of investment to

00:09:58.028 --> 00:10:00.448
allow them to compete in a market economy.

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:06.921
The Russian state was just desperate for someone to come along and fix these useless companies.

00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:11.521
And so in many cases, a promise of investment was enough to get the deal.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:18.311
So this meant that a load of these companies were snapped up at rock bottom prices and have since

00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:21.721
been turned around and many are hugely valuable.

00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:28.426
The final way in which they acquired their loot was through something called the loans for shares

00:10:28.426 --> 00:10:29.046
scheme.

00:10:30.176 --> 00:10:35.406
It was definitely the most scandalous of the ways in which the oligarchs became so wealthy.

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:43.412
How this worked was that the banks run by the oligarchs were charged with auctioning off some of

00:10:43.412 --> 00:10:49.272
Russia's largest state companies from steel manufacturers to oil and gas companies.

00:10:49.777 --> 00:10:56.027
The bankers rigged the auctions, meaning that in many cases they were also participating in the

00:10:56.027 --> 00:11:02.058
auction, so they were the auctioneer and the participant, and they could just pick themselves as the

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:02.378
winner.

00:11:03.669 --> 00:11:09.599
Evidently, if you are choosing yourself to be the winner of an auction, you want to pay as little

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:13.129
money as possible, and this is exactly what happened.

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:21.742
Khodorkovsky for example, received a stake in the oil and gas company Yukos for $310 million.

00:11:22.522 --> 00:11:27.992
Right, that might sound a lot of money to me or you, but that stake was actually worth $5 billion.

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:29.532
Quite a bargain.

00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:29.902
Right?

00:11:31.502 --> 00:11:38.132
Unsurprisingly, this made the oligarchs incredibly unpopular with the regular non-oligarch Russian

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:38.842
population.

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:44.192
You know, the 99.99999% of the population.

00:11:45.685 --> 00:11:50.423
The discounts that these oligarchs got on the state assets didn't come from nowhere.

00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:56.653
It was money that should have gone into the Russian state, but instead, all of the profits flowed

00:11:56.653 --> 00:11:58.653
straight into the oligarchs' pockets.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:05.310
Key to the oligarchs' success, in case you hadn't already guessed, was relationships with

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.750
government.

00:12:06.596 --> 00:12:11.946
Although the Russian state was weak, none of these favourable deals would have been possible without

00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:14.766
close relationships with government officials.

00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:19.004
So knowing who to speak to and when was absolutely everything.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.924
Then in the year 2000 along came Vladimir Putin.

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:31.185
While Putin's reign has been excellent news for many of the oligarchs, several have found themselves

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:35.055
purged and unable to return to Russia, including Khodorkovsky.

00:12:35.937 --> 00:12:41.656
There are several theories which are uncorroborated of course, that deals were struck between Putin

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:46.896
and the oligarchs, whereby he promised that he wouldn't go after them in return for their support.

00:12:47.927 --> 00:12:55.127
There are also several theories that Putin asked for a lot more, and by a lot more, I mean a chunk

00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:55.697
of their wealth.

00:12:56.337 --> 00:12:58.897
However, that's a conversation for another day.

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:03.757
So where does this leave the oligarchs in 2019?

00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:11.535
A large proportion of all the wealth of Russia is still concentrated in the hands of very few, with

00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:18.225
35% of all the wealth in Russia owned by only 110 individuals.

00:13:19.311 --> 00:13:25.294
Some of these individuals are still the same as those that amassed vast wealth in the 1990s, in the

00:13:25.627 --> 00:13:28.137
wild west days of Soviet capitalism

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:39.004
Indeed, a research paper in 2018 suggested that there is more than three times as much money held by

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:43.304
Russians outside of Russia as there is held in Russia.

00:13:44.534 --> 00:13:50.144
Just to underline on that final point, and given that this wealth will largely be held by the

00:13:50.174 --> 00:13:56.735
oligarch population, there is more than three times the amount of money held by Russians outside

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:02.835
Russia, which isn't going back into the economy or helping regular Russians than there is in the

00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:04.475
entire Russian economy.

00:14:06.155 --> 00:14:13.715
in July of 2019 the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin said, we do not have oligarchs in Russia

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:14.315
anymore.

00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:18.245
I think I'll let you be the judge of that.

00:14:19.604 --> 00:14:23.934

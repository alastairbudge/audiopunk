Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:10.565
English.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:16.325
The show where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the world.

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:18.195
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:28.455
It's Tuesday, March the 31st, which makes tomorrow the 1st of April, April Fool's day, the day where

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:36.195
people, newspapers, and companies try to play tricks on the general public.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:40.985
So that is the subject of today's podcast - April Fool's day.

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:49.130
We'll talk a bit about where it came from, then we'll talk about some of the best and funniest April

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.900
Fool's stories out there.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.130
We'll also talk about a time when an April Fool's joke went badly wrong.

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:05.712
Before we get right into it though, let me just take a minute to remind those of you listening to

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:14.177
the podcast on Spotify, Google Podcasts iVoox, or wherever you get your podcasts that you can find a

00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:21.887
copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for every single podcast over on our website, which is

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:23.367
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:30.707
If you haven't already checked them out, the transcript is super helpful for following every single

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:31.817
word of the podcast.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:38.882
And the key vocabulary explains the harder words and phrases, so you will understand every single

00:01:38.882 --> 00:01:46.412
word, you won't miss a thing, and you will build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:47.132
the podcast.

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:53.432
If you're interested in checking this out, and I'd certainly recommend you do, then you should head

00:01:53.462 --> 00:02:00.422
to leonardoenglish.com/subscribe and join curious minds from all over the world.

00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:02.877
Okay.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.227
Let's talk about April Fool's.

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:16.424
Firstly, the exact origins of this particular festival aren't actually fully known, but there are a

00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:19.214
few theories about where it came from.

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:29.144
The tradition of playing practical jokes on people, and generally causing trouble can be traced back

00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:38.227
all the way to the Roman era, and historians believe it's related to celebrating the coming of

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:38.624
spring.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.211
I guess it was a sort of fun way to celebrate the arrival of a new season.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:55.615
And we have records of people tricking others on April the first that date back over 300 years now.

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:07.722
There's a record of something called "Fooles Holy day" on April the first 1698 and on this day, on

00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:16.267
the 1st of April, 1698, people were invited to go and see something called 'the washing of the

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:18.757
lions' at the Tower of London.

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:26.836
Of course, that sounded quite exciting, and when these people turned up at the Tower of London and

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:35.356
asked to see the lions being washed, the guards there gave out a mighty laugh, and that was the

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:40.636
first record of an April Fool's prank, of an April Fool's joke.

00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:45.545
You might think "lions at the Tower of London?

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:47.375
Who would believe that?"

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:50.525
But actually that wasn't the joke.

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:53.375
There were some lions at the Tower of London.

00:03:54.254 --> 00:03:59.229
The joke was that there would be some kind of public washing of the lions.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:04.119
Obviously lions wouldn't be particularly keen on being washed.

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.484
The joke proved so popular that it was played almost every year.

00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:21.324
Of course, this was before any kind of mass media, even before mass readership of newspapers, before

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:28.554
mass circulation of newspapers, so they could safely play the same old joke year after year.

00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:39.044
Nowadays, some form of April Fool's is celebrated in lots of different countries in slightly

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:39.914
different ways.

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:49.034
In France, for example, they have 'Poisson d'Avril', the April fish, where you try to stick a paper

00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:51.974
fish onto the back of someone else.

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:02.019
You might say that I'm biased on this one, being British, but no country really engages with the

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:05.919
idea of April Fool's as much as the UK does.

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:16.584
In the past 50 years in the UK it has become a tradition that has been embraced by almost all of the

00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:23.394
major newspapers, TV channels, radio stations, and now brands, companies.

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:32.304
Traditionally, they will publish a news story, or a story, an announcement, that is completely fake

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.974
and unbelievable and often quite funny.

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:40.372
This will be hidden within the newspaper or TV programme.

00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:50.732
And it's always quite a fun game on April the first to go through various newspapers and try to spot

00:05:50.972 --> 00:05:54.512
the fake ones, to try and find the ones that are the jokes.

00:05:55.764 --> 00:06:02.274
What I want to do now though, is talk about three of the best, three of my favourite, April Fool's

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:07.914
jokes, and then we'll end, as I said, with the story of an April Fool's joke that goes wrong.

00:06:09.944 --> 00:06:18.764
So to start with, one of the first mass broadcast April Fool's jokes was by the BBC, and this was in

00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:20.264
1957.

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.179
Now, let me just start with a little bit of background for you.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:33.489
The BBC has a show called Panorama, which is a serious news reporting show.

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:41.979
It normally does research and investigations into important issues, so it's definitely not a joke

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:42.339
show.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.259
It's definitely not a comedy show.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:54.869
Anyway, in 1957 Panorama did a show about how spaghetti was made in Switzerland.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:05.439
The show talks about spaghetti farming in Switzerland and shows how spaghetti is farmed by being cut

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.479
from trees like apples.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:17.614
You can see a video of happy farmers picking the spaghetti from the trees, and then laying it out to

00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:20.704
dry in the warm Alpine sun.

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:31.444
The Panorama show also talks about how this year, in 1957, it has been a very good year for

00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:39.184
spaghetti because a tiny little creature that used to eat the spaghetti while it was on the trees

00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:48.844
has disappeared, and this has led to a bumper harvest, a really successful time, for the Swiss

00:07:49.174 --> 00:07:50.254
spaghetti farmers.

00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:57.964
Now you will, I guess, recognise that this is completely made up.

00:07:58.024 --> 00:07:58.744
It's a joke.

00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:05.794
Spaghetti does not grow on trees and it is certainly not harvested high up in the hills in

00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:06.364
Switzerland.

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:13.029
You might think, "surely British people would never have believed that".

00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:21.705
Well, it turns out that quite a few people did believe it, and they wrote into the BBC to ask where

00:08:21.705 --> 00:08:24.675
they could buy their own spaghetti bush.

00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:35.850
Spaghetti, you see, was still quite an exotic dish in the UK in 1957 and a lot of people wouldn't

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.100
really have known anything about it.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:46.858
This might be hard for you to believe, especially for the Italians among you, but it is true.

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:57.478
Our second story, which was actually published in a bit of a ridiculous newspaper called The Daily

00:08:57.478 --> 00:09:05.563
Star, but I wanted to share with you because it features two things that are pretty common in

00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:06.913
British pop culture.

00:09:07.723 --> 00:09:14.053
Firstly, the NHS, the National Health Service, and secondly beer.

00:09:16.093 --> 00:09:25.896
Last year, 2019, The Daily Star published an article that stated that people in Britain will be able

00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:34.806
to be given beer by the NHS if they can convince their doctor that they are suffering from

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:35.736
tiredness.

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:42.081
That if you go to the doctor and say that you're feeling tired the doctor can write you a

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:47.841
prescription for beer and you can get that free from the national health service.

00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:57.201
The article said that the beer would be given to patients through an intravenous drip, so through a

00:09:57.231 --> 00:10:01.791
tube directly into their arm, not in a pint glass.

00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:10.230
I have no doubt that this idea was pretty popular with some of the readers of the newspaper, but I

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.370
should of course add it was completely untrue, completely fake.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.070
Our third example is a particularly clever one.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:28.920
The one from The Daily Star about the beer and the NHS was pretty stupid, but this one is quite the

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.340
opposite.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.410
It's quite a highbrow joke, whereas The Daily Star was definitely what we would call lowbrow.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:44.998
So our third example comes from the BBC again, but this time it is from BBC radio.

00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:49.646
This April Fool's joke is from 1976.

00:10:50.498 --> 00:10:58.853
On Radio Two, a famous British astronomer, an expert in the stars and the planets, called Patrick

00:10:58.853 --> 00:11:03.098
Moore had an important message for his listeners.

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:14.108
Moore told his listeners that the planet Pluto was going to pass the planet Jupiter, and this unique

00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:19.238
event would have a strange impact on gravity on Earth.

00:11:20.802 --> 00:11:31.512
He said that at precisely 9:47 in the morning, 9:47 AM, people on Earth would feel just a little bit

00:11:31.512 --> 00:11:32.142
lighter.

00:11:33.012 --> 00:11:40.477
And he suggested to people that if they jumped in the air they would feel a strange floating

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:45.187
sensation as if they were flying, as if they were in space.

00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:55.837
Of course, this was a joke, another April Fool's, however many people phoned in to the BBC to say

00:11:55.837 --> 00:11:59.107
that the experiment had indeed worked.

00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:04.777
They had jumped and felt this strange floating sensation.

00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:16.007
One woman even called in to say that she and her 11 friends had been lifted from their chairs and

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:18.767
floated around the room in the air.

00:12:20.757 --> 00:12:23.825
The mind really can play strange tricks on you.

00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:33.675
Now, April Fool's jokes aren't always met with fun and laughter, and sometimes they go wrong.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:45.120
Google is famous for playing jokes on its users and the problem comes when people don't realise that

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.230
they are a joke.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:57.486
In 2016 Google announced that within Gmail, the email provider, there would be a button called

00:12:58.146 --> 00:13:06.996
'microphone drop send', 'Mic drop send', which would allow you to send your email, but it would also

00:13:06.996 --> 00:13:14.616
insert a GIF, a funny moving image, of a minion from the Despicable Me series.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:19.755
I guess if you've seen the Despicable Me series you'll know what I mean.

00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:28.665
Basically, it was a functionality that would send an email and attach a funny GIF in there when you

00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:29.505
pressed send.

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:37.682
And they didn't just write an announcement about it, they actually inserted this functionality

00:13:37.892 --> 00:13:38.942
within Gmail.

00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:47.836
Some people didn't realise that this was a different button and responded with this button in

00:13:47.836 --> 00:13:55.936
serious emails, emails to their bosses, colleagues, important partners and clients about serious

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:56.506
topics.

00:13:58.486 --> 00:14:05.356
Obviously they weren't happy when they realised that Gmail had inserted a funny GIF in their email,

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:12.556
and there were several people who took to Twitter and other social networks to say that they had

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:16.996
lost their jobs, they'd lost important clients, and worse.

00:14:17.864 --> 00:14:25.484
One person shared an email that had accidentally been sent using this GIF about funeral

00:14:25.484 --> 00:14:26.384
arrangements.

00:14:27.224 --> 00:14:32.054
Obviously that's not the kind of email that you want to be putting funny GIFs in.

00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:41.417
So, April Fool's jokes don't always go right, and people and companies nowadays need to be pretty

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:41.957
careful.

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:51.748
This is even more the case in the era of so-called "fake news" where politicians claim that news is

00:14:51.748 --> 00:14:58.258
fake, completely made up, especially if it doesn't reflect positively on their own performance.

00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:07.658
All over the world, journalists are accused of writing fake news and so on the day when it is

00:15:07.988 --> 00:15:15.173
actually acceptable and funny to write fake news, newspapers have to be pretty careful.

00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:24.893
Indeed the past few years have seen newspapers be extra careful in this respect, making sure that

00:15:25.013 --> 00:15:32.813
the story is so unbelievable and sometimes even adding a little note in the article to confirm that

00:15:32.813 --> 00:15:33.533
it's a joke.

00:15:34.463 --> 00:15:39.308
Which is a bit of a shame really, as it spoils a lot of the fun.

00:15:40.658 --> 00:15:48.818
But in the era when stories like Donald Trump tries to buy Greenland or the story about the UK

00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:55.208
declaring that it will now have a blue passport made by a company in France as one of the first

00:15:55.208 --> 00:16:01.688
moves after Brexit - both those stories are true, by the way - in an era when these kinds of stories

00:16:01.688 --> 00:16:10.778
are actually not April Fool's it's become increasingly difficult to tell fact from fiction.

00:16:12.728 --> 00:16:19.718
So if you are listening to this podcast on the day when it's released, the 31st of March, tomorrow

00:16:19.718 --> 00:16:28.118
it will be April Fool's day, and there will no doubt be a competition by newspapers, TV shows, and

00:16:28.298 --> 00:16:32.108
companies to pull off the best April Fool's trick.

00:16:33.398 --> 00:16:40.478
So keep an eye out for it and let's hope that someone manages to pull off a joke that's quite as

00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:44.618
good as the documentary about spaghetti growing on trees.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:51.468
Okay then, that is it for today's episode.

00:16:52.218 --> 00:16:58.253
I hope that you are keeping safe wherever you are, and that you may even be using some of this time

00:16:58.253 --> 00:17:02.393
at home if you are spending time at home to improve your English.

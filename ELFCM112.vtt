Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.750
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.540
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.270
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Personality Tests,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.990
the idea that our personality and character can be neatly categorised to help

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.510
other people understand us better, and to help us better understand ourselves.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.690
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can follow

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.270
along to this episode with the subtitles, the transcript and its key vocabulary,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
so you don’t miss any of the harder words and phrases, and you can build up

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.870
your vocabulary as you go, over on our website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.010
The website is also home to all of our bonus episodes, plus

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.630
guides on how to improve your English in a more interesting way.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.670
So if you haven’t checked that out yet then I’d definitely recommend doing so.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.790
The place to go to for that is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.050
OK then, let’s talk about personality tests.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.580
The idea of personality, of each human being different, is of course nothing new.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.860
We are all different, we have different hopes, dreams, strengths and weaknesses,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.120
different things we like doing and different things we don’t like doing.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.620
Throughout history there have been various ways of categorising

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.610
these differences, of trying to understand how we are different.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.450
But this really came to its apex, to its highest point, in

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.070
the 20th century with the mass adoption of personality tests.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.640
If you have ever worked in an office environment, or applied for an

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.750
office job, you will probably have taken one of these kinds of tests.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.260
You answer a series of questions, and then you are presented with your

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.670
personality type, a clean, neat summary of your character, of your personality.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.910
We are going to go into detail about how these became so popular, but it’s first useful

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.570
to understand a bit more about some historical ideas of ‘character’ and of ‘personality’.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:52.070
Going all the way back to the Hippocratic tradition, in the 5th century BC, over 2,500 years ago,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.790
Hippocrates proposed the idea that people’s characters fell into 4 different categories, or humours.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.660
Sanguine, choleric, melancholic, or phlegmatic.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.330
The idea here was that these four bodily liquids control your character, and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.330
having more or less of one of them can have an effect on your personality.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.790
Hippocrates proposed that you could correct these imbalances through medicine.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.310
This idea persisted in different forms right through until the 18th century.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.350
The belief, in Western medicine at least, was that your physical condition had an

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.270
effect on your character, on your personality, and that people’s personalities could

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.490
be explained and understood through a better understanding of their physical condition.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.360
You might have heard this being referred to as the idea of the Humours.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.020
As this idea started to become less popular, new ideas about personality and

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.190
about how our minds work emerged from people like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.910
They tried to apply scientific thinking to psychology, with Freud creating the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.000
modern idea of psychoanalysis, and Jung developing his idea of Analytical Psychology.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.700
Jung in particular did a lot of work on personality, researching how

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.870
to put humans into different buckets of personality, extroverts vs.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.400
introverts, openness vs.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.910
closeness and so on.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.070
In 1921 Jung published a book called Psychological Types which

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.760
proposed ideas on how to categorise people’s personalities.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.500
This wasn’t an empirical study, it wasn’t real science, but rather

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.600
just based on differences in people that he had observed in his work.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.660
This book caught the attention of a mother and daughter from

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.090
Michigan, Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs-Myers.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.090
Neither were professional psychologists, or had any kind of psychological training,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.830
but they were keen students of Jung, and devoured his book on Psychological Types.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.440
They adapted this to form their own system of categorising people,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.030
eventually creating their own personality test based on 93 questions

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.370
that puts people into one of 16 different categories of personality.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.870
If the names of these women rang a bell, that’s because they gave birth to the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.130
most popular personality test in history, the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.840
It wasn’t an immediate success though, it wasn’t an immediate hit.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.500
It took almost 80 years to become mainstream, with the mother, Katharine,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.810
starting to take an interest in psychology when the daughter was only 4 years old.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.730
This mother and daughter pair observed what we all see every day.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.150
That people are different.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.170
Within a family setting, these differences are exacerbated, they are made greater.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.310
Not only do you normally know your family members better than anyone, because you

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.920
are with them all the time, but you live with them, so you need to be more aware

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.570
of their differences in order to get along, in order to survive living together.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.020
This mother and daughter pair wanted a way to explain and categorise

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.210
these differences, to help people understand how they were different.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.410
There’s no evidence that they were interested in making a quick buck, making

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.810
quick money, and indeed neither of them lived long enough to see their

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.740
invention turn into the multi-million dollar enterprise that it has now become.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:29.860
They were just genuinely interested in how personality works, and were avid fans of Carl Jung.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.500
They honed their test at their kitchen table, practising on family members and friends.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.930
If you have ever taken a Myers-Briggs Personality

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.860
Indicator you will be familiar with some of the questions.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.020
There are 93 questions, you choose either A or B.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.920
The test will indicate what your personality is, based on four different categories.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.110
Firstly, Extraversion or Introversion, so are you an

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.580
outgoing type of person or do you prefer to be on your own?

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.600
Secondly, are you a Sensing or an Intuitive type of person.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:21.940
Do you prefer to look at the basic information you see, or do you want to wait for more information?

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.890
Thirdly, are you a Thinking or Feeling type of person?

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.780
Are you logical or are you sensitive?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.790
And finally, are you a Judging or a Perceiving type of person.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.290
Do you prefer just to decide things, or would you prefer to stay open minded?

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:49.030
You answer these 93 questions and ta-da, you get a four letter

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.510
code at the end of it that tells you what personality type you are.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:01.830
Everyone in the world, everyone who takes this test,  fits into one of these 16 categories.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.950
Each of these 16 personality types is different, but they are all positive in their different ways.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:17.490
So the idea is that it isn’t a test, as such, but rather an indicator.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.910
You should see your results and think, ok, great, that’s me.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.090
Myers and Briggs, the mother and daughter pair, continued

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.290
working on their system, eventually publishing it in 1962.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.740
It wasn’t until 1968 that it caught the eye of a professor

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.510
of psychology at the University of Florida, Mary McCaulley.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.430
She saw its potential and really started to push it forward, and

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:55.090
businesses started to use it to try to understand their employees.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:03.540
The post-war period was when people started to research management techniques, and

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:09.850
Human Resources, the managing of your workforce became a standalone discipline.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.050
An increasing number of people were starting to work in offices, and having to do work that required

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:25.650
interacting with other people, work where your ability to get on with others was actually important.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.890
In agricultural or industrial societies, this didn’t really matter so much.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.270
You cut the corn or you worked in a factory, it didn’t really matter whether

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.430
you preferred to learn on your own or be taught by someone else, you could do

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.720
your job perfectly well without anyone knowing anything about the real you.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.090
In an office situation where employees had to work with each

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.290
other, understanding other types of people was important.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.150
As anyone who has ever worked in an office will know, in most cases

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.550
the hardest part of your job is normally getting on with other people.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.610
The Myers-Briggs personality indicator provided an

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.170
excellent way for companies to ‘understand’ their employees.

00:11:19.307 --> 00:11:24.054
If employees just did this test then managers would

00:11:24.064 --> 00:11:27.584
be able to understand them by looking at their result.

00:11:28.514 --> 00:11:34.474
They would know that a particular type of personality would be good at certain tasks,

00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:41.004
other types of personalities might be put forward for management positions, and so on.

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:49.264
It was very neat, it soon became adopted by corporate America, and it has continued

00:11:49.494 --> 00:11:54.544
to this day to be a favourite of Human Resource departments all over the world.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:12:02.704
The company that bought the rights to the test makes about $20 million a year from these tests,

00:12:03.004 --> 00:12:11.284
from these simple 93 questions, and the personality test industry is a $2 billion industry.

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:17.194
So, the question you might be asking yourselves is, does it actually

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:22.144
work, is it actually effective at telling us what our personalities are?

00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:28.044
Although there are thousands of companies that still use it, there really isn’t

00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:33.514
much evidence to suggest that it is nearly as effective as it claims to be.

00:12:34.544 --> 00:12:38.964
Firstly, our character, our personality is complicated.

00:12:40.124 --> 00:12:44.174
If you’ve ever done one of these personality tests you will probably

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:49.674
remember that the answers to the questions aren’t always obvious to you, you

00:12:49.674 --> 00:12:53.994
probably need to spend a while thinking about what your answer should be.

00:12:55.154 --> 00:12:59.164
With a question that is trying to figure out whether someone is an extrovert

00:12:59.164 --> 00:13:05.114
or an introvert, the reality is that most people are somewhere in between.

00:13:06.134 --> 00:13:12.094
Not every extrovert wants to always be the centre of attention at a party all night

00:13:12.094 --> 00:13:18.124
long, and not every introvert wants to be at home every night under their duvet cover.

00:13:19.254 --> 00:13:24.084
Trying to place everyone in one of two categories for every question

00:13:24.354 --> 00:13:29.674
is a gross over-simplification of how complicated we all actually are.

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:37.154
Plus, the fact that we find it so hard to actually choose the answer to many of the questions

00:13:37.424 --> 00:13:43.274
means that people often get different results when they do the same test multiple times.

00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:49.824
How we answer might depend on how we’re feeling that day, and indeed there

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:53.694
have been studies that have shown that the number of people who got the

00:13:53.694 --> 00:14:00.684
same result when they did the test again varied between 24 and 61 percent.

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:02.214
Not great, right?

00:14:03.374 --> 00:14:08.364
The other main criticism of this kind of test is that it’s completely

00:14:08.444 --> 00:14:13.984
self-reported, you say what you believe, there are no right or wrong answers.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:21.014
Companies often use these tests for things like recruiting, for hiring new staff,

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:27.724
and for understanding which employees might be suitable for new roles or promotions.

00:14:28.314 --> 00:14:33.764
If I know that my company is looking for management-type people, I can just

00:14:33.764 --> 00:14:38.974
answer the questions in a way that it’s likely I’ll be given a personality

00:14:38.974 --> 00:14:43.644
type that is more likely to suggest I’m suitable for a management role.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:47.554
So it’s very, very easy to fake.

00:14:48.964 --> 00:14:56.104
Furthermore, these tests are also very self-reinforcing, they make people believe that certain

00:14:56.114 --> 00:15:03.074
things are just ‘parts of their personality’, so they are less likely to adapt their behaviour.

00:15:04.454 --> 00:15:10.924
If you see that you are the type of person that enjoys confrontation, or the type of person that

00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:17.964
struggles to manage their time, then you will just think ‘well, it’s my personality type’, instead

00:15:17.994 --> 00:15:24.314
of trying to do something to make yourself less confrontational or get better at managing your time.

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:31.084
The reality is that the more we believe that we can’t change these parts of our

00:15:31.084 --> 00:15:36.314
personality, the less likely we are to actually do anything to try to change them.

00:15:37.524 --> 00:15:43.074
So, if that is all true, why do companies still use them, why do 2 million

00:15:43.074 --> 00:15:48.364
people take them every year, and why is the Internet full of articles

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:52.294
like ‘How your Myers-Briggs personality type can affect your salary’?

00:15:53.274 --> 00:15:59.894
There is an interesting phenomenon in psychology called the Forer effect, or the Barnum effect.

00:16:01.084 --> 00:16:05.764
In short, this is a phenomenon in which people say that they believe

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:10.774
something if they think it has been tailored just for them, even if

00:16:10.964 --> 00:16:15.494
it is completely generic and it could be applied to almost anyone.

00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:22.424
This is one of the theories about why things like the messages in fortune cookies, the

00:16:22.624 --> 00:16:29.394
fortunes told by fortune tellers, and the messages in astrology are so widely accepted,

00:16:29.784 --> 00:16:35.544
because, although completely generic, people believe that they are specific to them.

00:16:36.804 --> 00:16:38.854
If I tell you that I think:

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:43.064
You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.

00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:45.924
You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:51.824
You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.

00:16:52.294 --> 00:16:58.034
And while you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.

00:16:59.244 --> 00:17:02.784
If you hear these statements, do you think I’ve done a

00:17:02.784 --> 00:17:06.404
pretty good job at summarising parts of your character?

00:17:07.524 --> 00:17:13.504
I haven’t, I’ve just read out a series of relatively generic statements, but if

00:17:13.504 --> 00:17:18.814
you think that these apply to you, then that is the Forer effect in practice.

00:17:20.034 --> 00:17:26.374
With the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator this is exacerbated because there

00:17:26.374 --> 00:17:32.694
is the whole huge industry of personality tests, plus because most people are

00:17:32.894 --> 00:17:38.044
taking it in a corporate setting, they think it must work, it must be accurate.

00:17:39.234 --> 00:17:45.264
Much more so than reading your star sign or reading a fortune cookie, which you might think

00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:51.774
could be true, but isn’t provided by a nice man or woman in a suit who has come to your office.

00:17:53.104 --> 00:17:59.774
Indeed, these kinds of personality tests, or personality assessments, have been disregarded

00:17:59.814 --> 00:18:05.814
by the vast majority of professional psychologists, who tend to agree that they are

00:18:05.814 --> 00:18:12.774
very problematic, and a gross simplification of the complexity of our characters.

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:20.954
And it’s not just that they are imperfect, using these kinds of tests can actually be harmful

00:18:21.024 --> 00:18:27.314
because they are considered correct, and therefore people are put into boxes, and treated

00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:33.174
in a different way, just because of 4 letters that were spat out by a personality test.

00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:40.674
Now, this is in no way to try to belittle the work of Katherine Briggs and Isabel

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:45.594
Briggs-Myers, the mother and daughter pair who created this personality test.

00:18:46.424 --> 00:18:51.524
From their kitchen table, without any real academic experience of psychology,

00:18:51.894 --> 00:18:57.804
and in an era when women weren’t really allowed to be independent thinkers,

00:18:58.084 --> 00:19:03.464
they managed to come up with a system that has been used by hundreds of millions

00:19:03.464 --> 00:19:08.134
of people, by some of the world’s biggest companies, all over the world.

00:19:08.974 --> 00:19:12.284
It’s certainly an impressive achievement, but the

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:15.714
reality is that it just doesn’t work particularly well.

00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:21.864
Maybe you’re left thinking, well, are there any personality tests that do work?

00:19:23.074 --> 00:19:26.584
The Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator isn’t the only test,

00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:29.784
and there are hundreds of others that have cropped up.

00:19:31.064 --> 00:19:34.524
None have got anywhere near the Myers-Briggs one though.

00:19:35.594 --> 00:19:41.204
The reality is that our personalities are very complex, there aren’t only 16

00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:46.184
types of people, and that we probably aren’t very good at describing our own

00:19:46.234 --> 00:19:50.354
personalities, our strengths and weaknesses, what we like and we don’t like.

00:19:51.304 --> 00:19:56.194
So where this leaves the personality test industry is anyone’s guess.

00:19:56.454 --> 00:20:02.014
But it certainly doesn’t seem like Myers-Briggs is going anywhere anytime soon.

00:20:04.044 --> 00:20:09.134
OK, on that note that is it for today’s episode on Personality Tests.

00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:13.874
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and at least if someone asks you to do a

00:20:13.874 --> 00:20:17.914
personality test then you’ll know a little bit more about where they come from.

00:20:19.194 --> 00:20:22.784

Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.180
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.239
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.130
The show where you can listen to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.580
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.759
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.799
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.100
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.309
going to be talking about a word.

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.460
I think this is the first time we’ve

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.610
ever actually done this, focussed only

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.129
on a single word, but there are few

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.829
words in modern English that arouse

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.540
such passion and create such division,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180
few words that have been weaponised

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.120
in such a short period of time.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.200
And that word is “woke”.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.470
To those who embrace the word, it means

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.260
being aware of social injustice, aware

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770
of discrimination, understanding that the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.689
world is structured in an unfair way, and

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.820
being prepared to do something about it.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.770
But to its detractors, its critics,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.830
it’s an insult, it’s used to describe

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.910
someone who is virtue signalling,

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.029
claiming to be morally better than

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.409
other people, and is not prepared to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.210
listen to any other point of view.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.779
So, in this episode we are going to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.810
explore the evolution of this word, a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.039
word that is more than a word, actually,

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:27.240
it’s a state of mind, a shorthand for a

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.619
whole set of values and attitudes, which

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.979
are either espoused vigorously by the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.849
believer or despised by its adversaries.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.429
Ok then, let’s get right into it

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.189
and look at the evolution of woke.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.789
Now, if we are going to spend an

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.359
entire episode talking about a word,

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:49.640
we should first define what that

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.703
word means, and the first place

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.579
we should look is the dictionary.

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:57.550
If you were to consult a dictionary

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.979
20 years ago, you would probably

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.109
only have found one definition.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.910
It would say something like “the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.770
past tense of wake”, and might

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.929
give

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.000
you examples like “I woke up this

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.480
morning”, or even “I woke this morning”.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.200
And of course, you can still use the word

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.760
like that, it’s the past tense of “wake”,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.420
absolutely nothing has changed since then.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.615
But you would see another definition

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.995
today, a definition that in many

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.845
dictionaries actually now comes above

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:32.505
the original definition, meaning it’s

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:34.645
the more common usage of the word.

00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:38.545
And in fact, this definition is

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.795
often split into two separate

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.305
definitions, which reflects how

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.095
polarising the word has become.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:48.035
So, let me give you the definition

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.095
from the Merriam Webster dictionary.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:53.585
The first definition is, and I’m

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:56.375
quoting directly, “aware of and

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:58.705
actively attentive to important

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:01.445
societal facts and issues [especially

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:04.205
issues of racial and social justice]”

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:09.115
And the second definition is, and again

00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:11.975
this is a direct quote, “politically

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.132
liberal [ as in matters of racial and

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:17.332
social justice] especially in a way that

00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:20.172
is considered unreasonable or extreme”.

00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:24.362
And only after this, coming

00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:26.442
in at the third definition, do

00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:28.562
you find the original literal

00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:30.412
definition of what this word means.

00:03:31.522 --> 00:03:34.362
Now, this third definition, the original

00:03:34.392 --> 00:03:37.052
literal definition, is easy to understand

00:03:37.062 --> 00:03:39.542
and less controversial, I mean, it

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.572
simply refers to not being asleep.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.112
So we will focus our attention today

00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:48.042
on the first two, the definitions

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.892
of “woke” that are more to do with

00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:52.562
ideology and what you believe rather

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:54.172
than simply your physical state.

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:58.182
Now, in terms of where this word,

00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:01.172
“woke”, came from in this context,

00:04:01.402 --> 00:04:03.502
it was originally slang, or

00:04:03.672 --> 00:04:06.382
vernacular, used by African Americans

00:04:06.572 --> 00:04:08.942
going as far back as the 1940s.

00:04:10.472 --> 00:04:12.982
On one level, it was used as an

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:15.512
alternative to woken or awake,

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.012
so “I’m woke, I’m coming”,

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:20.152
like “I’m awake, I’m coming”.

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:23.772
But it also had another meaning,

00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:26.772
meaning if you were “woke” you were

00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:29.572
aware of the societal injustice faced

00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:31.182
by the African-American community.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.492
Its first use in print is thought to come

00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:38.982
from all the way back in 1962, in a New

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:41.492
York Times article by an African-American

00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:43.822
author called William Melvin Kelley.

00:04:45.172 --> 00:04:47.572
The article’s title was “If You’re

00:04:47.572 --> 00:04:50.232
Woke You Dig It”, and it talked

00:04:50.232 --> 00:04:52.452
about dialect and language in

00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:54.992
1960s America, in particular the

00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:56.972
language used by African-Americans.

00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:00.902
Importantly, this essay wasn’t about

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:03.872
social injustice, police violence, or

00:05:04.162 --> 00:05:06.732
any kind of ideological point of view.

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:10.272
He was simply explaining how language is

00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:14.152
used, and how slang terms, or idiomatic

00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:17.232
language would be discarded, not used

00:05:17.242 --> 00:05:19.682
any more when they become mainstream.

00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:23.122
We’ll come back to this idea in a

00:05:23.132 --> 00:05:25.522
few minutes, and it will be important

00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:27.312
when we look at the development of

00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:29.402
being “woke” in the 21st century.

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.412
Anyway, back to the 1960s.

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:35.062
The term continued to be used as

00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:37.802
African-American Vernacular, as a slang.

00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:42.202
Its most famous next use case then

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:44.602
came a decade later, when a character

00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:47.622
in a 1971 play about the Jamaican

00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:49.432
political activist, Marcus Garvey,

00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:52.082
said ‘I been sleeping all my life.

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:53.702
And now that Mr.

00:05:53.702 --> 00:05:56.382
Garvey done woke me up, I’m gon stay woke.

00:05:56.882 --> 00:05:58.072
And I’m gon' help him

00:05:58.082 --> 00:05:59.402
wake up other black folk’.

00:06:00.802 --> 00:06:03.782
So, the term existed, and it was

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:06.492
used, but it wasn’t really until

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:08.912
the 21st century that “woke”

00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:10.552
was brought into the mainstream.

00:06:12.112 --> 00:06:14.502
One of the first people to publicise

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.072
this word was the singer Erykah Badu,

00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:19.712
who used the lyrics, ‘I stay woke’,

00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:22.342
in her 2008 song Master Teacher.

00:06:23.552 --> 00:06:26.922
And moving into the 2010s, the expression

00:06:26.932 --> 00:06:28.912
continued to grow in popularity and

00:06:29.092 --> 00:06:31.962
mainstream usage, and after the police

00:06:32.012 --> 00:06:34.562
shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old African

00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:36.962
American called Michael Brown, and the

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:38.832
formation of The Black Lives Matter

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:41.882
movement, it shot to public prominence.

00:06:43.512 --> 00:06:46.322
Black Lives Matter, or BLM, was

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.982
formed in 2013, and this group really

00:06:49.982 --> 00:06:52.842
embraced the term “woke”, and “stay

00:06:52.842 --> 00:06:55.152
woke”, and promoted the use of the

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:57.982
hashtag “#staywoke” on social media.

00:06:59.322 --> 00:07:01.102
And what did this mean?

00:07:01.642 --> 00:07:03.329
Well, it meant that you were aware

00:07:03.502 --> 00:07:05.479
of racial injustice, you were aware

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.942
of the fact that police violence

00:07:08.132 --> 00:07:10.472
falls disproportionately on African

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.792
Americans, that is, if you are an

00:07:12.802 --> 00:07:15.152
African American you are over twice as

00:07:15.162 --> 00:07:17.462
likely to be shot and killed by police

00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:19.152
than if you are a white American.

00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:23.212
And importantly, “staying woke”

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:24.882
meant that you were prepared

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:26.055
to do something about it.

00:07:26.972 --> 00:07:29.382
Protesting in the street, entering

00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:31.032
grassroots politics, you were

00:07:31.032 --> 00:07:32.642
prepared to do something about

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.422
the injustices in the system.

00:07:35.772 --> 00:07:37.632
You would see people with posters

00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:40.122
or t-shirts with the “Stay Woke”

00:07:40.162 --> 00:07:42.722
message written on them, and the term

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.432
entered the public consciousness,

00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:46.872
on both sides of the Atlantic, in

00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:48.992
the United States and in the UK.

00:07:50.302 --> 00:07:53.751
In 2017, in fact, this “new”

00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:55.941
definition was added to the Oxford

00:07:56.011 --> 00:07:58.001
English Dictionary, which is always

00:07:58.001 --> 00:07:59.711
slightly behind with these things,

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:02.161
but this gives you an idea of

00:08:02.161 --> 00:08:04.661
quite how mainstream it had become.

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:09.341
But as often happens, when a term that

00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:12.271
was previously used, created, owned

00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:14.911
even, by one particular group of people,

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:17.781
when this term goes into the mainstream,

00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:20.281
especially when it is a term about an

00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:23.101
ideological viewpoint, the definition

00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:26.151
was twisted and used to mean something

00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:29.431
completely different, it’s used against

00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.631
the original creators of the term.

00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.841
And if you remember our second definition

00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:37.731
of “woke”, from the start of the episode,

00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:40.611
of “politically liberal [as in matters

00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:43.421
of racial and social justice] especially

00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:45.904
in a way that is considered unreasonable

00:08:46.074 --> 00:08:49.664
or extreme”, woke has become an insult

00:08:49.784 --> 00:08:51.624
when used by certain types of people.

00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:55.474
If you were to watch Fox News, or

00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:57.534
read a right-wing newspaper, you

00:08:57.534 --> 00:08:59.814
would find all manner of references

00:08:59.814 --> 00:09:02.564
to wokeness in a negative light.

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.784
Here’s one from Fox News

00:09:05.924 --> 00:09:07.314
at the start of 2020.

00:09:07.984 --> 00:09:10.374
And by the way, remember that Fox

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:12.574
News is the most popular cable

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:14.414
news show in the United States.

00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:17.354
So, here’s Tucker Carlson, the most

00:09:17.384 --> 00:09:19.534
popular cable news host in American

00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:22.624
history, with an average of 3.3

00:09:22.824 --> 00:09:25.134
million viewers every single night:

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.670
wokeness is a virus.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.050
It's infectious.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.520
It destroys your brain.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.720
You're watching it happen

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.190
to people all around you.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.800
Certainly on the left, some running

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.660
for president, many working at CNN.

00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:42.134
So, to repeat, he says

00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:44.404
“wokeness is a virus.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.404
It’s infectious, it destroys your brain”.

00:09:48.664 --> 00:09:51.084
And here’s another clip from someone

00:09:51.084 --> 00:09:53.094
whose voice you probably will recognise:

00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:55.681
Because woke means you're, a loser.

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.361
Everybody ultimately loses with woke.

00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:01.424
And yes, that was the former

00:10:01.444 --> 00:10:03.524
President, Donald Trump, saying

00:10:03.534 --> 00:10:05.924
that “woke means you’re a loser”.

00:10:07.054 --> 00:10:11.374
So, how did one term, one idea, being

00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:13.924
“woke”, go from being aware of social

00:10:13.954 --> 00:10:17.064
issues to being an infectious virus that

00:10:17.064 --> 00:10:19.774
destroys your brain, making you a loser?

00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:23.324
Well, on one level, we must go

00:10:23.344 --> 00:10:24.854
back to the original New York

00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:27.994
Times article from 1962, the one

00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:30.414
titled “If You’re Woke You Dig It”.

00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:34.674
If you remember, Kelly, the author,

00:10:35.004 --> 00:10:37.434
wrote that as soon as a term becomes

00:10:37.444 --> 00:10:39.804
mainstream, it is no longer used by the

00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:41.964
group or people who originally used it,

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:44.394
it becomes polluted and untouchable.

00:10:45.804 --> 00:10:48.574
And this is, to a certain extent,

00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:51.124
what happened with the term “woke”.

00:10:52.254 --> 00:10:54.094
In the aftermath of the Black Lives

00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:56.924
Matter movement, as people and also

00:10:56.984 --> 00:10:59.424
companies became more publicly aware

00:10:59.434 --> 00:11:02.314
of social injustice, the term moved

00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:05.034
further into the mainstream, and took

00:11:05.044 --> 00:11:07.464
on an altogether different meaning.

00:11:08.684 --> 00:11:11.364
Companies started to publicly pledge

00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:13.834
their support for social movements and

00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:16.654
racial equality, with some even going as

00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:19.444
far as describing themselves as “woke”.

00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:23.034
Was this because the leaders of the

00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:25.354
companies truly believed in what they were

00:11:25.354 --> 00:11:27.894
saying, or was it because they needed to

00:11:27.894 --> 00:11:30.924
appeal to a new generation both of social

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:34.004
justice aware consumers and employees, and

00:11:34.304 --> 00:11:36.984
being woke was “just good for business”?

00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:39.834
I’ll leave you to be the judge

00:11:39.844 --> 00:11:42.574
of that, but many companies were

00:11:42.604 --> 00:11:44.504
criticised for what was perceived

00:11:44.514 --> 00:11:47.044
as piggybacking, jumping on the

00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:48.934
bandwagon, of a social movement.

00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:52.204
And as this happened, the

00:11:52.204 --> 00:11:54.414
term “woke” became even more

00:11:54.594 --> 00:11:57.854
politicised, weaponised, and binary.

00:11:58.694 --> 00:12:00.842
You were either woke, or you were

00:12:00.842 --> 00:12:02.884
not, there was no “middle ground”.

00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:07.854
To the critics of “woke” ideology, this

00:12:07.874 --> 00:12:10.844
was seen as virtue signalling, when

00:12:11.034 --> 00:12:13.544
someone shows off their beliefs so as

00:12:13.544 --> 00:12:15.724
to display their moral superiority,

00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:18.354
that they are a better human being

00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:20.204
because they believe something.

00:12:21.504 --> 00:12:25.864
And, given this new binary nature, of one

00:12:26.004 --> 00:12:29.484
either being woke or not being woke, to

00:12:29.534 --> 00:12:33.414
critics of “wokeism”, this word epitomised

00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:36.324
what they believed as liberal extremism.

00:12:37.364 --> 00:12:40.714
Wokeness meant a refusal to debate issues,

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.364
being overly sensitive, viewing everything

00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:45.704
that happens in the world through a lens

00:12:45.704 --> 00:12:48.694
of social injustice and looking down

00:12:48.914 --> 00:12:51.304
on anyone with a different ideology.

00:12:52.654 --> 00:12:55.464
And as a result, “woke” took on a

00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:57.674
completely different, pejorative,

00:12:57.844 --> 00:13:00.594
negative meaning, it became an insult.

00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:04.274
Right wing talk show hosts talked

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:07.164
about The Woke Mob, The Woke Police,

00:13:07.274 --> 00:13:10.224
Going Woke, The Woke Warrior Class,

00:13:10.264 --> 00:13:13.204
The Wokerati, and Woke Capitalism.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.454
As you heard Tucker Carlson and

00:13:16.644 --> 00:13:18.184
Donald Trump saying a few minutes

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:20.994
ago, it was presented as a virus

00:13:21.024 --> 00:13:23.254
that infected the mind, something

00:13:23.254 --> 00:13:25.134
that nothing good could come from.

00:13:26.694 --> 00:13:29.084
Now, clearly, the issue of social

00:13:29.114 --> 00:13:32.064
injustice, discrimination, and political

00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:35.104
polarisation are huge issues, far too

00:13:35.104 --> 00:13:37.884
large to do justice to in a short episode

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.584
like this, so instead I want to keep

00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:42.994
the focus on the evolution of the term,

00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:45.354
rather than go down the rabbit hole of

00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:47.434
the rights and wrongs of both sides.

00:13:48.664 --> 00:13:51.564
What is undeniable is that the term,

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:54.564
“woke”, is now used far more frequently

00:13:54.624 --> 00:13:57.564
in a critical sense, by critics of the

00:13:57.564 --> 00:14:00.164
ideology, rather than its proponents.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.254
This isn’t, of course, so unusual.

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.494
It's simply joining a long list of

00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:08.904
terms that had one meaning when used

00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:11.044
by one group of people, then was

00:14:11.054 --> 00:14:13.234
used by another group either as a

00:14:13.274 --> 00:14:15.504
positive or negative term by people

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:16.994
on the other side of the argument.

00:14:17.934 --> 00:14:20.664
Liberal, is one example, “politically

00:14:20.664 --> 00:14:22.884
correct” is another one, which

00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:25.074
have both gone from being simple

00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:28.624
descriptive terms to weaponised insults.

00:14:29.384 --> 00:14:32.314
Gay is another - it originally simply

00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:34.534
meant “happy”, then it was used

00:14:34.544 --> 00:14:37.054
to mean “homosexual”, and was also

00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:39.444
used by some groups as an insult

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.624
to mean “bad” or “undesirable”.

00:14:43.094 --> 00:14:46.284
And another, which is coming from a

00:14:46.284 --> 00:14:49.068
slightly different angle, is the "N-word",

00:14:49.324 --> 00:14:51.724
which was originally used as an ethnic

00:14:51.734 --> 00:14:54.974
slur, an insulting term for black people.

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:58.224
But, as you may know, it’s used

00:14:58.224 --> 00:15:00.254
by some African Americans as a

00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:02.994
colloquial term, it’s been embraced

00:15:03.124 --> 00:15:05.524
and has gone from an insult to a

00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:08.534
term of camaraderie, of endearment.

00:15:09.954 --> 00:15:13.264
So, this brings us to today, and to

00:15:13.264 --> 00:15:16.304
the status of the word “woke” in 2023.

00:15:17.314 --> 00:15:18.994
Will you still see people using it?

00:15:19.664 --> 00:15:22.764
Yes, probably, but more commonly as an

00:15:22.864 --> 00:15:25.754
insult rather than in its original sense.

00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:29.704
To the original proponents of the word

00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:33.004
“woke”, this is pretty depressing news.

00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:36.234
In an interview with the woman who wrote

00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:38.599
the “I stay woke” lyrics of the Erykah

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:42.044
Badu song, the journalist wrote “Like

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:44.534
anything created by black people, the

00:15:44.534 --> 00:15:47.484
phrase “stay woke” was appropriated by

00:15:47.484 --> 00:15:50.157
the masses, transformed into a trend

00:15:50.187 --> 00:15:53.337
term before ultimately mutating into

00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:55.897
a meme and becoming a form of irony.”

00:15:57.077 --> 00:15:59.697
Essentially, it was taken, stolen

00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:02.317
and used as an insult, meaning it

00:16:02.317 --> 00:16:04.457
can’t be used in its original sense.

00:16:06.017 --> 00:16:08.187
And the result of all of this, to

00:16:08.377 --> 00:16:10.487
quote the same article is that,

00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.917
“being woke isn’t fucking fun.”

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.757
There are many different conclusions

00:16:16.983 --> 00:16:19.057
we might draw from this, from how the

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:22.277
meaning of the word “woke” has changed and

00:16:22.277 --> 00:16:24.507
evolved in such a short period of time.

00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:28.387
Firstly, I think it’s yet another

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.587
example of the power of a single

00:16:30.587 --> 00:16:33.127
word, of how a word can come to

00:16:33.137 --> 00:16:35.247
stand for much more than it means.

00:16:36.487 --> 00:16:38.977
Secondly, it might be to ask ourselves

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.857
whether one group should have ownership

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.887
over a particular word or phrase?

00:16:44.257 --> 00:16:46.137
And what happens if that

00:16:46.187 --> 00:16:49.027
ownership, that agency, is lost?

00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:53.133
Thirdly, it’s that the greater the

00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:55.213
number of people who say that they

00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:57.603
identify with a particular word, the

00:16:57.603 --> 00:17:00.423
less powerful that word often becomes.

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:03.803
Its meaning becomes diluted, and

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:06.453
even if the message might have been

00:17:06.453 --> 00:17:08.873
powerful to begin with, it’s harder

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.893
to understand what it really means.

00:17:12.392 --> 00:17:14.972
And on a related note, finally,

00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:16.972
it’s that having more supporters

00:17:17.142 --> 00:17:19.412
doesn’t always yield better results.

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:23.272
In the case of woke, it’s clear that the

00:17:23.272 --> 00:17:25.982
more people and companies jumped on the

00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:29.014
bandwagon, or claimed to hold certain

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.434
socially progressive beliefs when their

00:17:31.464 --> 00:17:34.624
actions spoke otherwise, this opened up

00:17:34.814 --> 00:17:37.484
the entire woke movement for criticism

00:17:37.894 --> 00:17:40.414
and gave people like Tucker Carlson

00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:42.844
and Donald Trump the ammunition to

00:17:42.844 --> 00:17:45.896
criticise the entire movement, everyone

00:17:46.156 --> 00:17:47.996
who identified with the word “woke”.

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:52.695
This being said, the past 10 years or so

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:55.945
have “woken” many people to the social

00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:59.085
injustices, not just in America but in

00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:00.925
pretty much every country in the world.

00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:04.745
And looking to the future, while the

00:18:04.745 --> 00:18:06.785
word “woke” might be dead in the water,

00:18:07.225 --> 00:18:09.095
no matter how much Donald Trump might

00:18:09.095 --> 00:18:11.375
say it’s for losers, it’s clear that

00:18:11.395 --> 00:18:14.725
the ideas behind it are alive and well.

00:18:17.255 --> 00:18:19.715
OK then, that is it for today's

00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:21.965
episode on the history and

00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:23.925
evolution of the word “woke”.

00:18:24.325 --> 00:18:25.715
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:27.445
and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:30.525
As always, I would love to know

00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:31.945
what you thought of this episode.

00:18:32.275 --> 00:18:34.245
Were you aware of this term before

00:18:34.245 --> 00:18:37.415
today, and if so, what impact has

00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:39.588
woke  ideology had in your country?

00:18:40.108 --> 00:18:41.348
What do you think is next

00:18:41.358 --> 00:18:43.578
for “staying woke”, both the

00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:45.468
term and the idea behind it?

00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:47.948
I would love to know, so let’s

00:18:47.948 --> 00:18:49.378
get this discussion started.

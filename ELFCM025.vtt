Hello hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.294
English.

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:12.854
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.711
I'm actually recording this podcast on February the first.

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.951
Why am I telling you this at the start of the show?

00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:29.831
Well, because the UK technically left the European Union at midnight on January the 31st, yesterday,

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:37.406
and that might prove to be a very relevant thing for what we are going to be talking about today.

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:46.842
In today's podcast, we are going to talk about the difference between the UK, Great Britain, the

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:55.572
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Northern

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:57.762
Ireland, and the British Isles.

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:07.372
Now, you might be sort of aware of this already, but I guess for you this is probably a point of

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:16.812
confusion and me just listing out all of the countries just now probably hasn't made life any easier

00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:19.422
and you aren't any clearer on the difference.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:25.946
If I asked you now, what's the difference between the UK and Great Britain, would you be able to

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:26.396
tell me?

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:34.976
It's certainly something that lots of people in the UK are confused about, and if you were to stop

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:42.836
someone on the side of the street in London, Manchester, or Liverpool, I would imagine the majority

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:47.366
of people wouldn't be able to tell you exactly what the difference was.

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:53.901
So the difference between the UK and Great Britain is a bit of a tricky one.

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:58.311
I'll explain exactly why and what the difference is in the little bit.

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:05.576
An easier one is the difference between England and Great Britain, or Scotland and the UK.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:10.976
I imagine that you might know this already or maybe you don't.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.813
Believe it or not, it's not just native speakers who don't know there's difference.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:25.763
It's something that lots of Americans frequently get wrong using Britain and England

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:26.903
interchangeably.

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:34.270
Now, of course, I shouldn't generalise about Americans and obviously there are many, many who don't

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.070
fit this, but it is a little bit of a theme, a bit of a stereotype.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.910
So today let's clear things up and explain how there are four different countries and sometimes even

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.935
five different countries that people put together as one, so if you weren't 100% sure on the

00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:03.490
difference, by the end of this podcast, you'll know exactly what the difference is, how this

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:11.500
happened, and we'll take a minute just to think about how long this explanation may stay relevant

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.640
for in light of the UKs decision to leave the European Union.

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:25.425
So let's start by explaining exactly what the differences are and then I'll explain how we got to

00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:29.235
this admittedly pretty confusing situation.

00:03:30.452 --> 00:03:38.868
The UK and Great Britain are often used as synonyms, people use them interchangeably, assuming that

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:40.068
they mean the same thing.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.173
But this isn't actually correct.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.513
They are two different things.

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:53.641
A useful thing to do here is to pull up a map of Britain on your phone, or if you don't need to do

00:03:53.641 --> 00:04:00.481
that, just picture, just imagine the British Isles, the collection of islands to the North of France

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.516
that form England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:13.625
Of the two larger islands, Great Britain is actually just the big one on the right, and it's not

00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:17.585
technically a country, it's an island.

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:22.485
So Island with an I S not Ireland as in I.

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:22.792
R.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:23.407
E L.

00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:23.557
A.

00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:25.694
N.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:25.582
D.

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.242
Great Britain isn't actually a country.

00:04:29.272 --> 00:04:37.582
The country, the sovereign state is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which

00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:44.512
includes Northern Ireland, so that's the six counties to the north of the Republic of Ireland.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:52.492
So the country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and it is formed of four

00:04:52.492 --> 00:05:00.862
different countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which are all themselves

00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:01.762
countries.

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:03.382
Huh?

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:07.012
I wouldn't blame you for being a little bit confused.

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:14.122
You can't normally have a country within another country, so how does this work?

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:22.952
Well, the way to think of it is probably something similar to how different states work in the

00:05:22.952 --> 00:05:24.242
United States of America.

00:05:25.322 --> 00:05:27.792
There are some different laws that apply.

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:35.552
Scotland and Wales, for example, have their own parliament and have power over things like health

00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:42.892
and education, but they ultimately fall under control of the government of the United Kingdom of

00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:48.142
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is normally shortened to the UK.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.642
So how did this all come about?

00:05:53.302 --> 00:06:02.152
Well, the British Isles by which I'm referring here to Great Britain and Ireland, they've got a

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:05.512
pretty long and complicated history, as you may know.

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:16.089
To summarise, the creation of what we now know as the UK came to be after a series of key events.

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:28.704
Firstly, in the year 925 AD the Kingdom of England was formed after the unification, the union, of

00:06:28.884 --> 00:06:36.684
Anglo Saxon tribes, so that's the group of people who had lived in Britain since the fifth century.

00:06:37.974 --> 00:06:42.774
They united and formed England as its own kingdom.

00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:52.480
Then in 1536 after the Kingdom of England had been in existence for 600 years, more or less, England

00:06:52.510 --> 00:07:00.250
decided to expand its kingdom and King Henry the Eighth, you might remember him as the King who was

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:08.350
quite keen, who quite liked removing his wives heads from their bodies, he effectively made England

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.190
and Wales the same country, governed by the same laws.

00:07:12.712 --> 00:07:16.631
So that was one country, the Kingdom of England and Wales.

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:24.042
At least from the point of view of what we're talking about today there weren't any major changes

00:07:24.252 --> 00:07:33.222
until 1707 when the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed after the Kingdom of England and Wales

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:35.472
joined the Kingdom of Scotland.

00:07:37.277 --> 00:07:46.629
Then just under a hundred years later, in 1801, Ireland joined the union and the United Kingdom of

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:48.789
Great Britain and Ireland was formed.

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:56.009
So this made both of the big islands, so island, not Ireland, one united country.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:03.349
If you've really been paying attention though, you'll note that this is the United Kingdom of Great

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:09.829
Britain and Ireland, not the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is what we

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:10.429
have now.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.129
So what's the difference?

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:22.699
Well, the reason for this is that in 1922 the Republic of Ireland, what we now know as Ireland

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:25.189
withdrew from the union.

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:32.539
It gained independence leaving just the northern counties of Ireland in the United Kingdom of Great

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.389
Britain and Northern Ireland, which is what we have today.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:42.199
So just to recap, because I appreciate that's quite a lot of information and it could be a little

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:43.039
bit confusing.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:49.969
The sovereign state, the official country, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

00:08:49.969 --> 00:08:56.479
Ireland, which is comprised of four different countries, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern

00:08:56.479 --> 00:08:56.929
Ireland.

00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:04.858
The British Isles is the name given for all of the islands in the United Kingdom of Great Britain

00:09:04.918 --> 00:09:07.108
and Northern Ireland and Ireland.

00:09:08.458 --> 00:09:13.678
There are two big ones, so if you look at it map, it might seem like there's just two - Great

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:21.313
Britain, and Ireland, but the British Isles are actually comprised of 6,000 different little

00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:21.973
islands.

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:30.246
To make matters even more confusing, not all of the islands in the British Isles are part of Great

00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:30.576
Britain.

00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:36.351
They include three what's called crown dependencies.

00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:44.001
So that's the Isle of Man, the bailiwick of Guernsey and the bailiwick of Jersey, which are

00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:46.731
self-governing possessions of the crown.

00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:55.341
They are owned by the Queen, the Royal family, so they are sort of part of the UK, but technically

00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:55.671
not.

00:09:56.751 --> 00:10:02.721
Yes, I know it's pretty confusing, and in fact, we're not going to go into huge detail on these

00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:09.261
crown dependencies because it would take quite a long time and perhaps not be that interesting, so

00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:11.451
let's leave it there with the crown dependencies.

00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:12.361
Okay.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:20.041
So that is a quick explanation of how this slightly complicated situation came to be, and I would

00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:25.801
completely forgive you for not having known the difference before this podcast.

00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:30.751
As I said, the majority of people in the UK also wouldn't know the difference.

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:36.088
Now it's time to answer a few questions that you may have about all of this.

00:10:36.028 --> 00:10:39.895
Firstly, why is Great Britain called great?

00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:45.055
We don't have great Spain, great Russia or great Italy.

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:54.763
And there are actually two conflicting arguments, two theories about why great was stuck in front of

00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:55.123
Britain.

00:10:56.128 --> 00:11:05.847
The first theory is that great is used to distinguish Britain from its similarly sounding, but much

00:11:05.847 --> 00:11:12.432
smaller French neighbour, brittany, which is a province in the North of France, Bretagne for the

00:11:12.432 --> 00:11:13.632
French speakers out there.

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:18.934
So the idea was that they wanted to make Britain seem different from Brittany.

00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:28.577
The second reason, the second theory is that it was due to the ego of a certain King James the

00:11:28.577 --> 00:11:32.822
First, who was actually the first King of England and Scotland.

00:11:33.407 --> 00:11:40.454
He was King of both countries, England and Wales and Scotland at the same time, even when they were

00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:41.594
independent countries.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:49.860
He wanted to make it abundantly clear that he wasn't just the King of the old Roman Britain, which

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.240
only included England and some of Wales, but of the entire island, and therefore he referred to

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.240
himself as the King of Great Britain.

00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:06.318
The second question you might have is from a sporting point of view.

00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:14.462
If England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales aren't real countries, they aren't real sovereign

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:19.562
states, then how come they are allowed to play in sporting world cups?

00:12:20.432 --> 00:12:27.122
And why does Great Britain compete in the Olympics, not England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:27.632
Ireland.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:35.162
And why is the Olympic team called Great Britain, not the United Kingdom of Great Britain and

00:12:35.192 --> 00:12:35.972
Northern Ireland?

00:12:37.472 --> 00:12:44.682
Well for the Olympics it is because the Olympic committee only recognises teams from

00:12:44.982 --> 00:12:52.712
passport-issuing countries and as England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all have the UK

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:57.512
passport then they all form part of the UK Olympic team.

00:12:58.752 --> 00:13:06.582
But yes, it is called team GB, not team UK, which is confusing even for people in the UK.

00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:15.042
Actually, the technical term for the Olympic team is "the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic

00:13:15.042 --> 00:13:18.492
team", but that doesn't sound particularly catchy.

00:13:19.002 --> 00:13:23.322
And so just for branding reasons, it's called team GB.

00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:32.418
And for things like the football, rugby, or cricket world cup, the way it works is that it's more

00:13:32.418 --> 00:13:38.688
like member organisations that represent a country, not the sovereign state itself.

00:13:39.408 --> 00:13:45.798
So that's why you can have England or Scotland playing as their own team for these kinds of

00:13:45.798 --> 00:13:46.428
competitions.

00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:56.325
Now finally, when should you call someone British as opposed to English, Scottish, Irish, or Welsh?

00:13:56.865 --> 00:14:00.465
Well, this is indeed a complicated subject.

00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:06.375
Each country is fiercely proud of its own heritage and identity.

00:14:07.725 --> 00:14:14.055
Call a Scotsman English and well, I'm sure he wouldn't be particularly impressed.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:23.160
As a general rule, anyone from Great Britain, and remember that's the island of Great Britain, so

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:31.530
not including Northern Ireland here, so anyone from England, Scotland, or Wales, they shouldn't be

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.560
too offended at being called British.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:42.030
So that's normally a safer bet, rather than assuming that they are English, Welsh or Scottish,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.400
unless you actually know for a fact.

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:50.650
So long story short, you should be okay if you call people British normally.

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:59.131
And as I'm sure you know, and as I mentioned at the start of the podcast, the UK voted to leave the

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:08.191
European Union in June, 2016 and this happened technically on January the 31st of 2020.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:17.261
While Brexit is a phenomenally complicated subject that we could speak for hours about, it's worth

00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:24.071
just mentioning that it is completely plausible that Brexit could be the decision that brings about

00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:30.761
the end of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its current form.

00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:39.071
The majority of people in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, while the

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:42.731
majority of people in England and Wales voted to leave.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:50.996
But the entire of the UK has now left the EU, not just England and Wales.

00:15:52.466 --> 00:16:01.646
Scotland, as you may well know, is already talking about a referendum on membership of the UK, so a

00:16:01.646 --> 00:16:06.746
popular vote on whether to gain independence from the United Kingdom.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:11.714
So only time will tell how long this union manages to last for.

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:20.329
In any case, as of February, 2020 this is still the difference between Great Britain, the United

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:23.584
Kingdom, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:32.566
So next time someone inevitably misuses these terms, calling England Britain or calling a Welshman

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:40.001
English, and there are probably hundreds of people misusing these terms at this very second you will

00:16:40.001 --> 00:16:42.971
be able to correct them and put them in the right direction.

00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:48.521
Okay then, as always, thank you for listening to the show.

00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:50.621
It has been a pleasure.

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:58.706

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.894
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:20.254
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:26.384
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Valentine’s Day.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:32.234
This episode is set to be released on February the 12th, two days before a

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:37.114
day that has become associated with romance and love across much of the world.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:42.364
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about the history of this

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:47.294
day, some of the not-very-romantic-at-all theories about where it

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:52.424
originates and how it has developed into this huge commercial holiday.

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:57.844
It’s a fascinating story, and whether you’re listening to this just before Valentine’s

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:03.024
Day or you want to surprise a loved one with some trivia, with some interesting facts,

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:08.074
or you just want to listen to an interesting story, I hope you’ll enjoy today’s episode.

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:14.094
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:19.564

00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:24.201
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:30.321
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:42.984
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:46.774
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:50.344
OK then, Valentine’s Day.

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:58.464
I should start by saying that nobody really knows where Valentine’s Day definitively comes from.

00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:04.064
If you read an article with a catchy title like “The Real Origins of

00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:08.759
Valentine’s Day”, you’ll probably learn about one of the theories about where

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:14.444
Valentine’s Day comes from, but historians do not agree on the matter, and

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:19.034
there are several ideas, all intriguing and interesting in their own right.

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:24.304
It’s one of those things that we are probably never going to know the real

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:31.334
origin of, and even going back to 1853 there was an article in the New York Times

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:37.194
that described Valentine’s Day as, and I'm quoting directly here, “one of those

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:42.904
mysterious historical or antiquarian problems which are doomed never to be solved.”

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:48.644
So, instead of attempting to claim “Here’s where Valentine’s Day comes

00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:53.044
from”, in this episode we’ll talk about some of the more prominent

00:02:53.054 --> 00:02:58.344
theories, and you can decide for yourself which one sounds most plausible.

00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:04.014
The most common explanation for where Valentine’s Day comes from is from

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:08.844
St Valentine, a man who was killed because of his dedication to love.

00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:13.484
But there are actually stories of two St.

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:20.374
Valentines, two different legends of a Valentine who was martyred for his romantic actions, who

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:27.704
was killed for his romantic deeds, and both of these stories have slightly different versions.

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:32.284
Our first Valentine is a Christian priest called Valentinius,

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:37.704
who lived in the 3rd Century AD, just north of Rome.

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:42.884
The legend goes that Valentinius was arrested by the Roman

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:47.144
Emperor Claudius for the crime of helping persecuted Christians.

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:52.134
He was imprisoned by an aristocrat called Asterius.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.630
While he was being held by Asterius, our priest Valentinius was

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.020
allowed to preach, he was allowed to tell Asterius about Jesus Christ.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.720
Asterius was captivated by what he heard about this

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.672
miraculous Christ, and made a deal with Valentinius.

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:19.820
If this Jesus Christ could cure Asterius’s daughter of blindness, if

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.090
he could make her see again, then Asterius would free Valentinius.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.720
Valentinius put his hands over the blind daughter’s eyes,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.550
he said a prayer, and ta-da, the daughter could see.

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:38.588
Asterius had seen the light, he had seen the power

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:42.238
of God, and immediately converted to Christianity.

00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:45.168
And of course, Valentinius was freed.

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:49.288
When the Emperor got wind of this, when he heard about this

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:54.058
story, he was furious and ordered for them all to be put to death.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:05:01.128
Valentinius was thrown back into jail, but he had fallen in love with Asterius'

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:07.058
daughter, and reportedly wrote her a love letter the night before he was to be executed.

00:05:07.128 --> 00:05:14.258
It was signed, ‘Your Valentine’, which has become a traditional way to sign a Valentine’s Card.

00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:20.688
There are numerous different versions of this story, with parts added and removed.

00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:26.748
One additional twist that appears in several versions is that Valentinius performed

00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:32.028
secret Christian marriage ceremonies for Roman soldiers who weren’t allowed to marry.

00:05:33.218 --> 00:05:36.558
The whole story is, of course, a little problematic.

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:42.798
Even if we skip over the part where Valentinius miraculously heals the blind

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:47.578
daughter, the probability that Valentinius would have been able to get pen and

00:05:47.578 --> 00:05:52.118
paper in his jail cell would have been slim, it would've been quite small, and

00:05:52.448 --> 00:05:57.693
even if he could have, it’s very unlikely that a young woman in the 3rd Century AD

00:05:57.918 --> 00:06:03.248
would have been able to read, especially if she was blind just shortly beforehand.

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:08.832
Nevertheless, this is one of the most prominent stories, and if we worried

00:06:08.882 --> 00:06:13.382
too much about the practical considerations of the origins of the feasts

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:16.842
and celebrations that we know and love, life wouldn’t be that much fun.

00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:22.212
So, that’s our first St Valentine, St Valentinius of Rome.

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:29.732
Our second theory of where Valentine’s Day comes from is about another St Valentine, but

00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:36.452
this time it’s St Valentine of Terni, a town about 75 kilometres to the north of Rome.

00:06:37.602 --> 00:06:44.382
The story about St Valentine of Terni actually dates from a similar time, in the third century

00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:51.362
AD, when Christianity was still very much considered a cult, not a mainstream religion.

00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:58.682
Valentinius of Terni was a Christian bishop with a similar story to Valentinius of Rome.

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:06.542
He tried to convert someone, he healed their child as proof of the power of Christianity, but was

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:13.242
later executed by the Roman Emperor as punishment for trying to convert this person to Christianity.

00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:21.152
Like the story of St Valentine of Rome, there are some additions, such as St Valentine offering

00:07:21.172 --> 00:07:27.402
a fighting couple a rose and telling them to love each other because they only had one heart.

00:07:28.712 --> 00:07:34.962
And there are variants of the story of St Valentine of Terni that are identical to St

00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:41.132
Valentine of Rome, for example that he conducted clandestine, secret, Christian marriage

00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:46.642
ceremonies for young Roman couples that weren’t allowed to be married in a Christian tradition.

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:51.572
The reality is that there probably weren’t two St Valentines.

00:07:51.922 --> 00:07:56.252
There might have been one, and the story has been told and retold,

00:07:56.762 --> 00:08:01.242
embellished as the years went on, with parts from other legends added.

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:07.732
Fair enough, you might think, but why is it on February 14th, and how did

00:08:07.732 --> 00:08:13.072
it go from a Christian bishop being killed to a huge celebration of love

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:17.842
and romance, and something that is quite far removed from any religion?

00:08:19.002 --> 00:08:22.372
Well, it did start out as a religious feast.

00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:26.712
The Feast of St Valentine was added to the Catholic religious calendar

00:08:27.302 --> 00:08:33.412
around the year 496, and celebrated this mythical St Valentine.

00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:39.752
There are some interesting theories about why the date of February the 14th was chosen.

00:08:41.022 --> 00:08:46.922
There’s no evidence that St Valentine was killed on or even around February

00:08:46.982 --> 00:08:53.912
14th, and instead the theory goes that it was placed on that day to coincide

00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:58.762
with a pagan festival that was celebrated by the Romans called Lupercalia.

00:09:00.392 --> 00:09:05.602
The Christian church was trying to convert as many people as possible to Christianity,

00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:12.062
and turning a pagan celebration into a Christian one was a far simpler way of

00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:16.652
getting people onboard than just saying “ok, you can’t celebrate your Pagan

00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:20.402
festival now, you need to celebrate our Christian one on a different date”.

00:09:21.902 --> 00:09:28.162
Lupercalia was already a festival that celebrated fertility, and thus it wasn’t

00:09:28.212 --> 00:09:33.662
a huge jump to go from a festival that celebrated the act of reproduction

00:09:33.882 --> 00:09:38.332
through to one that celebrated a saint who had a strong romantic story.

00:09:39.492 --> 00:09:45.552
During the Roman feast of Lupercalia, Roman priests would meet at a cave where it

00:09:45.642 --> 00:09:51.702
was believed Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, had been brought up by a wolf.

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:58.422
They would then sacrifice a goat, they would kill a goat, they would skin it,

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:04.742
they would cut off its skin and then dip the pieces of goatskin into blood.

00:10:05.882 --> 00:10:08.502
After this they would walk through the streets of

00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:13.822
Rome with this bloody goatskin and slap women with it.

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:18.962
The idea was that this would make the women more fertile,

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:22.092
more able to produce children in the coming year.

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:27.872
Further to this, the young women of the city would put their name into a

00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:34.042
big jar, and the young, unmarried men would pick the names out, and matches

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:37.872
would be formed, young men would be paired together with young women.

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:46.362
So, it was in 496 AD that this pagan feast of Lupercalia was banned and replaced

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:51.172
with the Feast of St Valentine, a celebration of the life of St Valentine.

00:10:52.022 --> 00:10:57.692
But, crucially, it was not immediately a celebration of love and romance at all.

00:10:58.672 --> 00:11:05.542
This wasn’t to come for several centuries, and many historians believe that the association with

00:11:05.552 --> 00:11:12.382
love and romance was first put forward by the English poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, in the 14th Century.

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:18.302
The medieval era saw the development of something called courtly love,

00:11:18.502 --> 00:11:24.132
this idea that love was a powerful force that swept people up and caused

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:28.992
them to do great, brave things to win over the objects of their desire.

00:11:29.872 --> 00:11:35.002
Of course, this idea of courtly love is everywhere throughout medieval literature.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:42.322
At the time that Chaucer was writing, it was believed in England and France that mid-February

00:11:42.442 --> 00:11:48.882
was when birds choose their mate, they choose a partner, and when flowers start to bloom.

00:11:49.482 --> 00:11:53.742
So mid-February, and Valentine’s Day, which is February 14th,

00:11:54.262 --> 00:11:58.762
became associated with love, coupling up, and reproduction.

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:05.276
Aristocrats started to write love letters to each other, and as the idea

00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:09.506
of February 14th being a celebration of love and romance continued to

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:14.486
grow, this became a more and more important part of European culture.

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:20.366
When it came to Shakespeare, in the early 17th Century, we can see

00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:24.896
the Valentine’s Day tradition clearly there, with Ophelia, one of

00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:29.456
the characters in Hamlet, saying that she was Hamlet’s Valentine.

00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:35.076
Hamlet was written in 1609, and by this time the connection

00:12:35.206 --> 00:12:39.016
between Valentine’s Day and love was clearly established.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:45.706
With these connections now a part of much of Western European culture, it was just

00:12:45.726 --> 00:12:51.126
a question of the mass commercialisation of it that we are familiar with today.

00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:57.186
There’s evidence of this trend starting as early as the 1840s,

00:12:57.596 --> 00:13:01.346
when the tradition of sending Valentine’s Day cards started.

00:13:02.426 --> 00:13:07.576
The cost of printing had reduced greatly, given the invention of the printing

00:13:07.576 --> 00:13:12.006
press, and improvements in the postal service had also reduced costs.

00:13:12.886 --> 00:13:17.226
So, by the mid 19th Century it was comparatively easy and

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:21.146
cheap to buy and send a Valentine’s card for a loved one.

00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:28.546
And as shops started offering more and more expensive Valentine’s Day gifts, and chocolate

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:34.436
manufacturers also got in on the game, these costs soon spiralled out of control.

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:40.166
In America, where Valentine’s Day is probably more commercialised than

00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:44.936
anywhere else in the world, people will spend $20 billion dollars on

00:13:44.936 --> 00:13:50.426
Valentine’s day, with the average Valentine’s Day gift costing $110.

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:56.756
Indeed, it’s believed by many that the reason that Valentine’s Day is now such a

00:13:57.126 --> 00:14:03.036
big deal is in no small part because the companies that profit from it have spent

00:14:03.046 --> 00:14:08.186
hundreds of millions of dollars marketing it, promoting their products to make

00:14:08.186 --> 00:14:13.226
people feel bad if they aren’t spending large amounts of money on Valentine’s Day.

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:20.776
Hallmark, the American card manufacturer, has been accused of pushing Valentine’s Day cards

00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:27.796
on young children, and essentially inventing the idea that kids at school should be sending

00:14:27.836 --> 00:14:32.926
Valentine's cards to each other, making it a competition about who received the most.

00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:38.496
For Hallmark, Valentine’s Day is the second biggest day in the year, after

00:14:38.526 --> 00:14:44.716
Christmas, for sending cards, with 145 million Valentine’s Day cards sent.

00:14:45.946 --> 00:14:51.416
As you probably know, greeting cards are incredibly cheap to produce, and are

00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:55.686
very high margin, the companies make a lot of money from selling each one.

00:14:56.786 --> 00:15:01.046
There are countless adverts leading up to Valentine’s Day encouraging us to

00:15:01.206 --> 00:15:07.496
spend, spend, spend, and placing the idea that you are a bad husband, boyfriend,

00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:12.066
wife or girlfriend if you aren’t treating your loved one to something special.

00:15:12.926 --> 00:15:16.176
And for people who aren’t in a relationship, Valentine’s

00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:19.306
Day can obviously be a difficult time of year.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:25.496
This has led to several anti-Valentine’s Day holidays, some of which take

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:30.716
place around February 14th, and others are on completely different dates.

00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:38.256
In the US there is something called Singles Awareness Day, which is a celebration of being single.

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:44.556
That happens on February 14th, on Valentine's Day, and the idea is that

00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:50.046
you make a toast of your single status, and presumably celebrate not being

00:15:50.046 --> 00:15:53.646
pressured to spend hundreds of dollars on cards, chocolate and roses.

00:15:54.786 --> 00:16:00.196
In China there’s something called Single’s Day, which is celebrated on November 11th.

00:16:01.078 --> 00:16:04.906
The idea here is to treat yourself, to spend money on

00:16:04.906 --> 00:16:07.766
yourself, because nobody is buying presents for you.

00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:14.506
This has actually morphed into the biggest spending day in the entire world, and is

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:21.166
about two and a half times bigger than Cyber Monday, so although it might have started

00:16:21.466 --> 00:16:27.516
as an anti-Valentine’s Day, it’s really just a way to bag yourself a few bargains.

00:16:28.596 --> 00:16:33.886
And one that emerged out of a TV Series called Parks & Recreation is something

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:38.986
called Galentine’s Day, which is celebrated on the day before Valentine’s Day.

00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:43.726
The idea here is that it’s a way for women to celebrate

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:47.316
friendship, without any pressure or romantic implications.

00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:55.396
And to explain the name, Gal is slang for ‘girl’, so it’s Valentine’s, just for gals - Galentine’s.

00:16:56.476 --> 00:17:00.266
So, that’s Valentine’s Day, and some of the theories that surround it.

00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:05.426
It’s one of those traditions that is now observed by hundreds of millions of people

00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:10.766
around the world, that has most likely been pushed upon us by companies that profit

00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:15.526
from it, but that does have some interesting stories about its potential origins.

00:17:16.844 --> 00:17:22.276
And for those of us that might not like the idea of being pressured to spend on cards

00:17:22.436 --> 00:17:27.806
and roses that will end up in the rubbish bin just a few days later, or those who

00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:33.016
just don’t like the idea of the day in general, I guess we can be thankful that we

00:17:33.016 --> 00:17:37.096
don’t have to run through the streets of Rome with the bloody skin of a dead goat.

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:44.346
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Valentine’s Day.

00:17:44.716 --> 00:17:47.756
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:52.156
and that whatever you do on February 14th, whether you’re celebrating

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:55.766
Valentine’s Day, or whether you are not, that you have a fantastic day.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:59.906
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

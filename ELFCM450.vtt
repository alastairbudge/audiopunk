Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.701
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:19.571
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:27.061
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina.

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:31.131
It’s a story about football, of course, but we are going

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.311
to talk more about what happened off the pitch than on it.

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:40.626
It will involve global politics, a military dictatorship, murder, prisons, corruption,

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:46.171
and has led to some people calling this “the dirtiest world cup in history”.

00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:53.786
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about The 1978 World Cup in Argentina.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.856
The winters in Buenos Aires are generally mild, temperatures dropping

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:05.436
to 9 degrees or so at night, and rising to 16 in the afternoon.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:11.986
And the afternoon of the 25th of June 1978 was, in

00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:15.546
many ways, a typical day in the capital of Argentina.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:20.216
A light breeze blew across the city, the people of Buenos Aires

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.886
went about their daily business, but the atmosphere was buzzing.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:33.166
To the north of the city, in the barrio of Belgrano, 71,483 fans had

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:38.136
packed into the Estadio Monumental to watch the final of the world cup

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:42.476
between Argentina, the hosts of the tournament, and the Netherlands.

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:46.496
The Netherlands were many people’s favourites.

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:51.536
They were the pioneers of total football, and had got to the finals

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:55.936
of the last world cup, only to lose to the hosts, West Germany.

00:01:57.026 --> 00:02:01.026
They were up against the hosts again, and this time the

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:05.156
Europeans were desperate to lift their first world cup trophy.

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:13.066
Their opponents, Argentina were in many people’s estimations a weaker team, but they had been

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:19.156
playing very well, only losing one match on their way to the final, and they had the advantage

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:25.676
of phenomenally passionate home fans, full of energy, love and support for their country.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:31.886
These were the days when fans weren’t really able to travel to support their teams,

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:36.536
so there were few orange shirts, supporters of the Netherlands, in the stadium.

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:42.426
Even before the referee blew his whistle to kick off the game, there had

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:47.146
been some inconsistencies, shall we say, directly leading up to the match.

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:54.176
The scheduled referee for the final was an Israeli named Abraham Klein, but the

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:59.766
Argentine Football Association had complained, saying that Israel had strong political

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:04.986
links to the Netherlands, and therefore an Israeli couldn’t be trusted to be impartial.

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:10.576
In other words, Klein couldn’t be trusted to officiate the game fairly.

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:17.156
The Israeli referee was removed, and replaced by Sergio Gonella, an official

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:21.646
from Italy, a country with a strong history of links with Argentina.

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:24.346
And this wasn’t it.

00:03:25.236 --> 00:03:29.776
The bus that took the Dutch team to the stadium went on an unusual

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:33.666
scenic route through Buenos Aires, instead of going directly.

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:38.606
To state the obvious, a tour of the city is the last thing a

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:41.986
player wants when they are on the way to play in a world cup final.

00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:47.996
And then after the Dutch players got onto the pitch, ready for the 3pm

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:52.656
kick-off, they were made to wait, as the Argentine team was 5 minutes late.

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:59.046
We’ll get to what happened next, in the match, in due course, but let me further set the

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:03.886
scene by saying that these were far from the only controversies leading up to the final.

00:04:05.196 --> 00:04:08.286
In fact, the very decision to hold the FIFA world

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:11.516
cup in Argentina was a subject of wide controversy.

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:16.066
The decision to award the tournament to Argentina was

00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:21.004
not controversial, but that happened in July of 1966.

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:27.026
At that point, or to be precise, until 1 week before that point,

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:30.966
Argentina had been run by a democratically elected government.

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:38.449
But on June the 28th of 1966, the government was overthrown by a military junta.

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:45.339
The military would rule the country until 1973, when democracy returned for a

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:52.319
brief period before another military coup in 1976, which would last until 1983.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:02.729
And this second period of military rule, from 1976 to 1983, was particularly brutal.

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:10.436
Almost immediately after seizing power, the generals proceeded to crack down on anyone

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:14.866
who was deemed to have dangerous political views or be a threat to the government.

00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:19.956
And this wasn’t just political opponents, people in politics.

00:05:20.496 --> 00:05:25.706
Anyone who was thought to have leftist views or communist sympathies, from

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:30.806
journalists to lawyers, writers to artists, they would find themselves abducted by

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:37.106
the police, sent to prison for torture and beating, and more often than not, murdered.

00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:43.901
The scale of this is quite astounding, with estimates putting the figure at around

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:50.551
30,000 people abducted and murdered by the regime during its seven year stint in power.

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:58.061
And while the true scale of this state-enabled murder has only come to light with the downfall of

00:05:58.061 --> 00:06:03.661
the regime, of course there were plenty of people in Argentina who knew exactly what was going on.

00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:10.091
Or rather, they didn’t know exactly what was going on, but they knew that their friends and loved

00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:16.311
ones were being abducted in broad daylight, and they were never heard of or seen ever again.

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:22.211
Clearly, the objective of this visible brutality was to squash

00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:26.491
all opposition, to stop people from protesting or complaining.

00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:31.271
But some citizens continued to protest.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:38.471
In 1977, the year before the tournament was scheduled to take place, and a year after

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:43.561
the junta had seized power, a collection of brave Argentine women founded a group

00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:49.241
called “Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo”, or “The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo” in English.

00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:55.071
These mothers were women whose children had disappeared, or to be

00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:59.531
more precise, whose children had been disappeared by the authorities.

00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:04.621
Every Thursday they would march to the presidential palace holding

00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:08.304
up pictures of their children, and wearing white headscarves.

00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:14.221
As they grew in number, they started to draw more international attention.

00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:21.731
And in December of 1977, on Human Rights Day, the group paid for a full-page

00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:26.041
newspaper advertisement where they published the names of their missing children.

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:29.441
Where were they, the mothers asked?

00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:30.561
What happened to them?

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:38.031
It would later transpire that a common fate for people captured by the regime was to be first

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:44.191
imprisoned and tortured, and when the military officials had extracted as much useful information

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:50.731
as they could from them, they would be stripped naked, given a sedative, put on an aeroplane,

00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:58.631
flown out over the Atlantic or over the River Plate, and thrown out from the plane to their death.

00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:05.581
In one chilling description, a former army operative recalled how the

00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:09.971
sedated prisoners would fall out of the planes “like little ants”.

00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:17.975
In fact, one of the founding mothers of “Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo”, Azucena Villaflor, a

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:25.005
woman who had publicly asked “what happened to my son”, she would later meet his same fate.

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:30.296
The very same evening that the newspaper advertisement was published, she found

00:08:30.296 --> 00:08:36.026
herself kidnapped by a group of armed men and taken to a secret detention centre.

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:45.146
In fact, nobody knows for sure what happened to her, and she wasn’t seen or heard of for 30 years.

00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:53.326
She would only be formally identified in 2005, when body parts that had washed up on a beach

00:08:53.546 --> 00:09:00.686
back in 1977 were identified, and they were found to belong to Villaflor and other activists.

00:09:02.106 --> 00:09:05.626
In all probability, like the children she was protesting

00:09:05.636 --> 00:09:10.016
about, Villaflor was thrown from an aeroplane to her death.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:16.096
Now, this was the backdrop to the World Cup finals in Argentina.

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:22.366
A brutally repressive regime that would crack down on its opponents in the most terrible of ways.

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:29.536
And much of this was known, or at least supposed, by the international community.

00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:35.876
There were protests outside Argentina, encouraging countries to boycott the tournament.

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:43.726
Amnesty International led a series of protests, with a slogan, “Yes to Football, No to Torture!”

00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:51.206
Johan Cruyff, one of the best and most famous football players in the world, refused to travel

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:57.196
to the world cup, which was interpreted as a criticism of the regime, but he would later

00:09:57.196 --> 00:10:02.206
say that it was out of fear for his family’s safety rather than a grand political statement.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.333
In the end, no countries boycotted it.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:10.846
The world cup would go on, and the president of Argentina,

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:16.136
General Videla, was determined to make it a huge success.

00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:23.206
No expense would be spared; it was Argentina’s time to shine on the world stage.

00:10:24.886 --> 00:10:30.266
In fact, the costs were spiralling out of control so much that a general who was

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:36.495
overseeing the World Cup, a man called Omar Actis, raised public concerns about the cost.

00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:44.115
But in August of 1976, as he was on his way to a press conference where he was expected

00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:49.775
to criticise the excessive spending, he was assassinated, shot in broad daylight.

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:57.785
The regime would blame his death on a far-left paramilitary organisation called Montoneros,

00:10:58.153 --> 00:11:03.535
but the group denied it, and the timing of his death certainly looked suspicious.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:11.565
In the end, Argentina would spend 520 million dollars on the world cup, which was twice what

00:11:11.565 --> 00:11:17.145
Spain would spend on its world cup preparations for hosting the next tournament in 1982.

00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:20.786
Now, let’s talk about some football.

00:11:21.526 --> 00:11:25.796
The tournament kicked off on the 1st of June, 1978, with

00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:29.456
an uneventful 0-0 draw between West Germany and Poland.

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:34.596
Back then the hosts didn’t automatically play the first match.

00:11:35.716 --> 00:11:39.996
Argentina would play the following day, beating Hungary 2-1.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:44.416
And a few days later, Argentina would face France.

00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:51.196
Now, France had lost their first game against Italy, so they had to win to stay in the tournament.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.420
The game against Argentina would be marred by accusations of favourable treatment of

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:03.770
Argentina by the referee, with a penalty being given for Argentina and one denied for France.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.020
In the end, Argentina won the game 2-1, progressing to the next round.

00:12:11.622 --> 00:12:17.632
Now, the way in which the world cup worked in 1978 was slightly different to how it works now.

00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:23.292
Instead of quarter finals and semi finals, there was a second “group

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:27.622
stage”, and the winners of each group played each other in the final.

00:12:29.072 --> 00:12:32.942
Argentina was in a group with Brazil, Poland and Peru.

00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:37.862
And it won its first match against Poland, then drew against Brazil.

00:12:38.762 --> 00:12:42.072
It would all come down to the last set of matches.

00:12:42.582 --> 00:12:48.092
Brazil against Poland, and Argentina against fellow South Americans Peru.

00:12:49.532 --> 00:12:55.432
Brazil had played earlier in the day, beating Poland 3-1, so Argentina

00:12:55.442 --> 00:13:02.102
knew exactly what it needed to do to get to the final: beat Peru 4-0.

00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:08.522
Now, in case you don’t know much about football, if perhaps you are more familiar with

00:13:08.772 --> 00:13:16.002
basketball or sports with high scores, 4-0 is a lot, especially in a world cup match.

00:13:16.782 --> 00:13:22.612
It would be no mean feat, but there was a lot riding on Argentina making it to the final.

00:13:23.432 --> 00:13:30.322
10% of the country’s national budget had been spent on new stadiums, the phone lines of 6,000

00:13:30.362 --> 00:13:35.412
Argentinians had been disconnected so that global media outlets could cover the competition.

00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:43.112
And it was a matter of huge pride for the country, and for the military regime that ruled it.

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:49.142
Peru, on the other hand, had no hope of qualifying for the final.

00:13:49.932 --> 00:13:53.979
They had lost both their games, so they would be playing only for honour.

00:13:55.182 --> 00:14:01.792
The game started off relatively equal, but the tide soon turned in Argentina’s favour.

00:14:03.378 --> 00:14:07.688
By the 50th minute, Argentina were 4-0 up, and the

00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:12.078
game ended 6-0, propelling Argentina into the final.

00:14:13.518 --> 00:14:20.088
Now, was this simply excellent football on Argentina’s part, or were there other factors at play?

00:14:21.568 --> 00:14:27.098
According to a 2018 film, called Pele, Argentina and the Dictators,

00:14:27.428 --> 00:14:30.698
it was not just a case of Argentina playing better football.

00:14:32.108 --> 00:14:39.178
This film tells the story of an Argentine civil servant who alleges that Argentina had offered

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:47.698
Peru $50 million and 35,000 tonnes of grain if Peru threw the match in Argentina’s favour.

00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:55.228
Now, these are the allegations of one person, but there are other suspicious events as well.

00:14:56.568 --> 00:15:01.898
There was an allegation of a secret emergency meeting 48 hours before the game

00:15:02.128 --> 00:15:06.948
at the Buenos Aires Sheraton hotel, involving officials from both countries.

00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:12.240
There's even an allegation that the president of Argentina, General

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.308
Videla, visited the Peruvian dressing room to speak to the players.

00:15:17.378 --> 00:15:21.618
And what’s more, that the Argentine president was accompanied by Henry

00:15:21.618 --> 00:15:25.238
Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State, who had done a lot of

00:15:25.268 --> 00:15:29.058
interfering in South America in support of right wing governments.

00:15:30.368 --> 00:15:35.028
Now, Kissinger was a private citizen at that point in time, and a

00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:39.308
thorn in the side of the Democratic president Jimmy Carter, so if

00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:42.888
he was there, he wasn’t acting on the orders of the US government.

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:49.928
Kissinger would later say that he had no recollection of visiting the Peruvian dressing room,

00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:58.178
but even this denial, saying “I can’t remember” rather than “I did not” is somewhat suspicious.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.598
Now, as a quick side note, if you'd like to learn more about the life of

00:16:02.598 --> 00:16:07.088
Henry Kissiner, we have a member-only episode on that, it’s number 393.

00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:15.208
Anyway, back to our story, Argentina won 6-0, and they would face the Netherlands in the final.

00:16:16.358 --> 00:16:19.328
And this brings us back to the start of the episode.

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:25.728
The crowd was roaring, the tens of thousands of Argentine fans in the stadium and the hundreds

00:16:25.728 --> 00:16:31.998
of thousands of fans outside screaming at the top of their lungs in support of the team.

00:16:33.548 --> 00:16:39.088
Even in the notorious detention centre just a stone’s throw away from the stadium, the

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:46.128
Escuela Superior de Mecánica de la Armada, or the Navy Petty-Officers School, a TV had

00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:50.118
been brought in for the battered and bruised political prisoners to watch the game on.

00:16:51.828 --> 00:16:53.378
You might already know the result.

00:16:54.268 --> 00:16:57.228
Argentina scored first, in the 38th minute.

00:16:58.688 --> 00:17:03.128
Moving towards the final minutes, the atmosphere in the stadium grew even more

00:17:03.128 --> 00:17:09.418
tense, as Argentina was minutes away from lifting the first world cup in its history.

00:17:10.528 --> 00:17:16.158
But then in the 82nd minute, the Netherlands equalised, taking it to 1:1.

00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:22.178
The atmosphere ratcheted up a notch when the Dutch hit the post with minutes to go.

00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:27.468
Normal time ended 1:1, meaning it went to extra time.

00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:35.828
In the 105th minute, the scorer of the first goal for Argentina, Mario Kempes, scored again, and

00:17:35.828 --> 00:17:43.318
then his teammate Daniel Bertoni scored, taking it to 3:1 and sealing victory for the home nation.

00:17:44.678 --> 00:17:48.018
The crowd went wild, the city electric.

00:17:48.548 --> 00:17:53.916
For the first time in its history, Argentina had won the world cup.

00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:59.838
But this victory wasn’t just a footballing victory; it was a victory

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:04.518
on the world stage for the murderous regime that had presided over it.

00:18:05.358 --> 00:18:11.088
It was, unfortunately, marred by controversy, giving Argentina’s rivals, both

00:18:11.388 --> 00:18:16.978
political and footballing, a reason to question the legitimacy of the victory.

00:18:18.338 --> 00:18:24.188
It's unquestionable that the Argentine team played some great football, and very

00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:30.418
possibly they did win fair and square, but the actions of the regime cast a black

00:18:30.468 --> 00:18:35.938
cloud over the tournament, with some calling it “The Dirtiest World Cup In History”.

00:18:37.498 --> 00:18:41.508
As always, it is a reminder that the full story of the world

00:18:41.508 --> 00:18:45.898
cup is often more nuanced than what happens on the pitch.

00:18:47.738 --> 00:18:52.968
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The 1978 World Cup in Argentina.

00:18:53.978 --> 00:18:56.458
As always, I'd love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:56.818 --> 00:19:02.888
We've got loads of listeners from Argentina, and Latin America more widely, so what do you think?

00:19:03.378 --> 00:19:04.498
Do you remember this world cup?

00:19:04.898 --> 00:19:08.208
Do you think it was all fair play, or were there other factors?

00:19:08.618 --> 00:19:11.598
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

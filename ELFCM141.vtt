Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:16.778
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:21.408
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:27.418
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part 3, the final part of this

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:32.058
mini-series on language invention, creation, and discovery.

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:40.054
In the first part, part one, we learned about invented languages, from Lord of The Rings to Láadan.

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:47.088
In the second part we learned about Cockney Rhyming Slang, the strange dialect from the

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:53.058
East End of London where you replace words with other words and phrases that sound the same.

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:59.858
And in today’s episode we are talking about a subject that is perhaps a little more

00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:07.958
important, an object that has allowed us to decode an entire civilisation, The Rosetta Stone.

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:14.978
It’s one of the most famous objects in the world, certainly the most famous stone, and

00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:21.688
its unexpected discovery unlocked a language, uncovered a culture, and really gave a

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:27.378
voice to the ancient Egyptians, a people that we had thought had been forever lost.

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:30.848
It’s not just about ancient Egypt though.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:37.078
The story of the Rosetta Stone teaches us about geopolitical rivalry, it poses

00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:42.568
questions about what is right and wrong in terms of cultural heritage preservation,

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:48.978
and it gets us thinking a lot about the role of language in understanding the past.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:55.718
It’s also just a great story, so with all that in mind, let’s jump straight into it.

00:01:57.758 --> 00:02:02.786
If you go to the British Museum in London, and you find yourself strolling

00:02:02.808 --> 00:02:08.568
through the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery, you might well end up in Room 4.

00:02:09.768 --> 00:02:13.648
In the middle of this room, inside a glass cabinet, you’ll

00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:18.308
see a large block of stone, the subject of today’s episode.

00:02:19.628 --> 00:02:24.518
The Rosetta Stone may not seem like much to the untrained eye.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:33.578
It’s a lump of stone, about a metre high, 75 cm wide, and just under 30 cm deep.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:41.438
Although this is a very unfair comparison, it’s a little bit like a big flat screen TV.

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:46.888
Looking more closely, you’ll see that it is covered in writing.

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:52.258
Specifically, three different types of writing, three different scripts.

00:02:53.478 --> 00:02:59.378
You don’t need to understand the writing to see that the three scripts are very different.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:05.688
The script at the top is pictorial, it looks like it is made of different characters.

00:03:06.168 --> 00:03:11.908
You might recognise it as hieroglyphics, a style of writing used in Ancient Egypt.

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:18.308
The script at the bottom might also be one that you recognise, it’s ancient Greek.

00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:23.608
And you probably wouldn’t recognise the writing style in the middle.

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:29.488
It looks, to the untrained eye at least, a little bit like Persian or Arabic.

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:32.398
That script is called Demotic.

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:38.948
Now, you might be thinking, “ok, so a stone with three languages on it.

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:43.518
Go on, why is this so special - what is written on this text then?”.

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:49.518
Well, that is an excellent question, and the importance of the Rosetta

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:54.528
Stone has very little to do with what is actually written on the stone.

00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:59.108
Of course, the words are important, but anything could have been

00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:02.838
written on the stone and it would still have been equally important.

00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:09.468
The text on the stone is pretty uninteresting - it’s a royal decree,

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:15.748
and starts with a list of titles of the Pharaoh Ptolemy V, and then

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:19.838
proceeds to talk about how loyal the Pharaoh is towards the gods.

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:28.248
Its importance isn’t in the content of the text, but rather the fact that the text is in

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:34.848
three different scripts, two of which had been thought to have been lost to mankind forever.

00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:39.638
These scripts were the first two on the stone, hieroglyphics

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:44.478
and Demotic, two writing systems used by the Ancient Egyptians.

00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:50.138
Ancient Egypt was one of the most powerful civilisations in world history, and

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:56.038
for almost 3,000 years Egypt was a centre of trade, science, and philosophy.

00:04:56.658 --> 00:05:04.948
But by the year 30 BC, with the death of Cleopatra, Egypt fell and became a Roman province.

00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:11.788
The writing system that ancient Egyptians used for formal writing was called hieroglyphics.

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:15.178
You’ve probably seen these before - it looks like a

00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:18.838
character-based writing system with beautiful pictures.

00:05:19.948 --> 00:05:25.798
After the Romans took over, this hieroglyphic system was still in use, but its

00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:30.828
use was discouraged, and fewer and fewer people knew how to read and write it.

00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:38.478
By the 5th century AD, it had completely disappeared, without a soul who knew how to read it.

00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:43.758
Almost as soon as the last person who understood this writing system died

00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:48.128
out, people were trying to figure out what these hieroglyphics meant.

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:57.198
The 3,000 years of ancient Egyptians civilisation had left a huge amount of stuff, from pots and

00:05:57.198 --> 00:06:03.308
pans through to the pyramids, and anyone could see that it was a highly developed civilisation.

00:06:04.248 --> 00:06:11.248
But, with no way to read their writing, it was hard to actually dig deep into their culture.

00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:12.838
It remained a mystery.

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:17.208
From Islamic scholars through to German Jesuit

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:21.528
scholars, numerous attempts were made, but to no avail.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:25.678
There was no dictionary, no parallel texts, no way

00:06:25.678 --> 00:06:28.898
of translating hieroglyphics into any other language.

00:06:29.658 --> 00:06:36.108
And it stayed this way until a strange combination of British colonialism and

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:42.128
French expansionism in the late 1700s caused there to be a critical breakthrough

00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:46.778
in our understanding of hieroglyphics, and therefore of ancient Egypt.

00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:53.128
By the late 18th century, Britain had firmly established a stronghold in India.

00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:58.058
Napoleon Bonaparte had been rising through the ranks of the French

00:06:58.058 --> 00:07:04.378
army, and in 1798 he had led a French army to Egypt and Syria.

00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:12.198
The idea was to make Egypt a French colony, which would protect French trade interests,

00:07:12.358 --> 00:07:18.558
attack British trade routes, and cut off the British access to India, its crown jewel.

00:07:19.788 --> 00:07:22.548
But, the mission wasn’t just a military one.

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:30.088
Napoleon, ever the shrewd strategic leader, had brought scientists and archaeologists

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:36.278
with him with the idea to better document and understand Egyptian cultural heritage,

00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:43.308
as well as promote Enlightenment ideas in Egypt, a sort of preemptive soft power move.

00:07:44.438 --> 00:07:47.978
The importance of these scholars will become clear in a minute.

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:54.528
On the 15th of July, 1799, a young French officer called

00:07:54.568 --> 00:07:58.408
Pierre-François-Xavier Bouchard made a startling discovery.

00:07:59.518 --> 00:08:03.958
He was working on strengthening a French fortress a few kilometres

00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:08.618
north of a port city called Rachid, which the French called Rosetta.

00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:13.958
As he was adding to the fort’s defences, he stumbled across

00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:18.488
this large stone buried deep in the walls of the fortress.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:25.038
It had strange writing on, he called over some of his colleagues, they agreed it

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:30.408
could be important, and sent it to Cairo to be examined by the French scholars.

00:08:31.518 --> 00:08:36.058
These scholars were evidently immediately impressed, they could see that

00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:40.908
this stone could be the key to understanding Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:46.058
They made copies of the stone, just in case, so that they could examine

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:49.937
the scripts even if they didn’t have physical possession of the stone.

00:08:51.153 --> 00:08:54.648
This was to be a canny move, a smart decision.

00:08:55.458 --> 00:09:00.188
The French expedition to Egypt and Syria hadn’t gone completely to plan.

00:09:00.938 --> 00:09:04.718
At least, from a military point of view it was not a success.

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:10.548
To cut a long story short, the French ships were sunk at the battle

00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:14.898
of the Nile in 1798, almost as soon as they arrived in Egypt.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:19.448
After 3 years of fighting against the British and the Ottomans,

00:09:19.738 --> 00:09:25.838
Napoleon fled back to France, and in 1801 the French forces surrendered.

00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:33.428
As part of the surrender, they eventually agreed to hand over a vast amount of these ancient

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:39.178
Egyptian treasures that they had discovered to the British, including The Rosetta Stone.

00:09:40.398 --> 00:09:47.088
By February 1802 it had arrived in Portsmouth, and within a month it was in the British

00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:53.168
Museum in London, where it has been ever since, apart from during wartime, where it was

00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:59.198
removed for its own protection, and a short period where it was loaned to the Louvre in Paris.

00:10:00.847 --> 00:10:06.169
Now it should be noted that although both the French and the British were sure

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:11.079
of the importance of the Rosetta Stone, they didn’t actually know how to read it.

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:17.569
Or rather, they could read the Greek, because reading ancient Greek wasn’t very difficult.

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:23.499
They could translate the Greek text, they knew what it said, but they still didn’t know

00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:30.769
exactly how to unlock the other two languages, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Demotic.

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:38.339
To do this, our story needs two more characters, one British, the other French.

00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:45.319
And depending on what story you believe, and perhaps your nationality and pride,

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:50.839
either one or the other was responsible for deciphering The Rosetta Stone.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.669
Our British character was a man called Thomas Young.

00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:02.039
He was the older of our two characters, and didn’t really start

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:07.689
working on the study of Egypt until 1813, when he was 40 years old.

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:13.079
One of Young’s important developments was to recognise the

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:17.489
similarities between the hieroglyphics and the Demotic script.

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:22.959
Indeed, we now know that the Demotic script was a sort of

00:11:23.189 --> 00:11:27.699
day-to-day ancient Egyptian, it means 'language of the people’.

00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:33.259
Hieroglyphics were used for more formal things, such as

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.309
the royal decree, the royal message on the Rosetta Stone.

00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:42.409
And as the text of the Rosetta Stone needed to be understood by everyone,

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:47.249
it was written in three different scripts - Hieroglyphs, Demotic and Greek.

00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:52.689
And this is the reason that it is so important, if the ancient

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:55.729
Greek wasn’t there, it would just be another old stone.

00:11:56.809 --> 00:12:00.559
Going back to Young, the other major development that he made

00:12:00.909 --> 00:12:05.069
was to recognise that hieroglyphics could also be phonetic.

00:12:05.869 --> 00:12:11.669
Others had hypothesised this before, but there was such a prevailing belief that

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:17.249
each hieroglyph represented a word or concept that this was just taken as truth.

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:22.639
Young did manage to make some excellent progress with the hieroglyphics,

00:12:22.849 --> 00:12:27.809
but at the same time, across the channel in France, an eccentric

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:31.859
but incredibly clever Frenchman was working away furiously.

00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:37.709
His name was Jean-François Champollion, and at the time that

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:41.169
the Rosetta Stone was discovered he was only 8 years old.

00:12:42.249 --> 00:12:47.119
It was almost as if he were destined to uncover ancient Egypt.

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:52.579
He was interested in Egypt from a very early age, and was even

00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:56.839
nicknamed The Egyptian, due to his dark skin and dark hair.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:03.169
He had a gift for languages, and aside from his native French

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:08.729
he learned Latin and Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiopic and Coptic.

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:14.329
Coptic was a late stage Egyptian language, similar

00:13:14.599 --> 00:13:17.609
to the Demotic script that was on the Rosetta Stone.

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:24.709
Coptic came from Demotic, and with his knowledge of Coptic, Champollion

00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:28.559
was able to make faster progress with Demotic than Young was.

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:35.379
It was certainly not an overnight breakthrough, and took years of meticulous study.

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:41.639
The real breakthrough came on 14 September 1822,

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:45.389
over 20 years after the Rosetta Stone was discovered.

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:51.679
Champollion had found a word that seemed to start with R, and

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:56.519
have another letter, then S, and then another letter, then S.

00:13:57.319 --> 00:14:02.289
He hypothesised that it was the name for Ramses, an Egyptian king.

00:14:03.149 --> 00:14:07.609
He checked this theory with other instances of hieroglyphics, it

00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:11.389
matched, he had cracked it, or at least cracked part of the code.

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:16.639
Legend has it that he ran all the way to his brother’s house,

00:14:16.849 --> 00:14:21.619
screamed “I’ve done it”, and then collapsed for days, exhausted.

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:26.459
Now, of course the story is a little more complicated than that.

00:14:26.819 --> 00:14:33.008
The actual process of cracking the code, of figuring out what these hieroglyphics meant, was

00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:40.038
incredibly complicated, and there was a lot of further work required after Champollion’s discovery.

00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:48.508
But what this meant was that the texts of ancient Egypt were finally unlocked, people could

00:14:48.508 --> 00:14:54.218
read them and understand Egyptian culture in a way that they were never able to do before.

00:14:55.288 --> 00:15:00.738
Prior to the decipherment of hieroglyphics, before hieroglyphics were unlocked,

00:15:01.048 --> 00:15:05.548
our knowledge of ancient Egypt was from the objects that it left behind.

00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:11.598
Archaeologists and historians made up their own minds about what these objects

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:17.888
were used for, and our understanding of ancient Egypt was second-hand, it

00:15:17.888 --> 00:15:23.420
was from conclusions that people had taken after having discovered objects.

00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:27.998
Now, the ancient Egyptians could speak for themselves.

00:15:28.998 --> 00:15:35.298
They had left an extensive written history, written records, and we can understand what they wrote.

00:15:36.298 --> 00:15:39.878
An entire civilisation, one of the most important

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:43.218
civilisations in the world, had just been opened up.

00:15:44.358 --> 00:15:48.398
In terms of who took credit for the deciphering of the

00:15:48.398 --> 00:15:52.488
Rosetta Stone, both Britain and France said “It was our guy”.

00:15:53.638 --> 00:15:58.258
Indeed, there was a serious rivalry between Champollion and Young - they

00:15:58.268 --> 00:16:03.144
started off by collaborating, but later broke ties after falling out.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:10.868
The reality is that the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone is the work of much more than one person.

00:16:11.928 --> 00:16:16.059
Young’s discoveries wouldn’t have been possible without the work that came

00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:20.219
before him, and Champollion’s wouldn’t have been possible without Young.

00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:26.139
And neither of them got it all right, scholars that came after them have

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:30.619
been correcting and polishing the work of both Young and Champollion.

00:16:31.789 --> 00:16:37.059
The Rosetta Stone might have been the instrumental text, the trilingual text

00:16:37.109 --> 00:16:41.629
that allowed the code to be cracked, but it wasn’t a complete dictionary.

00:16:42.349 --> 00:16:48.659
What it did was allow us to know how ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics are constructed, and

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:54.739
how to translate, rather than being a dictionary to translate every single hieroglyphic.

00:16:55.939 --> 00:17:02.659
And although this story is about ancient Egypt, and discovering the language and culture of the

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:09.399
ancient Egyptians, you might notice that modern-day Egyptians are quite absent from this story.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:15.639
The decipherment of the Rosetta Stone was really something done by Europeans,

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:21.339
and the field of Egyptology has been dominated by Europeans ever since.

00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:27.919
Indeed, the Rosetta Stone still sits in the British Museum in London, not in Egypt.

00:17:28.899 --> 00:17:33.979
The Egyptians have asked for the stone to be returned to Egypt multiple times, but

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:39.309
their requests have always been rejected, on the grounds that the stone is best

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:45.399
preserved in the British Museum, that it’s part of a shared humanity and it can be

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:50.739
shared with the most people in London, rather than in its original home of Egypt.

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:57.039
Now, whether this is right or wrong is certainly a topic of debate, but it

00:17:57.039 --> 00:18:00.969
doesn’t seem like the situation will change any time in the near future.

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:06.019
Wherever the Rosetta Stone is, physically, what’s perhaps more

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:10.679
important is what it represents, and what it has allowed us to do.

00:18:11.869 --> 00:18:17.440
You don’t need to see it to be amazed by it, and indeed Jean-François

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.219
Champollion, one of the men credited with deciphering it, probably never

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:26.809
actually saw it, he worked exclusively from copies of the original.

00:18:27.879 --> 00:18:34.219
The stone represents many things, but for me one of the main things is the power of language.

00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:40.279
Before its discovery, the ancient Egyptians were a people from thousands

00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:45.959
of years ago, a people who left behind pyramids, tombs, and all sorts of

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:50.759
other amazing objects that showed how developed their civilisation was.

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:55.689
But they had no voice, no way of expressing themselves

00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:58.759
other than through the objects they left behind.

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:05.707
The Rosetta Stone, and the decipherment that it facilitated, gave ancient Egyptians

00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:11.763
a voice, it allowed them to talk to us in their own terms, in their own language.

00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:17.593
And while I started this episode by saying that the Rosetta Stone doesn’t

00:19:17.593 --> 00:19:22.473
look very impressive if you see it in a museum, it’s hard to deny that

00:19:22.503 --> 00:19:26.723
it is probably the most important stone in the history of the world.

00:19:29.993 --> 00:19:34.693
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Rosetta Stone.

00:19:35.243 --> 00:19:38.863
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:46.733
This is also the final episode of our mini series on invention, creation, and discovery of language.

00:19:47.183 --> 00:19:51.473
You might have thought ‘what do invented languages, Cockney Rhyming Slang and the

00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:56.583
Rosetta Stone have in common’, and well, there is a theme that semi unites them all.

00:19:57.933 --> 00:20:00.493
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this

00:20:00.513 --> 00:20:03.513
episode, particularly for the Egyptian members out there.

00:20:03.983 --> 00:20:06.633
What do you think of the story of the Rosetta Stone?

00:20:06.933 --> 00:20:12.173
Should the stone remain in the British Museum, or should it be sent back to Egypt?

00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:14.123
I would love to know what you think.

00:20:14.553 --> 00:20:17.423

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds,

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:11.454
by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:15.744
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:19.594
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:25.134
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about scientific research.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:30.774
Millions of people around the world spend their lives researching and studying the

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:35.514
world around us, searching for cures for diseases, furthering our understanding

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.274
of the human body and delivering wonderful breakthroughs in the process.

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:44.804
But sometimes, they get it wrong, so in this episode we are going to look at

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:48.974
three different times when scientific breakthroughs and discoveries have been

00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:53.894
announced, only for it later to be revealed that it was all one big mistake.

00:00:55.502 --> 00:01:00.342
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and talk about Bad Science.

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:08.972
You may know that the most popular British newspaper by practically every metric is The Daily Mail.

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:13.692
It boasts a couple of million daily readers of its physical

00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:16.890
newspapers, swelling to three million on the weekend.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.440
And the Daily Mail website is incredibly popular, with almost 30 million

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.770
monthly readers in Britain, and hundreds of millions more worldwide.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.320
In fact it is the 125th most popular website in the World.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.490
People read The Daily Mail for all sorts of reasons, but it is

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.420
particularly happy to publish articles “revealing” medical discoveries.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.630
“A glass of wine a day is NOT good for your health”, it revealed in October of 2018.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.740
Then ”Drinking a small glass of red wine a day could help avoid age-related health problems

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.610
like diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease, study finds“, published in April of 2020

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.430
“Drinking two glasses of wine per day may LOWER chance of developing dementia”, in February of 2023.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.870
If you were to add up everything that The Daily Mail said studies proved would cause cancer,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.960
you’d have at least 116 different items, and you could probably find just as many articles

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.670
published in the same newspaper about the same items saying that they were good for your health.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.975
This has become a bit of a joke in British culture, but it does raise an interesting question about

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:50.005
the basis of scientific studies, and how the results are published and presented to the public.

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:56.945
Now, for the absence of doubt, this episode is not intended to suggest that any

00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:02.615
scientist is intentionally deceiving members of the public with a result of their study.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:08.665
Scientists and researchers do wonderful work, tirelessly furthering human

00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:13.939
understanding of everything from medicine to nutrition to the origins of the universe.

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:21.245
What’s more, the peer review process is an effective safeguard for low quality research.

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:27.245
To publish an article in a journal, you present your research methodology and results in detail.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:34.305
Then, other well-respected scientists have the chance to question and interrogate the process.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:40.195
This typically means that any scientific study that has large holes in

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:45.285
it, that has not been conducted in a thorough and correct manner will not

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:49.322
see the light of day, it will not be published in a reputable journal.

00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.962
Typically, but not always.

00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:59.082
So in this episode we are going to look at three occasions when this was not the case.

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:04.362
These are going to be, I hope, more on the lighthearted side.

00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:10.622
In our last episode, we covered the 1998 scandalous paper that drew a

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:16.342
link between the MMR vaccine and autism, which was an example of very bad

00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:21.662
science, and I should underline has been completely debunked and disproved.

00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:27.352
But don’t worry, in this episode we are going to talk about some slightly lighter material.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:32.372
So, with that disclaimer out of the way, let’s move forward with our

00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:37.492
first example, which comes with a scientific headline from 2012 that

00:04:37.492 --> 00:04:42.702
you might never have thought you would hear: “Einstein was wrong”.

00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:47.931
Albert Einstein was one of the most influential scientists in history,

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:52.571
and he would no doubt have been open to someone debating his theories.

00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:58.701
To say he was “wrong”, though, especially about some of his most famous theories,

00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:05.101
would have completely upended our understanding of space, time, and gravity.

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.521
But this was exactly what happened.

00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:15.231
In 2012, the European Council for Nuclear Research, which you might know

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:20.701
as CERN held a press conference to announce this groundbreaking news:

00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:27.481
researchers had found some neutrinos which had exceeded the speed of light.

00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:32.411
As you might know, the fact that nothing can go faster than

00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:36.591
light is a core part of Einstein’s theories of relativity.

00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:41.481
And this isn’t like saying “a cheetah is the fastest land

00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:44.471
animal in the world and there’s nothing faster than a cheetah”.

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:50.231
If an animal was discovered tomorrow that could run faster than a cheetah, nothing

00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:54.841
would happen, apart from there would probably be some great new nature documentaries.

00:05:55.891 --> 00:06:00.001
If it was suddenly discovered that something could travel faster than

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:05.361
light, it would completely change everything we believed about the universe.

00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:07.450
It would be a huge deal.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.000
So, what happened?

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.120
Well, the researchers said that they had fired beams of subatomic particles, called

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:25.110
neutrinos, through the ground from CERN to a lab in Gran Sasso, in Italy, 720 km away.

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:37.068
The speed of light is, as you may know, 299,792,458 metres per second, but

00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:43.798
these neutrinos got to the Gran Sasso lab faster than light would have.

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:51.018
To be precise, they got there sixty nanoseconds, that’s sixty billionths of a second

00:06:51.338 --> 00:06:55.388
earlier than they would have if they were travelling at the speed of light in a vacuum.

00:06:56.168 --> 00:07:00.644
Sixty billionths of a second might not sound like very much, but the

00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:04.314
important thing is that they were faster even by 1 billionth of a second.

00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:08.444
It seemed like all laws of physics were breaking down.

00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:16.854
And, to state the obvious, this was CERN, some of the smartest physicists in the world, this

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:23.134
wasn’t a backyard experiment with a random armchair scientist declaring “Einstein was wrong”.

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.534
Of course, it caused quite the reaction.

00:07:26.804 --> 00:07:30.464
It was all over the news, with some scientists even

00:07:30.464 --> 00:07:33.874
claiming that this proved time travel was possible.

00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:37.954
So, what happened, you’re probably wondering.

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:43.385
Initially it looked like there was nothing obviously wrong with the experiment,

00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:48.455
but it was later discovered that, similar to the reason that you might have had

00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:53.895
problems with your WiFi or your TV, there was a problem with the fibre optic cable.

00:07:54.785 --> 00:08:00.225
All was not lost; Einstein was not wrong, time travel is still not possible,

00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:04.745
there is no need to rethink our understanding of space, time and gravity.

00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:07.545
It all came down to a fault in the cable.

00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:13.755
But this wouldn’t be the first time that scientists have claimed that they were on the

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:18.925
cusp of a groundbreaking discovery, and one that would fundamentally change the world.

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:26.815
In 1989, two electrochemists at the University of Utah announced that they had managed

00:08:26.815 --> 00:08:33.205
to achieve “cold fusion”, a type of nuclear reaction that took place at room temperature.

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:40.945
This was groundbreaking because nuclear reactions, as you may know, were only believed

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:46.045
to be possible at incredibly high temperatures, in the tens of millions of degrees.

00:08:47.605 --> 00:08:50.675
Yes, they give off huge amounts of energy when they happen,

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:55.615
but it is expensive and dangerous to create a nuclear reaction.

00:08:56.965 --> 00:09:02.165
But these two scientists, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, claimed that they

00:09:02.165 --> 00:09:07.275
had managed to achieve this at room temperature, basically on a kitchen table.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.284
As they prepared to share their discovery with the

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:14.664
world, they anticipated the changes that it would bring.

00:09:15.464 --> 00:09:21.084
No longer would countries be dependent on oil from the Middle East or worried about pollution

00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:27.324
from power stations or global warming; these men had created a way for the universe’s most

00:09:27.374 --> 00:09:34.344
powerful source of energy to be harnessed at room temperature, from the comfort of one’s own home.

00:09:35.614 --> 00:09:37.364
It was going to be revolutionary.

00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:43.274
And the even better news was that the process was relatively simple.

00:09:44.194 --> 00:09:49.644
I’ll give you the simplified version here, but it essentially just involved passing

00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:56.744
electricity through heavy water, which is just modified water with a heavier form of hydrogen.

00:09:58.194 --> 00:10:01.534
You could do it on your kitchen table, and it would generate

00:10:01.564 --> 00:10:04.854
a nuclear reaction and give off huge amounts of energy.

00:10:05.704 --> 00:10:06.494
Crazy, right?

00:10:08.018 --> 00:10:12.178
And again, these weren't two random scientists; they

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:15.768
were reputable electrochemists, university researchers.

00:10:16.588 --> 00:10:19.908
They knew what they were doing, and they said that they had

00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:24.738
managed to achieve what had until then been thought unachievable.

00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:31.088
They decided to skip the typical peer review process, where a research

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:34.588
paper is shared with academic colleagues for comment and feedback.

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:39.978
Instead, they went straight to a press conference, such was

00:10:39.978 --> 00:10:43.048
the gravity of what they claimed that they had discovered.

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:48.208
Immediately scientists at other prestigious universities,

00:10:48.628 --> 00:10:53.568
such as Cal Tech and MIT rushed to recreate the experiment.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:59.108
After all, it was quick and easy, and could be done with

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:02.608
materials that any chemistry laboratory would have on hand.

00:11:03.388 --> 00:11:05.678
Verifying it should be a breeze.

00:11:07.218 --> 00:11:12.818
The problem was, try as they might, they could not recreate this

00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:16.948
“cold fusion” that Fleischmann and Pons had supposedly proved.

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:20.568
They tried, but they got very different results.

00:11:21.058 --> 00:11:25.738
And they tried again, and the result was the same, and the same, and the same.

00:11:27.168 --> 00:11:32.338
Soon enough, it became clear that Fleischmann and Pons had made some kind of large

00:11:32.338 --> 00:11:38.628
mistake with their experiment, and their names became bywords for “failed science”.

00:11:39.998 --> 00:11:46.548
Now, just in case this episode ages terribly, I should add that there are still some people

00:11:46.648 --> 00:11:52.228
who believe that Fleischmann and Pons were not mistaken, and that cold fusion is possible and

00:11:52.588 --> 00:11:59.098
one day will in fact change the world, but to date nobody has come anywhere near achieving it.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:05.084
Right, for our third and final example of bad science, we’re

00:12:05.084 --> 00:12:08.144
going to turn to everyone’s favourite subject: chocolate.

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:14.834
Well, perhaps not everyone’s favourite subject, but one that newspapers love to write stories about,

00:12:15.304 --> 00:12:21.364
especially when it comes to the links between chocolate and health: chocolate gives you cancer,

00:12:21.794 --> 00:12:28.414
chocolate prevents cancer, chocolate causes obesity, chocolate helps prevent obesity, and so on.

00:12:29.634 --> 00:12:35.564
In 2015, there was a groundbreaking discovery on the cover of the German Bild magazine.

00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:42.431
The story was about a group of German researchers who had “discovered” that people on a low

00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:50.051
carbohydrate diet would lose weight 10% faster if they ate a bar of chocolate every day.

00:12:51.597 --> 00:12:52.483
Amazing, right?

00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:57.783
You don’t necessarily associate eating a chocolate bar every day with losing

00:12:57.783 --> 00:13:03.863
weight, but this research definitively proved, or at least strongly suggested,

00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:09.543
that there was a positive correlation between eating chocolate and losing weight.

00:13:11.103 --> 00:13:16.013
Obviously, it was perfect news fodder, and the story was picked up by news

00:13:16.013 --> 00:13:21.113
outlets in 20 different countries across the world in half a dozen languages.

00:13:22.663 --> 00:13:29.683
And the story quoted the study’s lead author, Johannes Bohannon, Ph.D., research director of the

00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:35.293
Institute of Diet and Health, who said: “The best part is that you can buy chocolate everywhere.”

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:45.493
The problem was, Johannes Bohannon was not a German Ph.D, he was an American science journalist.

00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:52.933
And the Institute of Diet and Health, well, if it sounds made up, it is made

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:57.743
up, it was invented by the journalist, whose real name was John Bohannon.

00:13:59.253 --> 00:14:05.473
His intention with this story was to shine a light on quite how easy it is for

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:11.273
anyone to make outrageous claims and for serious newspapers and media companies

00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:16.508
to run with them without really interrogating the results or the methodology.

00:14:18.063 --> 00:14:23.033
In the case of this study on the link between chocolate and dieting, Johannes Bohannon,

00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:30.003
Ph.D, or rather John Bohannon, he did conduct a study, but if you look at what it actually

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:36.493
involved, I’m sure you’ll see that it wasn’t done to the most exacting of scientific standards.

00:14:38.063 --> 00:14:44.623
First, they chose a group of 15 people who were prepared to go onto a diet for three weeks.

00:14:45.523 --> 00:14:50.843
Then they divided the group into three, so 5 people in each group.

00:14:52.273 --> 00:14:55.363
One group followed a low carbohydrate diet.

00:14:56.233 --> 00:14:59.073
The other group followed the same low carbohydrate

00:14:59.073 --> 00:15:03.993
diet but also got a 42 gram bar of chocolate every day.

00:15:05.403 --> 00:15:09.583
And the final group were asked to make no changes to their

00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:12.703
normal diet - they did nothing different, essentially.

00:15:14.043 --> 00:15:17.863
Throughout the entire three weeks, the researchers measured the

00:15:17.863 --> 00:15:23.393
participants extensively: their sleep quality, weight, blood pressure,

00:15:23.513 --> 00:15:28.423
cholesterol, sodium, blood protein, they took all manner of measurements.

00:15:29.693 --> 00:15:34.683
Bohannon wasn’t sure exactly what would happen during the three weeks, but

00:15:34.993 --> 00:15:39.773
because there were only 5 people in each group, a tiny number, there was

00:15:39.913 --> 00:15:44.623
bound to be something that seemed different from one group to the next.

00:15:45.643 --> 00:15:51.323
Maybe it would be lower or higher cholesterol, maybe sleep quality, who knows,

00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:56.853
the point wasn’t to try to prove that chocolate helps you lose weight, the point

00:15:56.883 --> 00:16:02.673
was to try to show how even a poorly designed experiment can become “news”.

00:16:04.073 --> 00:16:05.353
And…it did.

00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:12.433
Bohannon found a medical journal that astonishingly had no peer review, so it

00:16:12.433 --> 00:16:17.653
was simply a case of submitting the piece and waiting for an editor to accept it.

00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:24.533
This only took 24 hours, but then the article was up, published.

00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:27.879
That was only the first step though.

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:33.749
Next Bohannon wrote a press release that he knew would be picked up by journalists,

00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:38.749
and included all of the facts and figures that he knew a journalist would want.

00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:48.185
And the result was exactly as he had hoped and feared; publications around the world, from Bild

00:16:48.185 --> 00:16:54.865
to Cosmopolitan to The Huffington Post ran with it, not doing any due diligence whatsoever.

00:16:56.373 --> 00:17:00.233
So, there we have it, three pieces of Bad Science.

00:17:00.883 --> 00:17:07.603
Einstein wasn’t wrong, Cold Fusion is still not possible, and if you had remembered

00:17:07.603 --> 00:17:12.083
reading somewhere that a bar of chocolate a day can help you lose weight, well, I’m

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:15.853
sorry to break it to you, but you can’t trust everything you read in the newspaper.

00:17:16.423 --> 00:17:18.613
Especially if it’s about chocolate.

00:17:21.143 --> 00:17:25.253
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Bad Science.

00:17:25.613 --> 00:17:28.683
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:29.493 --> 00:17:32.423
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:32.883 --> 00:17:36.503
What other stories are there about times when scientists got it wrong?

00:17:37.113 --> 00:17:40.513
Do you have papers like The Daily Mail in your country that seem to be

00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:45.533
constantly telling you that red wine or chocolate or sex are good or bad for you?

00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:48.863
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:17:49.293 --> 00:17:51.823

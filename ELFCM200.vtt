Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:17.012
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:21.442
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:26.252
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:30.142
Stéphane Breitwieser: The Greatest Art Thief of All Time.

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:35.322
This is actually part two of our three part series on Art Theft.

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:40.542
Part one was on five of the greatest art thefts of all time, where we covered

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:45.192
everything from the theft of the Mona Lisa right through to the theft of

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:50.112
a billion dollars’ worth of cultural relics from a museum in Mexico City.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:55.782
Then in Part three, which will be another one of our member-only episodes

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:59.922
and come out on Tuesday, we will talk about the single greatest art

00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:04.922
robbery of all time, the robbery of the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston.

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:10.822
But today we are talking about the greatest art thief of all time, or

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:14.942
at least the most prolific, and in my opinion, the most interesting.

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:18.192
A Frenchman called Stéphane Breitwieser.

00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:23.382
Over the course of a 6 year criminal career he stole almost

00:01:23.392 --> 00:01:27.722
a billion euros worth of art from museums all over Europe.

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:29.862
The strangest part of it all?

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:32.672
It’s that he never sold a single piece.

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:38.415
So, today we are going to learn about this man, how he committed these literally

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:43.635
hundreds of robberies, what he did with the stolen art, and most interestingly,

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:48.708
why he did what he did, and why he still can’t seem to stop doing it.

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:54.998
This has been one of my all-time favourite episodes to make, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:56.453 --> 00:02:01.343
OK then, Stéphane Breitwieser, The Greatest Art Thief of All Time.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:07.833
I should say that, unlike almost every other art thief, we know quite a lot

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:12.773
about the life of Stéphane Breitwieser, firstly because he has written a book

00:02:12.913 --> 00:02:18.883
about his life as an art thief and secondly given extensive interviews, so a

00:02:18.883 --> 00:02:23.853
lot of what you’ll hear about in today’s episode should be credited directly to

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:30.493
that, especially an excellent interview from 2019 with the American magazine GQ.

00:02:31.773 --> 00:02:38.513
So, in the last episode we talked about five of the main reasons that criminals steal art.

00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:43.443
Broadly they are, firstly, to sell on the black market to make money.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:51.123
Secondly, to be used as a sort of get-out-of-jail-free card, so that they can use it as a

00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:56.253
bargaining chip if they are caught by the police and accused of a different crime, they can

00:02:56.253 --> 00:03:02.983
say “hey, if you let me go I’ll tell you where you can find this Van Gogh, or this Monet”.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.743
Thirdly, as collateral in drug deals or to be used to get illegal loans.

00:03:10.653 --> 00:03:14.793
Fourth, out of a sense of patriotism, feeling that a

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.903
particular painting belongs in a particular country.

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:22.613
And finally, because they personally want the works of art.

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:30.043
In the case of Stéphane Breitwieser, there is little doubt that he falls into this fifth category.

00:03:30.823 --> 00:03:36.108
Over the course of six and a half years he stole 239 pieces of art

00:03:36.463 --> 00:03:43.423
from 172 different museums, an average of one theft every 14 days.

00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:49.413
Police estimate that the value of everything he stole was over a billion Euros.

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:55.833
But unlike most art thieves, he had zero interest in the pieces of art

00:03:56.013 --> 00:04:00.483
for their monetary value, he simply wanted to have them for himself.

00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:04.933
He never sold a single item, nor did he ever try.

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:12.953
And while you might now be imagining some glamorous French art thief who lived in a

00:04:12.963 --> 00:04:19.403
large chateau with beautiful art all over the walls, this was not how Breitwieser lived.

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:26.063
He lived with his mother in a nondescript house in an industrial city in Eastern

00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:31.043
France called Mulhouse, near the border with both Switzerland and Germany.

00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:38.773
Breitwieser hadn’t always lived here though, and this will be our first clue into his motivations.

00:04:39.623 --> 00:04:44.993
Until the age of 22 he had lived in more lavish surroundings.

00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:52.343
His parents both had well-paying jobs, and their house was filled with beautiful antique furniture.

00:04:53.483 --> 00:05:00.733
He had never been a particularly sociable child, and even as a teenager he preferred spending his

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:08.573
days at a museum among beautiful objects rather than doing more traditional teenager activities.

00:05:09.283 --> 00:05:14.313
Then when he was 22 years old, his world fell apart.

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.283
His parents divorced suddenly.

00:05:17.423 --> 00:05:19.223
The family house was sold.

00:05:19.473 --> 00:05:25.233
His father moved out, taking all of the beautiful antique furniture with him.

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:30.759
Breitweiser stayed with his mother, and they were forced to replace the

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:36.269
lovely furniture that he had grown up around with modern, cheaper furniture.

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:43.329
For Breitweiser, he felt like he had been robbed, that he deserved to live

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:49.079
around beautiful things, and suddenly he was living like, well, a normal person.

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.409
It was at around the same time of his parents' divorce that he met a woman who would

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.389
become his chief accomplice, his chief partner in crime, Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:08.479
They fell in love, and before long Kleinklaus had moved in with Breitweiser and his mother.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:16.329
Kleinklaus and Breitweiser were, in many ways, two peas in a pod, they were very similar characters.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.669
Both were introverted and passionate about museums

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:23.789
and the beautiful objects that were kept inside them.

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:30.409
One day, Breitweiser and Kleinklaus were visiting a museum in the small village

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.119
of Thann, in eastern France and very close to where they lived in Mulhouse.

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.539
And it was to be in this small village museum that he would

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:47.419
complete the transition from legal art admirer to illegal art thief.

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.939
In the interview with GQ magazine, Breitweiser describes

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.669
his feelings as he was about to commit his first crime.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.849
In the museum he spotted an antique pistol, an old antique gun.

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:07.149
Instead of thinking, what a lovely pistol, his first

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:11.669
thought was that he should have one of those for himself.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.659
His father had a collection of antique pistols, but when

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.389
his parents divorced his father had taken them all with him.

00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:25.389
Breitwieser knew that he shouldn’t steal it, but he couldn’t resist it.

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:30.219
He wanted it so badly, and it seemed like he wouldn’t be caught.

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.199
There were no cameras, no guards, no alarms.

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:38.309
He was carrying a backpack, and it would be very easy

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:42.039
to just pick up the pistol and carry it away with him.

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:49.609
He asked Kleinklaus what he should do, and she encouraged him, saying “Go on, take it”.

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:55.499
He picked it up, put it in his backpack, and calmly walked out of the museum.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.459
Now when you hear the term “the greatest art thief of all time”,

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:04.699
this is probably not how you imagine the thefts to happen.

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:09.749
In the last episode we heard about thieves rushing into galleries

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:14.329
with machine guns or smashing windows and running away with paintings.

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:17.419
Breitweiser never did any of this.

00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:22.749
He was, in almost every way, an unusual art thief.

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:30.069
He never snuck into a museum, he never made his way into a museum or gallery without permission.

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.679
He would buy a ticket and just go in.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.969
He never used violence, and never threatened anyone.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:44.049
The only guns he had were antiques, and they were purely for display purposes.

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:50.729
He never used disguise, fake moustaches, masks, or stockings over his face.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.589
He would wear his normal clothes.

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:58.979
He didn’t even wear gloves, and he didn’t seem worried about leaving fingerprints.

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:05.459
Unusual for the greatest art thief of all time, but he certainly knew what he was doing.

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:09.809
He would meticulously research the objects that he

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:13.099
wanted to take, and the museums they were located in.

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:18.989
He knew when guards would change, he knew which cameras were real and which were

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:25.139
fake, he knew how to take objects out of their cases, and he knew never to steal

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:30.989
any incredibly valuable object, because that was a surefire way of being caught.

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:36.229
He also had a valuable and loyal accomplice: Kleinklaus.

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:41.909
While Breitweiser was stealing an object, Kleinklaus would stand by

00:09:41.909 --> 00:09:46.109
a door, pretending to be looking at another object in the gallery.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:51.949
If anyone was coming into the room she would cough, and

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:55.119
Breitweiser would immediately stop what he was doing.

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:59.629
These thefts would often take a long time.

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:06.669
Breitweiser would find the object of his desires, but it might be locked in a glass cabinet.

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:12.239
A violent thief might just smash the glass and run out

00:10:12.249 --> 00:10:15.269
of the gallery with the object, but not Breitweiser.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:20.629
He carried a little Swiss Army Knife on him with a screwdriver

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:25.542
on it, and would unscrew the glass case and remove the object.

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:31.832
Of course, this would often take some time, so he would start turning the screwdriver,

00:10:32.102 --> 00:10:37.482
then Kleinklaus would hear someone coming and cough, Breitweiser would move

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:42.782
away from the object, and only return to it when the person had left the room.

00:10:43.722 --> 00:10:50.552
He would purposefully choose smaller, less popular museums, and less famous works of art.

00:10:51.492 --> 00:10:58.302
Fewer people meant the actual theft was easier, because it was more common to find a room empty.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:04.042
And less famous works of art meant firstly that they weren’t as well protected,

00:11:04.392 --> 00:11:09.922
be it security guards, alarm systems, or being locked away behind difficult

00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:15.852
to open protective cases, but it also meant that in many cases the gallery

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:21.412
wouldn’t find out about the theft until several days after it had taken place.

00:11:22.122 --> 00:11:27.188
As we heard about in the last episode on the Greatest Art Thefts of All Time, and

00:11:27.358 --> 00:11:33.028
if you know the story of the Mona Lisa theft, works of art are often removed from

00:11:33.028 --> 00:11:38.168
their normal places because they are given out on loan to other galleries, or

00:11:38.268 --> 00:11:43.598
they are taken away for restoration, maintenance, or to be studied by collectors.

00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:49.208
Galleries aren’t always very good at keeping track of the pieces of art inside them.

00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:54.408
Breitwieser knew this all too well, and sometimes would even bring

00:11:54.408 --> 00:11:59.008
with him little paper cards saying “Objects removed for study”.

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:06.398
After he removed a precious object he would replace it with one of these cards, so that the museum

00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:13.808
guards would see the object missing, but reasonably assume that it had been legitimately removed.

00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:20.308
In this extensive interview with GQ magazine he recounts the story of using

00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:25.228
this tactic, then returning to the museum he had stolen from two weeks

00:12:25.228 --> 00:12:30.468
later and seeing the empty case still there, complete with the cards saying

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:36.408
“Objects removed for study” - two weeks later and the museum hadn’t noticed.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:41.748
Within a few years Breitweiser and Kleinklaus' stolen collection

00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:46.798
contained over a hundred unique pieces of art, and the only two people

00:12:46.978 --> 00:12:51.648
who knew of its existence were Breitwieser and Kleinklaus themselves.

00:12:52.488 --> 00:12:57.558
It’s not even clear if Breitwieser’s mother, who has never spoken publicly

00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:03.248
about her son, it’s not even clear if she knew exactly what her son was doing.

00:13:04.248 --> 00:13:11.028
Perhaps one of the great ironies of this was that, although they had stolen hundreds of millions

00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:17.298
of Euros worth of art, they were broke, they were poor, they were always struggling for money.

00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:25.968
To pay for normal life, food, petrol, museum tickets, Breitwieser worked occasionally as a waiter.

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:32.958
He describes deciding how to get to an art fair in Zurich, where he plans to

00:13:33.128 --> 00:13:38.468
walk away with hundreds of thousands of Euros in stolen art, but he plans his

00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:43.928
journey to avoid toll roads, to avoid travelling on roads he has to pay for.

00:13:44.798 --> 00:13:49.388
Indeed, Breitweiser is certainly considered in a very different category

00:13:49.618 --> 00:13:53.978
to the kind of thief who breaks into a museum with a gun, and then

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:57.658
rolls up a painting under their arm to sell to the highest bidder.

00:13:58.548 --> 00:14:05.178
Breitwieser was, and still is, as we’ll find out, hopelessly addicted to art theft.

00:14:05.508 --> 00:14:07.278
He simply couldn’t stop.

00:14:07.837 --> 00:14:14.027
Whether it was the actual act of stealing that gave him such a thrill or the fact that he

00:14:14.037 --> 00:14:21.052
wanted to possess the art for himself, it is anyone’s guess, but he simply could not stop.

00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:26.232
The risk of being caught didn’t seem to bother him in the slightest.

00:14:26.752 --> 00:14:31.212
He had multiple close encounters with the police: policemen giving him a

00:14:31.232 --> 00:14:36.862
parking ticket as he returned to his car with stolen artwork, and accidentally

00:14:36.962 --> 00:14:40.962
breaking a glass container when he was trying to remove a work of art.

00:14:42.052 --> 00:14:47.162
It was only in 1997, two years after his first theft, that he

00:14:47.162 --> 00:14:51.642
had his closest call, his most serious encounter with the law.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.760
When visiting a gallery in Lucerne, Switzerland, the pair was actually arrested.

00:14:58.922 --> 00:15:03.802
Breitwieser was seen by a museum employee walking out with a painting

00:15:03.812 --> 00:15:08.202
under his arm; they were both stopped and taken to a police station.

00:15:09.152 --> 00:15:12.492
They managed to persuade the police officers that this was

00:15:12.492 --> 00:15:16.132
their first time stealing, and the policemen believed them.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:20.622
Their fingerprints were taken, and they were released without charge.

00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:25.771
This was the first time they had ever actually been caught,

00:15:26.162 --> 00:15:29.352
and they couldn’t believe their luck at having been released.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:33.302
Of course, over the previous couple of years after all of

00:15:33.302 --> 00:15:37.562
his prior thefts, galleries had reported them to the police.

00:15:38.052 --> 00:15:43.922
But because the galleries they chose to rob tended to have quite poor security,

00:15:44.232 --> 00:15:50.112
often with no security cameras, and in many cases the galleries didn’t know exactly

00:15:50.162 --> 00:15:56.402
when the works of art had been stolen, the police didn’t have any real idea who

00:15:56.612 --> 00:16:02.482
Breitwieser and Kleinklaus were, or the scale of the theft that they had committed.

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.252
Now, things were different.

00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:09.272
The Swiss police had their fingerprints, and if they were

00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:12.452
caught again they could be linked back to this crime.

00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:15.862
The situation was certainly more serious.

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:22.022
They promised each other never to return to Switzerland, and Kleinklaus made Breitwieser

00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:27.242
promise to always wear gloves in the future, so that he left no fingerprints.

00:16:28.432 --> 00:16:36.582
Breitwieser agreed to do so, but the scale and boldness of his thefts only continued to increase.

00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:41.522
He seemed to not care any more, to think he was invincible.

00:16:42.422 --> 00:16:46.552
And tensions were growing between Breitwieser and Kleinklaus.

00:16:47.002 --> 00:16:52.582
She was hoping to start a family, to live an honest life, to be normal.

00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:56.972
But he showed no sign of wanting to change.

00:16:57.852 --> 00:17:02.272
In November of 2001, he returned home and admitted to

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:06.042
having done what they had both sworn never to do again.

00:17:07.262 --> 00:17:11.622
He had stolen a musical instrument called a bugle from a museum

00:17:11.962 --> 00:17:16.492
in Switzerland, and he admitted that he didn’t use gloves.

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:22.682
His fingerprints would be all over the case, and if the police were called and they

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:27.997
took fingerprints, it would be linked straight back to Breitwieser and Kleinklaus.

00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:30.442
They rushed back to the museum.

00:17:30.812 --> 00:17:35.002
Kleinklaus said that it was too risky for Breitwieser to go into the

00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:39.782
scene of the crime, and that he should wait outside in their car.

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:45.442
She went into the museum with products to wipe off the fingerprints,

00:17:46.022 --> 00:17:50.062
but Breitwieser didn't obey his orders to stay in the car.

00:17:50.852 --> 00:17:54.742
He stepped out, walked around the museum, trying to

00:17:54.752 --> 00:17:58.362
look inside to see how Kleinklaus was getting on.

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:03.552
Unknown to Breitwieser, there was a man walking his dog outside

00:18:03.552 --> 00:18:07.372
the museum who had read about the theft in the newspaper.

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:15.112
He went inside, mentioned to the person behind the desk that there was a man acting suspiciously,

00:18:15.522 --> 00:18:20.902
the person recognised Breitwieser, the police were called and Breitwieser was arrested.

00:18:22.062 --> 00:18:26.212
Crucially, Kleinklaus is not arrested, she isn’t even linked

00:18:26.252 --> 00:18:29.992
to Breitwieser, and so she is able to travel back home.

00:18:31.032 --> 00:18:36.842
He first denies everything, but later admits to the bugle, saying that he

00:18:36.842 --> 00:18:41.252
had no money and only wanted to give his mother a nice Christmas present.

00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:46.782
The police then link Breitwieser to the previous crime four years ago.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:54.182
Suddenly the police realise that perhaps he isn't just a small-time thief trying his luck.

00:18:55.502 --> 00:18:59.022
Breitwieser denies that he is anything more than an

00:18:59.022 --> 00:19:02.352
opportunist thief, but the police don’t believe him.

00:19:02.822 --> 00:19:06.632
They manage to get an international search warrant to search

00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:10.392
his house in France, to see if the stolen art is there.

00:19:11.392 --> 00:19:16.422
Four weeks after his arrest, the police arrive at Breitwieser’s mother’s house.

00:19:16.802 --> 00:19:20.072
They are shown to Breitwieser’s room in the attic.

00:19:20.552 --> 00:19:27.822
They open the door, no doubt waiting expectantly, but the room is completely empty apart from a bed.

00:19:28.562 --> 00:19:34.262
The true extent of Breitwieser’s crimes are still hidden to the police, but he is

00:19:34.262 --> 00:19:39.912
kept in police custody, he is held in the police station for another month and a half.

00:19:40.542 --> 00:19:46.702
He becomes desperate, and when he is taken in for further questioning, he starts to crumble.

00:19:47.902 --> 00:19:53.702
The detective shows Breitwieser a picture of a medal, telling him that he knows he stole it.

00:19:54.522 --> 00:19:55.822
Breitwieser admits to it.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:20:01.012
Then the detective pulls out another pile of pictures of stolen goods.

00:20:01.672 --> 00:20:07.902
He puts them in front of Breitwieser, and one by one Breitwieser admits to stealing all of them.

00:20:08.882 --> 00:20:13.912
It turns out that they had been found in a canal near Breitwieser’s mother’s house.

00:20:14.932 --> 00:20:20.512
What detectives now believe happened is that Kleinklaus returned home after Breitwieser was

00:20:20.522 --> 00:20:28.212
arrested, confessed everything to Breitwieser’s mother, and the pair of them took all of the

00:20:28.222 --> 00:20:35.392
stolen works of art and essentially threw them away, they tried to hide the evidence of the thefts.

00:20:36.122 --> 00:20:40.582
Some were thrown in a canal, others in a forest, and

00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:44.322
many paintings were cut up and left in rubbish bags.

00:20:45.372 --> 00:20:52.652
To this day, it’s not clear exactly how much has ever been recovered, and estimates are that around

00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:59.672
60% of the works that Breitwieser and Kleinklaus stole were destroyed or damaged beyond repair.

00:21:00.872 --> 00:21:06.942
After spending four years in a Swiss jail, Breitwieser spent another two and a half in France.

00:21:07.752 --> 00:21:11.132
His mother was sentenced to three years for destroying

00:21:11.132 --> 00:21:14.752
the artwork, but she only served half of her sentence.

00:21:16.172 --> 00:21:22.042
And as for Kleinklaus, she was sentenced to 18 months but only served six.

00:21:23.162 --> 00:21:27.612
If you were thinking that Breitwieser had probably learned his

00:21:27.612 --> 00:21:31.852
lesson, and his days of stealing art were behind him, you’d be wrong.

00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:38.612
In 2011, only a few years after being released from prison, police found another

00:21:38.912 --> 00:21:44.542
30 pieces of stolen art, and he was sent back to prison for another three years.

00:21:45.192 --> 00:21:50.012
After he got out from his second time in prison, he was being watched closely by the

00:21:50.012 --> 00:21:56.482
police, but yet again he was caught, this time trying to sell stolen art on eBay.

00:21:57.162 --> 00:22:02.502
Tragically, this arrest came in February 2019, the same month as the

00:22:02.502 --> 00:22:07.982
extended interview with him in GQ magazine, which described how he

00:22:07.982 --> 00:22:12.942
wept, he cried profusely, about not being able to steal ever again.

00:22:14.262 --> 00:22:20.652
It seems that Stéphane Breitwieser, despite being the world’s best known art thief and being

00:22:20.652 --> 00:22:27.192
responsible for the thefts of over a billion Euros worth of art, just simply cannot stop.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:37.210
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Stéphane Breitwieser: The Greatest Art Thief of All Time.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:43.080
As a quick reminder, this was part two of our three-part series on Art Theft.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.700
In part one we went through five of the most famous art thefts of all

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:52.270
time, and in part three, which will be coming out next, we’ll learn about

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.360
the amazing story of the The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Robbery.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.390
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.140
Breitwieser was obviously a thief and a criminal.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.160
But there is debate about the severity of his crimes.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:17.500
He stole a billion Euros of art, but he wasn’t trying to sell it, he simply wanted it for himself.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.710
Does this change how we view his crime?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.360
Does this make it worse, better, or does it simply not matter?

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.340
I would love to know what you think.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.830

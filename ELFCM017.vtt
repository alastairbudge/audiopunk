Hello and welcome to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:09.356
English.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:10.876
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:16.766
Today it is part two of our mini series on British food.

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:23.546
If you missed the first part, we talked about the strange history of the British oyster.

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:31.016
It's not something that you might have associated normally with Britain, perhaps, but 200 years ago

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:38.066
Londoners were eating an average of one oyster per day, and they were handed out for free outside

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.636
pubs.

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:46.286
We also talked about one fateful evening that caused the huge decline of the oyster industry in

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:50.816
Britain and cost several nobles their lives.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:56.216
So if that sounds interesting, then make sure you have a listen to episode one of this mini series.

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:01.466
But today we are not talking about oysters anymore.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.686
We're onto something else.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.656
Something you might be more familiar with.

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:11.336
Yes, it's a British classic - fish and chips.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.500
Before we get our hands too greasy though with the history of fish and chips, I just want to remind

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.790
those of you listening to this podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or whatever podcast app you might

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.268
be listening to this on that you can find the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast on the

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:34.888
website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:41.643
The transcripts and key vocabulary can be a huge help for following the podcast and expanding your

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:45.513
vocabulary, so it's definitely worth checking that out as an option.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.973
Okay then, fish and chips.

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:56.361
If you're thinking boring, not another Brit claiming to talk about something new and interesting,

00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:00.136
but all he's talking about is fish and chips, don't worry.

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:05.926
I promise that this is going to be more interesting than someone telling you that fish and chips are

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.306
popular in the UK.

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:14.116
Today we are going to be looking at the story behind the dish, behind fish and chips.

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:22.226
As you'll find out, it's pretty interesting and there's a lot to suggest that it's not really that

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.666
British after all.

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:31.478
That being said, fish and chips have a special place in every Brit's heart.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.294
Winston Churchill, the famous wartime prime minister, called them "the good companions".

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:47.144
The Beatle, John Lennon, smothered his in tomato ketchup and even Michael Jackson was famous for

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:49.604
enjoying his with mushy peas.

00:02:51.584 --> 00:02:59.354
For generations, fish and chips have fed millions of memories - eaten with greasy fingers on a

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:06.644
seaside holiday, a payday treat at the end of the working week, or a late night supper on the way

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.784
home from the pub.

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:14.914
It has even been suggested that fish and chips helped win World War One.

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:22.537
According to Professor John Walton, who is the author of a book called Fish and Chips and The

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:28.957
British Working Class, the government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips a priority.

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:38.083
He said the cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart, unlike the

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:44.593
German regime that failed to keep its people well fed, and that was one of the reasons why Germany

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:45.403
was defeated.

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.249
He continued to say, historians can sometimes be a bit snooty about these things, but fish and chips

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:59.339
played a big part in bringing contentment and staving off disaffection.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.109
Basically, he says people were more willing to tolerate the pretty terrible situation that they were

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.229
in, if they had small home comforts, things like fish and chips.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:21.014
George Orwell, who you may know as the author of books like Animal Farm and 1984, in his book, The

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:28.484
Road To Wigan Pier, which came out in 1937, he put fish and chips first among the home comforts that

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:33.614
helped keep the masses happy and according to him, averted revolution.

00:04:34.764 --> 00:04:41.734
Such was the perceived importance of keeping these home comforts alive, that during World War Two

00:04:42.394 --> 00:04:49.014
ministers bent over backwards, they did everything they could, to make sure that fish and chips were

00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:52.504
one of the few foods that was never rationed.

00:04:54.269 --> 00:05:00.059
But enough about the impact that fish and chips had and the importance that they have for British

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.539
people.

00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.884
Where did they actually come from?

00:05:03.544 --> 00:05:09.064
When and how did they get to this iconic position in every Brit's heart?

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:16.964
Well, let's start with chips because, and I know that this might be a controversial statement to

00:05:16.964 --> 00:05:19.844
make, but chips aren't the main part of the dish.

00:05:20.464 --> 00:05:25.504
I'm sorry to those of you listening out there that may disagree, but there you go, I've said it,

00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:28.144
chips aren't the main bit of fish and chips.

00:05:28.984 --> 00:05:30.544
Anyway, chips.

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:32.554
Where did they come from?

00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:40.984
In fact, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that they actually have French origins, or at least a

00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:42.244
continental past.

00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:50.584
The story of the humble chip goes back to the 17th century, to either Belgium or France, depending

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:51.634
on who you believe.

00:05:52.577 --> 00:06:00.480
Oddly enough, it's believed that the chip may have been invented as a substitute for fish rather

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.010
than an accompaniment.

00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:10.479
When rivers would freeze over and no fish could be caught, resourceful housewives began cutting

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:16.719
potatoes into fishy shapes and frying them as an alternative to fish.

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:26.829
At around the same time, fried fish was introduced to Britain by Jewish refugees from Portugal and

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:35.194
Spain who adapted an original recipe for fish that was coated in breadcrumbs and cooked on Fridays,

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.629
to be eaten cold on Shabbat, on the Saturday.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:48.679
Given the antisemitism at the time in Britain and the requirement for Jewish people to behave like

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:55.017
Christians, these Jewish immigrants used to fry the fish on a Friday to look like good Christians,

00:06:55.287 --> 00:07:00.087
then they would eat it cold the day after, in accordance with the Jewish tradition.

00:07:01.764 --> 00:07:10.729
But who first had the bright idea to marry, to put together, fish with chips remains the subject of

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.289
fierce controversy and we will probably never know for sure.

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:25.113
It's safe to say it was somewhere in England, but arguments rage over whether it was up North or

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:25.713
down South.

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:31.459
Some people credit a Northern entrepreneur called John Lees.

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:40.219
As early as 1863 it is believed he was selling fish and chips out of a wooden hut at Mossley Market

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:42.889
in industrial Lancashire in the North of England.

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:50.789
Others claim that the first combined fish and chip shop was actually opened by a Jewish immigrant,

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:54.400
Joseph Mullin, in East London, around 1860.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:02.620
They say it was him who had the genius idea of putting fried potatoes, chips, together with the

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.680
fried fish that was eaten by Jewish immigrants in Britain.

00:08:06.462 --> 00:08:13.872
Whoever actually did invent it, it caught on like wildfire, it became incredibly popular, very

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:14.382
quickly.

00:08:15.654 --> 00:08:23.454
Diets in 1860 for working people were boring, and fish and chips were a tasty deviation from the

00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:23.874
norm.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:31.049
Immigrants, especially Italian immigrants who were passing through English towns and cities, saw the

00:08:31.049 --> 00:08:37.949
growing queues outside fish and chip shops, and they sensed a business opportunity, so they set up

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:42.269
shops in Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, all over.

00:08:43.594 --> 00:08:49.324
By the 1920s there were 35,000 fish and chip shops across Britain.

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:55.354
So that's almost one per thousand people, and that's just in the course of over 50 years.

00:08:55.684 --> 00:09:01.054
So if you're doing the arithmetic, if you're doing the calculations in your head, that's about two

00:09:01.084 --> 00:09:03.484
new fish and chip shops every day.

00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:10.835
On a linguistic note, a fish and chip shop in the UK is normally just shortened to chippy.

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:15.815
So if you hear someone saying, let's go to the chippy, this is what they mean.

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:22.787
Of course, the fact that fish and chips are pretty tasty meant that there was this huge demand for

00:09:22.787 --> 00:09:24.527
fish and chips across the UK.

00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:30.387
But what other factors meant that it soon became such a nationwide staple?

00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:39.307
Well, firstly, the advent of trawl fishing, so this means boats going along with huge nets

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:43.882
underneath them, which meant they could catch far more fish than before.

00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:48.798
Fish suddenly became a lot cheaper and a lot more widely available.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:56.755
Secondly, though, the railways meant that this fish could quickly be transported inland.

00:09:57.174 --> 00:10:04.032
Remember, although commercial refrigerators existed at the time, they were still very expensive, and

00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:11.112
so being able to quickly transport the fish to the cities inland where it was to be consumed meant

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:15.252
that suddenly a whole new section of the country could be opened up.

00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:25.227
To keep prices down, fish and chips were wrapped in old newspaper, a practice that survived as late

00:10:25.227 --> 00:10:26.247
as the 1980s.

00:10:26.937 --> 00:10:33.987
But then it was ruled unsafe for food to come into contact with the ink from newspapers without

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.297
greaseproof paper in between.

00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:43.593
Newspaper ink, as you may know, is full of all sorts of chemicals that you really don't want in your

00:10:43.593 --> 00:10:44.103
stomach.

00:10:44.613 --> 00:10:50.313
And now most fish and chips, most portions of fish and chips, will come wrapped in some sort of

00:10:50.493 --> 00:10:51.243
brown paper.

00:10:52.143 --> 00:10:59.103
If you see fish and chips wrapped in newspaper now, you're probably in a very touristy place as it

00:10:59.103 --> 00:11:07.443
won't be real newspaper, it'll be special greaseproof stuff specifically made for fish and chips, or

00:11:07.443 --> 00:11:10.743
should I say specifically made for tourists.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:19.354
Nowadays, the number of fish and chip shops, of chippies, has plummeted and there are only about

00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:21.484
10,000 throughout the UK.

00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:28.482
Brits now have a plethora of fast food options to choose from, although a portion of fish and chips

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:35.472
always holds a special place in every self-respecting Brit's heart - there's really nothing quite

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:36.012
like it.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.660
So next time you find yourself in a conversation about British food, and someone mentions the cliché

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:50.185
of fish and chips, you'll be able to tell them the story behind it, and you'll know that it's not

00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:52.315
quite so British after all.

00:11:53.536 --> 00:11:59.476
Right, as always, if you have enjoyed this episode, please feel free to share with friends, family

00:11:59.476 --> 00:12:03.826
members, colleagues, classmates, or anyone else who may be interested.

00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:08.596
The more people who listen to the podcast, then the better it'll get for everyone.

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:14.491
And if you have thoughts, feedback, or anything you want to say, any feedback about the podcast,

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:16.201
then I'd love to hear from you.

00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:21.631
Just email hi, Hi@leonardoenglish.com and I'll get straight back to you.

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:28.381
Next up, we'll be taking a long look at the English breakfast at the fry up.

00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:36.751
We'll talk about how and why English breakfasts became so massive and how they made the transition

00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:43.786
from food of the aristocracy, of lords and ladies, to the way that the working man would start the

00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:43.981
day.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:50.341
Until then, you've been listening to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:50.881
English.

00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:55.411
I'm Alastair Budge and I will catch you in the next episode.

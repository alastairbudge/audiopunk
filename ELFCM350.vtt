Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.510
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.579
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.439
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.850
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.940
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.060
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.369
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.290
we are going to be talking about

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.780
The Unusual Names of Cocktails.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.190
Now, you might be the sort of person

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.049
who thinks of themselves as something

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:33.400
of a cocktail connoisseur, able

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.610
to make the perfect Negroni or Tom

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.610
Collins without a second thought.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.360
Or you might never have drunk

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.390
a drop of alcohol in your life.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.050
Whatever side of the cocktail

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.360
love/hate spectrum you would place

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.610
yourself, it’s hard to deny that the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.060
history of cocktails is fascinating.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.139
These drinks often come with amazing

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.690
backstories, and in this episode

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.680
we are going to explore the history

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.629
of cocktails overall, and dive into

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.910
the stories of some of the most

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.220
interesting, from the Margarita

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:07.380
right through to the Singapore Sling.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.929
Along the way we’ll meet Ice

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.730
Kings, zealous queens, and more.

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:16.276
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:20.736
If you look up the word “cocktail” in a

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:22.856
dictionary, you’ll find something like

00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:25.916
“an alcoholic drink consisting of a spirit

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.566
or spirits mixed with other ingredients,

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.576
such as fruit juice or cream.”

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:34.706
This term, “cocktail”, was first recorded

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:38.586
in 1798, but the concept of a cocktail,

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.976
or at least of adding tasty things to

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.296
alcohol, has existed for millennia.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.326
For better or worse, humans practically

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:49.516
since the dawn of time have enjoyed the

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.216
feeling that comes from drinking alcohol.

00:01:52.676 --> 00:01:54.956
Alcohol, after all, is a drug,

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:57.106
it does change the way you feel.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.296
And while the effects of alcohol

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.516
are considered pleasant by many,

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:04.466
the taste of alcohol itself

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:06.706
is not so universally enjoyed.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.146
So, going back thousands of years, people

00:02:10.156 --> 00:02:12.296
have looked for ways to make the process

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:14.436
of drinking alcohol more pleasant.

00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:17.306
Going back to the ancient Greeks,

00:02:17.516 --> 00:02:19.056
there are records of honey and

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.886
spices being added to wine.

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.736
All over the world, people would add

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.009
all sorts of things to their wine

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.019
and beer to try to make the taste

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.009
more palatable, to camouflage the

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.819
taste of the alcohol in the drink.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.299
With the discovery of spices and more

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.029
widespread availability of sugar, this

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.239
all started to go into wine and beer,

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.869
which, let’s remember, were often drunk

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.239
pretty much constantly in large parts of

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.649
Europe as safer alternatives to water.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.499
When distillation started to become

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.692
more widespread, when the technique of

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:57.052
producing spirits, stronger alcohol,

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:59.242
reached Europe, clearly there was

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:01.852
an even greater need to disguise

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:03.982
the taste of this stronger alcohol.

00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:07.952
And while the US is probably the country

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:10.612
most associated with cocktails, the

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:13.122
first “cocktail” is widely believed

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:15.002
to be something called “punch”,

00:03:15.232 --> 00:03:17.582
which is thought to have been created

00:03:17.642 --> 00:03:19.752
by a British soldier in India.

00:03:21.312 --> 00:03:23.672
You might know a “punch” now as a big

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:26.282
bowl of alcohol with various fruit

00:03:26.312 --> 00:03:28.982
juices, and back in the 17th century,

00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:31.312
when the first record of punch can be

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:34.592
found, it met this modern criteria.

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:37.992
It was, and I’m quoting directly, "a

00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:40.522
kind of drink consisting of aqua vitae,

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:43.542
rose-water, juice of citrons and sugar."

00:03:44.192 --> 00:03:44.982
It was a cocktail.

00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:48.642
Now, punch has its own fascinating

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:50.572
history, but we must move on.

00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.652
And to continue our exploration of

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:55.602
the unusual names of cocktails, we

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.922
must cross the Atlantic to the United

00:03:57.922 --> 00:04:00.112
States, the country that is now

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:02.092
synonymous with cocktail drinking.

00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:05.532
And before we get into the stories

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.852
of the cocktails themselves, I must

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:10.702
introduce you to a peculiar character,

00:04:10.972 --> 00:04:14.112
a man by the name of Fredric Tudor.

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.452
He was born in Boston, Massachusetts,

00:04:17.602 --> 00:04:22.722
in 1783, and by his death, in 1864 he

00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:25.032
would have pioneered the transport and

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:28.122
sale of ice all over the world, earning

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:30.782
himself the nickname of “the Ice King”.

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:34.252
From a young age, he was convinced

00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:36.162
that there was a fortune to be made

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.562
in transporting ice from the ponds

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:40.942
of New England, in the northeast of

00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:42.602
the United States, to the rest of the

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:45.362
country, to  warmer areas without ice.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.602
He decided not to go to Harvard,

00:04:48.862 --> 00:04:50.822
and instead, he focussed on what

00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:52.822
must have seemed like a mad dream,

00:04:53.262 --> 00:04:56.062
transporting ice in the days before

00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:58.152
widespread artificial refrigeration.

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:01.732
He cut huge blocks of ice out of

00:05:01.732 --> 00:05:05.002
frozen ponds, loaded them up on large

00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:07.592
ships, and tried everything he could

00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:10.292
to stop the ice melting before it

00:05:10.322 --> 00:05:12.152
arrived at ports to the south of the

00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:14.552
country, and even in the Caribbean.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:18.089
Covering the ice in wood shavings

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.149
was one idea, building a sort

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:22.159
of roof over it was another.

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:26.089
Eventually, after multiple iterations,

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:29.349
improving the insulation and buying faster

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.879
ships, he was able to transport 180 tonnes

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.299
of ice all the way to Calcutta, in India.

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.719
His ice empire was born, and

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.419
he became one of the richest

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.219
men in America in the process.

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:46.639
Now, bringing this back to cocktails,

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:49.459
why was he important, why do we need

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.359
to know the story of the Ice King?

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.609
Well, because cocktails need ice.

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.699
Practically every modern cocktail comes

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.179
with some form of ice, and cocktails

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.919
are much more palatable when drunk cold.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.351
So, you could say, there could be

00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:08.841
no cocktails without the Ice King.

00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:12.371
But there were a couple of other important

00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.451
innovations we need to mention that made

00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:16.501
widespread cocktail drinking possible.

00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.581
Firstly, artificial carbonation,

00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.191
making drinks fizzy.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.571
This happened in 1767, by a man

00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:27.645
called Jacob Schweppe, yes, that

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:29.365
is where “Schweppes” comes from.

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:33.865
And secondly, in 1826, something

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.828
called “continuous distillation”,

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.065
which was essentially the process

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.216
to make producing spirits, strong

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:42.036
alcohol, much more efficient.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.226
So, by the mid-19th century, the US

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:48.496
had all of the ingredients required

00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:52.406
for a cocktail boom: ice, fizzy drinks,

00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:55.106
strong alcohol, and a heavy drinking

00:06:55.106 --> 00:06:57.886
culture, a very thirsty population.

00:06:58.526 --> 00:07:00.786
So thirsty, in fact, that it would lead

00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:04.206
to the 1919 Volstead Act, and Prohibition,

00:07:04.396 --> 00:07:06.466
the 13-year period at the start of

00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:09.076
the 20th century when practically all

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:11.246
alcohol was banned in the United States.

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:13.126
By the way, if you haven’t

00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:14.216
listened to our episode on

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:16.853
Prohibition yet, that’s number 261.

00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:19.466
Now, back to cocktails.

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:21.606
Ever since the end of Prohibition,

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.706
in 1933, cocktails have been on

00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:26.676
an upwards trajectory, they have

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.056
gone from strength to strength.

00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:31.376
Whether it was James Bond’s signature

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:34.386
“vodka martini, shaken not stirred”, or

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:36.986
the “mad men” of the New York advertising

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:39.466
world’s constant thirst for Old Fashioned,

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.766
or the more recent trend of Instagrammable

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:45.026
colourful drinks like Negronis or

00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.756
Aperol Spritz, it might seem like we are

00:07:47.756 --> 00:07:50.226
drinking more cocktails than ever before,

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:53.736
And some of them have fascinating

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:56.066
origin stories, stories I should

00:07:56.066 --> 00:07:58.286
add that are often debated, there

00:07:58.286 --> 00:08:00.376
are multiple versions of them, but

00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:02.166
they’re interesting nonetheless.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.716
So, without further ado, our

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:08.126
first cocktail is the most popular

00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:10.066
cocktail in the world, the Margarita.

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:12.706
In case you need a reminder of

00:08:12.706 --> 00:08:14.806
what a margarita is, it’s a mix

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:17.246
of tequila, triple sec, and lemon

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.456
juice, and is often served with

00:08:19.456 --> 00:08:21.526
salt around the rim of the glass.

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:24.966
Like most cocktails, there are several

00:08:24.966 --> 00:08:27.776
claims about who invented the margarita.

00:08:29.046 --> 00:08:31.346
One claim is that it was invented by

00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:34.406
accident by a Mexican bartender who was

00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:37.176
trying to make a Mexican drink consisting

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:39.726
of brandy, triple sec, and lemon juice.

00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:42.516
He reached for the brandy bottle,

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:45.506
but instead of brandy he picked up a

00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:48.426
bottle of tequila, and lo and behold,

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:51.056
he accidentally invented the margarita.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.736
Another claim is that there was a fussy

00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:56.876
customer, a dancer called Marjorie

00:08:56.876 --> 00:08:59.216
King, who said she was allergic to

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:02.076
all spirits except tequila, and the

00:09:02.086 --> 00:09:04.466
owner of a Tijuana restaurant invented

00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:06.500
this twist on the “ tequila shot”

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.880
specifically for her, an alternative,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.460
longer drink, compared to a simple shot.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.000
There’s also another theory that

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.110
the “margarita” is actually only

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.040
a twist, a variant, on an older

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.580
cocktail called “The Daisy”, which

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.200
was popular during prohibition.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.200
The Daisy has exactly the same

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.380
ingredients, except it uses

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.160
brandy rather than tequila.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.630
And as the Spanish speakers among you

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.000
may know, or if you speak another Romance

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.930
language you can probably guess, the

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.450
word for daisy in Spanish is….Margarita.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.610
Our second cocktail is also going to be a

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.580
woman’s name, but this time it’s something

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.390
slightly less pleasant, or at least has

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.290
a less pleasant story: the Bloody Mary.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.950
Again, if you need a reminder about

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.750
how to make a Bloody Mary, it’s tomato

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.750
juice with vodka, Worcestershire sauce

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.150
and tabasco, and it’s often drunk

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.600
on aeroplanes or even the morning

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.320
after a heavy night of drinking.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.260
It’s an unusual concoction,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.590
certainly, so where did it come from?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.260
Well, it’s thought to have been invented

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.560
by a French bartender in 1921, a man

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.780
called Fernand Petiot, who worked at

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.150
the famous Harry’s Bar in Paris, a

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.790
bar where the famously thirsty writer

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.810
Ernest Hemingway could often be found.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.800
There are several other claims, but

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.960
the more interesting question is

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.220
about why it’s called a “Bloody Mary”.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.100
The most popular theory is that

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.490
it was named after Mary I of

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.070
England, a particularly bloodthirsty

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.000
queen who was known for burning

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.430
Protestants at the stake.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.920
It’s not the only theory, of course.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.020
There is another theory that it was named

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.710
after an actress, Mary Pickford, as well

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.310
as a mere waitress at a Chicago bar.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.120
And a completely different theory

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.960
about where it comes from is that

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.030
it can all be traced back to a

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.670
mispronunciation of “Vladimir”.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.760
This might sound unlikely, but it is

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.650
somewhat more plausible when you learn

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.270
that one of the people the French

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.485
bartender made the drink for was Vladimir

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:29.100
Smirnov, of the Smirnov vodka dynasty.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.840
So, perhaps the bartender simply

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.490
couldn't say Vladimir properly, he

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.260
said something like “loody mir”,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.140
and the drink became “Bloody Mary”.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.670
Now, we must stay, in fact, at

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.801
Harry’s Bar in Paris for our

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.906
third cocktail, the “Sidecar”.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.880
A sidecar cocktail, if you don’t know,

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.240
is cognac, triple sec and lemon juice.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.380
If you imagine an old motorbike and you

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.760
picture a little compartment with one

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.390
wheel on the side, with enough space for

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.072
a person to sit in, that’s a sidecar.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.980
And the cocktail is thought to be

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.280
named after the motorbike attachment.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.200
This origin story goes back to the end of

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.690
World War I, where there was an American

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.810
army captain who would reportedly drive

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.790
all the way up to the bar in the sidecar

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.450
of the motorbike and request this drink.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.890
Other theories have it being invented

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.150
in London as well as across the Atlantic

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.600
in New Orleans, but I certainly like

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.710
the idea of this American captain

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.460
riding all the way up to the bar.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.870
Now for cocktail number four, we

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.310
are going to go all the way to

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.150
the other side of the world, to

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.400
Singapore, for the Singapore Sling.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.540
As a reminder, this drink has a gin

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.960
base, and is topped up with a mixture of

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.880
fruit juices and liquors to give a bright

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.530
pink colour, more like a large glass

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.560
of fruit juice than anything stronger.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.360
And when it comes to cocktails with

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.390
debated origins, where there are multiple

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.960
different claims about who invented

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.700
it and where, the Singapore Sling is

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.840
pretty universally agreed to have been

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.100
invented sometime around 1915 by a man

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.860
called Ngiam Tong Boon who was working

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.450
at the famous Raffles hotel in Singapore.

00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:29.830
Ngiam, the bartender, created this

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.410
drink to solve a very specific

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.530
problem, he created it with a

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.700
specific customer in mind: women.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.740
See, at the start of the 20th century,

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.150
Singapore was still a British colony.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.400
Men would come to the bar at

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.870
Raffles hotel to meet and drink.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.350
Women would come too, but it still wasn’t

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.860
considered socially acceptable for women

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.170
to be seen drinking alcohol in public.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.710
Ngiam’s clever idea was, well, I imagine

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.860
these women want to drink alcohol,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.870
they just don’t want other people to

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.560
think that they’re drinking alcohol.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.170
What if I create a drink that doesn’t

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.440
look alcoholic, it looks like a fruit

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.540
juice, so these women can happily

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.750
drink it without the social stigma

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.580
of being seen to drink in public.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.700
And, ta-da, he was right.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.750
It was a massive success, and you

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.470
can now find this cocktail being

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.460
made in bars all over the world.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.010
Right, we have time

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.710
for two more cocktails.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.500
Cocktail number six is one with

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.100
unusual ingredients, and an unusual

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.080
story of why it became so popular.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.860
It’s the White Russian.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.030
Now, again if you need a reminder of

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.340
what a White Russian is, the clue about

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.160
the main ingredient is in the name.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.890
It’s a cream-based cocktail, with

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.060
vodka, cream and coffee liquor.

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.554
The origin story of the White Russian

00:14:57.584 --> 00:15:00.354
is not so interesting, it’s thought to

00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:02.514
have been invented, along with its sister

00:15:02.514 --> 00:15:05.424
cocktail, the Black Russian, by a Belgian

00:15:05.424 --> 00:15:08.044
barman at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels.

00:15:08.854 --> 00:15:10.464
And, if you were hoping that it

00:15:10.464 --> 00:15:12.274
was called a White Russian because

00:15:12.274 --> 00:15:14.024
of some deep historical reference

00:15:14.034 --> 00:15:16.244
to the White Army, or the Russian

00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:18.784
Civil War, I’m sorry to disappoint.

00:15:19.574 --> 00:15:20.994
The only reason it's called

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:23.104
“Russian”, is because it uses vodka,

00:15:23.554 --> 00:15:25.679
and it’s actually far more popular

00:15:25.969 --> 00:15:28.069
outside of Russia than within it.

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.879
But the interesting thing about the

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:33.489
White Russian is that its popularity

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:36.539
comes almost exclusively from a film,

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:40.139
the 1998 cult film “The Big Lebowski”.

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:43.759
If you’ve seen the film, you’ll know why.

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:46.639
The main character in the film, played

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:49.009
by Jeff Bridges, constantly drinks

00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:51.309
this cocktail, downing a total of

00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:53.719
9 White Russians during the movie.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:56.409
It was quite a niche drink before,

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.899
but after the movie developed a cult

00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:01.439
following, this drink became something

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:04.189
of a staple, and sales of one of the

00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:06.859
main ingredients, Kahlua, boomed.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:11.369
And for our final cocktail it’s time

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.599
for perhaps the simplest cocktail of

00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:16.059
them all, a cocktail so simple you

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:17.899
might rightly argue that it isn’t

00:16:17.939 --> 00:16:20.419
a cocktail at all: The Screwdriver.

00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:23.809
The ingredients of a Screwdriver are

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:26.991
blissfully simple: orange juice and vodka.

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:30.351
Like the Singapore Sling, it

00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:32.371
has the advantage of not looking

00:16:32.371 --> 00:16:33.491
like it contains alcohol.

00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:36.701
Vodka is colourless, and so the drink

00:16:36.701 --> 00:16:39.381
is indistinguishable from orange juice.

00:16:40.531 --> 00:16:42.961
And this cocktail has some wonderful

00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:46.061
claims as to its origins, all of which

00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:48.061
revolve around the fact that it’s a

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.991
cocktail that can be drunk without

00:16:50.011 --> 00:16:51.861
people knowing it contains alcohol.

00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:55.441
My favourite one is that it comes from

00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:58.031
the mid 20th century, from American

00:16:58.071 --> 00:16:59.721
oil workers in the middle east.

00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:03.421
As an American oil worker working in the

00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:06.151
middle of the desert, before widespread

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.781
TV, there were limited ways to pass

00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:11.281
the time, you had limited access to

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.371
interesting alcoholic ingredients, and

00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:15.581
more importantly, you weren’t meant to be

00:17:15.581 --> 00:17:17.881
drinking when operating heavy equipment.

00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:20.591
Perhaps someone might have brought in

00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:22.671
a bottle of vodka from a recent trip,

00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:24.721
and there might have been concentrated

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:27.021
orange juice provided in your base.

00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:29.201
So, what did these

00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:30.651
American oil workers do?

00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:32.771
They poured the vodka in

00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:33.681
with the orange juice.

00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:36.741
But this wasn’t Harry’s Bar in

00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:39.001
Paris with skilled bartenders

00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:40.931
and all the necessary equipment.

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:43.261
So, what did they use to stir

00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:44.921
the vodka into the orange juice?

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.841
A screwdriver of course!

00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:49.991
There’s another theory that dates it

00:17:50.001 --> 00:17:52.081
slightly earlier, back to World War

00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:54.651
II, to American soldiers who would

00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:57.141
add vodka to their orange juice, which

00:17:57.281 --> 00:17:58.921
clearly you are not meant to do if your

00:17:58.931 --> 00:18:01.111
job involves handling deadly weapons.

00:18:02.141 --> 00:18:03.821
And they would find themselves

00:18:03.971 --> 00:18:05.491
mixing it all together with the

00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:08.101
closest thing they had to hand: well,

00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:10.011
you’ve guessed it,   a screwdriver.

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:14.709
OK then, that is it for today's

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:17.129
episode on a brief history of cocktail

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:19.209
drinking and some of the potential

00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:21.569
origins or at least claimed places

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:23.811
of origin of six of the most popular.

00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:26.681
For almost every cocktail it seems

00:18:26.681 --> 00:18:28.271
like there are half a dozen different

00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:30.191
origin stories, so they are all

00:18:30.221 --> 00:18:32.041
to be taken with a pinch of salt.

00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:34.731
As always, I would love to know

00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:36.411
what you thought about this episode.

00:18:36.711 --> 00:18:39.121
What is your favourite cocktail, and why?

00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:40.311
What are some other

00:18:40.331 --> 00:18:41.871
interesting origin stories?

00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:44.121
There are loads more fun ones, and

00:18:44.351 --> 00:18:45.801
unfortunately we didn’t have time to

00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:48.151
talk about Negronis, Gin and Tonics,

00:18:48.191 --> 00:18:50.341
or the ridiculously strong “Zombie”.

00:18:50.681 --> 00:18:52.921
I would love to know, so let’s

00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:54.391
get this discussion started.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.911
You can head right into our

00:18:55.911 --> 00:18:57.601
community forum, which is at

00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.461
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:02.631
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:19:03.191 --> 00:19:04.951
You've been listening to English Learning

00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:07.611

00:19:08.061 --> 00:19:10.601

00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:12.781

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.330
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.560
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.850
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a woman called Boudicca.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.630
She was the queen of a Celtic tribe who stood up to the most powerful

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.450
empire in the world, inspiring her people, slaughtering tens of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.220
thousands of Romans, and becoming a British folk hero in the process.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.770
It’s a fascinating story that involves ancient Rome, the Celtic

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.630
people, emperor Nero, violence, colonialism, and even Queen Victoria.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.390
So, get ready, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.690
OK then, Boudicca.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.340
When the Romans invaded Britain, in 43AD, they weren’t quite

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.690
sure what they would find on this mysterious far northern island.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.140
Sure, Julius Caesar had invaded with a small army 100 years before, and there were

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.570
established trade links between Britain and Gaul, modern day northern France, but

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.670
the Romans had never sought to bring the entire British Isles under Roman control.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.330
There were plenty of questions.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.740
What would the people be like?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.080
How would they be different to the civilised Romans?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.200
How easy would it be to conquer them and bring them into the Roman empire?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.813
Well, invading Britain didn’t prove to be particularly difficult for the Romans in AD43.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.047
Britain at the time was made up of a collection of tribes,

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:09.277
with a long history of complicated allegiances and rivalries.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.797
The Roman army, on the other hand, was well-trained,

00:02:14.077 --> 00:02:17.737
well-equipped, it was the most powerful army in the world.

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:24.877
So, it would surprise the Romans, and even surprise the Roman emperor Nero, to

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:31.547
find that 17 years after invading Britain, after a period of relative peace, the

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:36.947
Roman army was brought to its knees, tens of thousand of Romans were killed, the

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:42.247
entire Roman army almost needed to retreat from Britain with its tail between its

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:48.497
legs, and according to some historians the Roman empire might even have collapsed.

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:53.737
It would be even more surprising to Rome that it was almost beaten

00:02:53.977 --> 00:02:59.567
not just by one of the local uncultured savages, but by a woman.

00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:08.047
So, to understand how all this came about, let me paint you a bit of a picture of Roman Britain.

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:16.307
Britain, during the time of the Roman invasion, as I said, was made up of a collection of tribes.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:21.467
When it was clear that they would be no match for the all-powerful Roman

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:27.767
soldiers, many of these tribes became what’s called clients of the Romans.

00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:32.367
This meant that they would have pledged their loyalty to Rome,

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:36.507
and they would be allowed to keep a certain level of freedom.

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:42.117
Essentially they were allowed to continue life almost as normal, and there

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:47.237
wasn’t too much interference from the Romans in their day-to-day life.

00:03:48.097 --> 00:03:52.817
This was mostly in the south-east of England - the Romans didn’t

00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:57.127
head further north until after the story we’re talking about today.

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:02.477
To state the obvious, the Romans thought of themselves as,

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:06.497
and indeed were, very different from the Celtic people.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:15.867
The Romans portrayed the Celts as wild, savages, fighting naked, painting their bodies with ancient

00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:22.907
symbols, blowing loud horns to frighten their enemies, and beheading anyone who got in their way.

00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:30.767
The history of this time was written almost exclusively by the Romans, so we of course

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:36.527
need to factor this into any consideration of what the Celtic people were really like.

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:44.567
Although we don’t have real written records from the Celts at this time, we can see the products

00:04:44.657 --> 00:04:51.387
of their society, archaeologists continue to this day to dig up artefacts from this time.

00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:59.157
We can see that, yes, the Celts might not have had sophisticated aqueducts and underfloor

00:04:59.177 --> 00:05:07.257
heating like the Romans did, but it’s clear that these supposed “wild savages” created beautiful

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:15.107
ceramics and wore gold necklaces displaying elaborate designs – the work of the finest artisans.

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:23.337
In fact, it’s believed by some historians that the paving of roads was also the brainchild

00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:29.117
of the Celts even though Romans tried hard to claim that innovation as their own.

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:36.197
Now, although there might have been relative peace between the Romans and the local tribes,

00:05:36.407 --> 00:05:43.887
it would only take one incident to spark a huge conflict that would rock the Roman Empire.

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:52.847
And that spark all came down, ultimately, to differing views on the role of women in society.

00:05:53.497 --> 00:06:01.177
See, while the Celts might have been considered wild savages, many Celtic tribes had

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:07.887
what we would now call progressive, or simply, normal views about gender equality.

00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:14.607
The Romans, on the other hand, believed men to be superior to women.

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:19.717
You’ll know that there were no female Roman emperors, and women

00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:25.577
always played second fiddle, they came after men in Roman society.

00:06:26.057 --> 00:06:28.967
So, how does this relate to our story?

00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:36.512
Well, Boudicca, our protagonist, was married to an Iceni king, a man named Prasutagus.

00:06:36.977 --> 00:06:38.897
They had two daughters together.

00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:44.477
Iceni by the way, was the name of the Celtic tribe from a part

00:06:44.507 --> 00:06:48.157
of the country called East Anglia, to the north east of London.

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:51.717
Remember, London was an early Roman settlement.

00:06:52.547 --> 00:06:57.607
And Prasutagus and the Iceni had a good relationship with the Romans.

00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:05.027
Prasutagus was a client-king of the Romans - he was allowed to rule over the tribe in the

00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:10.717
knowledge that it was really the Romans who pulled the strings, who all had the power.

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:19.257
But things all started to go downhill, they started to go wrong, when Prasutagus died.

00:07:20.387 --> 00:07:26.847
Under Iceni customs, if a King died the rule passed to his children, no

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:31.677
matter whether those were male or female children, sons or daughters.

00:07:32.047 --> 00:07:37.687
Women had an important role in Iceni culture - they were considered able to

00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:44.037
rule, we know that many would have been druids, a powerful sort of scientific and

00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:50.157
religious position, and they were rightly considered to be just as capable as men.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:55.777
But under Roman law, women weren’t allowed to rule, and there

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:59.947
was great fear about what women would do if they took power.

00:08:00.797 --> 00:08:05.487
Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, was to Romans an example of

00:08:05.487 --> 00:08:09.647
the dangers of what would happen if a woman was in charge.

00:08:10.627 --> 00:08:14.377
As a result, Roman women weren’t even allowed to vote,

00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:18.887
own property, or have anything resembling independence.

00:08:19.647 --> 00:08:22.827
So, when Prasutagus died, there was a problem.

00:08:23.277 --> 00:08:29.387
In his will, Prasutagus had written that his property and his kingdom would be divided

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:35.367
between his daughters and the Roman emperor, Nero, a man who would later become

00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:40.647
famous for all sorts of terrible and unspeakable things, including killing his mother.

00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:48.879
But Roman law stated that the entirety of Prasutagus property would pass to the emperor.

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:51.989
Women got nothing under Roman law.

00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:59.619
Indeed, the Romans turned up, demanding that all of the property should pass to them, to the Romans.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:06.569
When Bouddica objected, she was flogged, that is whipped with thick

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:12.679
leather cords with lead balls or animals bones that created deep cuts,

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:17.449
and her daughters were brutally raped, they were sexually assaulted.

00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:23.509
All the chief men of the Iceni were stripped of their ancestral

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:27.339
possessions and the king's relatives were made slaves.

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:33.889
Bruised and humiliated, Boudicca decided to get her revenge.

00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:37.849
Her people were no longer independent, her daughters had been

00:09:37.849 --> 00:09:43.009
assaulted, and her body bore the scars of the flogging she had received.

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:48.259
So, she did what no one had yet been able to do for the

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:53.659
Celts – she united them under one cause – fighting the Romans!

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:59.299
Before launching her assault, Boudicca did a kind of divination,

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.660
that is fortune telling, asking the gods how things would go.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:10.140
Acting just as a druid would, which suggested she had had some druid

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.890
training, she released a hare from her tunic and watched the way it ran.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.760
It ran a particular way that she believed to be a sign that

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.060
the Iceni goddess of victory, Andraste, was on her side.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.290
Boudicca summoned the client kings and leaders of the other tribes.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.780
All of them had faced one injustice or another at the hands of Romans.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:42.470
They agreed to follow Boudicca as their queen in a rebellion against the Romans.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:50.910
Many of the tribes had actually been stockpiling weapons in secret and they now planned an attack.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:58.020
The Romans were completely unprepared for this, both mentally and strategically.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:06.150
On a mental level, as we heard, they simply thought a woman would be incapable of leading men.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.030
So, they didn’t prepare to fight, and instead the Roman Governor of

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.570
Britain, a man named Paulinus, was away with his soldiers in Wales on

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:23.234
a military campaign, leaving the Roman towns and settlements unguarded.

00:11:24.682 --> 00:11:29.760
Taking advantage of the situation, Boudicca marched forward with her troops

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.260
of around 120,000 men to the city of Colchester, in southeast England.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.650
The city was practically undefended.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:45.650
She killed all the Roman men and women she encountered, chopping off the heads

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.100
of her enemies and offering them to the Icenic goddess of victory, Andraste.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.110
Some of these heads were embalmed and mounted on

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.930
their chariots, while others were thrown into rivers.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:08.040
The remaining Roman citizens sought refuge, they sought safety, in the large Temple of Claudius.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.100
And for a couple of days, it held out, Boudicca and her forces couldn’t get in.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.130
Eventually they did, they set fire to it, they burned the structure to the ground,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.450
and then marched further south to the town of Londinium, modern day London.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.050
You might have thought that the sacking of Colchester would have been enough to worry the

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:39.220
Romans, but, when the Roman leadership learnt of the situation, they decided a woman surely

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:46.940
can't pose much difficulty and they sent a measly 200 men to take care of the ‘problem.’

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:55.420
When it was clear that 200 men wouldn’t be sufficient, wouldn't be enough, another 2,500 were sent.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:02.240
In the meantime, Boudicca had arrived in London and burned it to the ground.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:08.230
The settlement was tiny compared to modern London, but it was still the capital

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.880
of Roman Britain, so to be destroyed not just by a local tribe but by a local

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:21.770
tribe led by a woman was, well, it was embarrassing and humiliating to Rome.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:28.705
As the Roman historian Cassius Dio later wrote, “all this ruin was brought upon

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:35.400
the Romans by a woman, a fact which in itself caused them the greatest shame.”

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.170
Paulinus convinced Nero, who was on the verge of surrendering

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.600
according to some accounts, to fight back against Boudicca.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.350
So, Paulinus amassed around 10,000 soldiers and they marched along the

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.150
famous Roman road, Watling Street, to face Boudicca and her Celtic army.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.820
Watling Street was the long Roman road that went from the southeast

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.310
of England through almost to Wales, a road almost 500km long.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:16.770
In the meantime, Boudicca had expanded her army to 230,000 men, gaining

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.800
oppressed Celts as soldiers from the towns along the route of her victory.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.940
Boudicca had the advantage in terms of numbers.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:33.350
However, her army lacked modern weaponry, proper military training, food and other supplies.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:40.340
Some of her soldiers would likely have had shields, chainmail, and swords,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.700
but the majority were probably unprotected by armour and only really had

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.520
makeshift weapons, weapons they had made out of whatever was available.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:58.430
On the other hand, Paulinus’ men were properly trained and shielded in

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.610
body armour, not to mention equipped with the finest of Roman weapons.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.500
The scene was set for a final, decisive battle.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.620
On the one hand, an army of over 200,000 Celts defending their homeland.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.060
On the other side, around 10,000 Roman soldiers.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.890
You might have thought it would be no contest, with more

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.440
than 20 fierce Celtic warriors for every 1 Roman soldier.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.040
And indeed the Celts were confident of victory.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.480
So confident, in fact, that they had invited their families

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.030
and friends to come watch as they crushed the Roman forces.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.440
There’s a saying in English - and I'm sure there are also similar sayings in your

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:56.010
language, that “pride comes before a fall” - and it certainly applies in this case.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.300
What the Romans lacked in numbers, they made up for

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.040
in training, equipment, organisation and strategy.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:12.880
The Roman governor, a man named Suetonius, had also chosen a favourable position for the battle.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.380
The Roman forces had a forest behind them and cliffs to the side, meaning that

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.600
the Celts would have to run straight at them, they couldn't go round the side.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.950
They had also chosen a high position, which allowed them to throw

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.330
their javelins, their spears, down onto the Celts as they approached.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:44.900
With low quality armour, the Celts were helpless against the cold steel of the Roman soldiers.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.830
Tens of thousands were cut down, and as the Roman soldiers pushed further towards the

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:57.810
Celts, they did so in a formation that forced the Celtic soldiers closer together.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:04.210
The Celts had big, long swords that worked well in open space.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.070
But when packed closer together, there was no room to swing them.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:16.360
The Roman soldiers, on the other hand, had short swords that were ideal for close combat.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:23.400
The Roman troops started closing in, killing men and women left, right, and centre,

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:28.880
including those who had just come to spectate, who had just come to look at the battle.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.170
They massacred 80,000 men, women, and children on the

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.790
field, while only losing around 400 of their own soldiers.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.140
This battle, which would later be remembered as The Battle of Watling Street, concluded

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.300
Boudicca’s rebellion, and was the first and last major rebellion the Romans faced in Britain.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:01.550
As for Boudicca, our warrior queen, little is known about her fate, and it’s thought

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:07.120
that she either committed suicide by drinking poison or was killed in the battle.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:12.430
And interestingly enough, the little we know about Boudicca,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:17.110
in fact all we know about Boudicca, comes from Roman sources.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:25.390
We have two historians’ accounts to rely on; both of whom were Roman so hardly neutral observers.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:30.410
The first was Tacitus, and the second Cassius Dio, and

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.520
neither of them were actually even in Britain at the time.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.730
Tacitus, although he is one of the most respected Roman historians,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.370
would only have been 3 or 4 years old during Boudicca’s rebellion.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.400
His information all comes from his father-in-law, who had

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.240
served in Britain and fought at the Battle of Watling Street.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.610
The other historian, Cassius Dio, was born 95 years after the

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:05.170
rebellion, and his reports were primarily based on Tacitus’s accounts.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:13.700
Nevertheless, we have some fantastic, dramatic accounts of Boudicca as a person, and of her actions.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.160
I'll read you a few of them now but please do take them with a pinch of salt.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:27.930
So, Cassius Dio wrote, of Boudicca, “In stature, she was very tall, in appearance most

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:35.370
terrifying, in the glance of her eye most fierce, and her voice was harsh; a great mass

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:42.820
of the tawniest hair fell to her hips; around her neck was a large golden necklace; and

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:50.130
she wore a tunic of diverse colours over which a thick mantle was fastened with a brooch.”

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:57.080
So, you can see there that she is being portrayed as an “other”, as a “savage”.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:03.690
And Cassius Dio gives her a slightly backhanded compliment too, saying

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.230
“she possessed greater intelligence than often belongs to women.”

00:20:09.386 --> 00:20:15.190
Tacitus even goes as far as to describe, word for word, Boudicca's

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:19.550
rousing speech to her troops before they went into battle.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.110
He wrote:

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.190
“We British are used to women commanders in war;

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.080
But I am not fighting for my kingdom and wealth now.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.450
I am fighting as an ordinary person for my lost

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.530
freedom, my bruised body, and my outraged daughters...

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.710
Consider how many of you are fighting – and why!

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.780
Then you will win this battle, or perish.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.450
That is what I, a woman, plan to do!

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.060
Let the men live in slavery if they will.”

00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:01.420
What is clear is that, even though she was the enemy of Rome, and she caused huge problems

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:08.430
for the Romans, there is a certain degree of respect given to her by these Roman historians.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:14.670
And in Britain she is remembered as a warrior queen, an

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.220
example of the power of Britain, and of the power of women.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.820
As a result, she becomes channelled, used by people in Britain, as a cultural icon.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:35.540
This is especially the case by British queens, first Elizabeth I and then Queen Victoria.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.640
The idea is, of course, that Boudicca was the original British warrior

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:47.320
queen, one who almost toppled the most powerful empire in the world.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:54.652
And, faced with hostility against women, sexism ultimately, these two British

00:21:54.662 --> 00:22:00.182
queens increasingly brought Boudicca back into the public eye, showing that,

00:22:00.392 --> 00:22:06.352
yes, women were just as strong as men, and women can be both mothers and leaders.

00:22:07.352 --> 00:22:14.982
Boudicca has risen to the status of an epic British heroine, an icon of national resistance,

00:22:15.022 --> 00:22:21.742
who not only symbolises freedom and strength but also embodies women's empowerment.

00:22:22.602 --> 00:22:29.522
She has received accolades in the form of paintings, sculptures, documentaries, movies, and books.

00:22:30.192 --> 00:22:35.392
If you want to witness her in her element as British historians have later

00:22:35.512 --> 00:22:41.202
portrayed her, you can see her in a statue on Westminster Bridge in Central London.

00:22:41.892 --> 00:22:47.842
She stands there in bronze, guiding her warrior chariot, her troops, and the

00:22:47.852 --> 00:22:52.932
Celtic people to reclaim what was taken from them – their freedom and their

00:22:52.932 --> 00:22:59.182
dignity – and serving as an eternal reminder of the power of British women.

00:23:01.782 --> 00:23:08.142
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Boudicca, the woman who fought the Romans.

00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:12.042
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:16.462
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:16.832 --> 00:23:19.502
Had you heard about the story of Boudicca before?

00:23:20.042 --> 00:23:22.612
What do you think we can learn from her story?

00:23:22.932 --> 00:23:27.392
And how reliable do you think this story even is, given that

00:23:27.392 --> 00:23:31.112
it was written from second and even third-degree sources?

00:23:31.522 --> 00:23:35.402
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

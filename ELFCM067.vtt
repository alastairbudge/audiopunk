Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:16.402
The show where you can listen to interesting stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:21.532
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:27.372
I’m Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be looking at the stories

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:33.552
of 5 inventions that you probably know, and you may even use yourself.

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:43.162
But these stories aren’t the classic stories of an inventor working away in his or her

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:50.032
laboratory for years on end, and finally making the discovery they were looking for all along.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:51.452
Oh no.

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:55.432
These stories are quite unorthodox.

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:57.902
They are somewhat unconventional.

00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:02.002
They are all stories of how things were discovered

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:07.032
either by accident or at least in unexpected ways.

00:01:08.052 --> 00:01:10.152
It's going to be quite an exciting one.

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:12.212
So let's get started.

00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:19.552
When you imagine something being invented, you probably imagine a workshop,

00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:25.692
with someone searching day and night, adding things, taking things away,

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:31.622
experimenting, until they finally discover what they had been looking for all along.

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:39.473
The discovery of many of our greatest inventions happened in this way they were the

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:46.918
result of years and years of testing and improving stuff, where the person knew what

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:51.938
they were looking for, they were just experimenting with different ways of getting there.

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:57.648
From the light bulb to the telephone, these were all things that were

00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:03.548
‘invented’ in this way - people knew what they were trying to achieve, they

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:09.188
just needed to keep on testing different ways of actually getting there.

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:17.118
All of these inventions do have interesting stories, but we aren’t going to tell them today.

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:24.308
Instead, we are looking at some things that were discovered almost by accident, or

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:31.528
at least, in very unorthodox ways, where there is a real ‘Eureka’ moment, a moment

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:37.778
where someone does something by accident, and discovers something that ends up

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:43.948
being mass-produced and used by hundreds of millions of people all over the world.

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:51.143
Without further ado, our first example is probably more of a discovery

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:56.313
than an invention, but certainly has an interesting story to it.

00:02:56.313 --> 00:03:04.133
And it is Brandy, the strong alcoholic drink that is produced by distilling wine.

00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:10.713
Almost since the dawn of history, people have enjoyed drinking wine.

00:03:11.813 --> 00:03:17.063
It was normally produced relatively locally, and because it was

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:23.473
mainly water, it was quite difficult to transport in large quantities.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:32.124
As global trade, or at least European trade  started to really grow, in the 16th

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:40.119
century a Dutchman was looking for a way to be able to transport more wine in his ships.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:47.699
He knew that wine contained a large amount of water so he figured that if he could

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:54.864
remove the water from the wine, then pack this into his ship, the wine with the water

00:03:54.894 --> 00:04:02.594
removed, and then add water to the concentrated wine at his destination, then he

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:07.384
could get more wine into his ship, and he could sell more wine, and make more money.

00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:10.164
Sounds like a good idea, right?

00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:16.904
Well, for the purposes of transporting wine, it wasn’t a very good idea.

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:24.754
It turns out that if you just add water to your concentrated wine, it is not very nice to drink.

00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:30.154
But what he did discover is that the concentrated, the

00:04:30.514 --> 00:04:35.324
burnt wine, was actually quite tasty, quite tasty indeed.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:43.204
It was called 'brandewijn' in Dutch, and given the name ‘Brandy’ in English.

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:51.264
So he was looking to achieve something completely different, but he just stumbled across brandy.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:59.514
And the rest is, as they say, history - brandy is a drink that is now enjoyed by hundreds

00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:05.484
of millions of people all over the world, and it was discovered completely by accident.

00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:12.744
Our second invention is the microwave oven, the special little box that might

00:05:12.744 --> 00:05:18.304
sit in your kitchen that manages to heat up food at the press of a button.

00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:23.904
Now, the story of the microwave oven is quite a special one.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:32.589
In 1945, just as World War II was ending, there was a self-taught engineer called Percy Spencer.

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:40.669
He was working with radar technology for the Allies, and one day, as

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:46.759
he was working with a radar, he reached down into his pocket, and found

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:52.299
that the peanut candy bar that he had there had completely melted.

00:05:53.649 --> 00:06:00.799
The temperature of the room wasn’t hot enough to have melted it, and this bar had completely melted.

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.759
Spencer realised that it must have been the radar that did it.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:15.439
The radar machine must have emitted microwaves that had the effect of heating substances.

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:24.989
So, the legend goes, Spencer immediately went away with some corn, and then put it

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:32.509
next to the radar, and the corn started popping, much like you see in popcorn machines.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:40.079
The next day, he came back with an egg, and he  it next to the radar to see what would happen.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.769
And if you have ever put an egg in a microwave, you will know what happened.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.329
It exploded in his face.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.239
So he had discovered the microwave oven.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:56.654
Shortly after this, he went and filed a patent for it.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:02.239
And then two years later, the first commercial microwave oven came on sale.

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.979
It was a little different to the one that you and I would recognise now though - it

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:15.774
was almost 2 metres tall, and cost today's equivalent of around $50,000.

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.579
So it wasn't an immediate success.

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:25.162
However, as the technology improved, the boxes became smaller and smaller,

00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:29.702
and they were soon affordable to the growing American middle class.

00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:36.082
And within a few years, It was being sold into households all over America.

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:43.942
And to think, if he hadn't put his hand into his pocket that day, well,

00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:47.772
perhaps the story of the microwave would have been slightly different.

00:07:49.342 --> 00:07:51.362
Next up is Viagra.

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:57.902
Now, Viagra, which I think is the same word in almost every language.

00:07:58.272 --> 00:08:03.242
Is now a name that’s known all over the world.

00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:07.372
Viagra is just the brand name given to the drug.

00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:14.092
The name of the actual medication is Sildenafil, and it was

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:21.022
first made in a laboratory in the south of England in 1992.

00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:27.272
But its original purpose wasn't for, how can I say 'bedroom' use?

00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:32.932
It was actually to treat high blood pressure and chest pain.

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:39.914
It was created in a laboratory, and various tests were run with a small group of people.

00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:44.544
They wanted to test whether this drug was going to be

00:08:44.544 --> 00:08:48.274
a miracle cure for high blood pressure and chest pain.

00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:54.464
Unfortunately, the drug didn’t have the desired effect - it

00:08:54.464 --> 00:08:57.414
didn’t seem to do anything to help high blood pressure.

00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:06.974
So, the drug was almost abandoned, but then the men who took part in the pilot reported

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:13.474
another, unexpected side-effect - the side-effect for which the drug is now famous.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:20.254
The story goes that the people that took part in the test were quite

00:09:20.274 --> 00:09:25.884
reluctant to give up this new medicine, with its unexpected side-effect.

00:09:27.394 --> 00:09:32.934
So the scientists took it back to the laboratory, and conducted some more tests.

00:09:34.024 --> 00:09:38.524
Bingo, they hadn't found a cure for high blood pressure, but

00:09:38.864 --> 00:09:43.554
they had perhaps stumbled across something much more valuable.

00:09:45.054 --> 00:09:52.844
Viagra was born and since its founding over $10 billion worth of the drug has been sold.

00:09:54.384 --> 00:10:00.904
Interestingly enough, though, the patent for Viagra is running out this year,

00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:07.844
meaning that lots of generic, cheaper versions of the drug are able to be sold.

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:16.304
But the fascinating world of patents, and how they work is definitely a subject for another episode.

00:10:17.814 --> 00:10:21.494
Our penultimate invention is something called velcro.

00:10:22.604 --> 00:10:27.784
Now, velcro, in case you don’t know what it is, is the material that you

00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:34.414
often find to fasten two things together, to attach two things together.

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:41.894
Often children’s shoes use this to tighten the shoes without using laces - it is normally

00:10:41.924 --> 00:10:50.425
black, and one side is fluffy, it’s hairy, and the other side is full of tiny little hooks.

00:10:52.045 --> 00:10:55.855
But how Velcro came into existence is an interesting

00:10:55.855 --> 00:11:01.478
story, and the heroes of our story are a man and a dog.

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:09.508
Now, those of you that have dogs, especially dogs with lots of hair, will know that

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:15.708
if they run in long grass, they tend to return with lots of little things stuck

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:20.788
to them, which can be difficult to remove, depending on how hairy your dog is.

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:29.008
A Swiss engineer, a man called George de Mestral was out walking with his

00:11:29.008 --> 00:11:35.358
dog, and he noticed that these little things kept sticking to his dog's hair.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:44.948
He was curious about how that actually worked, and so, being a curious mind, he looked under

00:11:44.948 --> 00:11:51.608
the microscope back in his laboratory, and saw that each of these little things that was stuck

00:11:51.658 --> 00:11:59.398
to his dog had tiny, tiny, little hooks that had caught in his dog’s hair, in his dog's fur.

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:07.438
He thought, well, if I can create this artificially, using synthetic material,

00:12:07.898 --> 00:12:12.838
that would be great - it would be another way of fastening two things together.

00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:18.948
He created the first version of velcro - one side was fluffy,

00:12:18.948 --> 00:12:22.748
and the other side was full of thousands of tiny little hooks.

00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:26.918
So when they were pressed together, they stuck.

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:30.418
You had to pull hard to remove one from the other.

00:12:31.608 --> 00:12:32.908
Velcro was born.

00:12:34.438 --> 00:12:41.538
However, it wasn't an immediate hit, and it took years until it actually became popular.

00:12:42.998 --> 00:12:48.648
Interestingly enough, one of the first really popular uses of Velcro, or at

00:12:48.648 --> 00:12:55.555
least one of the ways in which Velcro became known around the world was through

00:12:55.975 --> 00:13:03.405
astronauts - for astronauts it was a very easy way to attach things when they

00:13:03.405 --> 00:13:07.595
were wearing these large space suits, so they couldn't really use their hands.

00:13:08.045 --> 00:13:16.870
Our final invention story is of the stethoscope, the device that doctors use to listen to the

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.120
beating of your heart, the device that’s essentially a long tube with a metal piece that is

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.530
pressed against your chest, and the tube divides into two parts that go into the doctor’s ear.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.120
Got it?

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.300
Great.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:39.930
Now, this story takes us back to the year 1816, to France,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.560
to the doctor's surgery of a man called René Laennec.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:51.460
In his clinic was a young woman who was quite overweight, she was a bit fat.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.990
The normal thing that a doctor would have done would have been to

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:02.930
check her heart just by placing his or her ear over the chest of the

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:08.400
patient, however there were two problems with this particular woman.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:15.280
The first problem was that she was a young woman, and it would have been

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:21.390
embarrassing for a male doctor to have put his ear directly to her bare chest.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.800
So he didn’t want to put her in an awkward position, he didn’t want to embarrass her.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.730
The second problem was that she was overweight, and it

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.160
would have been difficult to accurately hear her heartbeat.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:45.510
So our hero, the inventor of the stethoscope, Dr Laennec had an idea.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.300
He had previously seen school children playing a game where they

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.290
used a hollow stick, a stick with a hole through the middle.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:04.560
In this game, one child put their ear on one end of the stick, and the other child scratched

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:11.899
the other end with a pin, so they made a noise at the other end, Dr Laennec thought,

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:18.599
well, it seems like I might be able to hear more clearly, and cause this patient less

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:26.429
embarrassment if I do a similar thing, and so he went and found some paper, rolled it up into

00:15:26.429 --> 00:15:33.539
a cylinder, and pressed one end to the young woman's chest, and the other end to his ear.

00:15:34.307 --> 00:15:41.837
Ta-da, he could hear her heartbeat distinctly, and the first-ever stethoscope had been invented.

00:15:43.737 --> 00:15:50.287
It has of course evolved a bit since then, but the principle, from an acoustic point

00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:56.477
of view, at least is the same - create a tube, and you can hear a sound more clearly

00:15:56.547 --> 00:16:02.547
if you listen through the tube than if you just put your ear directly at the end.

00:16:03.487 --> 00:16:04.397
Amazing, right?

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:09.637
A device that is now used by millions of doctors all over the world,

00:16:10.057 --> 00:16:15.577
and no doubt has saved millions of lives, was discovered almost by

00:16:15.577 --> 00:16:20.097
accident after a doctor saw some children playing a game with a tube.

00:16:21.487 --> 00:16:24.807
I, for one, think that is a pretty fun story.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:32.237
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Five Unorthodox Inventions.

00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:38.702
For all of the huge laboratories that exist and massive companies working to find new

00:16:38.702 --> 00:16:44.462
and fantastic inventions, spending billions of dollars on research and development, it

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:51.172
is nice to think of the times when individual people just stumble across them, completely

00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:57.542
by accident, or at least, they arrive at the invention through very unconventional means.

00:16:58.932 --> 00:17:02.822
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:06.552

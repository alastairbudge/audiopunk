Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.751
by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:18.781
I'm Alastair Budge and today it is part for the final part of our series on British food, of our

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.921
little sojourn into some weird British culinary history.

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:29.366
Before we get right into it, I want to remind those of you listening to this podcast on Apple

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:37.287
the go, print out, share it with friends, or do whatever you want with it.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:39.676
Okay.

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:46.522
We have already gone over some weird and wonderful stories from the world of British food.

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:52.522
We have covered oysters, fish and chips, and the English breakfast.

00:01:53.332 --> 00:02:01.342
Today it is time for something a little different and you could say that we have saved the best for

00:02:01.342 --> 00:02:02.032
last.

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:10.477
It's time to learn about what the Wall Street Journal called Britain's biggest contribution to

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:11.407
gastronomy.

00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:15.697
That's right, it's the sandwich.

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:24.457
It's time to learn about the sandwich, where it came from, who invented it, and why it became so

00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:24.997
popular.

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:32.897
As with everything on the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast, and I might also say, anything

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:38.887
in life, to understand something properly, you need to understand where it comes from and the

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:40.267
history behind it.

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:49.447
With the sandwich, it has a pretty interesting history, one that takes us back over 250 years.

00:02:50.762 --> 00:03:00.862
The sandwich, as we know it was popularised in England in 1762 by John Montagu, who was the fourth

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:02.392
Earl of Sandwich.

00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:11.332
The story goes that Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich was a serial, habitual gambler and used to spend

00:03:11.362 --> 00:03:14.902
hours at a time at the card table.

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:25.321
During a particularly long binge, a particularly long session at the card table, and with the card

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:33.091
game at a point where he didn't feel he could get up from the table, he asked his cook to bring him

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:40.741
something he could eat without getting up from his seat and which he could eat with one hand so he

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.471
could continue to play his card game.

00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:54.026
And the cook brought him some meat wrapped between two slices of bread, the first version of a dish

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:56.756
we now know as the sandwich.

00:03:57.858 --> 00:04:05.358
The sandwich had the advantage over a traditional meal in that it was something that he could hold

00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:09.678
in one hand while he held the cards in another.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:17.718
Unfortunately, the history books don't record whether the invention of the sandwich was enough to

00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:21.708
bring the Earl of Sandwich victory at the cards table.

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:23.688
I suspect not.

00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:32.293
In any case, Montagu enjoyed his meat and bread so much that he ate it all the time.

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:39.863
Montagu's official biography tells the story slightly differently, saying that his commitment to

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:46.193
politics, the Navy and art meant that he could not leave his desk for lunch and so needed something

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.783
he could eat whilst working.

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:55.479
But this seems to me like someone who was just a bit embarrassed at the fact that he spent more time

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.089
at the card table than at his desk.

00:04:59.192 --> 00:05:02.942
I think you can make your own minds up as to which account you believe.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:11.996
In any case, his invention, if we can really call it an invention, grew popular in London's high

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:12.656
society.

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:21.026
It didn't really have a name, but people would just request "what Sandwich has", which was later

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:23.666
just shortened to sandwich.

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:32.375
But this isn't to say that the Earl of Sandwich was some culinary genius who had this amazing idea

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:35.705
of putting fillings between slices of bread.

00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:41.281
Indeed, to us now it probably just seems obvious, right?

00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:43.291
It doesn't seem revolutionary at all.

00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:50.451
And in your country, I guess, there may well be your variants that predate, that come earlier than,

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:52.201
the Earl of Sandwich.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:06:01.216
So Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich, he didn't invent this out of thin air, out of nothing, he didn't

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:02.566
just come up with the idea.

00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:10.328
We know that he traveled abroad to the Mediterranean where Turkish and Greek mezze platters were

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:14.918
served, so dips, cheeses, and meats.

00:06:15.068 --> 00:06:19.548
They were all sandwiched, they were all put between, layers of bread.

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:26.283
And in all likelihood, Montagu took inspiration from these when he sat at that card table.

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:32.856
The sandwich took off and became very popular almost immediately.

00:06:33.338 --> 00:06:39.717
Within a few months of its creation, a man named Edward Gibbon mentioned the sandwich by name in a

00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:47.277
diary entry writing that he'd seen 20 or 30 of the first men of the kingdom in a restaurant eating

00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:47.457
them.

00:06:48.768 --> 00:06:52.153
It was popular for some of the same reasons that it is now.

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:59.113
It's tasty, quick to make, easy to eat, and pretty affordable.

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:01.633
Some things never change.

00:07:02.593 --> 00:07:10.566
In the UK, there were two major developments that really boosted the popularity of the sandwich,

00:07:12.086 --> 00:07:14.936
both of which I think might surprise you.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:24.075
Firstly, in 1928, the invention of sliced bread, bread that comes pre-sliced.

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:32.275
Now sliced bread is the kind of thing that you might not think was invented as it seems just so

00:07:32.275 --> 00:07:33.235
obvious now.

00:07:33.805 --> 00:07:40.975
Indeed, there is an expression in English that's the best thing since sliced bread, which you can

00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:44.395
use as a way of saying that something is really great.

00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:54.415
But anyway, sliced bread was invented in 1928 and this made sandwiches just so much easier to make.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:04.520
Cutting bread is a bit fiddly to do in a straight line, and so buying it pre-sliced made making

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.830
sandwiches incredibly easy.

00:08:09.549 --> 00:08:17.379
Secondly, was the invention of the pre-made sandwich, which arrived in 1980 in Marks and Spencer's,

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:20.529
which is an iconic British department store.

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:29.227
They used to serve sandwiches in their restaurant, and then one day at the end of the working day,

00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:37.657
instead of throwing away the leftover sandwiches, they wrapped them up and made them available for

00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:38.977
sale to the public.

00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:48.509
Now a little bit like sliced bread, you might think that the pre-packed sandwich seems so obvious

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:53.099
and ask, why did it take so long for that to be invented?

00:08:54.089 --> 00:09:00.432
Well, the truth is that people just didn't think that it would sell because it was something that

00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:03.252
was so easy to make at home.

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:09.552
They didn't think that people would want to buy them pre-made and pre-packaged.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.842
But they couldn't have been more wrong.

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:22.321
They were an immediate hit, an immediate success, as they suited the busy on the go life of many

00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.461
London workers.

00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:30.271
And the popularity of the pre-made sandwich in the UK continues to grow.

00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:40.491
Nowadays, it is estimated that the sandwich industry is worth 8 billion pounds in the UK alone, and

00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:43.981
it employs over 300,000 people.

00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:49.801
And it's quite a science getting the pre-packed sandwich, right.

00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:56.401
It can't stay on the shelves for too long, and you need to get the right combination of ingredients,

00:09:56.926 --> 00:10:01.876
so that bread doesn't go too soggy or wet and disgusting, right?

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:06.796
So obviously you can't just put a whole load of tomatoes right up against the bread, otherwise it'll

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:08.206
get wet and horrible.

00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:14.276
British supermarkets have got pretty good at making pre-packed sandwiches though.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:21.746
Indeed, one travel hack, I guess we can call it a travel hack, but this is a travel hack for those

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:29.786
of you visiting the UK, is that every British supermarket sells actually really good sandwiches

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:30.866
ready to go.

00:10:32.306 --> 00:10:39.686
If you are looking for something quick to eat and you want a tasty affordable meal, then just go

00:10:39.686 --> 00:10:42.656
into any supermarket and pick up a sandwich.

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:50.850
When I say this to friends from places like France or Italy, they are always surprised, as

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:56.700
sandwiches that you get in supermarkets in those countries are, for want of a better word,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.840
disgusting, but in the UK, they really are pretty good.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.970
So just trust me on this one.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:11.910
Obviously it's not just in the UK that sandwiches are popular and I imagine that some form of

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.910
sandwich is probably popular in your country.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:25.403
Nowhere are sandwiches more popular than in the US, where more than 300 million sandwiches are eaten

00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:26.933
every day.

00:11:28.603 --> 00:11:32.023
But the Americans didn't immediately adopt the sandwich.

00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:41.778
As you may know, when the founding fathers left Europe to found America, they wanted to leave the

00:11:41.898 --> 00:11:46.518
stuffy European archaic traditions behind.

00:11:47.118 --> 00:11:51.928
They wanted to build a new society starting from afresh.

00:11:52.968 --> 00:12:01.218
And so the theory goes that the reason that Americans held off, they waited so long to adopt the

00:12:01.218 --> 00:12:09.100
sandwich was because it was associated with old aristocratic Britain, because of the Earl of

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.730
Sandwich.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.670
It was exactly the opposite of everything that the founding fathers of the United States stood for.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:25.030
However, morals and principles can only be upheld for so long and sandwiches, well, they are pretty

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.720
delicious.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:34.750
The first record of a sandwich recipe appeared in an American cookbook in 1815 and from then the

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.460
sandwich has just got more and more popular in America.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.370
Now there are hundreds, thousands even, of different varieties.

00:12:46.825 --> 00:12:54.865
But when the sandwich was first eaten in America, the most popular version wasn't something you'd

00:12:54.865 --> 00:12:56.005
recognise today.

00:12:56.935 --> 00:13:01.675
It wasn't meatballs, it wasn't turkey, ham or cheese or anything like that.

00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:04.165
Can you guess what it might be?

00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:07.555
Oh, I don't know if you'll guess, it was tongue.

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.975
Yes, that's the tongue of an animal.

00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:12.895
That seems gross right?

00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:14.446
It seems gross to us today.

00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:15.016
I guess.

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:22.906
Luckily things have moved on since then, and sandwiches come in all different varieties.

00:13:23.716 --> 00:13:30.886
You may have heard of a Sloppy Joe, a Reuben, or a grilled cheese sandwich, which are some of the

00:13:30.886 --> 00:13:33.326
most popular in the US.

00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:43.141
In the UK though, probably the most iconic sandwich is something called the BLT, which stands for

00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:45.481
bacon, lettuce, and tomato.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:50.911
Although you can find sandwiches in almost any possible shape or size.

00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:59.971
Indeed, there is a Wikipedia page of a list of notable sandwiches and there are 219 on that.

00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:08.056
I'll leave you to peruse that list at your leisure and you can create your own little bucket list of

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.586
sandwiches if you really want.

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:11.836
I'll put the link in the show notes.

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:19.682
On a personal note, my favourite sandwich has to be the one made at home on Boxing Day, the day

00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:20.342
after Christmas.

00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:28.307
You basically just put all the leftovers from Christmas lunch in between two pieces of bread, so

00:14:28.307 --> 00:14:31.877
that's turkey, bread sauce, ham, cheese.

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:37.607
It's absolutely delicious, although I should admit that my brother is the real expert on this.

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:39.557
Okay.

00:14:39.887 --> 00:14:45.257
With this comes the end of this mini-series on British food.

00:14:45.522 --> 00:14:52.121
If you haven't checked out the other episodes and you are hungry for more, if you will pardon that

00:14:52.121 --> 00:14:55.001
terrible pun, then please do check them out.

00:14:55.706 --> 00:15:02.952
Episode one is on oysters, an unlikely but very interesting food with a very important history for

00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:03.282
Britain.

00:15:04.122 --> 00:15:10.872
Then episode two is about fish and chips and talks about the weird and wonderful history of that

00:15:10.872 --> 00:15:11.412
dish.

00:15:12.282 --> 00:15:18.582
Episode three is about the English breakfast all 1,500 calories of it.

00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:24.878
One thing that I think we can all agree on is that British food isn't boring.

00:15:25.298 --> 00:15:36.038
Yes, it might not have the same reputation as cuisines like French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, but

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:38.918
it is full of fascinating history.

00:15:39.968 --> 00:15:49.988
It's amazing how things change and how a food can go from being the food of the aristocracy and very

00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:56.048
rich through to being the food of the poor and of course vice versa.

00:15:57.398 --> 00:16:02.468
This has been a really interesting series to make and I hope you have enjoyed it.

00:16:03.098 --> 00:16:07.148
As always, thank you very much for listening to the show.

00:16:07.898 --> 00:16:15.128
If you are looking for the key vocabulary and transcript for this podcast or for any of the others

00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:20.578
for that matter, you can grab those over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:16:21.158 --> 00:16:27.698
The transcripts and key vocabulary are a big, big help for those of you that need a little helping

00:16:27.698 --> 00:16:34.793
hand and mean that you don't need to keep pausing and rewinding if you missed or didn't understand a

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:37.553
word, and you don't have to look things up in a dictionary.

00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:44.813
As a language learner myself, and having used this technique when learning French and Italian, I

00:16:44.813 --> 00:16:47.303
certainly know how useful they are.

00:16:48.143 --> 00:16:55.373
And as I said, the promotional price for becoming a member and getting access to the transcripts and

00:16:55.373 --> 00:17:02.033
the key vocabulary for this podcast and for every podcast we've ever done is coming to an end at

00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:07.163
midnight on January the 31st so that's just 10 days from now.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:14.333
If you become a member before midnight on January the 31st then you will get that promotional price

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:20.933
of just nine euros per month for as long as you are a member, which I hope will be a very long time.

00:17:21.533 --> 00:17:28.523
And also, if you weren't aware, there's a 30 day no questions asked refund policy, so, if at any

00:17:28.523 --> 00:17:35.543
time within the first 30 days of being a member, you find that it hasn't met your expectations or

00:17:35.543 --> 00:17:41.273
you haven't been able to use it, just let me know, let the team know and you'll get a full refund.

00:17:41.858 --> 00:17:49.122
That's how confident I am that you'll find them an amazingly useful resource for improving your

00:17:49.122 --> 00:17:50.952
listening and speaking skills.

00:17:52.077 --> 00:17:54.417
Right, that's the sales pitch over.

00:17:54.717 --> 00:18:00.807
I know it's useful, our current members know that they are very useful and you should just had to

00:18:00.807 --> 00:18:05.697
leonardoenglish.com/ subscribe and take a look for yourself.

00:18:06.477 --> 00:18:11.727
You've been listening to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:18:12.027 --> 00:18:16.917

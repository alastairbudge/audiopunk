Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:16.925
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:21.045
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:27.365
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Fast Fashion.

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:32.495
This is part three of this three-part series on fashion.

00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:37.815
In part one we talked about some of the historical curiosities of fashion,

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:43.425
and how different fashions have come and gone due to socio-political events.

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:51.845
Then in part two we looked at some of the great fashion houses: Chanel, Gucci, Dior, and Versace.

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:57.065
And in today’s episode, part three, it is the modern phenomenon of

00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.295
fast fashion, of the mass production of cheap items of clothing.

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:08.320
We’ll look at the development of fast fashion, how it actually works, the criticisms of fast

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.050
fashion from a sustainability point of view, and ask ourselves whether “fast” fashion is simply

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.890
the fashion of the future, or it too is another passing fad, a fashion that will come and go.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.050
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.230
The subjects we heard about in part two of this mini-series,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.370
Chanel, Gucci, Dior and Versace, are all luxury fashion houses.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.230
These designers, to different degrees, wanted to create beautiful garments,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.060
wonderful clothes that would make whoever wore them look absolutely stunning.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.730
These clothes would use the finest of materials, no expense would be spared, which

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.880
evidently resulted in very expensive clothes that only the richest in society could afford.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.750
For the majority of the 20th century, there was this gap, this gulf, between the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.630
clothes that the rich and famous would wear and the clothes everyone else would wear.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.399
Film stars and princesses wore dresses by fashion houses like

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.479
Dior, everyone else wore, well, more plain, normal clothes.

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:26.114
But towards the end of the 20th century, and at the start

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:30.571
of the 21st century, a strange phenomenon started happening.

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:36.091
The gap between the types of clothes designed by fashion houses and

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.351
the types of clothes that normal people would wear started to reduce.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:45.301
It became cheaper and cheaper to dress in a way that resembled your favourite

00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:50.021
star, it became cheaper and cheaper to buy any type of clothes you wanted.

00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.421
And as the cost reduced, people were able to buy more and more.

00:02:56.151 --> 00:03:00.021
Indeed, in the first half of the 20th century the average

00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:05.431
American spent between 12 and 14% of their income on clothes.

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:13.101
Now it’s more like 3%, but the average person buys much more than ever before.

00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:20.981
Some estimates have this as people owning five times more clothes now than 100 years ago.

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.331
This probably isn’t surprising to you.

00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:29.481
You may even remember clothes being a lot more expensive than they are today.

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:36.901
Now, if you were to walk into a shop like Zara or H&M, you’d be able to find

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:44.001
t-shirts for €5, and you probably wouldn’t pay much more for jumpers or jeans.

00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:51.171
If you wanted a stylish dress, one that didn’t look all too different to one a movie star

00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:57.211
might have been wearing on the red carpet, you might be able to find one for as little as €10.

00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:03.341
Apps like SHEIN might even sell you a swimsuit for just a couple of euros.

00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:09.291
So, how did clothes get this cheap, and what is the effect of this?

00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:16.971
Well, to illustrate this, it’s useful to take the case of a shop that you may well know, Zara.

00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:23.621
Zara is a Spanish brand, founded in the city of La Coruña in northwest Spain.

00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:31.821
It was founded in 1975, and went from a small clothing shop to the world’s largest clothing

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:38.095
retailer, turning its founder, Amancio Ortega, into one of the richest people in the world.

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:44.015
Now, Zara is just one of many fast fashion companies, but it is one

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:48.415
of the most prominent, and an understanding of how Zara works is

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:52.905
helpful for an understanding of the fast fashion industry as a whole.

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:58.875
Historically, clothes shops might have four different seasons,

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:02.545
so the clothes on offer would change four times a year.

00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:08.365
Nobody wants to buy a woolly jumper in July, or a swimming costume in December.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.565
Zara, on the other hand, changes its collection on a rolling

00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:17.445
basis, replacing three quarters of its collection every month.

00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:24.535
Put another way, Zara launches around 65,000 new items every

00:05:24.535 --> 00:05:28.925
year, whereas traditional manufacturers launch around 5,000.

00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:35.175
If you’re thinking, “why launch so many new items, wouldn’t it be better to launch fewer

00:05:35.175 --> 00:05:40.525
items and have them around for longer?”, well, that might seem like a sensible question,

00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:46.775
but it is the complete opposite of the philosophy and business model of fast fashion.

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:53.305
Fast fashion, and the success of companies like Zara, revolves around

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:58.625
the idea of very quickly adding and removing new collections, often

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:03.195
based very closely on designs created by expensive fashion houses.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:08.135
The result of this is that shoppers feel like they need to buy

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:11.685
it now otherwise they won’t be able to buy it in the future.

00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:17.095
You could argue that this is nothing new, and that this sense of

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:22.305
“FOMO”, this fear of missing out, is something that is as old as time.

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:29.085
But even 50 years ago, even if there had been the consumer demand for it, fast

00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:33.525
fashion wouldn’t have existed because it simply wouldn’t have been possible

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:38.955
to produce these new items as quickly as the fast fashion industry requires.

00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:46.945
It’s thought that now, a brand like Zara can go from having the idea for a particular item of

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:53.925
clothing through to having that item of clothing for sale in a shop in as little as four weeks.

00:06:55.265 --> 00:07:00.635
We’ll come to some of the consequences of this in a minute, but it is unprecedented.

00:07:00.965 --> 00:07:05.625
It’s incredibly fast, and means that these fast fashion retailers

00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:09.615
can produce new items of clothing faster than ever before.

00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:15.325
Now, at first glance this might seem like a welcome development.

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:20.575
If clothes are cheaper it means people have more money to spend on other things,

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:25.605
and wearing clothes that make you feel great should be something that is accessible

00:07:25.605 --> 00:07:31.004
to everyone, not just people who are able to afford Versace or Yves Saint Laurent.

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:36.415
It certainly has democratised fashion in a way never before,

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:40.615
but the fast fashion industry is not without its critics.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.080
And the criticisms fall into two main categories:

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.050
damage to the environment and exploitation of workers.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.660
To start with the environmental criticisms, we can also split these

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.260
into three main categories: climate change, pollution, and water usage.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.840
On the first issue, of climate change, the fashion industry is estimated

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.580
to be responsible for between 8-10% of global carbon emissions, about

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.110
4 or 5 times as bad for the environment as the airline industry.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:23.820
Making and transporting clothes uses a lot of energy, especially when one considers that in many

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:30.590
cases these cheap t-shirts or dresses will be being produced in countries using coal-powered

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.780
electricity, then put on a ship and sent thousands of kilometres to their final destination.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.540
In terms of water usage, again we might not necessarily look at our t-shirt

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.540
and think that much water has been used to produce it, but the fashion

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:55.100
industry is responsible for almost 20% of all wastewater produced worldwide.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.340
If you’re wearing a cotton t-shirt, which I am actually at the moment, it takes around

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:07.390
3,000 litres of water to produce the raw materials that went into making that t-shirt.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.520
And to put that another way, if you take a five minute shower every day, the amount of water

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:21.030
that goes into making the cotton in your t-shirt is comparable to two months worth of showers.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.354
Or in terms of drinking water, the amount of water that goes into making your

00:09:26.354 --> 00:09:33.204
t-shirt, is similar to what the average person drinks in about two and a half years.

00:09:34.164 --> 00:09:40.764
Now, on the pollution side of things, the fast fashion industry stands accused of using toxic and

00:09:40.784 --> 00:09:47.014
polluting chemicals both in the cloth itself and in the dyes used to create different colours.

00:09:48.394 --> 00:09:54.344
Because the emphasis is on reducing the cost as much as possible, the factories producing these

00:09:54.344 --> 00:10:00.844
goods have little incentive to spend money on more environmentally friendly raw materials or

00:10:00.964 --> 00:10:07.604
on disposing of waste products, and this ends up in rivers and polluting nearby environments.

00:10:08.364 --> 00:10:12.534
And there are countless stories and investigations into cases of

00:10:12.584 --> 00:10:17.254
villages in countries like India or Bangladesh where the residents

00:10:17.264 --> 00:10:20.874
have suffered because of waste pollution coming from garment factories.

00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:27.444
What’s more, with clothes made with synthetic materials, these often contain

00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:33.320
microplastics, tiny pieces of plastic which are washed away when the clothes are washed.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:38.694
These microplastics end up getting washed out into the sea, polluting

00:10:38.694 --> 00:10:43.374
the oceans, being eaten by fish, contaminating water and food supplies.

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:48.564
Now, moving onto our second category of complaints about the fast fashion

00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:54.194
industry, this revolves around the maltreatment, the exploitation, of workers.

00:10:54.884 --> 00:11:00.564
And for many people, it wasn’t until 2013 that the reality of

00:11:00.564 --> 00:11:04.584
how cheap clothing was made was finally made blindingly obvious.

00:11:05.714 --> 00:11:12.254
On April 24th of 2013, in Dhaka, in Bangladesh, a building called the Rana

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:19.549
Plaza collapsed, killing at least 1,132 people and injuring more than 2,500.

00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:27.784
The factories inside made clothes for a number of well-known Western manufacturers, such as Primark,

00:11:28.044 --> 00:11:34.654
Walmart and El Corte Ingles, as well as some expensive fashion houses such as Prada and Gucci.

00:11:36.084 --> 00:11:40.404
In the aftermath of the tragedy, it became clear that the building was

00:11:40.414 --> 00:11:45.814
entirely unsafe and the owners had ignored safety concerns for months.

00:11:47.274 --> 00:11:51.434
Previously conveniently hidden from view, the grim reality of

00:11:51.434 --> 00:11:55.164
life inside these garment factories was now shown to the world.

00:11:55.944 --> 00:12:00.794
Low-pay, long hours, and potentially fatal working conditions were

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:04.324
simply a reality for someone working in one of these factories.

00:12:05.364 --> 00:12:11.524
And while the perhaps stereotypical, or cliche, idea of the exploited fast

00:12:11.534 --> 00:12:16.954
fashion worker is someone in a factory in India or Bangladesh, it’s come to

00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:21.964
light that exploited workers are often based far closer to the end consumer.

00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:27.681
Indeed, there have been investigative reports that have shown that Leicester, a

00:12:27.811 --> 00:12:33.315
city in central England, has become a hub for garment production, with workers

00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:40.481
often earning as little as £3 an hour and employed on unstable, temporary contracts.

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:47.301
To give you some perspective here, £3 is about €3.50, and it’s

00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:52.286
less than a third of the government “living wage”, which is £9.50.

00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:57.794
Interestingly enough, the reason that these fast fashion companies are working with

00:12:57.804 --> 00:13:02.774
garment factories in England, and specifically in Leicester, in the centre of the

00:13:02.774 --> 00:13:08.104
country, is because the goods can be delivered very quickly to anywhere in the UK.

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:15.094
Factories in India and Vietnam and Bangladesh might be able to offer lower

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:21.344
prices per item of clothing, but they can’t deliver as fast, so in a strange

00:13:21.464 --> 00:13:26.664
twist of fate, this type of exploitative manufacturing has returned to the UK.

00:13:27.603 --> 00:13:32.543
Of course, exploitation of workers is exploitation of workers, whether that’s in

00:13:32.693 --> 00:13:38.123
Leicester or in Dhaka, but an interesting development that not everyone is aware

00:13:38.123 --> 00:13:42.953
of is that these factories are sometimes a lot closer to home than people think.

00:13:44.263 --> 00:13:47.471
So, where does this leave the fast fashion industry?

00:13:48.404 --> 00:13:51.904
Well, bigger than ever, and showing no signs of slowing down.

00:13:52.804 --> 00:13:59.314
It’s estimated that by the year 2050 global fashion sales could triple, while the global

00:13:59.314 --> 00:14:05.694
population is only estimated to be just under 10 billion, up from just under 8 billion today.

00:14:06.364 --> 00:14:12.694
So there will be 25% more people, but we will be buying three times more clothes.

00:14:13.684 --> 00:14:19.084
Clothing has become, and will become for many more people, an increasingly disposable

00:14:19.114 --> 00:14:23.864
item, something that you buy and wear a few times before it’s never worn again.

00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:26.259
And this is by design.

00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:30.609
The nature of these cheap clothes, produced in a fast and

00:14:30.739 --> 00:14:34.199
often unsustainable way, is that they don’t last very long.

00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:39.339
No doubt you don’t need me to tell you this, and if you’ve bought a t-shirt

00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:45.189
from H&M or Zara and then found that after a month or so it’s all out

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:49.419
of shape and needs to be thrown away, you’ve experienced this firsthand.

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:55.219
Because the quality of these clothes is often so low, it’s not easy

00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:59.669
for them to be re-sold, to be bought and worn again by someone else.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:05.449
The destination for these clothes is, more often than not, the landfill,

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:10.719
the rubbish tip, with an estimated 85% of all clothes in the United

00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:15.769
States going either to the landfill or being incinerated, being burned.

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:23.669
Even for the clothes that are given to clothing banks, where clothes are either recycled or given

00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:30.889
to charities to distribute, it’s estimated that less than 1% of all clothes are ever recycled.

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:35.229
So, what is being done, and what is to be done?

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:40.233
Commentators point at three major areas: government legislation,

00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:44.583
the fast fashion retailers themselves, and us, the consumers.

00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:50.703
On the government and fast fashion retailer side, there is the argument that there should be

00:15:50.703 --> 00:15:56.433
more government regulation that requires fast fashion retailers to have a more transparent

00:15:56.433 --> 00:16:01.953
supply chain, to make sure they are paying fair wages and using sustainable partners.

00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:07.713
Ultimately, we cannot rely on the fast fashion retailers to do this themselves

00:16:07.743 --> 00:16:11.793
as they will continue to maximise their profits for as long as they can.

00:16:12.063 --> 00:16:15.483
So this is where governmental legislation is required.

00:16:16.362 --> 00:16:19.032
But this is only one half of the question.

00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:26.323
The other side of the coin is the demand side, the consumer side, the person scrolling through

00:16:26.323 --> 00:16:32.563
Instagram and buying a dress or t-shirt on a whim, because perhaps they might wear it someday.

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:38.323
The fashion designer Vivienne Westwood had some advice on what people

00:16:38.323 --> 00:16:45.209
should do, and it’s a simple message: “buy less, choose well, make it last.”

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:50.949
In short, buy better clothes that you know you’ll wear, and buy less of them.

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:57.014
It sounds good, in theory, but it’s somewhat at odds, it’s contrary to,

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:02.409
what has become the norm for behaviour, especially among certain age groups.

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:09.179
Fast fashion has reduced the cost of clothing so much that, for many, clothes

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:14.839
have become a disposable item, something to wear once, perhaps twice at a

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:19.849
push, but then to throw away or keep in a cupboard, never to be worn again.

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:24.729
It’s so cheap and easy to always wear different things, and there is

00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:29.299
so much pressure to always be doing something new and different, that

00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:34.029
it will take a cultural shift to escape the claws of fast fashion.

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:38.789
There are some signs, though, that, at least in some sections of

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:43.179
society, there is a rising understanding of the impact of fast fashion,

00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:48.299
and a movement towards buying less, choosing well, and making it last.

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:56.319
Companies like North Face and Patagonia, which make high-quality and durable clothing, encourage

00:17:56.349 --> 00:18:02.329
customers to buy refurbished or recycled products, or even not to buy their products at all.

00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:07.819
There are other companies that offer the ability to rent pieces of clothing.

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:12.809
There’s one quite interesting one called Mud Jeans, which allows

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:17.229
you to rent a high quality pair of jeans for under €10 a month.

00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:24.229
And even one of the original fast fashion companies, H&M, seems to be paying more

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:29.359
attention to the sustainability of its supply chain, and has promised that raw

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:36.939
materials for its products will consist of a minimum of 30% recycled materials by 2025.

00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:44.464
Now, there are plenty of people who have accused companies like H&M of what’s called “greenwashing”,

00:18:44.946 --> 00:18:50.136
of pretending to be environmentally friendly in order to hide what it is really up to.

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:55.816
That might be the case, but if these fast fashion companies believe

00:18:55.946 --> 00:19:00.866
that they can be more successful and appeal more to consumers if they

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:04.556
are more sustainable, surely that must be a positive development.

00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:09.656
So it is ultimately the shopper, it is me and you, who

00:19:09.656 --> 00:19:12.396
will decide how the fast fashion industry develops.

00:19:13.306 --> 00:19:20.366
The temptation to buy just one more €10 t-shirt or pair of jeans is hard to resist, and the price

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:26.466
is so low that to many it might feel too good to miss out on, but this is entirely the point.

00:19:27.406 --> 00:19:31.826
The fast fashion industry has been created around the idea of allowing

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:36.746
normal people, me and you, to participate in the fashion industry at a

00:19:36.756 --> 00:19:41.006
fraction of the cost that it might have cost our parents or grandparents.

00:19:42.006 --> 00:19:48.316
On one level, yes this is a wonderful thing, but on another level, it’s important to

00:19:48.316 --> 00:19:54.846
remember that the true cost of that cheap pair of jeans is hidden deep beneath the surface.

00:19:57.146 --> 00:20:02.806
OK then, that is it for today's episode on fast fashion, and with

00:20:02.816 --> 00:20:06.226
that comes the end of this three-part mini-series on fashion.

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:09.266
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:12.006
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:17.136
Can you ever see a world where we return to a slightly slower fashion

00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:21.966
industry, of buying fewer but better quality clothes that last for longer?

00:20:22.706 --> 00:20:26.916
What are some of the other impacts of fashion becoming a disposable item?

00:20:27.496 --> 00:20:30.556
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

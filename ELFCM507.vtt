Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.839
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.999
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.199
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Irish Troubles.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.719
It was a 30-year period of violent conflict that cost

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.519
thousands of lives, and injured tens of thousands more.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.629
To some, it was a necessary fight for justice and freedom; to

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.259
others, it was a period of unjustifiable violence and murder.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.579
As you may know already, it is an incredibly long and complicated period which cannot

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.909
be properly understood or explained in a single episode, but we’ll cover the most

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.839
important parts, to give you a sense of the what, the how, the who and the why.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.399
OK then, let’s not waste a minute and learn about The Troubles.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.439
Belfast is not a famously sunny place, with a total of a miserable 21

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:20.749
hours of sunshine recorded during the entire month of December in 2021.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.479
But for the residents of Canmore Close, in the west of the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.759
city, it isn’t just dark clouds and fog that block out the sun.

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:37.449
Overlooking the houses runs a huge wall towering 14 metres into the

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.369
sky, more than three times the height of the former Berlin Wall.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.559
This wall is no ancient historical monument, it is not some beautiful Celtic construction.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.709
It is a “peace line”, a huge wall erected in 1969 to

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.279
separate the two warring sides and “maintain the peace”.

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.309
On one side were the Unionists, the predominantly Protestant

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:10.759
community that wanted to remain part of Great Britain.

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.799
On the other side were the Nationalists, the predominantly

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.729
Catholic community that wanted to join the rest of Ireland.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.309
This wall has now been up for 55 years.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.999
Unlike the Berlin Wall, which has mostly been torn down and the only remaining parts

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.199
serve as a historical artefact, this wall still serves a function in the 21st century.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.949
To this very day, it keeps two communities apart and maintains a fragile peace

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:51.789
between people who have been fighting, on and off, for hundreds of years.

00:02:52.679 --> 00:03:00.319
The story of why this huge wall was first put up and why it still exists today is the story of the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:07.534
Irish Troubles, one of the bloodiest and most violent periods of recent British and Irish history.

00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:10.324
So, where to start?

00:03:10.884 --> 00:03:15.124
Well, we cannot begin to understand the Troubles without understanding

00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:19.404
the historical relationship between Ireland and Great Britain.

00:03:20.324 --> 00:03:28.174
For almost a thousand years, this relationship has been marked by conflict, conquest, and rebellion.

00:03:29.624 --> 00:03:35.754
English intervention in Ireland began in the 12th century with the Norman conquest, when

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:42.024
Norman lords, under the authority of the English crown, began settling parts of the island.

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:48.464
But it wasn’t until the 1500s that England, in the form of the Tudor

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:53.644
king Henry VIII, really began to assert its dominance over the island.

00:03:54.654 --> 00:04:01.604
Henry declared himself King of Ireland, and then in 1603, King James I

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:07.924
became the first British monarch to rule over Scotland, England and Ireland.

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:14.384
And it’s here that religious differences really start to become important.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:21.974
Ireland was a predominantly Catholic country, but James was a Protestant.

00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:28.394
And the Irish were not happy to be ruled over not just by a foreign king, but

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:34.584
by one preaching a different and in their view heretical branch of Christianity.

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:42.294
Knowing that Ireland was a potential hotbed for rebellion, James had an idea.

00:04:43.434 --> 00:04:48.324
To cement his authority in Ireland, and create a loyal Protestant base in the

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:54.674
country, James I encouraged loyal supporters from Britain to settle in Ireland.

00:04:56.144 --> 00:05:02.714
This started in 1609 with what would come to be known as the Plantation of Ulster.

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:10.404
Essentially this was a state-sponsored campaign to push the native Irish, who were

00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:15.764
almost exclusively Catholic, out of the most fertile areas of the northeast of the

00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:21.644
country, and give their land to English and Scottish settlers, who were Protestant.

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:29.644
These Protestant settlers got the best land, and therefore made the most money, and the native

00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:36.974
Catholics were pushed out, forced to hand over their land and survive on lower-quality arable land.

00:05:37.914 --> 00:05:44.184
This is a key piece to understand the origin of the Troubles, and why Ireland is divided.

00:05:45.074 --> 00:05:49.604
The Plantation of Ulster is the reason that it’s the northeast part of Ireland

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:53.464
that is still part of the United Kingdom, in the form of Northern Ireland,

00:05:53.924 --> 00:05:58.594
and it’s where there is the largest Protestant population and the greatest

00:05:58.594 --> 00:06:04.284
support for Britain - it can all be traced back to James I in the 17th century.

00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:09.604
Fast forward to the early 20th century, and the whole of

00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:13.594
Ireland was still under British control, it was one entity.

00:06:14.694 --> 00:06:20.654
Starting in 1919, there was a bloody guerrilla war fought between the Irish Republican

00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:28.652
Army– or the IRA–and British forces, which resulted in the partition of Ireland in 1921.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.754
The largely Protestant six counties in the north remained part of the UK, while the rest of Ireland

00:06:36.924 --> 00:06:43.424
became the Irish Free State, which would later become the Republic of Ireland, or simply “Ireland”.

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:52.334
Now, zooming in on Northern Ireland, the country was a mixture of Protestants and Catholics.

00:06:53.134 --> 00:06:57.094
The Protestants, who made up the majority, tended to want

00:06:57.104 --> 00:07:01.624
to remain part of the UK, and were so-called “Unionists”.

00:07:02.284 --> 00:07:08.414
But there was still a sizeable Catholic population, which tended to feel that it had been

00:07:08.484 --> 00:07:15.124
cut off from the rest of Ireland, and supported a unified Ireland, becoming one country.

00:07:16.284 --> 00:07:20.534
I use the word “tend” here because not every Protestant

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:24.164
was a Unionist and not every Catholic was a Nationalist.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:29.684
Especially in this story, there are many exceptions, and we need to be careful not

00:07:29.694 --> 00:07:35.514
to generalise too much, but if I stopped every 10 seconds to add disclaimers then

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:40.084
it would be really irritating, so I hope you’ll forgive the odd generalisation.

00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:45.644
Now, talking again specifically about Northern Ireland, the Catholic

00:07:45.644 --> 00:07:49.974
population continued to be treated as second-class citizens.

00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:56.364
Not from a legal point of view, they weren’t officially treated any differently, it wasn’t a

00:07:56.594 --> 00:08:03.794
full apartheid-type system like in South Africa, but structurally Catholics were marginalised.

00:08:04.514 --> 00:08:09.204
All positions of power were held by Protestants, public sector jobs

00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:13.474
were given to Protestants, priority when it came to housing was given

00:08:13.474 --> 00:08:18.314
to Protestants, Catholics were pushed to the margins of society.

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:23.053
And they had little recourse to do anything about it.

00:08:24.054 --> 00:08:28.984
To vote in elections you had to own property, and after decades

00:08:29.004 --> 00:08:33.954
of persecution and limited opportunities to gain wealth, property

00:08:33.964 --> 00:08:38.624
ownership was much lower among Catholics than it was among Protestants.

00:08:39.594 --> 00:08:45.234
In some areas, a single Protestant family might control multiple votes due to

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:50.014
property ownership, while entire Catholic families didn’t have a vote between them.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:57.704
And even in the areas with majority Catholic populations, areas that might have voted for

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:04.164
Catholic politicians, Protestant politicians and lawmakers adjusted the borders of voting

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:11.645
areas to split up key Catholic areas and ensure that no Catholic ever won public office.

00:09:12.817 --> 00:09:15.677
If you would like a piece of advanced English vocabulary,

00:09:15.947 --> 00:09:19.077
the technical term for this is gerrymandering.

00:09:20.617 --> 00:09:25.697
To state the obvious, it was a deeply unfair system, and there

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:30.007
was increasing animosity from Catholics towards Protestants.

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:36.097
But there was little agreement about what should or could be done about it.

00:09:37.157 --> 00:09:43.357
Inspiration came, in fact, from across the water, but to the west, not the east.

00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:49.937
The American Civil Rights Movement had started in the 1950s, and had

00:09:49.947 --> 00:09:54.687
given Irish Catholics an example of how to fight for equal rights.

00:09:55.807 --> 00:10:01.927
Importantly, it was largely nonviolent, it was characterised by peaceful protest.

00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:07.677
This was exactly what was first tried in Northern Ireland by Catholic civil rights

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:14.067
protestors: peaceful, non-violent, marches, modelled on the civil rights marches in America.

00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:19.328
Their demands were, I’m sure you would agree, perfectly reasonable.

00:10:20.648 --> 00:10:25.868
Their main requests were for “one man, one vote”, and equality

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:29.358
when it came to things like job opportunities and housing.

00:10:30.378 --> 00:10:36.038
But these peaceful protests were often met with violence, both from

00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:40.898
the police, which was predominantly Protestant, and from Loyalists.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:46.648
Now, Loyalists and Loyalism are terms you’ll hear quite a bit in this episode.

00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:53.375
Loyalism is often used as a synonym for Unionism, support of Great Britain in

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:58.785
Northern Ireland, but it typically has a more violent and militant connotation.

00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:05.235
And why were Loyalists not keen on the idea of improved civil rights for Catholics?

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:10.705
Well, it was a threat to their dominance, and they also feared that it could

00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:15.165
lead to increased calls for unification with Ireland, which they didn’t want.

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:23.356
One of the key early flashpoints came in October 1968, in Derry, one of the cities

00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:28.216
where Catholics made up the majority but still faced deep-seated discrimination.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.106
There was a civil rights march that the Ulster

00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:36.076
government had tried to ban, but people marched anyway.

00:11:37.316 --> 00:11:40.986
Although it was a peaceful march, they were violently attacked

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:44.356
by the police, which was almost exclusively Protestant.

00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:49.286
The images of police brutality were broadcast across the

00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:53.126
world, showing unarmed civilians being beaten in the streets.

00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:59.726
It’s important to understand that these protests were not initially about Irish

00:11:59.746 --> 00:12:04.726
unification; they were primarily about improved civil rights for Catholics.

00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:10.686
But the government’s heavy-handed response only increased tensions.

00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:18.668
Peaceful protests soon spiralled into street violence, and by 1969, the British government

00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:24.588
made the decision to send in the British Army to restore order in Northern Ireland.

00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:30.921
Initially, some in the Catholic community welcomed the soldiers, thinking

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:35.008
they would protect them from Loyalist violence and police brutality.

00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:39.888
But it didn’t take long for this relationship to sour.

00:12:40.888 --> 00:12:46.558
As the soldiers’ role shifted from peacekeeping to maintaining order, they were soon seen

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:52.608
as occupiers rather than peacekeepers by the Catholic Nationalist community, especially

00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:57.466
when their presence became more about stopping the IRA, the Irish Republican Army.

00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:02.906
Now, the IRA had played a pivotal role back at the start of

00:13:02.976 --> 00:13:07.136
the 20th century, but they had largely been dormant since then.

00:13:08.216 --> 00:13:14.106
They sprung back into action as a reaction to the British Army arriving in Northern Ireland, but

00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:22.426
like many paramilitary groups, they split along ideological lines: on the one side was the Official

00:13:22.466 --> 00:13:30.636
IRA, which focused on Marxist politics and largely renounced violence, and on the other was the

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:37.696
Provisional IRA, which believed in armed struggle as the only way to achieve Irish reunification.

00:13:38.716 --> 00:13:44.346
To keep things simple going forward, I’ll use IRA as a synonym for the Provisional

00:13:44.346 --> 00:13:48.796
IRA, the more violent wing, which had the larger role during The Troubles.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:54.286
The IRA saw themselves as the defenders of the Catholic population of

00:13:54.286 --> 00:13:59.566
Northern Ireland, fighting against British rule and for a united Ireland.

00:14:00.396 --> 00:14:03.996
And they were prepared to do almost anything to achieve it.

00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:09.876
On the other side were the Loyalist paramilitary groups, such as the Ulster

00:14:09.876 --> 00:14:15.746
Volunteer Force, the UVF, and the Ulster Defence Association, or the UDA.

00:14:17.076 --> 00:14:22.756
These groups were just as determined to keep Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, and

00:14:23.016 --> 00:14:29.576
they targeted Catholics, Nationalists, and anyone they saw as a threat to Unionist dominance.

00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:35.206
And these two groups fought each other, tooth and nail.

00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:40.696
As violence escalated, Northern Ireland became a battleground,

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:45.616
with bombings, shootings, and riots becoming a part of daily life.

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:53.186
Entire neighbourhoods were divided along sectarian lines, and the Peace Walls, like the one at

00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:59.126
Canmore Close, began to be built to physically separate Catholic and Protestant communities.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:06.056
And of course, there was the British Army, numbering 21,000 at its peak, a

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:11.606
permanent reminder of what was to many Nationalists a colonial, occupying, force.

00:15:12.526 --> 00:15:20.706
So you had this increasingly volatile situation: militant groups on both sides, the army, and

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:25.996
trapped in the middle the millions of civilians just trying to go about their daily lives.

00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:30.164
Unfortunately, things would only get worse.

00:15:31.049 --> 00:15:37.486
1972 was the bloodiest year of the conflict, with over 470 people killed.

00:15:38.686 --> 00:15:43.166
One of the most infamous events of that year, and of the entire Troubles,

00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:48.666
was Bloody Sunday, which you might know from the U2 song “Bloody Sunday”.

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:55.646
On January 30, 1972, there was a civil rights march in Derry.

00:15:56.476 --> 00:16:01.546
These marches had become increasingly common, and would normally involve young

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:06.826
Catholic men marching, and perhaps throwing the occasional stone at the lines of

00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:11.572
policemen or soldiers who would be there to ensure no serious violence broke out.

00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:15.676
But this march went differently.

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:19.820
British soldiers opened fire on the protesters.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.830
Fourteen people were killed.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.910
The British government claimed the soldiers were responding to

00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:32.330
IRA gunfire, but this version of events was widely discredited.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:41.300
An inquiry held decades later concluded that the victims were unarmed, innocent and posed no threat.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.140
Bloody Sunday was a turning point.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.940
It fueled even greater anger among the Catholic community and

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.820
significantly increased support for and membership of the IRA.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.070
Peaceful protests for civil rights looked like they were going nowhere.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.057
And the IRA offered an alternative path.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:11.210
The violence intensified, and the conflict became even more entrenched.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:17.900
The IRA responded with bombing campaigns targeting British soldiers, government

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:23.250
buildings, and even civilian areas in both Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.210
And the numbers here are staggering.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:36.070
Over the course of The Troubles, there were 16,000 bombings and 37,000 shootings.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:45.630
47,541 people were injured, and 3,720 people were killed, of

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:52.710
whom 54% were civilians, and 41% were under the age of 25.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.817
And another particularly troubling statistic is that every single day of

00:17:58.817 --> 00:18:03.867
the year marks the anniversary of someone being killed during the Troubles.

00:18:04.377 --> 00:18:09.301
Today, whenever you are listening to this episode, someone, somewhere

00:18:09.383 --> 00:18:13.507
is marking the anniversary of a relative killed in the Troubles.

00:18:14.527 --> 00:18:19.597
It was a seemingly unstoppable cycle of tit-for-tat murder.

00:18:20.747 --> 00:18:26.457
A Protestant area would be bombed, so a Catholic civilian would be murdered in retaliation.

00:18:27.477 --> 00:18:30.807
And again, it was not as simple as Protestant vs.

00:18:30.817 --> 00:18:32.767
Catholic, or Irish vs.

00:18:32.797 --> 00:18:33.287
British.

00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:37.447
On both sides there were multiple different groups, all with

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:42.697
different aims, beliefs, and viewpoints on how to achieve their goals.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:49.098
And by the mid-1970s, it seemed as though there was no way out.

00:18:49.737 --> 00:18:55.597
Violence had become part of daily life, with both sides suffering terrible losses.

00:18:56.217 --> 00:19:01.785
Checkpoints, bomb scares, people being kidnapped and murdered in the middle of the night.

00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:05.707
The divisions between Catholic and Protestant communities,

00:19:05.847 --> 00:19:09.757
which had always been present, now seemed impossible to bridge.

00:19:11.287 --> 00:19:16.547
Given the guerilla nature of the violence, and the fact that this was no ordinary

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:23.087
war, the police took a heavy-handed approach, and would often round up large groups

00:19:23.087 --> 00:19:27.617
of young men if there was even a whiff of suspicion that they had been involved

00:19:27.627 --> 00:19:33.167
in violent activity, particularly if they were suspected to be part of the IRA.

00:19:34.147 --> 00:19:37.677
They would be carted off to the purpose-built Maze

00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:42.127
Prison, which housed suspected and convicted IRA members.

00:19:43.397 --> 00:19:48.317
And this infamous prison was the setting for a significant event that

00:19:48.327 --> 00:19:53.607
helped change the course of the conflict—the Hunger Strikes of 1981.

00:19:54.677 --> 00:19:59.487
These hunger strikes were led by IRA prisoners who were being held in the prison.

00:20:00.487 --> 00:20:04.297
Some of these men, it would later transpire, were completely

00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:07.537
innocent, they had just been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:20:08.557 --> 00:20:14.437
But others had committed acts of extreme violence, they had planted bombs that

00:20:14.437 --> 00:20:18.647
had killed dozens of people, they had murdered innocent women and children.

00:20:19.582 --> 00:20:24.555
Acts with awful consequences, but these prisoners considered

00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:29.345
themselves political prisoners and demanded to be treated as such.

00:20:30.445 --> 00:20:34.795
Political prisoners typically didn’t have to do things like wear prison

00:20:34.805 --> 00:20:39.615
uniforms or do prison work, and that’s what these prisoners wanted.

00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:46.495
And when the British government, led by Margaret Thatcher, refused their demands, a group of

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:52.995
prisoners led by a young man called Bobby Sands went on hunger strike, they refused to eat.

00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:59.575
This was all over the media, and support for the strikers was so great that Bobby

00:20:59.615 --> 00:21:04.375
Sands got enough votes in a by-election to be voted into the British Parliament.

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:13.955
But after 66 days on hunger strike, and now as an absentee British MP, Sands died.

00:21:14.905 --> 00:21:18.325
His death, along with the deaths of nine other hunger strikers,

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:22.635
galvanised support for the IRA and the wider Republican movement.

00:21:23.475 --> 00:21:28.275
The fact that these young men would give their lives for the cause attracted huge

00:21:28.295 --> 00:21:33.655
international attention and brought the conflict in Northern Ireland into the global spotlight.

00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:41.665
And while the hunger strikes, and the deaths were tragic, they also marked a turning point.

00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:46.975
The IRA began to realise that political means might be

00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:50.245
more effective than violence in achieving their goals.

00:21:51.835 --> 00:21:56.275
And against the backdrop of all of this bloody violence, behind the

00:21:56.275 --> 00:22:00.425
scenes, there had been secret talks taking place between the British

00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:05.685
government, Irish politicians, and paramilitary leaders from both sides.

00:22:06.695 --> 00:22:11.325
To state the obvious, these were very tense and difficult negotiations.

00:22:12.285 --> 00:22:17.285
Many of the leaders, especially those on the paramilitary side, would refuse to

00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:22.455
be in the same room, such was the hatred and vitriol they had for one another.

00:22:23.955 --> 00:22:28.305
Plus, a condition for peace talks even starting would typically

00:22:28.315 --> 00:22:33.335
be a ceasefire and some form of decommissioning of weapons.

00:22:34.605 --> 00:22:40.325
And, perhaps perfectly understandably, groups like the IRA didn’t want to surrender

00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:46.005
their weapons, as the threat of more violence was one of the main cards up their sleeve.

00:22:47.295 --> 00:22:53.175
Now, to cut a very long story short, the culmination of over a decade of

00:22:53.175 --> 00:23:00.275
talks led to the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed on April 10th, 1998.

00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:05.795
This agreement was signed by the government of Ireland, the government of

00:23:05.795 --> 00:23:10.525
Great Britain and eight different political groups in Northern Ireland.

00:23:11.925 --> 00:23:17.145
Key to the agreement was the creation of a new Northern Irish political assembly,

00:23:17.645 --> 00:23:22.865
which would contain representatives from both Unionist and Nationalist communities.

00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:27.645
It also included the requirement for paramilitary groups to

00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:32.605
decommission their weapons, and for British security forces to leave.

00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:39.435
And importantly, controversially, it required the release of all political

00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:43.755
prisoners during The Troubles, no matter what they had been convicted of.

00:23:44.565 --> 00:23:50.150
People who had murdered and tortured, people from both the Unionist and Nationalist

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.360
sides who had committed acts of extreme violence, they were to walk free.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.750
Serious compromises were made on both sides, but the agreement was signed.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:09.390
The deal was hailed as a breakthrough, a masterpiece of diplomacy, which brought

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:15.070
together so many distinct groups that had such a visceral distrust of one another.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.810
And it has worked, for the most part.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.960
It was put to the test a few months afterwards, when in August of

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.960
1998 a splinter group of the IRA called the “Real IRA” detonated a car

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.660
bomb that killed 29 people in the town of Omagh, in Northern Ireland.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:40.410
But the reaction to this was, for the most part, one of disgust.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:46.760
People had had enough of the violence and they had just enjoyed a few months of peace.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:52.080
There was little appetite to return to the violence of the 1970s and 1980s,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:58.950
and fortunately, ever since, attacks and killings have reduced significantly.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:06.110
But they have not stopped; since the signing of the Good Friday agreement more than

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:12.100
25 years ago there have been more than 150 people killed related to the conflict.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:18.580
It is a significant improvement, a drop of 96%, but there

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.140
are still 150 more dead bodies than there should be.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.870
And the hard-won peace is a tenuous one.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.380
While Catholics and Protestants might have equal opportunities and there is no

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.400
longer the same extent of structural persecution, there is clear segregation.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:44.480
The Peace Lines are still up, and on one side there are murals, wall paintings, of

00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:50.680
IRA members brandishing machine guns and the Irish flag, while on the other you’ll

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.480
find the Union Jack, the flag of Great Britain, flying proudly above shops and houses.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.370
If you remember, 41% of all of the people killed during The Troubles were under the

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:09.600
age of 25, and most members of the paramilitary groups on both sides were young men.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.120
This category of people today, anyone under the age of 25,

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.490
was not born when the Good Friday Agreement was signed.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.480
And this is a fear about Northern Ireland.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:29.490
One of the key things that keeps the peace is the lived memory of how bad things were,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.710
and the young people of today who might think their political aims can be furthered by

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:40.520
violence have no personal experience of what life was really like during the period.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.510
Fortunately, tens of millions of people across Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:55.130
can remember, and it is their and our responsibility to make sure that nobody forgets.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.520
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Troubles.

00:27:00.771 --> 00:27:05.751
I mentioned it at the start, but it is such a complicated period of history and there are

00:27:05.771 --> 00:27:10.541
so many interesting elements to it that we didn’t have time to talk about today, from going

00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:15.831
deeper into the political aims of each group through to stories of spies, murder, and more.

00:27:16.481 --> 00:27:22.171
And there is also the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland, which is a topic for its own episode.

00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:26.711
If it’s a subject that you feel you’d like to delve more into,

00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:30.727
I’d highly recommend a podcast called “The Troubles Podcast”.

00:27:31.091 --> 00:27:36.121
There are almost 100 episodes, each nearly an hour long, and the host speaks

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:40.551
clearly with a wonderful Irish accent, so if you’d like to explore this

00:27:40.551 --> 00:27:44.891
subject further, that’s the one to go for, it’s called “The Troubles Podcast”..

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:50.571
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:27:50.991 --> 00:27:56.516
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

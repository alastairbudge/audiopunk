Hello, hello,hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.039
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.159
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.999
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the fantastic life of Caravaggio.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.797
He is widely considered to be one of the fathers of modern

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:38.907
painting, and during his life was the most famous artist in Rome.

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.746
But he was a troublemaker, both in his work and his

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:48.406
life, and he pushed the boundaries of art and of the law.

00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:55.046
Not many artists, or even people, have lived such an adventurous

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:59.276
life, so without further ado, let’s get right into it.

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:04.456
Not a huge amount is known about the early life of

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:08.186
Caravaggio, but here’s what is believed to be true.

00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:16.946
He was born in 1571, near Milan, in Northern Italy, to a relatively poor family.

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:23.936
After a plague hit Milan, when he was only around 5 years old, his family

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:30.116
escaped from Milan, to a town called Caravaggio, about 40km to the east.

00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:33.826
It was from this town that he took his name.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:38.156
At birth, Caravaggio wasn’t his name, it was Michelangelo

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:42.456
Merisi, but he took the name after the town where he grew up.

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:50.086
Unfortunately, moving away from Milan wasn’t enough to save his family from the plague.

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:58.046
Within two years of being in the town of Caravaggio, his father, his paternal grandparents

00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:05.226
and his uncle had all died, with his father and grandfather dying on the same day.

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:11.346
And by his 21st birthday, his youngest brother and his

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:15.596
mother had also died, leaving Caravaggio an orphan.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:23.835
He left to seek his fortune in Milan, becoming an apprentice to a Milanese painter

00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:29.805
called Simone Peterzano, and supporting himself through painting portraits.

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:37.915
If you think of Milan now, you might think of a chic, modern, fashionable Italian city.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:43.265
Milan in the late 16th century was very different.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:50.455
It was a dangerous city, full of violence and crime, and judging by his

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:55.895
actions, the young Caravaggio was a perfect fit for this city of sin.

00:02:57.465 --> 00:03:04.905
He had experienced tragic loss at a young age, and was really without any family, any

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:10.314
roots, without anyone to judge him, and without anyone to put him on the right path.

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:16.054
He was completely on his own, and he swiftly got into a lot of trouble.

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:22.894
It’s not known exactly what Caravaggio did, but he got into some kind of

00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:28.644
fight that resulted in a police officer getting hurt, and he left for Rome.

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:34.474
This will become a bit of a theme in Caravaggio’s life - things starting

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:39.284
to go reasonably well, then him getting into trouble and having to flee.

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:46.354
So, some time around 1592, still in his very early 20s,

00:03:46.964 --> 00:03:51.994
Caravaggio arrived in Rome, with no name, no money, no nothing.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:04:00.844
He did odd-jobs for painters, just managing to earn enough to feed himself and keep himself alive.

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:07.734
He got a big break when he caught the eye of a Roman Cardinal, a man called

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:12.944
Francesco del Monte, who essentially sponsored Caravaggio, giving him

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:18.144
his own house, paying him a wage, and commissioning art from Caravaggio.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:25.604
It was during this period that he started to develop his own, unique painting style.

00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:33.014
Now, we aren’t going to talk in great detail about his actual art because you are listening

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:38.764
to this and I can’t actually show you the images, and also because this is more about the

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:44.994
story of his turbulent life than his art, but the two are of course very closely linked.

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:52.814
As you may know, Baroque art was mainly of religious scenes, and the religious figures

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:59.694
in the paintings all looked relatively similar, and idealised, not like ‘real people’.

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:04.364
That was the point, of course, they were figures from the Bible,

00:05:04.364 --> 00:05:07.954
and naturally they shouldn’t look like people off the street.

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.964
But this wasn’t what Caravaggio thought.

00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:16.804
He rejected this polished, perfect, idealised style

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:20.744
that was used by artists like Raphael and Michelangelo.

00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:30.024
Caravaggio used real models from the streets of Rome, beggars, prostitutes, street children,

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:37.434
and painted them in a religious context as they really were, with all of their imperfections.

00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:46.754
There is a famous painting with Cupid with dirty feet and broken fingernails, and also

00:05:46.774 --> 00:05:53.554
one where Caravaggio painted the Virgin Mary and used a famous prostitute as his model.

00:05:54.994 --> 00:06:00.284
Frequently, when he presented these works to the patrons that had

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:05.084
commissioned them, they were appalled and asked him to redo them.

00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:11.014
You couldn’t depict the Madonna or Jesus like that, it was almost blasphemous.

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:17.204
From a stylistic point of view, the other main thing that Caravaggio was

00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:23.554
most famous for was his use of light, and if you look at his paintings, they

00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:29.394
are almost all dark, with deep shadows, and then a sudden, revealing light.

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:37.079
Nobody did this before, as previously everything was depicted in shining light.

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.296
But Caravaggio existed in the darkness, in his private life as well.

00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:48.846
By the time he was in Rome, he had developed a reputation for

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:53.846
being a troublemaker, and he would go out looking for fights.

00:06:55.286 --> 00:07:01.216
Reportedly he would paint for 2 weeks, then spend the next 2 months wandering

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:06.306
around Rome, with a sword by his side, looking for fights and arguments.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:14.136
And, unlike with some other artists, where they kept meticulous diaries and notes,

00:07:14.396 --> 00:07:20.536
meaning that historians have a much easier time figuring out what they did, or what

00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:25.836
their character was, our knowledge of Caravaggio comes really just from two things.

00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:29.046
His paintings, and his criminal record.

00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:33.126
And his criminal record was pretty lengthy.

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:39.406
He would frequently engage in duels, when you challenge someone else to a fight, and

00:07:39.686 --> 00:07:45.816
seems to have been a very angry young man, looking to fight anyone, for any reason.

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:50.536
He would carry a sword and a dagger, a little knife,

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:55.126
everywhere, and reportedly he would occasionally carry a pistol.

00:07:55.906 --> 00:08:01.666
Although this was illegal, Caravaggio would boast that if he was ever

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:06.076
caught he would never get into trouble, because his patrons, the people who

00:08:06.106 --> 00:08:10.316
commissioned his paintings, were very powerful and they could protect him.

00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:19.176
His crimes include getting into a fight with a waiter, and throwing a plate of cooked artichokes

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:28.026
in his face, making a hole in the ceiling of his studio, throwing stones at his landlady, writing

00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:35.826
satirical and very rude poems about another man’s wife, and a whole array of general bad behaviour.

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:43.826
And although he was by this time a very successful painter, and by some people’s

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:48.806
standards the most in demand painter in the whole of Rome, he would still

00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:55.586
live on the streets, gambling, drinking, visiting prostitutes, and living a

00:08:55.586 --> 00:09:00.426
very different life to the religious figures he would spend his days painting.

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:07.986
Then in May 1606, when he was 35 years old, his bad-boy

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:13.706
behaviour reached an entirely new, but not unexpected, level.

00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:16.196
He murdered a man.

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:24.896
Accounts differ over exactly what happened here, but he killed a man called Ranuccio Tomassoni.

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:31.006
One theory goes that Caravaggio and Tomassoni had an argument

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:36.086
over a woman, potentially a prostitute, or even Tomassoni’s wife.

00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:43.976
Other theories say it could have been a gambling debt, or even an argument over a game of tennis.

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:50.766
In any case, there was an argument, and Caravaggio and Tomassoni agreed to fight.

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:58.866
As you did in those days, they arranged to meet at a specific time and place, with their supporters.

00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:03.846
It was during this fight that Caravaggio killed Tomassoni,

00:10:04.686 --> 00:10:10.236
reportedly trying to castrate him, trying to chop off his testicles.

00:10:11.526 --> 00:10:17.356
That, of course, is horrible, and the reason that has been put forward for

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:23.166
Caravaggio trying to do that is that it was a sign that the fight was over a woman.

00:10:24.456 --> 00:10:28.306
In those days if the fight had been caused by an insult

00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:31.986
to you personally, you might try to cut someone's face.

00:10:33.096 --> 00:10:38.626
If the fight had been over a woman, one person might try to cut off the other person’s genitals.

00:10:39.426 --> 00:10:40.816
I know, gross, right?

00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:49.216
In any case, Caravaggio was a murderer, and even his high-powered patrons couldn’t protect him.

00:10:50.446 --> 00:10:54.256
He fled Rome immediately, and was exiled from the city.

00:10:55.356 --> 00:11:01.256
There was even a price put on his head, so anyone in the Papal States, which

00:11:01.466 --> 00:11:05.896
included most of central Italy, could receive a reward for killing him.

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:11.566
Caravaggio wasn’t safe anywhere near Rome, and so he headed

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:16.456
south, first to Naples, where he stayed for around 9 months.

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:24.546
Although he was a violent, known murderer, his artistic talents meant that he was still in high

00:11:24.546 --> 00:11:31.306
demand, and he worked on several paintings that you can still see in the churches of Naples today.

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:38.236
However, he was still a wanted man, with a price on his head, and he

00:11:38.236 --> 00:11:43.296
couldn’t return to Rome unless he was given a pardon for the murder.

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:51.016
At this time, the small island of Malta, to the south of Sicily, was the headquarters of

00:11:51.016 --> 00:11:57.656
the Knights of St John, a Catholic military order, and Caravaggio thought that he could go

00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:03.906
to Malta, gain the favour of the knights there, and they would be able to get him a pardon.

00:12:05.436 --> 00:12:13.146
So in 1607, he arrived in Malta, offered his services, and the knights were honoured

00:12:13.156 --> 00:12:18.846
to have, really, one of Europe’s most famous painters as their official painter.

00:12:20.186 --> 00:12:24.896
He quickly became a favourite of the Knights, and was admitted

00:12:25.086 --> 00:12:28.086
to the order, and Caravaggio became a Knight of Malta.

00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:35.566
He continued to paint in his signature style, and if you come to Malta, and I

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:40.506
would definitely recommend you do, you’ll see one of his most famous works, the

00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:45.706
beheading of St John The Baptist, in the cathedral of the capital city, Valletta.

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:53.816
The theme of beheading, of religious characters getting their heads chopped off was a common

00:12:53.816 --> 00:13:00.916
one for Caravaggio, and he would paint his own face as the face of the chopped off head.

00:13:02.486 --> 00:13:07.336
The theory behind this is that Caravaggio was obsessed with this idea

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:13.106
that he was in effect a dead man, Caravaggio was only a severed head.

00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:20.256
He had a price on his head, so that anyone in the Papal States could kill him and get a reward.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:25.446
But I don’t think this is time to feel sorry for Caravaggio.

00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:31.486
He hadn’t changed his ways when he got to Malta, and although he had

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:36.886
been given this great opportunity, and been made a Knight of Malta, he

00:13:36.896 --> 00:13:41.800
didn’t change his ways, he didn't start living an honest, crime-free life.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:50.160
He would still drink and fight, and one evening in August 1608 he picked a fight with the

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.850
wrong man, a man called Fra Giovanni Rodomonte Roero, one of the top knights of Malta.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.620
Very much not something that you should be doing if you are looking

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.790
to the knights to put in a good word for you, to get you a pardon.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.550
Caravaggio was arrested, and thrown into prison.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.220
It looked like this was game over for him.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.960
But he managed to escape from jail, and escape from Malta.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.720
He fled, again, this time north, to Sicily.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:29.350
This was still only in 1608, so he was only 37 years old at the time.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.960
He floated around a bit in Sicily, still winning well-paid commissions.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.720
Just like it was in Malta, he was still a known murderer

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.290
and violent man, but he was an excellent artist.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:51.860
While in Sicily, his behaviour started to get more and more erratic, and

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.010
he reportedly would sleep fully clothed with a sword by his side, and he

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:03.120
would rip up an entire painting if there was even a word of criticism.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.380
He stayed for around 9 months in Sicily, and then returned to Naples,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.100
where he had enjoyed some success a couple of years beforehand.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.030
Obviously, when he got to Naples he didn’t manage to stay out of

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:23.770
trouble, and he was viciously attacked outside a tavern, his face

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.480
slashed, he was cut horribly, and left with really damaging wounds.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:37.190
It’s not known exactly why he was attacked, but over the years he had certainly made enough enemies.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:46.650
Caravaggio thought it was a retribution for attacking Fra Giovanni Rodomonte Roero back in Malta.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.140
Caravaggio painted a picture of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:56.510
and again painted his own head as the decapitated head of John The Baptist.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.310
He sent it to the Knights of Malta in an attempt to be forgiven, but it didn’t work.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.030
However, through other channels Caravaggio thought he was having

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:14.400
better luck, and friends in Rome told him that the pope’s nephew, a

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.530
cardinal called Scipione Borghese, would be able to secure him a pardon.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:27.180
In 1610 he travelled back towards Rome by boat, from Naples, with 3

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.643
paintings that he was planning to give to Borghese, the pope's nephew.

00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:36.873
When he got off the boat just outside Rome, it’s thought that he was

00:16:36.873 --> 00:16:41.053
arrested by a captain, who didn’t know anything about this pardon.

00:16:42.623 --> 00:16:45.903
Caravaggio was released, but the paintings were still on

00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:48.903
the boat, which had already left, and travelled north.

00:16:50.283 --> 00:16:53.233
Caravaggio rushed north, and tried to find the ship

00:16:53.543 --> 00:16:56.913
in a port called Porto Ercole, to the north of Rome.

00:16:57.673 --> 00:16:59.443
However the ship wasn’t there.

00:17:00.883 --> 00:17:05.393
We don’t know a huge amount about exactly what did happen there, but

00:17:05.393 --> 00:17:12.973
what we do know is that on the 18th July 1610, Caravaggio died, aged 39.

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:17.583
Historians are divided over what killed him.

00:17:18.993 --> 00:17:22.793
Some say it was a fever, perhaps malaria.

00:17:23.636 --> 00:17:29.246
Others say that he succumbed to the injuries from being attacked in Naples.

00:17:30.796 --> 00:17:37.936
It’s also been suggested that the lead in his paint might have poisoned him, and also have

00:17:37.936 --> 00:17:43.646
been the thing that was responsible for driving him mad in the final years of his life.

00:17:45.216 --> 00:17:50.116
There are theories that it was Fra Giovanni Rodomonte Roero, the man who he had

00:17:50.116 --> 00:17:55.286
attacked in Malta, who had followed him all the way back to Italy and murdered him.

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:59.316
While others think it was the family of Tomassoni,

00:17:59.976 --> 00:18:03.646
the man murdered by Caravaggio in Rome 4 years before.

00:18:05.186 --> 00:18:09.936
Whatever it was that killed him, he died alone, in a town where he knew

00:18:09.936 --> 00:18:14.966
nobody, without any of his paintings, and without anyone to comfort him.

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:22.536
Quite an ignominious end, but consistent really with the way in which he lived his life.

00:18:23.976 --> 00:18:27.126
The legacy of Caravaggio is still alive and well,

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:30.456
and he has had a huge influence on the world of art.

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:35.876
Not just on other painters, but his use of shadows has been

00:18:35.876 --> 00:18:40.713
credited by filmmakers such as David LaChapelle and Martin Scorcese.

00:18:40.713 --> 00:18:41.789
Indeed if you watch a Scorcese film, you can clearly see he uses

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:50.305
a lot of the techniques that Caravaggio used 400 years beforehand.

00:18:51.405 --> 00:18:55.295
Caravaggio was undoubtedly a fantastic artist, and has

00:18:55.305 --> 00:18:58.385
had a huge impact on artists from all over the world.

00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:06.575
But he was also, evidently, a pretty horrible man, and ultimately a violent murderer.

00:19:07.635 --> 00:19:14.785
These days, when historical characters are being examined with our 21st century sense of morality,

00:19:15.245 --> 00:19:21.755
you might ask yourself, does it matter that the creator of beautiful art was a horrible man?

00:19:22.535 --> 00:19:26.025
Does this make you think differently about the work that he did?

00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:29.275
Or does it not matter in the slightest?

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:35.375
It is an interesting question, and the answer I think I will leave you to think about.

00:19:36.395 --> 00:19:40.945
But all I’ll say on this is that luckily for the Caravaggio fans out

00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:45.495
there, there don’t seem to be any plans to cancel Caravaggio just yet.

00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:55.071
OK then, so that is it for the fantastic life of Caravaggio, probably the baddest of

00:19:55.071 --> 00:20:00.781
the bad-boy painters, certainly not a very nice man, but a brilliant, troubled, artist.

00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:04.761
If you haven’t ever seen any of the works of Caravaggio

00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:08.051
before, I’d definitely recommend having a look.

00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:12.951
Naturally, they are completely different in the flesh, and if you ever

00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:16.931
are in the same city as a Caravaggio, it’s definitely worth the trip.

00:20:18.191 --> 00:20:22.171
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show, and of this episode.

00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:26.881
We are just about to launch a new forum for you to discuss

00:20:26.881 --> 00:20:29.701
episodes and discuss anything you would like to discuss.

00:20:30.123 --> 00:20:31.003
So if that is not

00:20:31.003 --> 00:20:32.033
ready yet then you can

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:38.113
email hi @leonardoenglish.com, otherwise the forum will be on the website.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:42.603
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

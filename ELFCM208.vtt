Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.780
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.270
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about James Bond.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.800
Now, you have probably seen some of the movies, you may have read some of the books, but

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.200
today we are going to go a little bit deeper into the story of this iconic British spy.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.380
We’ll talk about how James Bond got started, and the life and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.840
times of the author of the James Bond novels, Ian Fleming.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.710
We’ll then talk about the films, how not only the James Bond actors have changed

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.890
over the years and for what reasons, but also the character of James Bond.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.460
We’ll also talk about the unusual business of James Bond, and how, although it is a

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.940
huge, multinational franchise and its films are shown in countries all over the world,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.890
the production is controlled by a small family, it’s essentially a family business.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.170
And finally, because this is after all a show about English, we’ll talk

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.700
about the language of James Bond, the various different accents he has

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.680
had, and also how he speaks various foreign languages to different degrees.

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:39.355
OK then, Bond, James Bond.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:45.325
When you hear the name “James Bond”, a certain image probably comes to mind.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:52.115
For many it might be a man in a smart tuxedo, a black dinner jacket.

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:57.865
He might be sitting at a card table, he might be holding a gun, he might

00:01:57.865 --> 00:02:03.785
be about to seduce an elegant woman or about to jump out of an aeroplane.

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:09.155
He is undoubtedly handsome, and likely has a certain

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:14.345
type of rugged, a rough look, as if he has known danger.

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:20.495
The exact image you have in mind probably depends on your age, and

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:25.285
is due to the actor who played James Bond when you were growing up.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:31.765
But the real James Bond, who James Bond was really meant to be, was the

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:37.361
creation of Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond series of books.

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:43.751
Ian Fleming was, in many ways, a quintessential upper-class Englishman.

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:51.671
Born in 1907, he came from a very rich family, and was educated at Eton,

00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:57.031
the most famous private school in the country and the school that countless

00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:01.491
Kings, Prime Ministers, and other members of the royal family went to.

00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:06.661
After serving in the Naval Intelligence Division in the Second World War,

00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:11.361
he developed a knowledge of how British Intelligence services worked.

00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:18.971
After the end of the war, he worked in journalism, but longed to write a spy novel.

00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:28.281
He started work on his first one in February 1952, an idea that was to become Casino Royale, his

00:03:28.281 --> 00:03:36.171
first novel, his first hit, and the start of the most successful spy franchise in world history.

00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:42.691
Much like many books that we now consider to be huge successes, the

00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:47.851
first James Bond novel wasn’t an immediate hit with the publishers.

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:52.101
Fleming was advised to publish it under a pseudonym,

00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:56.091
under a pen name, to avoid personal embarrassment.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:02.201
It was only after the intervention of Fleming’s brother, who was a

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:07.311
relatively successful author, that a publisher finally agreed to publish it.

00:04:08.107 --> 00:04:12.617
It was so successful that three different print runs had to

00:04:12.617 --> 00:04:17.067
be made, it was evident that Fleming was on to something.

00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:20.867
He continued to write the adventures of James Bond,

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:26.167
publishing 14 separate adventures of this iconic British spy.

00:04:26.942 --> 00:04:32.017
Fleming’s creation was, in many ways, very different from the

00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:36.437
James Bond that you might be imagining from the James Bond films.

00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:42.677
In the James Bond books, yes James Bond is the protagonist but the

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:48.087
character James Bond is less developed than he is in some of the films.

00:04:48.927 --> 00:04:56.387
To quote Fleming directly, “exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would

00:04:56.397 --> 00:05:03.937
be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.”

00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:12.327
The James Bond of the novels was a machine, a blank canvas, the reader saw the adventures

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:18.637
through his eyes, but there was little examination of the character of the protagonist.

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:24.947
This was, interestingly enough, why his name was chosen to be James Bond.

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:32.216
You may know that both James and Bond are relatively common names in Britain.

00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:40.056
Fleming chose these two common names for his main character precisely because he wanted him to

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:47.296
blend into the background, to be anonymous against the backdrop of the adventures he was living.

00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:55.616
To quote Fleming again, "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find”.

00:05:56.876 --> 00:06:05.166
The James Bond of the Bond novels was also much more aggressive, fighting, drinking, smoking,

00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:11.206
he was very different to the James Bond played by someone like Pierce Brosnan, for example.

00:06:12.656 --> 00:06:18.016
The novels did bring Ian Fleming success and fame, but they didn’t

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:22.036
really translate into the great riches that many might think.

00:06:23.176 --> 00:06:31.016
He sold the film rights to his first book, Casino Royale, for $1,000, today’s equivalent of

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:40.006
around $10,000, and later sold the rights to all of his books except Casino Royale for $50k.

00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:47.516
That’s today’s equivalent of about half a million dollars, so certainly not bad at all,

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:54.376
but a pretty raw deal when you consider that the James Bond franchise has now generated

00:06:54.566 --> 00:07:03.706
around $14 billion on an inflation-adjusted basis, and almost everyone involved in them at

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:09.836
a high level made considerably more money than Ian Fleming, the creator of the character.

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:15.016
Fleming died in 1964, at the age of 56.

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:21.066
Like his most famous creation, he had been a heavy drinker and smoker

00:07:21.326 --> 00:07:26.586
all of his adult life, and died of a heart attack after a large meal.

00:07:27.566 --> 00:07:31.976
His reported last words were very English, he said to the

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:36.366
paramedics in the ambulance, "I am sorry to trouble you, chaps.

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:40.746
I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days."

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:47.456
Now, Fleming died just as the Bond franchise was getting going, but not

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:52.466
before he had had the opportunity to see the first film adaptation of

00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:59.166
his creation, the 1962 movie Dr No, with Sean Connery as James Bond.

00:08:00.406 --> 00:08:07.476
Although many Bond fans would argue that Sean Connery is James Bond, and that he is the best

00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:15.736
actor to have ever been 007, when he was first suggested for the part Fleming was not convinced.

00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:22.576
For starters, Sean Connery is Scottish, and speaks with a Scottish accent.

00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:31.046
The character James Bond did have a Scottish father and a Swiss mother, but the novels have him

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:38.206
growing up in England, going to the same school that Fleming attended, Eton, and living in England.

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:44.276
Fleming’s Bond was decidedly English, and the idea that a

00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:48.266
Scottish actor would play him was concerning to Fleming.

00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:55.226
Secondly, at least before the film was released and Sean Connery was catapulted

00:08:55.346 --> 00:09:01.566
to stardom, he was not considered to be a sophisticated, suave gentleman.

00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:09.886
Connery was tall, muscly, and had actually been an amateur bodybuilder in his home country.

00:09:10.646 --> 00:09:16.156
He was a relatively unknown actor, and he didn’t look at all like

00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:20.316
how Fleming had imagined Bond when he was creating the character.

00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:25.876
However, after the auditions, and after seeing him in action Fleming’s

00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:31.526
mind was changed, and Connery’s sex appeal and deep voice was enough

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:35.966
to convince Fleming that this man could pass as the English spy.

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:43.386
As you probably know, Connery’s performance was very well received, he went on to play James Bond

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:52.616
another five times, and for anyone growing up in the 1960s, Sean Connery simply was James Bond.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:58.726
Since Sean Connery a total of 5 different actors have played James Bond

00:09:58.756 --> 00:10:04.056
in the James Bond films, and six actors if you include David Niven, the

00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:09.986
actor who played James Bond in the TV adaptation of Casino Royale in 1967.

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:16.106
They all have their different quirks, their different characteristics,

00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:21.166
and the actors interpreted the character of James Bond differently.

00:10:21.876 --> 00:10:31.576
Roger Moore, for example, who played 007 from 1973 until 1985, for a total of 7 movies, played a

00:10:31.576 --> 00:10:39.626
slightly comical, tongue-in-cheek Bond, one who cracked jokes and was never particularly serious.

00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:45.206
He was also a much older James Bond - he was 57 during

00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:48.746
the filming of his last Bond film, A View To A Kill.

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:56.616
The Irishman Pierce Brosnan, who played Bond from 1995 to 2002 brought

00:10:56.666 --> 00:11:02.416
back a slick Bond, but by the final films critics complained about

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:07.676
too much product placement and completely unrealistic special effects.

00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:14.356
Then there is Daniel Craig, the actor who has played James Bond since Casino Royale

00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:21.826
in 2006, and whose last Bond film, No Time To Die, was released in Autumn of 2021.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:27.156
He was greatly influenced by Sean Connery’s performance as Bond,

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:32.636
and brought back a complicated character full of his own demons.

00:11:33.936 --> 00:11:39.146
Seasoned Bond fans will note I haven’t mentioned George Lazenby or Timothy Dalton

00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:45.566
here, but they only made three films between them, and rarely come top of anyone’s

00:11:45.566 --> 00:11:50.266
list of the greatest or most influential actors to have played James Bond.

00:11:50.906 --> 00:11:54.796
We can see, through the different actors who have played 007,

00:11:54.946 --> 00:11:59.606
how society and culture has changed over the past 70 years.

00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:07.266
The initial James Bond character of the novels was a hard-living man of the 1950s

00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:13.076
with views and behaviour we would probably consider misogynistic and backward.

00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:20.316
He would smoke up to 70 cigarettes a day, in one book he was recorded as

00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:25.606
drinking a total of 45 different alcoholic drinks, and his relationships

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:31.356
with women were short, inevitably one-sided and often violent.

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:35.986
The early films had characteristics of this James Bond.

00:12:36.186 --> 00:12:42.876
He smoked, drank a lot, and inevitably encountered a lot of women on his adventures.

00:12:43.816 --> 00:12:51.306
In the early films, and even up to the 1970s, Bond would make racist remarks, hit women,

00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:57.876
force himself upon women and behave in a way that would get him into a lot of trouble today.

00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:04.936
As this type of behaviour started to become unacceptable, James Bond changed.

00:13:05.716 --> 00:13:12.256
In 1995 he stopped smoking, although he does smoke a cigar in Die Another Day.

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:17.266
He has also cut back on the drinking, although those of you who

00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:21.206
have seen the most recent film might find that hard to believe.

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:28.116
He still, of course, has a troubled relationship with women, although the James Bond of the

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:35.656
past 25 years does seem capable of more affection than the James Bond of the early 1960s.

00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:40.816
As a sign of the changing times, James Bond’s boss,

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:45.556
“M”, was first a woman in the 1995 film Goldeneye.

00:13:45.946 --> 00:13:53.256
And there seems to be a very real conversation about whether James Bond, or rather the protagonist

00:13:53.336 --> 00:14:00.416
in the James Bond films, always needs to be the white man of Ian Fleming’s books in the 1950s.

00:14:01.486 --> 00:14:07.986
Now, moving on to the business of James Bond, the production of the films has been very tightly

00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:15.296
controlled really by a very small group of people ever since the first film, Dr No, in 1962.

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:23.156
A man called Harry Salzman had bought the rights to turn the James Bond novels into films

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:30.896
for a total of $50,000, plus an extra $100,000 for every book that would become a film.

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:37.816
He teamed up, he got together, with a film producer called Cubby Broccoli, and they

00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:44.076
structured a deal whereby they would get up to 60% of the profits from the films.

00:14:45.616 --> 00:14:51.776
Salzman ended up going bankrupt and having to sell his percentage to the film studio,

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:58.356
United Artists, leaving Cubby Broccoli to have creative control of most of the production

00:14:58.756 --> 00:15:06.266
as well as taking home around 10% of the profits of every James Bond film made ever since.

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:10.906
The Broccoli family continues to make money from every

00:15:10.906 --> 00:15:14.956
single film, often more than the distributors of the film do.

00:15:15.886 --> 00:15:22.376
For example, with the movie Skyfall, which grossed $1.1 billion at the

00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:29.246
box office, the distributors Sony and MGM are thought to have made $236

00:15:29.246 --> 00:15:35.276
million between them while the Broccoli family alone made $109 million.

00:15:36.296 --> 00:15:41.946
The added complication to the business of James Bond is that Amazon recently

00:15:41.946 --> 00:15:48.596
bought MGM, and so the James Bond franchise is partly owned by the Broccoli

00:15:48.596 --> 00:15:54.136
family and partly owned now by Amazon, one of the biggest companies in the world.

00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:59.286
The Broccoli family are considered by many Bond fans

00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:03.596
to have been good custodians of the 007 tradition.

00:16:04.006 --> 00:16:11.836
They have consistently made new films, some better than others, but haven’t exploited the James Bond

00:16:11.916 --> 00:16:18.166
brand and tried to make as much money as possible, they haven’t milked it, to use the expression.

00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:25.036
The fear is that Amazon will come in and make lots of spin-offs, other

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:30.346
movies about peripheral James Bond characters, diluting the beauty

00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:35.076
and pureness of James Bond in order to make as much money as possible.

00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:42.676
There are no signs of this happening just yet, but the fears are that James Bond goes

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:48.956
a similar way to the Star Wars franchise, with a new movie being released every couple

00:16:49.036 --> 00:16:56.516
years, with lots of spin-offs and the true James Bond is lost somewhere along the way.

00:16:57.856 --> 00:17:03.576
Now, let’s end this exploration by looking at the language of James Bond, and

00:17:03.576 --> 00:17:08.656
start by listening to some of the unique accents that this character has had.

00:17:09.316 --> 00:17:14.096
To start, we must listen to Sean Connery, the original James Bond,

00:17:14.096 --> 00:17:19.456
and a man who grew up in Scotland, and has a deep, gravelly voice.

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:25.526
You can always recognise Connery’s Bond as he pronounced “s”

00:17:25.686 --> 00:17:31.156
as “azshh”, so he would say “Jamessh” instead of “James”.

00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:35.446
Let's hear him in the first Bond film, Dr No.

00:17:36.468 --> 00:17:37.038
Yes.

00:17:38.148 --> 00:17:38.598
Tell me Ms.

00:17:38.598 --> 00:17:40.248
Trench do play any other games.

00:17:40.908 --> 00:17:45.528
I mean, besides Chemin de fer?

00:17:45.528 --> 00:17:46.208
Hmm...golf...amongst other things..

00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:48.638
One afternoon then?

00:17:48.963 --> 00:17:49.623
Tomorrow.

00:17:49.623 --> 00:17:53.493
And, will you have dinner afterwards, perhaps?

00:17:56.138 --> 00:18:03.698
Sean Connery tones down his Scottish accent for James Bond, he makes it less evident, and he

00:18:03.698 --> 00:18:11.258
speaks with a sort of Received Pronunciation, but you can still hear the slight accent coming out.

00:18:12.328 --> 00:18:19.968
To help you compare it, here is Sean Connery’s real accent, here’s him talking about Bond again.

00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:23.627
The ingredients are all there for the kind of movie that

00:18:23.627 --> 00:18:27.257
people want to see as it has very good entertaining value.

00:18:28.187 --> 00:18:32.237
Uh, for example, it's a spectrum of actors.

00:18:32.807 --> 00:18:37.269
I mean, from myself to Daniel Craig, who I thought was fantastic, marvelous.

00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:45.944
Now, Roger Moore, the actor who has played Bond in the most films, has a very different accent.

00:18:46.294 --> 00:18:52.524
He grew up in London and southern England, and spoke with a classic Received Pronunciation accent.

00:18:53.264 --> 00:18:53.994
Here's Roger Moore:

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.696
In my country, major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request.

00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:00.106
Granted.

00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:03.131
Let's get out of these wet things.

00:19:04.304 --> 00:19:09.104
And then finally, let’s have a listen to Daniel Craig, who also

00:19:09.244 --> 00:19:13.644
has an English accent, but it is less posh than Roger Moore’s.

00:19:14.414 --> 00:19:17.984
Here’s him ordering 007’s signature drink:

00:19:20.502 --> 00:19:23.442
The name is Bond, James Bond.

00:19:26.142 --> 00:19:30.132
Dry martini, wait, three measures of Gordon's.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.962
One of the vodka half a measure of Kina Lillet.

00:19:32.072 --> 00:19:32.812
Shake it over ice.

00:19:32.832 --> 00:19:33.432
And then add a thin

00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:34.659
slice of lemon peel.

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:39.661
And finally, let’s not forget that James Bond also has a

00:19:39.671 --> 00:19:43.451
greater talent than most English people for learning languages.

00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:48.931
The films and books have him speaking fluent French, Italian and

00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:53.571
German, a bit of Russian, Greek,  Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish.

00:19:53.921 --> 00:19:58.131
So, along with being certainly the UK’s most famous spy,

00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:02.171
this might make him one of the UK’s most talented linguists.

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:12.711
But I have to say his accents aren't that great, or at least the accents

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:14.651
that the actors have when they're speaking foreign languages aren't great.

00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:15.559
Here's a few examples.

00:20:17.608 --> 00:20:28.348
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:20:30.342 --> 00:20:31.432
[ Speaking Russian]

00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:39.838
Now, as we often do in these episodes, it’s worth reflecting

00:20:39.978 --> 00:20:44.128
on the future of James Bond, and on the movie franchise.

00:20:44.668 --> 00:20:49.658
When the books were first written, it was the height of the Cold War, people were

00:20:49.878 --> 00:20:57.268
fascinated by this idea of spies, and Fleming, with James Bond, really popularised

00:20:57.318 --> 00:21:04.748
this idea of the lone spy stopping some terrible despot, some terrible bad person,

00:21:04.818 --> 00:21:10.778
from committing an awful crime, and normally having a lot of fun in the process.

00:21:11.648 --> 00:21:18.438
The genre got a little tired at various points, especially towards the end of the

00:21:18.438 --> 00:21:25.168
Pierce Brosnan era, and it took hard work from Daniel Craig to revive it, making

00:21:25.168 --> 00:21:32.188
James Bond a complex character with plenty of demons, anxieties and even neuroses.

00:21:33.408 --> 00:21:39.258
Instead of having standalone movies, more recent Bond films all link

00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:44.498
together, more like an extended Netflix series than a standalone movie.

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:49.748
Audiences are more demanding now, they do want that complexity

00:21:49.758 --> 00:21:54.308
of character, and James Bond has had to adapt to the times.

00:21:55.058 --> 00:22:03.067
No Time To Die was Daniel Craig’s last outing as James Bond, and I for one, am very excited to

00:22:03.067 --> 00:22:09.507
learn about what will happen in the next chapter of the UK’s most famous secret service agent.

00:22:11.877 --> 00:22:16.597
OK then, that is it for today's episode on James Bond.

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:20.377
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:24.827
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:25.107 --> 00:22:27.027
Who is your favourite James Bond.

00:22:27.257 --> 00:22:27.827
and why?

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:31.717
And what do you think the future holds for James Bond?

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:17.452
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:21.972
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:30.292
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Just War, the ethical and

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:37.032
philosophical theories of when it is right to go to war, and how wars should be fought.

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:42.742
In this episode we’ll start by talking about the early ideas about when

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:47.762
wars can and should be fought, and how they can be morally justified.

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:52.602
We’ll then talk about probably the most famous Just War

00:00:52.612 --> 00:00:56.672
theory, by the Italian philosopher and priest, Thomas Aquinas.

00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:02.132
Then, we’ll move on to how more recent wars have been justified,

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:07.242
some of the alternative theories about when and why countries should

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:11.962
go to war, and what this actually all means on a practical basis.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:16.692
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get started right away.

00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:24.282
Since the beginning of time, humans have fought to solve disagreements.

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:30.742
Both on a one-to-one level, so a caveman punching another one in the face because

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:36.482
he stole food from him, and on a much larger level, with hundreds of thousands of

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:42.052
people lining up opposite each other and killing each other until one side gave up.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:49.842
While this episode isn’t going to be an argument either for or against the idea that war

00:01:49.862 --> 00:01:55.402
is a natural thing for humans to be doing, there can be little doubt that for as long

00:01:55.442 --> 00:02:01.252
as humans have existed, we have resorted to violence as a means of solving problems.

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:07.742
There’s a phrase in English that goes “All’s fair in love and war”, which

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:13.202
means when it comes to affairs of love, or of fighting, there are no rules.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:20.322
But while this might be a catchy and memorable phrase, and is one that’s used by

00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:25.142
people actually having extra-marital affairs - they’re of course talking about the

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:31.232
love, rather than the war – we’ll find out that there are some rules, and certainly a

00:02:31.232 --> 00:02:37.892
lot of theories, that cover what is and isn’t fair, or just, when it comes to ‘war’.

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:44.882
Given that fighting has been a theme throughout history, philosophers, religious leaders,

00:02:45.062 --> 00:02:50.562
and thinkers have devoted a large amount of time considering the question of war.

00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:53.932
When is it right to go to war?

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:57.372
When is it ok to kill someone?

00:02:58.502 --> 00:02:59.712
How should wars be fought?

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.712
Although the most famous Just War Theory was proposed by Thomas Aquinas,

00:03:03.712 --> 00:03:10.782
an Italian monk in the 13th century, these types of questions have

00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:14.922
troubled thinkers from all over the globe since the dawn of time.

00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:21.872
There’s evidence of the considerations of under what conditions going to war is acceptable

00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:28.762
in the Indian epic the Mahabharata, parts of which date back to the 4th century BC.

00:03:29.982 --> 00:03:33.762
And throughout Ancient Rome and Greece, philosophers

00:03:33.932 --> 00:03:38.152
took a stab at deciding when it was right to go to war.

00:03:39.442 --> 00:03:44.852
Aristotle suggested that war was an acceptable decision to take if the

00:03:44.852 --> 00:03:51.002
alternative was being sold into slavery, and the ancient Romans believed

00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:56.462
that a war was justified to stop an invasion or if a treaty was broken.

00:03:57.432 --> 00:04:03.272
But of course, given the fact that the Romans conquered large parts of Europe, without treaties

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:10.102
being broken or the threat of an invasion, they evidently didn’t always stick to their own rules.

00:04:11.322 --> 00:04:16.832
In Europe, it was only really after Christianity started to become an important

00:04:16.842 --> 00:04:23.342
religion that questions about the justification of war became more and more important.

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:28.332
The Bible, the most important religious text in Christianity,

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:32.842
has quite a lot to say about the rights and wrongs of killing.

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:40.032
To start off with, the Fifth Commandment is Thou Shalt not Kill - you shall not kill.

00:04:41.112 --> 00:04:45.902
The Bible also preaches that you should turn the other cheek if you are slapped,

00:04:46.312 --> 00:04:50.822
that you should forgive if you are wronged, if someone does something wrong to you.

00:04:51.622 --> 00:04:55.772
And there are dozens of other parts of the Bible that either

00:04:55.972 --> 00:05:01.512
implicitly or explicitly condemn killing people or taking revenge.

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:09.312
So reconciling this, making this work, with the idea that there are some situations

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:15.422
in which it is right to go to war, and to kill other people, is challenging.

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:23.082
It’s worth just taking a quick pause to consider the meaning of the word ‘just’.

00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:31.922
Just can mean ‘morally’ right, but it can also refer to whether something can be justified.

00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:40.152
So if a war is ‘just’, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is the morally correct thing to

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:46.412
do, but it can mean that it is the right thing to do because the alternatives are worse.

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:51.052
It’s an important distinction, and one that’s worth making

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:54.322
before we get into the Christian tradition of Just War.

00:05:55.342 --> 00:06:00.832
So, Christian philosophers were trying to figure out under what criteria

00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:06.242
they could ignore this particular part of the Bible, or at least make

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:11.312
their practical, real-life world work with their religious beliefs.

00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:16.972
The first of these was in the 5th century AD, a man called Saint

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:21.562
Augustine, Augustine of Hippo, a bishop from modern day Algeria.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:28.762
He documented eight different criteria in a theory about when Christians could

00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:34.912
go to war, and it was primarily based on the idea that violence wasn’t good

00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:40.942
per se, it wasn’t good in itself, but that Christians shouldn’t be frightened

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:45.782
of using violence when the objective of doing so is to promote peace.

00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:52.792
He even went one step further saying that opting not to fight, opting

00:06:52.802 --> 00:06:57.392
for peace, if you could stop a terrible thing from happening was a sin.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:01.862
So, not going to war, if going to war would stop

00:07:01.862 --> 00:07:05.182
something bad from happening, was a sin against God.

00:07:06.282 --> 00:07:14.022
Fast forward 800 years or so and the next major development in Just War Theory came from a

00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:20.842
Dominican priest from modern day Italy, called Thomas Aquinas, or Tommaso D’Aquino in Italian.

00:07:21.782 --> 00:07:28.172
He was really the father of modern Just War Theory, and a lot of how Western

00:07:28.222 --> 00:07:33.392
countries think about war today comes from the writings of Thomas Aquinas.

00:07:34.742 --> 00:07:42.112
To summarise, Aquinas wrote that three conditions needed to be met for a war to be ‘just’.

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:50.512
Firstly, the war needed to be fought under the command of a just leader, a king or queen.

00:07:51.702 --> 00:07:59.202
Secondly, the war needed to be fought because of a just reason, because a wrong had been done.

00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:05.992
And thirdly, the intent of those fighting must be good, and by

00:08:06.022 --> 00:08:10.902
intent he meant that they should try to promote good and avoid evil.

00:08:12.102 --> 00:08:16.372
These three conditions might seem a little simplistic,

00:08:16.442 --> 00:08:19.592
and they are certainly open to interpretation.

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:24.992
What meets the condition of a just leader, a true leader?

00:08:25.622 --> 00:08:30.382
What meets the condition of a just reason, and what is a ‘wrong’ one?

00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:35.242
And, what meets the conditions of having ‘good intent’?

00:08:35.562 --> 00:08:38.832
Surely that is very much open to interpretation.

00:08:40.012 --> 00:08:44.912
Indeed, at the time that Thomas Aquinas was writing his Just War Theory,

00:08:45.372 --> 00:08:50.402
Christian crusaders were off in the Middle East fighting a holy war that

00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:54.957
they believed to be ‘just’, according to the conditions set out in Aquinas’s

00:08:55.272 --> 00:09:01.092
theory, but most people today wouldn’t believe to be ‘just’ and correct.

00:09:02.382 --> 00:09:08.072
For the crusaders, it was ‘just’ because it was a holy war, they were fighting

00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:13.802
it on behalf of their God, which was a ‘just’ reason, so it had good intent.

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:21.312
And it was sponsored by sovereign leaders, it was allowed and promoted by the true

00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:26.212
leaders of the countries, so it met all of the conditions of Aquinas’s theory.

00:09:27.412 --> 00:09:32.282
Apart from these three conditions, of having a just leader, a just reason,

00:09:32.602 --> 00:09:38.302
and to promote good and not evil, Aquinas also proposed that violence should

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:44.412
be used as a last resort, after all peaceful avenues had been exhausted.

00:09:45.562 --> 00:09:49.782
Leaders had an obligation to try and find a peaceful

00:09:49.792 --> 00:09:54.882
solution, and war was only justified if none could be found.

00:09:55.972 --> 00:10:02.512
Aquinas didn’t only deal with the morals of when to go to war, but also how

00:10:02.512 --> 00:10:06.852
you should behave during battle, how you should behave when you are at war.

00:10:08.212 --> 00:10:13.112
Soldiers shouldn’t use excessive violence or cruelty, they should

00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:17.752
only do what is necessary for the war to be fought, nothing more.

00:10:18.642 --> 00:10:25.292
So, killing innocent non-military people, killing civilians, that was out of the question.

00:10:26.482 --> 00:10:31.772
Subsequent philosophers built on Aquinas’s theory to consider the idea

00:10:31.942 --> 00:10:36.282
of when it is right to go to war, and how these wars should be fought.

00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:42.922
At least in Western culture, the theories presented by Aquinas have been

00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:49.402
developed, but at its core the ideas about when it is just to go to war, and

00:10:49.452 --> 00:10:54.562
how wars should be fought have remained pretty similar since the 13th Century.

00:10:55.772 --> 00:11:00.402
You could argue that Thomas Aquinas’s theory hasn’t really done a huge amount

00:11:00.472 --> 00:11:06.512
to stop wars from happening in the first place, but what it has done is it has

00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:12.312
presented a framework for thinking about war, and this framework has been used

00:11:12.352 --> 00:11:17.992
over and over when leaders are considering the rights and wrongs of going to war.

00:11:19.152 --> 00:11:25.932
Perhaps the largest and most testing time, the most challenging time, for the theory

00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:31.452
of Just War came in the 20th Century, with World War I, and then World War II.

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:38.993
At the beginning of World War I there was actually a theological battle going on between

00:11:39.223 --> 00:11:46.583
German and British theologians about who was in the right, who was fighting a ‘just’ war.

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:53.383
Indeed, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior person in the Anglican

00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:58.753
Church collaborated with a large number of religious leaders to publish a

00:11:58.753 --> 00:12:05.373
document outlining why the German theologians’ ideas about war were wrong, and

00:12:05.533 --> 00:12:11.403
why it was actually the British forces, the Allied forces, who were in the right.

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:18.323
And the 20th century has of course put a lot of Aquinas’s theories to the test.

00:12:19.383 --> 00:12:24.453
When Aquinas was writing, war was fought on battlefields by

00:12:24.483 --> 00:12:29.333
men with swords, bows and arrows, and hand to hand combat.

00:12:30.123 --> 00:12:37.843
Yes, civilians might get hurt and cities might be burned to the ground, but it was a far cry from

00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:45.233
the events of even World War II, when cities would be bombed to the ground by aeroplanes far up in

00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:52.593
the sky, or today, where drone strikes on civilians can be carried out from thousands of miles away.

00:12:53.663 --> 00:12:58.663
Some of Aquinas’s ideas about what a just leader was have also been

00:12:58.663 --> 00:13:03.621
questioned, and this is often pointed at as a problem with his theory.

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:11.508
With Aquinas's just war theory , an official leader was the only one capable of waging a ‘just’ war.

00:13:12.388 --> 00:13:17.298
This would mean that a rebellion or revolution would be,

00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:21.278
by default, unjust, because the leader wasn’t sovereign.

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:28.677
Lenin, the Soviet revolutionary leader, therefore decided to come up with his own Just

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:35.057
War Theory, which was based on the idea that war was justified as part of a revolution.

00:13:36.117 --> 00:13:41.027
For Lenin, the war was between the oppressed and the oppressors, the

00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:46.202
working proletariat and the Russian bourgeoisie, the poor and the rich.

00:13:47.613 --> 00:13:53.397
He argued that there was no need to ask yourself ‘who was attacking who’, because the

00:13:53.527 --> 00:14:00.027
oppressed, the Russian poor, were being fought by their bourgeoisie oppressors, by the rich.

00:14:00.827 --> 00:14:05.467
A socialist war against the oppressors was, by default, just.

00:14:06.587 --> 00:14:13.387
Of course, World War II caused the most direct deaths of any war in the history of mankind,

00:14:13.747 --> 00:14:20.137
and there were some real questions posed there about the right and wrong way to fight a war.

00:14:21.647 --> 00:14:27.487
World War II might have been the last global war, but it certainly hasn’t been the last war.

00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:34.818
Countries embarking on military campaigns since then have often used a similar framework to

00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:42.068
the one Aquinas developed 700 years ago to think about whether the war can be justified or not.

00:14:43.328 --> 00:14:49.528
The modern theory of Just War revolves around the idea that war is something that should

00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:56.338
be avoided if at all possible, but there are times where it is the least bad option.

00:14:57.648 --> 00:15:01.798
And Just War Theory may be the most famous theory about

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:05.668
when and under what conditions it is right to go to war.

00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:10.768
But it’s not without its opponents, or at least alternatives.

00:15:11.888 --> 00:15:17.198
Pacifists, for example, argue that there is never a time for war, that

00:15:17.428 --> 00:15:21.608
there are always peaceful options that are better than going to war.

00:15:22.938 --> 00:15:28.508
And on the other side, there are those that feel that the Just War theory is

00:15:28.568 --> 00:15:34.828
too lenient, it actually imposes too many conditions for a war to be just.

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:41.958
Militarism is a theory that proposes that war isn’t inherently bad,

00:15:42.148 --> 00:15:47.638
it's not bad in itself, and it can actually be a good thing for society.

00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:53.998
Realism is another theory that you might be familiar with, and proposes

00:15:53.998 --> 00:15:58.578
the idea that looking at these kinds of questions through a moral

00:15:58.578 --> 00:16:03.218
lens just isn’t realistic, it’s not the right way to think about it.

00:16:03.898 --> 00:16:08.418
Instead, countries should be practical, and on occasion

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:12.498
war is the most practical, realistic, action to take.

00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:18.508
And somewhere in the middle is something called consequentialism, the

00:16:18.508 --> 00:16:24.098
theory that the end justifies the means, that if the outcome of war,

00:16:24.568 --> 00:16:30.258
or an act during the war, is good, then the act can be justified.

00:16:31.668 --> 00:16:37.908
For example something like dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaski at the end of

00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:45.238
World War II would be justified like this, as the objective was to end the war, even though

00:16:45.298 --> 00:16:52.438
the impact of dropping two atomic weapons on two large cities was, evidently, horrific.

00:16:53.608 --> 00:16:58.098
Now, bringing this back to real life for one minute, what does this actually

00:16:58.098 --> 00:17:02.778
mean in terms of whether a country can or can’t go to war with another one?

00:17:03.568 --> 00:17:08.968
We’ve dealt with the moral and ethical arguments, but when it comes to practicalities,

00:17:09.418 --> 00:17:14.168
when and under what conditions can a country now go to war with another?

00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:20.618
Evidently this is a very complicated subject, far too complicated to cover

00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:25.538
properly in a small section of this episode, but there is no black and

00:17:25.538 --> 00:17:30.578
white answer of under what conditions a country can or can’t go to war.

00:17:31.458 --> 00:17:36.448
I’m sure that we can all think of examples from recent years of countries,

00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:42.238
including the UK, going to war and there being large debates both inside and

00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:48.058
outside that country about whether the war is just, and whether it’s indeed legal.

00:17:49.008 --> 00:17:54.748
From a legal point of view, in the United Nations Charter countries have sworn to not

00:17:54.788 --> 00:18:00.218
use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.

00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:06.098
So any country that signed the UN Charter, and that’s almost every

00:18:06.098 --> 00:18:10.258
country in the world, has sworn to not go to war with another country.

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:15.418
But, as we know, there are still countless examples of wars still

00:18:15.438 --> 00:18:19.908
happening, for reasons that wouldn’t pass the test of being ‘Just’.

00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:27.901
So, although the theory of Just War does give us a useful framework for thinking about the rights

00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:35.041
and wrongs of war, and when a war can actually be justified, real life suggests that, as Jack

00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:38.014
Sparrow of Pirates of the Carribean once said, they’re more like guidelines than actual rules.

00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:47.481
OK then, that is it for Just War, and the theory of

00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:51.291
when, and under what conditions war can be justified.

00:18:52.061 --> 00:18:57.321
To state the obvious, it is a complicated, divisive, but certainly interesting subject.

00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:00.791
I hope you enjoyed it, and that you learned something new.

00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:05.711
As always, I would love to know what you thought of today’s episode.

00:19:06.131 --> 00:19:08.371
What do you think of the Just War theory?

00:19:09.071 --> 00:19:12.421
Are there circumstances when war can be justified?

00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:15.441
Or is it never right, whatever the other options?

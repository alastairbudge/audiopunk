wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:29.079
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Rise and Fall

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:35.659
of WeWork, the co-working company that was set to take over the world, and then...

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:36.839
well, didn’t.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.749
It is a really interesting story involving a charismatic leader, empty buildings,

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:50.109
ping pong tables, lots of money, the future of work, and a lot of free coffee.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:56.249
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:45.911
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.681
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.477
OK then, WeWork.

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.231
Now, you may have heard of this company before.

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.381
Perhaps you have even been inside a WeWork office.

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:10.221
If you haven’t heard of it, WeWork essentially is a company that rents out office space.

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:17.522
If you are a freelancer and you want to work at a desk in a nice office, or if you are a

00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:23.772
large company and you want a nice office for your staff, WeWork provides everything you need.

00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:29.505
Now, unless you are familiar with the story of WeWork, you probably think this

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:35.955
sounds all terribly boring, but before pressing pause, or skipping to another

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:42.845
episode, let me assure you that the story of WeWork is anything but boring, and

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:49.905
through it we can ask ourselves all sorts of interesting and pertinent questions.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:54.365
Such as: What will the offices of the future look like?

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:58.355
How will office life post-COVID be different?

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.845
Is every company a technology company?

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:07.055
And is there such a thing as a dream that is just too big?

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.818
Now, back to WeWork.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:15.895
Let me paint a picture of WeWork at its peak, at its height, in

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:20.935
the summer of 2019, before telling the story of how it got there.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:26.415
The company had raised over $8 billion dollars in venture

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:30.785
capital, it had raised this money from investors in order to grow.

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:38.735
It had offices in 32 different countries, and over half a million people working inside them.

00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:45.055
Its offices had free beer, ping pong tables, sofas, you name it.

00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:51.195
Its thousands of employees would be flown to all-expenses-paid WeWork

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:57.185
festivals where they would party and be serenaded by famous musicians.

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:05.945
The company had its own private jet, and its founder had a collection of houses and apartments

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:13.235
in some of the world’s most desirable cities, all over the US, Europe, and The Middle East.

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:19.085
It was set to go public, it was set to list its shares on the

00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:24.205
stock exchange, and hoped to be worth over $50 billion dollars.

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:32.085
This fundraising would make its charismatic CEO, an Israeli named Adam Neumann, a billionaire

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:38.725
several times over, and staff with stock options, staff who owned shares in the company,

00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:44.945
as well as early investors, would receive a bumper payday, they would make a load of money.

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:53.285
Yet, over the period of a few weeks WeWork fell from the stars, as investors looked more

00:04:53.285 --> 00:05:00.405
closely at the company and smelled something fishy, they felt that something was wrong.

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:07.065
The company scrambled, Neumann was forced out, thousands of employees were

00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:12.635
sacked, offices were closed, and the company struggled to avoid going bankrupt.

00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:20.785
To figure out how that all happened, we need to go back almost 10 years, to New York City.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:27.165
WeWork was founded in 2010 by two friends: Adam Neumann, the

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:32.095
charismatic Israeli, and Miguel McKelvey, an American from Oregon.

00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:38.455
They had successfully built and sold an office rental company, a company

00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:42.805
that managed office space, and now they had plans for something bigger.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:48.775
This vision for WeWork seemed to come primarily from Neumann.

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:54.835
He had grown up in a kibbutz in Israel, a sort of collective community,

00:05:55.345 --> 00:06:00.985
and he wanted to recreate the community feel in an office environment.

00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:08.445
McKelvey, on the other hand, was an architect by trade, but had also grown up in

00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:15.265
what he called a 5-mother-collective, a sort of mini kibbutz of 5 different families.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:22.595
So both men were deep believers in the power of community to bring people together.

00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:29.915
If one were to put labels on the responsibilities of each of the men, it was

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:36.545
Neumann’s job to be the salesman, to find new buildings to rent, to do deals, to

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:42.445
get people inspired by the vision of WeWork, and to raise money from investors.

00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:48.085
And McKelvey, as an architect, was in charge of designing the buildings.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.540
Now, WeWork’s main business wasn’t particularly complicated.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.620
It would rent large amounts of office space, and sometimes even entire buildings,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:06.130
then it would decorate them and make them look pleasant to a younger, more creative

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.560
crowd, it would divide them into smaller offices, and rent them out individually.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.650
To give a very basic example, if they rented a space from a property owner for

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:25.830
$50,000 a month, and then found 200 freelancers who were willing to pay $500 each

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.650
every month, then WeWork would collect $100,000 in rent from the freelancers, and

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.570
pay $50,000 to the building owner, and the difference was how it made its money.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.780
Not rocket science, right?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:46.980
The proposition was very attractive to investors, and WeWork soon was flooded with money from people

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.390
who wanted a piece of the company, thinking they might have found the next Facebook or Google.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.440
The CEO of the company, Adam Neumann, was an excellent

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.460
storyteller, and an extremely charismatic individual.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:08.370
He spoke with an Israeli accent, he was almost two meters tall, and

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.860
he had an imposing presence that captivated anyone who listened.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.580
And WeWork seemed to be doing something that no other company had managed to do.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.130
It was making office space cool.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:29.470
There were thousands of other companies that did a similar thing, but they were boring.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:35.840
Nobody dreamed about working in them, and they were merely a utility.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.170
WeWork was aspirational; people wanted to work in a

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.330
WeWork office, and people wanted to work for WeWork.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.820
WeWork seemed to have found the formula for growth.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.750
It found office space, signed a contract to rent the space for an extended period

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:02.760
of time, refurbished the space and made it cool, then new tenants would arrive.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.940
All it needed for world domination was money.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:16.701
It needed to invest in people, and it needed to invest in these leases, in the rents for the space.

00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:23.051
Even though WeWork tended to not buy the buildings outright,

00:09:23.051 --> 00:09:27.521
it just rented them, it was a very capital intensive business.

00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:31.831
Starting a worldwide property empire wasn’t cheap.

00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:39.432
Luckily, Neumann was an excellent salesman, and money seemed to naturally flow towards him.

00:09:40.592 --> 00:09:45.352
The money started small, comparatively speaking, $15 million dollars

00:09:45.362 --> 00:09:49.672
from a New York property developer, but shortly afterwards the

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:53.462
numbers were in the hundreds of millions and then the billions.

00:09:54.962 --> 00:10:01.622
WeWork was flying high, and burning through money, it was spending far more money than it made.

00:10:02.682 --> 00:10:10.822
By 2016 it was not just a unicorn, the term given by investors to a startup valued at

00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:17.522
over a billion dollars, it was now a decacorn, a company valued at over $10 billion.

00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:20.732
It seemed unstoppable.

00:10:21.602 --> 00:10:27.082
A large amount of the later money had actually come via Japan, from

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:31.982
an eccentric but brilliant Japanese businessman, called Mayoshi Son.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:38.372
Son had built up the Japanese technology company SoftBank, and had

00:10:38.382 --> 00:10:43.882
developed a reputation as an excellent, albeit unorthodox investor.

00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:51.132
He had made one of the best investments in history, as an early investor in Yahoo!, and

00:10:51.132 --> 00:10:57.902
then giving an unknown entrepreneur called Jack Ma $20 million to start a company in China.

00:10:58.802 --> 00:11:03.712
The company Jack Ma started was Alibaba, and this $20

00:11:03.712 --> 00:11:09.392
million investment would turn into over $150 billion for Son.

00:11:10.222 --> 00:11:16.152
Son was on the lookout for the next home-run investment, he was now looking to invest

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:22.122
in companies that he believed would change the world and net him a handsome profit.

00:11:23.192 --> 00:11:27.672
After meeting Neumann, he believed he had found one in WeWork, and

00:11:27.672 --> 00:11:32.912
SoftBank piled money into the company, with Son reportedly agreeing

00:11:32.912 --> 00:11:39.572
to invest $4.4 billion after meeting Neuman for only 28 minutes.

00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:45.642
By this time, the vision of WeWork had outgrown mere office space.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:51.852
It had changed its name to The We Company, and had bought and built schools

00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:57.052
for kids, buildings for people to live in, and even slightly less connected

00:11:57.062 --> 00:12:02.242
businesses such as one that made swimming pools with artificial waves.

00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:08.555
Neumann’s vision, or at least what he was telling investors, would be that WeWork

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:13.665
would solve many of the world’s problems, office space was merely the start.

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:21.115
A child might be born in a We apartment, they would go to a We kindergarten, they

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:26.695
would work at a We office, and their entire life would revolve around The We Company.

00:12:27.605 --> 00:12:33.215
Now, you might think this sounds mad and implausible, perhaps even

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:39.365
Orwellian, but Mayoshi Son and Softbank continued to believe in this vision.

00:12:40.395 --> 00:12:44.575
As SoftBank put more and more money into the company, people on

00:12:44.575 --> 00:12:49.055
the outside scratched their heads and questioned what was going on.

00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:53.175
Was there something that they didn’t understand?

00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:58.275
How could an office space company possibly be valued so highly?

00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:04.464
It’s worth briefly pausing to address the question of how companies are valued.

00:13:05.157 --> 00:13:10.247
Obviously this is a extremely complicated question but how it is relevant

00:13:10.277 --> 00:13:16.452
to WeWork is that technology companies tend to be valued more highly than

00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:20.842
traditional companies, they are given what’s called a higher multiple.

00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:27.422
One of the main reasons for this is that there is a much lower cost to service more

00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:33.052
customers for a tech company, because the distribution of software is much cheaper.

00:13:33.922 --> 00:13:40.452
If you are, for example, a company that builds houses, the cost of building 10 houses is much

00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:46.042
more than building one house, it’s not exactly 10 times, but it might be almost 10 times.

00:13:46.832 --> 00:13:51.699
But for technology companies, for software companies,  there is very

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:56.939
little additional cost to selling more software, it costs you almost

00:13:56.939 --> 00:14:02.989
the same to sell one piece of software as it does 10, 100, or 10,000.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:09.919
This means it tends to be a lot cheaper, easier, and quicker for a tech company

00:14:09.939 --> 00:14:14.979
to grow, therefore their valuations are higher as a multiple of revenue.

00:14:15.909 --> 00:14:21.139
Long story short, if you are a tech company, or you manage to convince your

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:25.439
investors that you are a tech company, your valuation can increase a lot.

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:34.129
WeWork managed to do an excellent job at convincing investors that it was a tech company, that

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:42.029
it was a so-called “platform for office space”, and it was rewarded with sky-high valuations.

00:14:43.239 --> 00:14:46.429
But under the surface WeWork was burning through

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:49.349
money, it was losing more and more money every month.

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:54.519
For many tech companies, this had come to be expected.

00:14:54.979 --> 00:14:59.129
You spend more than you make in order to get customers and to build a great

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:04.889
product, then at some point in the future you are profitable, and everyone is happy.

00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:09.459
Because the amounts of money that were involved were so

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:13.669
huge, WeWork would spend money like there was no tomorrow.

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:19.199
WeWork had taken on so much office space, it had rented so

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:22.989
many buildings, that it literally struggled to find new ones.

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:29.029
There was only so much available space in the prime cities that WeWork was targeting.

00:15:30.289 --> 00:15:35.789
Because the owners of buildings knew how much money WeWork had, they were able

00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:41.209
to charge higher rates, meaning that these locations became less profitable.

00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:46.419
At the same time, WeWork was spending huge amounts of money

00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:50.939
to find new tenants, to find people to fill its offices.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:56.504
It would often offer incredibly generous discounts to entice people

00:15:56.524 --> 00:16:01.144
into its office, to get new freelancers and companies to try its

00:16:01.144 --> 00:16:06.514
offices, even offering to give them a year’s free rent to switch.

00:16:07.364 --> 00:16:13.064
Again, the idea was that this was an investment in the future, and after that year was

00:16:13.084 --> 00:16:18.744
over the company would stay in the WeWork office, paying rent, and everyone would be happy.

00:16:19.794 --> 00:16:24.134
But a business can’t continue to lose money forever, and there was

00:16:24.144 --> 00:16:28.384
pressure for WeWork to go public, to float on the stock market.

00:16:29.514 --> 00:16:35.004
SoftBank and Mayoshi Son weren’t prepared to support the company forever, and

00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:40.184
it looked like going public was the only option left for WeWork to survive.

00:16:41.214 --> 00:16:44.854
And that is when it all started to go downhill, that's

00:16:44.854 --> 00:16:48.654
when it all started to go a little bit wrong for WeWork.

00:16:49.924 --> 00:16:55.374
As WeWork was forced to open up to investors, people saw under

00:16:55.374 --> 00:16:59.654
the hood and some of the excesses of the company were revealed.

00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:07.174
Alongside this, there were also numerous lawsuits against the company, accusations of

00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:13.024
drug-use by Neumann, employees coming forward and talking about the cult of WeWork,

00:17:13.914 --> 00:17:20.214
and all sorts of unorthodox and worrying behaviour that investors don’t like to see.

00:17:21.174 --> 00:17:27.504
WeWork had most recently been valued at $47 billion, but it soon became

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:33.444
clear that new investors weren’t prepared to value it at nearly that much,

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:38.324
and they certainly didn’t buy the story that it was a technology company.

00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:43.874
As a result, investors wouldn’t pay anywhere near what

00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:47.414
WeWork had hoped, and it had to postpone going public.

00:17:48.754 --> 00:17:53.454
It had hoped to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from going public,

00:17:53.464 --> 00:17:57.784
from its stock market offering, but given that this wasn’t an option

00:17:57.784 --> 00:18:03.244
anymore, it needed to make some serious changes to avoid running out of cash.

00:18:04.404 --> 00:18:07.544
The first change came at the top of the company.

00:18:08.184 --> 00:18:16.484
Neumann was pushed out of WeWork, he was in effect sacked, but, unlike you or me where we might be

00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:23.294
sacked and if we're lucky given a little bit of money to say "thank you for your work", Neumann was

00:18:23.364 --> 00:18:33.844
paid $1.7 billion to leave, and was then kept on as a consultant on a salary of $46 million a year.

00:18:34.954 --> 00:18:41.414
Thousands of WeWork employees were sacked, and they were understandably appalled that

00:18:41.424 --> 00:18:47.084
the boss had been given such a huge amount of money while they were losing their jobs,

00:18:47.414 --> 00:18:52.734
and their stock options proved to be worth much less than they had been promised.

00:18:53.844 --> 00:19:02.294
This all happened in Autumn of 2019, and then in the spring of 2020, as we all know COVID-19

00:19:02.304 --> 00:19:08.364
hit, WeWork’s offices had to close, and the company was in more trouble than ever before.

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:14.824
Of course, the world is still in a state of semi lockdown, with people in countries

00:19:14.854 --> 00:19:20.924
all over the world working from home, and not in a great rush to return to the office.

00:19:21.864 --> 00:19:24.394
So, where does this leave WeWork?

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:28.574
It has changed its leadership, it has a new boss,

00:19:28.594 --> 00:19:32.374
and the excesses of the past appear to be behind it.

00:19:33.354 --> 00:19:41.164
But is it going to be the answer to the future of work, with people valuing the ability to go into

00:19:41.164 --> 00:19:47.394
fashionable offices from time to time, but otherwise wanting a more flexible working environment?

00:19:48.114 --> 00:19:52.674
Or, is the old, office-based way of working a thing of the past?

00:19:53.274 --> 00:19:58.254
What will happen to the knowledge workers that were previously WeWork’s bread and butter?

00:19:59.214 --> 00:20:03.544
Have they got used to working from home, and will they

00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:06.114
be flooding back to the offices when they open up?

00:20:07.004 --> 00:20:12.814
Only time will tell, but if you are asking me, it seems that a company like WeWork

00:20:13.014 --> 00:20:18.144
may well be a small part of the answer to the working preferences of the future.

00:20:18.954 --> 00:20:24.044
Most surveys of people who have been forced to work from home for much of the past year

00:20:24.054 --> 00:20:29.964
and a half suggest that people aren’t looking forward to going back to the traditional

00:20:29.974 --> 00:20:34.824
office environment, where they are required to be there all day Monday to Friday.

00:20:35.584 --> 00:20:41.264
But at the same time, they don't know that they want to be working from home all day every day.

00:20:42.044 --> 00:20:46.744
So, perhaps, just perhaps, WeWork could be exactly what they are

00:20:46.744 --> 00:20:51.464
looking for, and it might be the phoenix to rise from the ashes.

00:20:53.934 --> 00:20:59.974
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the rise and fall of WeWork.

00:21:00.474 --> 00:21:04.504
Who knows, maybe you might be listening to this episode in a couple of years’

00:21:04.504 --> 00:21:09.774
time and ask why the title isn’t The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of WeWork.

00:21:11.084 --> 00:21:14.644
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:18.664
If you have been working from home during COVID-19, and you

00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:22.414
previously worked in an office, how do you feel about returning?

00:21:22.954 --> 00:21:24.254
Have you returned already?

00:21:24.644 --> 00:21:27.484
What would your ideal working situation look like?

00:21:27.874 --> 00:21:30.364
And is it anything like a WeWork?

00:21:31.354 --> 00:21:35.884

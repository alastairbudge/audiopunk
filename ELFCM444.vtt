Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.576
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:19.516
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:23.966
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to switch things up a little.

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:30.136
We’ve had some heavy, thought-provoking subjects recently: debates about immigration, a teenager

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:36.946
who joined ISIS and her citizenship revoked, fraudulent doctors and the search for eternal life.

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.146
But today we are going for something lighter.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.816
It is a short, feelgood tale about a lion called Christian.

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:50.026
It’s fun, it’s heartwarming, and it's a true story, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:55.145
OK then, the amazing story of Christian the Lion.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:02.483
London in the late 1960s was, so I am told, a very different city to today.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.837
If you walk down the streets of Chelsea in the year 2024, you will be greeted

00:01:08.877 --> 00:01:14.127
by expensive restaurants, designer clothing shops and multi-million pound flats.

00:01:15.527 --> 00:01:20.107
Going back 50 years ago, it was a different story altogether.

00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:25.337
Back then, Chelsea was the epicentre of a cultural revolution.

00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:32.227
It was a melting pot of artists, musicians, and free spirits, all contributing

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:37.327
to a vibrant, dynamic atmosphere that defined an era of London’s history.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:44.447
The streets were lined with bohemian boutiques, avant-garde galleries, and lively music venues.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:51.357
It was a place where anything felt possible, a hotbed of creativity and unconventional ideas.

00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:56.967
Two young men that were drawn to this magnetism of the city were John

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.277
Rendall and Anthony 'Ace' Bourke, a pair of young Australians who

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:05.117
had hopped on a plane after finishing university and headed to Europe

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:10.945
These two friends got a flat on the King’s Road, which is now one of London’s

00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:15.665
most desirable and expensive locations, but back then it was very different.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:20.976
It was cheap, perfectly affordable for a pair of unemployed recent graduates.

00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:27.746
They started working in a furniture shop, to pay the bills, and took to exploring the city.

00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:32.606
On their travels, they would go to Harrods, London’s most famous

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.831
department store just a tiny bit to the north, in Kensington.

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:40.771
As a quick side note, we actually have an episode dedicated to the history of

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:45.431
Harrods, its episode number 54, so if you are interested in learning more about

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.211
the story of this cult London shop, I’d recommend giving that one a listen.

00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:55.281
Anyway, nowadays Harrods is famous for selling all manner of products:

00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:59.181
designer clothing, jewellery, expensive furniture, you name it.

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:05.861
In fact, until 2014, it sold something even more unexpected.

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.311
If you took the lift and got off on the fourth floor,

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.861
you would arrive at Harrods' famous “Pet Kingdom”.

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.951
This section of the shop sold live animals, everything from dogs

00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:24.281
and cats to more exotic animals such as tropical fish and snakes.

00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.871
And it was while wandering around “Pet Kingdom” in 1969 that Ace Bourke

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:36.151
and John Rendall noticed something that caught their eye: a baby lion.

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:43.721
The price tag was quite steep, something like €500 in today’s money, a lot of money in

00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:48.531
any case, and certainly a lot for a couple of young men who worked in a furniture shop.

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:52.421
But the pair thought they just had to have him.

00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:56.131
They split the cost, and the lion cub was theirs.

00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.651
Now, it might sound crazy that you could just buy a lion at a shop, without any

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:08.273
kind of licence or checks or anything like that, but this was London in the 1960s.

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:11.943
The rules were different, or rather, there were no rules.

00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:15.743
The two young men decided to call him Christian.

00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:22.183
They took him home, to their flat, and soon started to learn a lot about lions.

00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:30.573
As you may know, or could probably imagine, lions grow quite quickly, and need a lot to eat.

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:36.763
Of course, they eat meat, and plenty of it, and the men found that they were quickly spending

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:42.163
a not insignificant amount of their salaries on buying meat for their growing ball of fluff.

00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:48.893
The lion also soon outgrew their little flat, and the pair took him to work with them at the

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:54.493
furniture shop, keeping him downstairs in the basement while they attended to customers upstairs.

00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:59.393
They discovered that lions sleep a lot, up to 18

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:02.733
hours a day, but they do need a fair bit of exercise.

00:05:04.213 --> 00:05:08.463
In the wild they would be out hunting, chasing zebras and so on,

00:05:08.803 --> 00:05:12.313
but there weren’t so many huge open parks to take him to in London.

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:19.653
In fact, compared to some cities, London does have plenty of large parks, open green spaces,

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:24.783
but the two men perfectly reasonably thought that they might get into quite a bit of trouble

00:05:25.003 --> 00:05:30.273
if they brought their pet lion to Hyde Park and let it off its lead, with children and

00:05:30.273 --> 00:05:35.613
tourists alike getting a bit of a fright if they saw a large lion running towards them.

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:39.393
But they did find a solution.

00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:44.133
See, Christian The Lion  had started to be quite well-known in Chelsea.

00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:48.153
The young men would walk down the street with him, or take him around

00:05:48.153 --> 00:05:52.653
in their car, and as you might imagine, people started to notice.

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:57.973
After word got around that Christian’s owners were looking for a place

00:05:58.013 --> 00:06:02.293
where the lion could run around, a kindly vicar agreed that Christian

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:06.073
could use the church graveyard for exercise for a few hours a day.

00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:11.873
It had a large wall around it, nobody else would come inside, and it became a

00:06:11.883 --> 00:06:16.593
substitute for the open plains of Africa, right there in the centre of London.

00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:23.513
During all of this time, the two men formed a very strong bond with the lion.

00:06:23.923 --> 00:06:28.113
They were incredibly affectionate towards him, and the feeling was mutual.

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:35.833
There are amazing clips of this, with this now huge lion jumping up to give the men hugs.

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:42.633
It's surreal, scary even, to see this almost fully-grown lion running

00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:47.213
at a human, but absolutely heartwarming to see him being remarkably

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.983
gentle with his owners to make sure that he didn’t hurt them.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:56.486
But, Christian the lion cub was becoming Christian the fully-grown lion.

00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:01.096
Ace and John knew that Christian couldn’t stay in London forever.

00:07:01.676 --> 00:07:07.146
London was no place for a lion, and certainly no place for an adult lion.

00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:13.896
One option was to send him to a zoo or sanctuary in the UK, but that

00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:17.786
was not ideal, they dreaded the idea of Christian being caged up.

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:23.496
What the pair really wanted was to send him to Africa, where he belonged.

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:26.686
But there was no clear path to do this.

00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:31.926
Christian was theirs, they had bought him, getting him to Africa, and then

00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:37.626
successfully integrating him into the wild would be no mean feat, it would not be easy.

00:07:38.796 --> 00:07:42.556
However, a chance encounter gave them an opportunity.

00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:46.486
One day, a couple walked into the furniture store.

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:51.286
Their names were Bill Travers and Virgina McKenna, and

00:07:51.486 --> 00:07:55.866
they had starred in a film from 1966 called Born Free.

00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:02.916
This film was about another real-life couple that raised an orphaned lion cub and

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:08.006
then reintroduced it to the wild, and it had been a great success at the box office.

00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:15.146
Naturally, the young Australians jumped at the chance to talk to Travers and McKenna, telling them

00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:19.676
about Christian, and saying “he’s actually right downstairs if you’d like to come and meet him”.

00:08:21.016 --> 00:08:26.526
Again, it seems kind of mad to us now that they were able to take their lion to

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:30.730
work with them, and their boss wasn’t too bothered by them taking some customers

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:36.870
downstairs to see it, but this was the 1960s, and the rules were “there are no rules”.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.270
Travers and McKenna, the Born Free actors, took an immediate interest in Christian,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.430
and offered to put Ace and John in touch with a man called George Adamson, a British

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.280
conservationist living in Africa who had helped with the lion from the Born Free movie.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.890
Contact was made, and plans were put into place to transport

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.780
Christian to Kenya, and introduce him into the wild.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.000
It was a bold plan.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.730
The previous lions that George Adamson had rehabilitated and introduced to the wild

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:18.210
had all been born in Africa, so there was some sense of familiarity and return.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.590
Christian knew none of this; he was a city lion, born and bred.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.090
Nevertheless, Adamson agreed to the challenge.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.500
After several months negotiating with the Kenyan government to

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.770
allow Christian to enter the country, an agreement was reached.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.160
Christian flew out to Kenya, accompanied by his owners, of course,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.530
and took his first smell of the land he would come to call home.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.850
They met George Adamson, this legendary conservationist and

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.340
lion expert, and off they went, heading for a nature reserve.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.250
The pair would later recall an incident during the trip when they were in a car in

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.680
the middle of nowhere, and they could see that Christian needed to go for a pee.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.050
They asked Adamson to stop the car, so that Christian could go out and do his business.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:20.270
Adamson was reluctant, saying that if Christian ran away, they would never find him again.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.436
After all, this was the bush, it wasn’t a walled graveyard in Chelsea.

00:10:27.908 --> 00:10:32.356
Undeterred, Ace and John said “no no, it’s ok, he’ll come back”.

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:36.266
The car stopped, out Christian got.

00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:42.036
He stopped, did his business, and then dutifully hopped back into the car.

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:48.616
The group arrived at Adamson’s compound, but clearly introducing Christian

00:10:48.646 --> 00:10:53.386
into the wild safely and successfully was more complicated than dropping

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:56.826
him in the middle of nowhere and saying “ok, there you go, good luck!”

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:00.956
Christian didn’t know how to hunt, he didn’t know how to

00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:05.796
interact with other lions, he didn’t know how to be a wild lion.

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:10.996
He was a city lion; he might have known how to catch the number 11 bus, but

00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:15.626
he didn’t know how to track a zebra or find a safe place to sleep at night.

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:20.036
Fortunately, George Adamson had a plan.

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:25.826
He wanted to create a new pride of lions, with Christian at the helm.

00:11:27.356 --> 00:11:34.169
This would include another older lion called “Boy”, and a younger female lion called Katania.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:41.126
Christian got a nasty shock when he was viciously attacked by Boy during their first meeting,

00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:47.836
but with Boy’s dominance now successfully asserted, there was a semblance of normality.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:55.166
The two male lions became close friends, and the lion pride was starting to come together.

00:11:56.636 --> 00:12:03.436
With this new pride forming, Ace and John knew that their time with Christian was coming to an end.

00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:09.646
Christian would never be able to be a fully-functioning, wild, lion if he

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:14.336
continued with one foot in the lion world and another in the human world.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.826
Ace and John had to go.

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:23.456
4 weeks later, the pair returned to London, and would be kept up to date

00:12:23.456 --> 00:12:27.486
with letters from Kenya, from George Adamson, about Christian’s progress.

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:35.226
All was going well, but then Boy was attacked by some other wild lions.

00:12:35.816 --> 00:12:41.746
Everything about Boy changed, and tragedy then struck when Boy attacked one of the

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:47.936
men working for Adamson, and Adamson was forced to shoot Boy to stop the attack.

00:12:49.282 --> 00:12:54.682
Christian was distraught, and he would spend his days sitting next to Boy’s grave.

00:12:56.039 --> 00:13:01.379
With seemingly no way to shake Christian out from this sadness, George Adamson

00:13:01.569 --> 00:13:06.019
wrote to the Australians and asked if they would come out to visit Christian.

00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:11.039
They jumped at the opportunity, and a year after seeing

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:14.429
Christian for the last time, John and Ace returned.

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:20.329
They were understandably nervous about how Christian would react.

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:26.129
He was now a semi wild lion, and one who had lost his best friend at that.

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.489
How would he react?

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:30.839
Would he remember his former owners?

00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:36.439
Or would he perceive them as a threat, unknown humans disturbing his territory?

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:41.463
What actually happened is nothing short of marvellous.

00:13:42.343 --> 00:13:47.443
There is actually a video of this reunion on YouTube, it is absolutely heartwarming.

00:13:48.243 --> 00:13:53.653
Christian approaches cautiously, and then when he recognises Ace and

00:13:53.663 --> 00:13:58.643
John, his pace quickens and he runs towards them, jumping up and giving

00:13:58.643 --> 00:14:03.153
them both enormous hugs, licking them and nuzzling his head in theirs.

00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:08.153
The pair returned to London, and continued to keep updated

00:14:08.153 --> 00:14:11.003
on Christian’s progress via George Adamson’s letters.

00:14:12.703 --> 00:14:16.423
Back in Kenya, Christian was now growing into an adult lion.

00:14:17.393 --> 00:14:20.523
Ace and John returned to Africa again, a year later,

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:24.583
and they found a very changed and more mature lion.

00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:30.113
By this time, Christian had been going away from the compound for days and

00:14:30.113 --> 00:14:35.153
weeks at a time, trying to find his own territory, far from his human friends.

00:14:36.603 --> 00:14:40.703
When the pair met Christian, it was an emotional reunion

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:45.113
of course, but Christian was now a fully grown, adult lion.

00:14:45.813 --> 00:14:49.353
He was different, he was mature, he was Christian The

00:14:49.353 --> 00:14:53.403
African Lion, no longer Christian The Lion Cub From Harrods.

00:14:55.013 --> 00:14:58.783
This would be the last time that any of them saw Christian.

00:14:59.843 --> 00:15:04.923
One day he left the compound, as he had been doing for several months by then.

00:15:05.963 --> 00:15:08.293
But this time, he never returned.

00:15:09.073 --> 00:15:13.183
Nobody knows what happened to him, one can only hope that he

00:15:13.183 --> 00:15:17.773
went on to live a long, happy, and most certainly wild life.

00:15:19.316 --> 00:15:23.546
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Christian The Lion.

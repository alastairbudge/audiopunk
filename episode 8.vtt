Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.700
by Leonardo English.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.510
I'm your host Alastair Budge and it's time for part two of our three part mini series on who owns

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.910
the sea, sky, and space.

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:20.978
So today it's part two.

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:21.998
It's the sky.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:27.795
If you're looking for a quick answer to who owns the sky, I'm afraid there really isn't one.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.675
It's quite complicated, but pretty interesting.

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:36.063
If you haven't already checked out part one, which is who owns the sea, then it's well worth a

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:36.503
listen.

00:00:36.863 --> 00:00:42.607
There's a lot in there that's not only fascinating if I may say so myself, but will help

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:45.007
contextualize parts two and three.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.197
Okay.

00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:52.437
Before we get right into it, for those of you listening on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or whatever your

00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:57.227
favourite podcast app might be, I just wanted to remind you that you can get all of the key

00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:02.377
vocabulary and transcript for this podcast on the website, so that's Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:03.697
Okay.

00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:05.137
That's the housekeeping over.

00:01:05.437 --> 00:01:10.707
Today we are going to be talking about the sky, who owns it and why that matters.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:17.428
To do that though, we are going to need to go into a little bit more detail about what the sky

00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:18.478
actually is.

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:27.564
In English and in most languages in fact, the word sky is used broadly to describe what's above us,

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.949
what's between the land and space.

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:35.559
It's not the same as atmosphere, which is the collection of gases that surround the earth.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:42.465
It's not a scientific term, and where the sky starts and ends isn't completely black and white.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:45.825
So where does the sky start?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.720
Is it at ground level?

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.777
So by our feet, by that definition, are we all walking in the sky?

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:55.420
That seems quite strange, right?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.090
But technically it's actually true.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.388
The sky is really just everything above the surface of the Earth until you get to space, until you

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:05.948
get to where space starts.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.293
But where exactly does space start?

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:14.514
From our position on the ground, you could be forgiven for thinking that it goes on almost forever.

00:02:14.904 --> 00:02:20.514
And evidently, where the sky ends and space starts isn't immediately obvious, it's not like there's

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:22.254
a big line or anything.

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:29.775
And it's also not helped by the fact that the term "sky" isn't very useful.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:30.945
It's not very scientific.

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:33.431
So let's use more scientific terms.

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:40.811
The atmosphere, of which the sky is a part, extends for about 250 miles from the surface of the

00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:41.041
Earth.

00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:44.891
That's the distance from New York to Washington, D C.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.952
This 250 miles is split up into different parts, starting with something called the troposphere.

00:02:52.912 --> 00:02:58.692
This starts at the ground and goes up to anywhere from four to 20 miles depending on whether you are

00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:03.052
one of the poles where it's thinner or at the equator where it's thicker.

00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:07.694
Even though the troposphere is just the first slice of the atmosphere.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:14.759
It's where most of the action happens, for the obvious reason that getting above it is pretty

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.239
difficult.

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:25.093
Remember, most commercial planes fly at between 31,000 and 38,000 feet, so that's about 5.9 to 7.2

00:03:25.093 --> 00:03:25.663
miles.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:32.923
Even the U2 spy plane can only go up to 70,000 feet, which is just over 13 miles up from the ground.

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:38.029
So let's stick with the lower part because you can't really go much higher, and then we'll round off

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.799
with who owns the bit above it.

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:47.353
We can think about ownership of the sky in two different categories: on an individual level and on a

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:48.283
national level.

00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:55.292
On an individual level being who owns the sky above my house and on a national level being who owns

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:56.522
the sky above my country.

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:59.801
Let's talk about it on an individual level first.

00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:07.159
Now of course, we can't lump the laws of every country in the world into one, but in the west at

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.589
least, there are a lot of similarities between countries in the way in which ownership of the

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.899
airspace works on an individual level.

00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:21.824
You might be surprised to find out that most of Western law was actually based on a 13th century law

00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:30.044
called Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos, which is Latin for whoever's is the

00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:33.764
soil, it is theirs all the way up to heaven and all the way to hell.

00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:41.474
This is quite a poetic way to say if you own the ground then you own everything above it and you own

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:42.374
everything below it.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:49.691
The base of this law has stood the test of time and in most of the Western world, a similar

00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:51.791
principle still applies.

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:59.011
If you own the land, then nobody can encroach on what's defined as your airspace without your

00:04:59.011 --> 00:04:59.491
permission.

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:06.161
But naturally there had to be some amendments to a law that was formed in the 13th century as the,

00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:09.151
as the world has changed quite a bit since then.

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:16.195
In the 13th century, nobody could really get into your airspace and the law only really existed to

00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:20.605
stop people doing things like building bridges over the land of someone else.

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:24.978
With the advent of flight, this evidently complicated things.

00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:31.664
If a hot air balloon happened to blow over your lands, blow over the airspace of your land, was this

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:37.574
trespassing in the same way as it would be if a horse and cart of someone else came onto your land?

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:44.839
As you might expect, it wasn't practical for a landowner to have infinite ownership of the airspace.

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.149
This would mean they could do things like extract tariffs for anyone flying above their land, which

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:55.079
would be hugely complicated and it wouldn't really make any sense.

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.789
So what has happened is that most countries recognise the immediate airspace above land as belonging

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:03.479
to the landowner.

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:09.830
Immediate here is defined as the space required so others can't interfere with the routine use of

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.100
it.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.705
Typically, this sky or airspace goes up around a hundred metres from the building, but it varies

00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:22.145
from country to country and there's no hard and fast rule that applies globally.

00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:25.063
It's for the individual countries to decide.

00:06:26.293 --> 00:06:32.359
In practical terms, this means that someone can't build over my property and obscure the light from

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:38.089
above or interfere in any way with what my routine use of the property would be.

00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:44.742
It also means that, as the individual who owns the land owns the immediate sky above, drones,

00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:50.802
aircraft or anything else that may want to decide to come into that space needs the permission of

00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:54.012
the landowner, no matter whether they are manned or not.

00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:59.687
This is becoming an increasing problem with things like drones as lots of people just assume that

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:00.887
they can fly them anywhere.

00:07:01.397 --> 00:07:06.977
In reality, the case is that it's quite a lot more complicated and mostly they can't.

00:07:08.643 --> 00:07:12.751
But above this immediate area, who owns that?

00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:18.181
We've covered only the first hundred meters of the sky, which, although it's debatably the most

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:23.611
important as it's closest to the land, is still only a tiny proportion of the entire sky.

00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:29.172
The answer actually is on one level, quite simple.

00:07:29.472 --> 00:07:32.202
It's owned by the country below the sky.

00:07:33.147 --> 00:07:38.097
This can be the territorial land of the country, or it can be the seas that are also owned by the

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:38.547
country.

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:45.387
As we found out in part one of this mini series, ownership of the sea can stretch out 350 nautical

00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:51.177
miles from the coast and as ownership of the sky belongs to whatever country owns the ground below

00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:55.657
it, well then ownership of the sea can come in pretty handy too.

00:07:56.495 --> 00:08:00.487
In practical terms though, what does ownership actually mean?

00:08:01.342 --> 00:08:06.832
Well, if a country owns something, then it can decide what it wants to do with it and it can decide

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:09.022
how it wants to let others use it.

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:14.542
For starters, it can require other countries to pay to use it, to pay to go into it.

00:08:15.134 --> 00:08:20.974
When aeroplanes fly through the airspace of another country, for example, they have to pay a fee to

00:08:20.974 --> 00:08:22.114
that country to do so.

00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:29.607
If we take the example of a plane flying from Barcelona in Spain to Copenhagen in Denmark, they

00:08:29.607 --> 00:08:35.967
would have to pay almost 1,600 euros in fees to six different countries because they go through the

00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:37.437
airspace of six different countries.

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:44.427
This revenue does of course help cover the cost of providing air traffic control, but especially for

00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:49.137
countries in strategic locations, this can end up being quite a nice little earner.

00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:54.770
Countries that own the airspace can also decide to not allow usage of their airspace.

00:08:55.115 --> 00:09:01.068
This can turn into quite a handy diplomatic tool and is used by countries to exert pressure on

00:09:01.068 --> 00:09:01.518
others.

00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:08.140
As we talked about in the episode on where planes can't fly, Taiwanese airlines, for example, can't

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.090
fly over mainland China, which is a real pain for any Taiwanese airline that needs to go West.

00:09:13.843 --> 00:09:19.133
It's worth saying though, and this is a bit of a leader on to part three of the mini series, that

00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:21.643
ownership of the skies doesn't continue forever.

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:28.290
Evidently, this ownership of the sky can't go on forever, as this would mean that humans would have

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:35.850
in effect, decided to divide up the entire universe, as the Earth turned ownership of different

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.750
parts would change hands and that would obviously be ridiculous.

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:47.340
The sky does end and of course space starts, but in terms of ownership, but also in terms of where

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.080
this happens, it's complicated.

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:56.277
There's currently no global consensus on exactly where sovereignty ends, of where ownership by a

00:09:56.277 --> 00:09:57.117
country ends.

00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:04.257
Suggestions range from 19 miles above the surface to 99 miles above the surface.

00:10:04.706 --> 00:10:10.533
There is one semi-official benchmark, which is called the Karmen line, and that's a hundred

00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:14.573
kilometres, so 62 miles, a hundred kilometres above the surface.

00:10:15.008 --> 00:10:17.590
But this doesn't have any real legal meaning.

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:25.220
So sovereignty, ownership, extends from the earth upwards, but there isn't a global agreement on

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.050
exactly how far this goes.

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:33.235
For the moment there isn't a huge amount of action that happens that far up in the sky.

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:38.957
And a country can't just send a plane higher and higher to bypass the sovereign airspace of another

00:10:38.957 --> 00:10:43.370
way because well, practically no planes can go that far up.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:49.456
Right, so to conclude on who owns the sky, the answer is, well, it's complicated.

00:10:49.993 --> 00:10:55.204
Even though it's been more than a hundred years since the Wright brothers first flew and over 200

00:10:55.204 --> 00:11:00.830
years since the first hot air balloon, ownership of the sky is still not quite as clear as you might

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.730
have thought it was.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.488
If you own the land well, you own the sky above it for as far as you could reasonably claim that it

00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:10.138
is required for you to use it.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.028
And for countries, well, they own or at least control everything above that.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:21.848
There's not quite a global consensus on exactly how far above means here, but it's far enough to

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.288
have not caused any global crises so far.

00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:29.722
Next up, we're going to be talking about the final frontier, space.

00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:35.792
We'll be talking about who owns it, why everyone wants a piece of it, and what that might mean for

00:11:35.792 --> 00:11:36.422
mankind.

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:40.045
That's all coming in part three of this three-part mini series.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.530
So stay tuned for the final episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:15.887
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:20.647
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:27.527
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Death around the world,

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:34.107
what happens when we die, how that is celebrated, or remembered in different countries

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:40.187
all over the world, and talk a bit about the future of what happens when we die.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:47.937
It is going to be a bit of a morbid episode, it’s all about death, but how this human

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:54.457
inevitability is celebrated is a fascinating subject, so if you excuse the fact that

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.797
the entire episode is about death, I hope you’ll find it to be an interesting one.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.989
OK then, we’ve got that disclaimer out of the way, so let’s begin.

00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:07.411
Death happens to all of us.

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:12.281
It’s the one human experience that every single person will get

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:16.301
to experience, even if that might not be a pleasant thought.

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:22.421
And despite it being a shared human experience, there is a lack

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:27.651
of common understanding about what exactly happens when you die.

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:30.741
Physically, we know, of course.

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:38.021
Whether it’s through disease, a road accident, old age or anything in between, your

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:43.581
heart stops, blood stops going to your brain, the kidneys and liver, you become

00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:49.621
lifeless and stop moving, and it’s then that a doctor will give as the ‘time of death’.

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:56.081
This much we know, but what happens after that both physically and

00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:01.361
spiritually depends on where you live, your culture, and your religion.

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.561
You could say that this is the biggest unknown in the world.

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:14.101
Death is a one-way street, there’s no asking someone what it was like when they died.

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:21.787
The closest that we can get to that is accounts of people who have supposedly

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:26.397
come back from the dead, who have come back to life after their heart stopped.

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:32.547
Stories of people whose hearts have stopped often include visions of bright lights,

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:39.857
being revisited by children and loved ones, and them being in an almost dream-like state.

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:47.807
But most scientists are pretty sceptical of these, and these strange visions are normally

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:54.857
just attributed to a lack of oxygen in the brain, which causes this lucid-type of dreaming.

00:02:55.847 --> 00:03:01.817
Of course, the simple, rational, scientific atheist answer to what happens when

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:07.317
we die is ‘absolutely nothing’, but that would make for quite a short episode.

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:11.747
So we are going to talk about some of the other ideas

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:16.107
about what happens, how this is celebrated, and why.

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:21.517
Even going back to prehistoric times, there has been a belief that there is

00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:27.427
something more that happens when we die, that there is something non-corporeal,

00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:32.327
not relating to our bodies, that happens when our bodies stop working.

00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:39.847
The belief about exactly what this is, how it works, and what happens to it varies

00:03:39.877 --> 00:03:45.617
a lot, but we can group it together as being the idea of something like a soul.

00:03:46.357 --> 00:03:51.157
Something that is part of us that continues to exist after we die.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.270
It has been a topic for philosophers and religious thinkers for

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.440
centuries, and different religions and cultures have developed different

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.020
ideas for how it relates to the body, and what happens when we die.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.110
The ancient Egyptians and ancient Chinese believed in an idea of a dual-soul, that your soul was

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.040
formed of two parts, one which stayed near the body and another that proceeded to the afterlife.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:28.901
The Ancient Greeks battled with the idea of the soul, with Epicureans considering it

00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:35.381
to be made up of atoms, like the rest of the body, but Platonists, the disciples of

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:41.551
Plato, believing it to be made out of nothing, not part of the material world at least.

00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:48.201
Aristotle believed that everything that was alive, from humans to plants, have

00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:54.351
souls, and it’s indeed the existence of a soul that makes something alive.

00:04:55.403 --> 00:05:02.553
And early Christians accepted this Greek idea of the immortality of the soul, that the soul

00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:09.573
was something that was created by God at conception, and lived forever, even after death.

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:16.372
We could of course go on forever talking about the different interpretations of the soul, but

00:05:16.492 --> 00:05:22.422
the point is that there seems to be a shared human belief throughout different cultures and

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:28.052
traditions all over the world that there is something that continues to exist after death.

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:33.802
In the West at least, we aren’t very good at talking about death.

00:05:34.822 --> 00:05:40.602
It’s quite a taboo, and if you bring up death in conversation with someone, they

00:05:40.602 --> 00:05:46.962
probably will think you are very weird, rude, creepy, or a combination of all three.

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:53.706
Most of us, thankfully of course, don’t have that much contact with death,

00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:59.216
and when we do have contact with it, it’s normally an elderly relative.

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:03.076
This doesn’t make it any less difficult to deal with

00:06:03.076 --> 00:06:06.646
of course, but it does make it quite infrequent.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.490
Just going back 200 years though, the situation was very different.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.490
In Victorian England, in 1840, the average age of death was

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.700
29, and one in six babies died before they were a year old.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.490
In the worst slum areas of industrial towns of England, the most

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.290
deprived areas, the average age of death was just 13 years old.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.120
Having a child, sibling or parent that died was completely normal.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.030
I’m sure it didn’t make it any less painful when your child died,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.040
but it was far more frequent than it thankfully now is in the West.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.870
And the fact that death was so frequent, so commonplace, back in Victorian England

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.080
is actually one of the reasons for the creation of what to us now might seem

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.000
like one of the strangest death traditions, something called the Death Portrait.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:18.550
When a family member died, whether that was a parent or a child, families would often commission

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:26.060
a photo to be taken, a family portrait of the alive family members together with the dead one.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.970
In the case of a young child, it might be the only photo that would exist

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.050
of them, so it would be the only record that they would have of the child.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.980
They would get a professional photographer to come and take the picture,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.210
and the dead person would be propped up, made to stand up, or put in a

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.500
chair, with their eyes open looking at the camera, as if they were alive.

00:07:54.602 --> 00:08:00.182
The photographer might edit the photograph afterwards - not in Photoshop, of course, but they

00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:06.522
would edit the photograph by painting on it, to make the dead person look, well, not so dead.

00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:11.626
If you have seen any of these photos they truly are bizarre to

00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:16.386
us in the 21st century, but you can understand why they did them.

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:23.096
They might be the only way that the family would have to remember what the deceased person looked

00:08:23.096 --> 00:08:29.826
like, and serve as a memento of that person’s life, no matter how short it might have been.

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:35.226
Nowadays, depending on what country you live in, your religion and

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:40.016
your culture, any number of things might happen to you after you die.

00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:44.126
You might be cremated, burned, and buried.

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:50.656
You might be embalmed, filled with formaldehyde, a chemical to preserve your body, and

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:55.886
laid to rest on a table in the living room so that family members can pay their respects.

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:59.156
You might be buried quickly facing Mecca.

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:04.046
Any number of different things may happen, and we certainly

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:07.586
shouldn't pass judgment on what is right or wrong.

00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:12.306
Today though, we are going to talk about some of the more

00:09:12.356 --> 00:09:16.656
unorthodox death traditions, things that might surprise you.

00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:22.476
Our first death tradition is of the Toraja people in Indonesia.

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:27.606
When a Toraja person dies, they aren’t buried or cremated.

00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:33.256
Instead, they are treated as if they are just sick, not actually dead.

00:09:34.186 --> 00:09:40.446
Time is required to prepare for a proper funeral, which can take weeks, months or years.

00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:47.166
Until that time, the dead person is treated with a mixture of water and formaldehyde

00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:52.076
to preserve the body, and they are kept in the house, as if they’re still alive.

00:09:53.138 --> 00:09:56.638
Their relatives take time to prepare for the funeral,

00:09:57.228 --> 00:10:01.188
and then a huge party is held to celebrate their life.

00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:06.668
The idea is that death isn’t an immediate black and white

00:10:06.668 --> 00:10:10.918
thing, and so this process makes it easier to deal with.

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:14.698
Only after this big funeral are they buried.

00:10:15.128 --> 00:10:17.478
But they aren’t laid to rest forever.

00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:23.858
Indeed, every few years their bodies are dug up, they are taken out

00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:29.458
of their graves, dressed up into clothes, and they are paraded around,

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:35.488
introduced to new family members, and treated as if they were still alive.

00:10:36.576 --> 00:10:43.926
So for the Toraja people death is a fluid process, the line between life and death is

00:10:44.516 --> 00:10:50.416
grey, and they never really treat their dead as if their lives have properly ended.

00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:58.906
Next up in our list of unorthodox deaths around the world is what’s called the Sky Burial in Tibet.

00:11:00.096 --> 00:11:03.856
Tibet, as you may know, is high up in the Himalayas.

00:11:04.536 --> 00:11:11.486
The ground is often frozen, meaning it’s hard to dig into it to bury someone, and there

00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:18.026
isn’t much wood, so it’s hard to make a fire to cremate someone, to burn their body.

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:26.386
Especially in poorer areas of rural Tibet, what happens is that the corpses of the dead, the

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:34.356
bodies of people who have died, are left out to be eaten by scavengers, by birds such as vultures.

00:11:36.256 --> 00:11:41.881
It’s an incredibly spiritual event, with monks chanting prayers around

00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:48.916
the body, cleaning it, wrapping it in cloth, then taking it up to a burial

00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:54.386
site before it is broken into pieces and left to be eaten by the vultures.

00:11:55.933 --> 00:11:59.943
The vultures eating the body serve two purposes.

00:12:01.043 --> 00:12:07.933
Firstly, Tibetan Buddhists believe in reincarnation and these vultures represent angels,

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:13.733
taking the body to the heavens to be reincarnated as something else in another life.

00:12:14.743 --> 00:12:20.563
And secondly, by allowing the vultures to eat the body, this saves the life of another

00:12:20.563 --> 00:12:26.433
animal that the vultures might have otherwise eaten, for example a little mouse.

00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:30.398
When you think about it like that, I think it’s quite a nice idea.

00:12:31.447 --> 00:12:33.477
Our third example is from Ghana.

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:38.586
Now, you might be familiar with a meme of dancing Ghanaian

00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:42.466
pallbearers, of people dancing while carrying a coffin.

00:12:43.386 --> 00:12:47.916
In recent years Ghanaian funerals have developed a tradition of

00:12:47.916 --> 00:12:52.376
having extravagant coffins that reflect the dead person’s preferences.

00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:59.596
So there are coffin-makers that will make a coffin of a Mercedes Benz, if that person drove

00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:06.036
a Mercedes, of a can of coke, if that person loved drinking Coke, or of whatever they wanted.

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:11.706
There are now adverts for coffin-makers alongside the streets of Ghana’s

00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:16.626
capital, Accra, and coffin-makers are highly sought after artists.

00:13:17.686 --> 00:13:23.806
We could certainly go on with examples of unorthodox death traditions around the world

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:30.636
- there is a tradition of eating the dead in the Amazon rainforest, of cutting off part

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:36.296
of your finger for each relative you lost in a tribe in Papua New Guinea, and of cutting

00:13:36.296 --> 00:13:42.446
yourself as a way of remembering a deceased one in certain Aboriginal tribes in Australia.

00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:48.686
These traditions might seem strange to me or you, or they might not do, but

00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:53.426
no doubt whatever traditions you have around death in your country or culture

00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:59.146
would seem equally weird to someone in Tibet or a Toraja person in Indonesia.

00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:07.336
And although how we confront death has evolved as we have, there are some technological

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:13.346
advances that may mean we start to think about life and death in completely different ways.

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:20.171
Of course, we are living for longer and longer, but this isn’t a point about people living forever.

00:14:21.178 --> 00:14:26.438
There are some pretty sound biological arguments, some pretty convincing

00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:31.408
reasons, to suggest that this isn’t going to happen any time soon, and

00:14:31.468 --> 00:14:38.068
even if it could, living to be 150, 200 or more could be fairly unpleasant.

00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:44.417
As we live more of our lives online, sharing photos, sharing our views,

00:14:44.557 --> 00:14:49.717
personalities, and there is an ever increasing amount of data about who we

00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:55.687
are that will exist forever, it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that a

00:14:55.687 --> 00:15:01.047
digital version of us will continue to exist forever, well after our deaths.

00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:06.651
A company like Facebook, which don’t forget owns Facebook of course, Instagram, Whatsapp,

00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:14.731
and Oculus VR, a virtual reality company, has a huge amount of data about its users.

00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:18.041
Who they are, who they contact, what kind of stuff they

00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:22.591
say, what websites they visit, who they actually are.

00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:29.201
People often joke that Facebook knows them better than they know themselves, and if Facebook has

00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:35.191
all this data that it has collected over the course of someone’s entire life, let’s say from when

00:15:35.191 --> 00:15:42.051
they were 13 years old right through to when they are 80, then with virtual reality and artificial

00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:49.451
intelligence it will be able to do a pretty good job of recreating a digital copy of that person.

00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:55.031
You might be able to have a conversation with a deceased loved one, you might be able

00:15:55.031 --> 00:15:59.871
to see what they would have looked like if they had had the chance to grow old, you

00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:04.771
could do almost anything with them, and it would be like they were there with you.

00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:11.031
In a weird way, if you have lived in a country where you haven’t really been able to leave

00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:16.851
your house, town, or city for the past few months and you have had to communicate with loved

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:23.131
ones through things like video calls, this potential future isn’t really that different.

00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:28.371
Now, this might completely creep you out, and you might think it’s the

00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:32.921
weirdest thing in the world, but the possibilities will certainly exist.

00:16:34.001 --> 00:16:40.221
And much like it might seem strange to us that the Victorians used to have Death

00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:46.441
Portraits, and you might be baffled to think that the Toraja people keep their relatives

00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:52.401
in their house for months or years after they die, a future where at least a digital

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:57.731
version of our loved ones remains after they pass is certainly not so far away.

00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:05.341
OK  then, that is it for today's episode on death around the world.

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:09.241
I know it was a bit morbid, but that’s death for you.

00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:14.921
It’s the only inevitability in life, and so we may as well be curious about it.

00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:19.331
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:24.481

I'd love to know: how is death celebrated in your country?

00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:33.391
Would you talk to a virtual version of a deceased loved one?

00:17:34.081 --> 00:17:37.211
It would certainly be weird, but I think I probably would.

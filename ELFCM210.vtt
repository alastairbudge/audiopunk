Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:16.928
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:21.328
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:25.468
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:29.468
talking about The Illogicality of The English Language.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:35.398
If you are listening to this show, you are probably learning English, or perhaps

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:40.468
I should say you are engaged in a life-long battle with the English language.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:47.278
If you are like many English learners, you have a love-hate relationship with English.

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:52.368
There are some parts of English that are so easy - no complicated

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:57.818
verb tenses, no tones, a relatively easy grammatical structure.

00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:02.748
So it’s not so difficult to get to an intermediate level.

00:01:03.218 --> 00:01:09.678
But the more you learn, the more you encounter weird rules, illogicalities

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:14.858
of the English language, and these will be the focus of today’s episode.

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:19.908
First, we’ll talk about some of the reasons why English is so weird,

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:24.618
because there is a certain logic, or at least reason, to the chaos.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.218
Then we’ll talk about some of the most confusing elements of the

00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:34.458
language: homophones, homonyms, homographs and confusing spellings.

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:40.678
And finally we’ll talk about something I bet you have never heard of: lonely negatives.

00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:46.478
You might find a few idioms in this episode, but you will be thankful that there

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:51.708
will be no mention of phrasal verbs, or at least, that will be the only mention.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.840
OK then, let’s talk about English.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.900
Where should we start?

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.390
Well, perhaps it will make you feel better if I congratulated

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.780
you for taking on the difficult task of learning English.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.190
Why?

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.210
Well, firstly, this curious language has so many words in its vocabulary.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.260
If you include all the scientific words, the total number of words

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.200
in English amounts to over 1 million, says Global Language Monitor.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.400
Even the number in the Oxford English Dictionary is a massive 170,000.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.540
Native speakers might know around 40,000 words, although

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.140
they are likely only to use about half that number.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.250
Even 20,000 is quite a challenge.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.880
My task is to help you understand a little bit more about why the English

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.550
language is as strange as it is, and to do that let’s start with an

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.710
explanation of why English is such a strange language, and how it has changed.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.700
This will be a little bit of a whistlestop tour, a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.230
quick trip through the history of the English Language.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.900
If you are interested in exploring this further, I would recommend

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.890
listening to Episode 134, which goes into this in much greater detail.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.970
Many of the reasons behind both the complexity and the richness of English

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.403
can be found in the hybrid or mongrel nature of the language’s development.

00:03:34.573 --> 00:03:39.893
Like a person with a big and undiscerning or undiscriminating

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:45.733
appetite, English has consumed or eaten anything that came its way.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:52.693
No matter if it might already have a perfectly good word for something – like, say, man

00:03:52.703 --> 00:03:59.233
or farm or cow – it will quickly borrow or take on another word from another language.

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:04.347
“Mmm, thank you very much!” it says, and gobbles or swallows the new word.

00:04:05.503 --> 00:04:09.583
This process means that English is constantly adopting

00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:14.103
new words and abandoning words which fall out of use.

00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:22.313
To return to the eating or culinary image, it is voracious - it will eat up anything.

00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:30.243
And interestingly, unlike languages such as French or Spanish, with L’Académie française,

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:36.369
and La Real Academia Española, there is no central body that governs the English language.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:43.789
Like a rampaging bull, or a mutating virus, it is free to do whatever it wants.

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:46.579
So, to our quick historical tour.

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:51.839
The basis of the language comes from the invasion of Britain by the

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:57.249
Northern European tribes, known as the Anglo-Saxons in the fourth century.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:02.619
The collection of words was then developed further, about 400 years

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:08.829
later by a further invasion from even further north, by the Vikings.

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:14.459
In addition to these two sets of people invading and then settling

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:20.199
in England, there was the so-called Norman Invasion of 1066 which

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:26.549
resulted in an infusion of French words, mostly words of Latin origin.

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.079
Running alongside these massive changes to the language over its early, formative years

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:39.989
are some less well-known influences, which are particularly relevant to our story.

00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:46.299
These have to do with the way in which the language was recorded on paper.

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:52.319
In the era before the invention of printing, the people who copied

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:57.999
scripts or pieces of paper by hand, known as scribes, would make

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:03.139
changes in order to make it easier for people to read their scripts.

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:11.999
For example, in early English, the letters i, n and m were all drawn

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:17.819
using a very similar downward stroke of the pen called a minim.

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:25.309
This word itself, minim, which is spelled M I N I M, would have

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:30.429
looked simply like ten identical downward strokes of the pen.

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:33.219
Quite confusing, I think you will agree.

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.859
So, what did our clever fourteenth century scribes do to help the situation?

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:47.329
Instead of changing the way that letters were written, they made some simple changes to spelling.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:57.839
For example the word for the bit of flesh in our mouths, went from being spelt “tunge ” to

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:08.169
“tongue”, tongue, so they changed the first “u” to an “o” and added a “u” at the end.

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:13.959
The change from “u” to “o” made the word easier to read.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.199
With the arrival of printing in the 15th century, there were more changes made

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:25.879
by the people in charge of reproducing the language; in this case, these were the

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.689
people who set the type – the letters which were used in the early printing press.

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.449
They made all sorts of changes.

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:48.209
For example, the old spelling for a female monarch, “queen”, Q U E E N, the old spelling was “cwen”.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:55.069
These typesetters changed the word to a spelling more in keeping with

00:07:55.069 --> 00:08:00.229
the higher status language of the relatively recent invaders, the

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:06.879
French, resulting in the spelling we know now – “queen”, Q U double E N.

00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:13.199
A similar thing happened with certain softer French sounds coming into the

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:20.559
language, for example, with the soft “ch” sound at the start of “church”.

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:27.649
Even now, if you travel North in the British Isles, you will find that in Scotland,

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:34.009
this soft “ch-“ sound is not used to describe a place of Christian worship.

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:41.879
The Scots, especially in the far north of the country, refer to it as the kirk, with the hard C.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:48.239
The further north you go, the harsher, the more Germanic are the consonants.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.859
Bizarrely, because many of the type setters – the printers – were from

00:08:54.859 --> 00:09:00.239
the modern day Netherlands, words were spelt using elements of Dutch.

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:06.779
For example, an “h” was put into various words, resulting in the modern

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:13.819
day spellings of ghost, ghastly and gherkin [which is a small, pickled

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:17.839
cucumber that you sometimes find sliced in a hamburger, by the way].

00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:22.109
Snobbery, or arrogance, played a part too.

00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:27.889
With the Renaissance fashion for claiming classical ancestry for words,

00:09:27.929 --> 00:09:33.239
that's Latin or Greek ancestry for words, certain words were given

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:39.259
additional letters in order to show their classical pedigree or origin.

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:49.199
For example, the old English word “people” used to be spelt “peple”, without an “o”.

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:56.909
The word for money that you owe to someone was “det”, but it was thought

00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:04.881
good to show its Latin origins so a silent “b” was added, hence debt.

00:10:05.658 --> 00:10:10.119
And the other main historical factor that has added to the confusion of

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:15.099
English is that there are simply so many people from so many different

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:20.489
countries that speak it, leading to differences in word use and pronunciation.

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:23.879
OK, that's enough history for now.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:30.849
Let’s dive into our first confusing category of English illogicality, homophones.

00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:37.379
If you aren’t familiar with the term, homophone, you will probably be familiar with the concept:

00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:45.189
a homophone is when two words have the same pronunciation but different spellings and meanings.

00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:52.559
Now, homophones aren't unique to English, most languages have them, but the sheer

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:58.819
volume that exists in English makes it even more confusing, and funny at the same time.

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:03.949
For example, the number “eight” and the past tense of the

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:08.779
verb “to eat” sound exactly the same: “eight” and “ate”.

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:11.129
“I ate eight hamburgers”.

00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:16.486
Homophones get even more confusing when you add connected speech in there,

00:11:16.746 --> 00:11:22.516
and offer a lot of room for misinterpretation, even with native speakers.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.876
Here's a famous clip from two comedians called The Two Ronnies:

00:11:31.183 --> 00:11:32.103
fork handles

00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:42.380
four candles.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:53.400
Well, there you are, four candles, no fork handles, handles for forks.

00:11:57.862 --> 00:12:04.542
So, to explain what was going on there, the first guy asked for “fork handles”.

00:12:05.082 --> 00:12:09.042
The shop assistant heard it as “four”, the number 4,

00:12:09.532 --> 00:12:14.602
“candles”, but the customer actually wanted handles for forks.

00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:22.462
Moving on, our next category is homonyms, or words that are spelled and pronounced

00:12:22.482 --> 00:12:27.642
in exactly the same way but can mean two or more completely different things.

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:32.382
Again, English isn’t the only language where these exist,

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:36.522
but it does have more homonyms than most other languages.

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:42.382
Some examples might already be coming to mind, but here are a few

00:12:42.392 --> 00:12:47.392
for you, some which probably will be familiar, others might not be.

00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:56.762
So, a bat is a small animal that flies in the night, but you can also hit a cricket ball with a bat.

00:12:57.692 --> 00:13:01.222
On the subject of cricket, you might play in a cricket

00:13:01.262 --> 00:13:05.572
match and you can also light a candle with a match.

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:12.727
The list goes on, and homonyms in particular offer excellent possibilities for jokes.

00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:19.286
Our third confusing category also begins with “homo”, and it is the homograph.

00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:24.487
Again, you have probably encountered these, even if you don’t know the word.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:29.247
Homographs are two words that are written in the same

00:13:29.247 --> 00:13:33.057
way, but have two different pronunciations and meanings.

00:13:34.007 --> 00:13:42.597
For example the word that is written “S O W” means “to put seeds into the ground”

00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:49.737
when it is pronounced “sow” and “a female pig” when it is pronounced “sow”.

00:13:50.807 --> 00:13:51.137
So...

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.837
Sow and sow.

00:13:53.897 --> 00:14:02.057
With this example things get even more confusing when the word “sew”, as in to “sew a dress” is

00:14:02.057 --> 00:14:10.687
pronounced “sew”, in exactly the same way as the word “so”, but that is a topic for another day.

00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:15.597
English has, unfortunately, tonnes of homographs.

00:14:16.827 --> 00:14:22.477
“B a s s” can be pronounced bass, and it means a type

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:27.247
of fish, and bass and it’s a type of musical instrument.

00:14:28.207 --> 00:14:34.807
“T E A R” is pronounced “tear” when it is something that comes out of your eye when

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:41.937
you cry, but if you pronounce it “tear” it means to pull something apart by force.

00:14:42.537 --> 00:14:49.237
And tear rhymes with pair, “p a i r”, meaning two of something AND

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:57.157
pear “p e a r”, that delicious fruit AND “P A R E”, pare, which is a

00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:01.687
slightly strange word meaning to cut away the outside of something.

00:15:02.507 --> 00:15:08.277
OK, if you are feeling a little bit ill and uncomfortable now, I certainly wouldn’t blame you.

00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:10.037
It is complicated!

00:15:10.917 --> 00:15:14.637
You can take heart, you can console yourself in the

00:15:14.737 --> 00:15:17.947
knowledge that many native speakers get these wrong.

00:15:19.207 --> 00:15:27.237
Our final category of unusual words or illogicalities is something called Lonely Negatives.

00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:35.137
Although this sounds like something from a bad dating site, it is in fact yet more interesting.

00:15:36.007 --> 00:15:41.747
It refers to words in English where there is only a negative word and the positive

00:15:41.757 --> 00:15:48.987
version either has never existed or has simply died or disappeared through lack of use.

00:15:49.897 --> 00:15:57.797
Remember, in general when you add “dis”, “non”, “un” or “im” to the start of the word, or you

00:15:57.827 --> 00:16:04.467
add “less” to the end, it normally has the effect of meaning the opposite of the root word.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.943
For example, approve and disapprove, resident and nonresident,

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:18.313
equal and unequal, plausible and implausible, useful and useless.

00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:24.403
Adding these prefixes or suffixes completely changes the meaning of the word,

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:30.763
but in the case of Lonely Negatives, the word exists only in the negative.

00:16:31.663 --> 00:16:41.203
Listen to this sentence: “The dishevelled man walked nonchalantly forward, holding an unwieldy club.

00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:47.733
He said: ‘I may look unkempt and disgruntled, but believe

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:54.263
me, my manners are impeccable and my will to win ruthless.”

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:59.513
So, the words to listen out for there, were dishevelled,

00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:06.542
nonchalantly, unwieldy, unkempt, disgruntled, impeccable and ruthless.

00:17:07.322 --> 00:17:12.052
What these words have in common is that they do not have an equivalent

00:17:12.172 --> 00:17:17.492
positive word; for example, taking the first one from my sentence,

00:17:17.632 --> 00:17:21.482
dishevelled, there is no word in English which means its opposite.

00:17:22.582 --> 00:17:26.632
It is tempting to think that the word “chevelled” exists

00:17:26.652 --> 00:17:31.482
and means neat or well turned out, but no it doesn’t.

00:17:32.322 --> 00:17:39.222
Likewise with “unkempt”, which means untidy or messy, and comes from Old English by

00:17:39.222 --> 00:17:45.592
the way, there is no longer a word “kempt” meaning neat or literally well-combed.

00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:52.872
Just to add an additional annoyance, in the case of the seventh word, “disgruntled,”

00:17:52.942 --> 00:17:58.592
there was originally a word “gruntled” meaning bad-tempered or grumpy.

00:17:59.042 --> 00:18:06.922
The prefix “dis-“ is actually an intensifier — in other words it means very grumpy or annoyed.

00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:12.862
But, just to save you embarrassment, the word “gruntled” is no longer used.

00:18:13.732 --> 00:18:14.762
Confusing, right?

00:18:15.202 --> 00:18:16.892
Well, yes it is.

00:18:17.192 --> 00:18:23.292
There is no getting around the fact that mastering all of these complications is very tricky.

00:18:23.692 --> 00:18:29.482
Many native speakers have trouble doing it, and given that we all now write by hand

00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:35.412
significantly less than in the past, and we have become reliant on spell checks and

00:18:35.652 --> 00:18:41.862
technology to correct us where our brain fails it is going to be even harder for people

00:18:41.862 --> 00:18:47.142
to know how to spell words correctly, when all they might know is their pronunciation.

00:18:48.192 --> 00:18:55.052
Native speakers always mess up the difference between your “your”, as in

00:18:55.212 --> 00:19:02.812
this is “your house”, and “y o u ‘ r e”, you're as in “you’re going home”.

00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:07.132
There is much to love about the English language, and much

00:19:07.132 --> 00:19:12.245
to well, I won’t say hate, but I’ll say be  frustrated by.

00:19:12.955 --> 00:19:19.605
My only advice to you is to take heart, to take comfort, in the fact that you’re certainly not

00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:25.735
alone, and the native and non-native English speaking population is there struggling with you.

00:19:26.825 --> 00:19:33.775
So next time you pronounce a silent “b”, or you look at the words cough, hiccough,

00:19:34.095 --> 00:19:40.495
rough, plough, lough, though and through and ask yourself how it is possible

00:19:40.615 --> 00:19:45.375
that they all end with the same last four letters and are pronounced completely

00:19:45.405 --> 00:19:51.522
differently, instead of getting worked up and annoyed, just embrace the chaos, and

00:19:51.522 --> 00:19:56.805
remember that English is a language that really doesn’t make much sense at all.

00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:05.742
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Illogicality of The English Language.

00:20:06.232 --> 00:20:10.482
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that it

00:20:10.492 --> 00:20:15.442
has given you some comfort about this weird and wonderful language you are learning.

00:20:16.032 --> 00:20:19.452
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

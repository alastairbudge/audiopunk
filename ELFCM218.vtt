Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:16.405
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.745
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:27.455
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part series on fast food.

00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:32.945
In part one we talked about the early history of fast food in America,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:38.105
how giants like McDonald’s got started, and how they took over America.

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:43.705
Then in part two, which was one of our member-only episodes, we talked

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:48.775
about how fast food companies went global, how American fast food companies

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:53.415
conquered the world, when this worked and some of the times it didn’t.

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:59.835
And in today’s episode, part three of this mini-series, we are going to look at the state

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:07.225
of fast food today, how much of it we actually eat, how it has adapted over the years, what

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:12.975
it is doing to our bodies and ask ourselves what the future might look like for fast food.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.220
Ok then, fast food today.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.500
Let's start with a few statistics, to remind ourselves

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.060
of just how large a part of our lives fast food plays.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.870
All around the world billions of people eat fast food every single day, and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.010
1% of the world’s population, 68 million people, will eat at McDonald's today.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.150
In the US alone one single burger, The Whopper, is eaten every 15 seconds,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.080
and globally the consumption of fast food is growing every single year.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.330
And staying in the United States, on any given day a quarter

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.820
of the population will eat at a fast-food restaurant.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.600
We heard how we got here in parts one and two.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.120
Fast food is convenient, it is a cheap source of energy, it is easy, it is satisfyingly familiar.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.670
American fast food companies successfully exported this formula across the globe, and we are now a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.210
world, and this is particularly true for the developed world, a world addicted to eating fast food.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.210
Everywhere fast food companies have gone, they have had a huge impact.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.840
Let's first talk about people.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.560
In the United States, almost 5 million people are employed by the fast food

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.440
industry, that’s 3% of the adult working population, or 1 in 30 working adults

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.180
in America, or, to put it another way, it’s as if the entire population of

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.680
Scotland, were flipping burgers, preparing tacos or serving you french fries.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.350
An even larger proportion of the population have

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.120
worked in a fast food restaurant at some point in time.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.290
1 in every Americans has worked at McDonald’s at some point in their life,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.680
including the singer Pharrell Williams and the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.860
And indirectly, in terms of all of the people involved in everything from the raising

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.480
of the chickens that go into the KFC Zinger Tower burgers, the potatoes that go

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.480
into French fries or even the companies that build the retractable windows used for

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.320
drive thrus, there are millions more whose livelihoods depend on people gobbling

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.480
down burgers, pizza and fried chicken, whose lives depend on the fast food industry.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.970
One of the consequences of this is that the fast food industry

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.930
is very powerful when it comes to negotiations with government.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.240
In the US, for example, the biggest fast food industry in the world, the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.330
lobbying groups related to fast food are some of the most powerful in Washington.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.320
They have successfully played a part in lobbying for subsidies, government

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.640
financial aid, for some of the key products of the fast food industry, such

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.869
as corn, soy and beef, which either go directly into the food you eat, in

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:32.809
the example of beef, or indirectly, by being used to create food for animals.

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:37.189
Essentially the U S governments via taxpayer money

00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:40.528
is keeping down the cost of Big Mac meals in America.

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:46.188
When it comes to the future of the fast food industry, industry analysts

00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:51.468
can't seem to see a future where the industry is much smaller than today.

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:55.878
It is remarkably recession proof - by that I mean that

00:04:56.078 --> 00:05:00.488
people visit fast food restaurants in good and bad times.

00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:04.748
They are cheap, so in a recession people might go to

00:05:04.748 --> 00:05:07.918
them as an alternative to traditional restaurants.

00:05:08.218 --> 00:05:11.328
They don’t stop going to fast food restaurants altogether.

00:05:12.118 --> 00:05:18.598
Indeed, during the financial crisis of 2007-2009 sales at McDonald’s

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:25.398
actually went up by 18% and the entire fast food industry grew by 4%.

00:05:26.148 --> 00:05:31.048
Even during the COVID pandemic, most fast food restaurants continued to grow.

00:05:31.678 --> 00:05:34.778
At the start of the pandemic, as many were forced to

00:05:34.778 --> 00:05:39.578
close, sales plummeted but they soon started to pick up.

00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:49.918
Indeed, the global fast industry is predicted to grow at an average of 7.35% from 2020-2027,

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:58.948
faster than the 5% that it was growing annually from the period 2015-2019, before COVID hit.

00:05:59.948 --> 00:06:05.838
But, COVID has had a large impact on our dining habits, with the line between

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:11.558
fast food and restaurant food now a little more blurry than it was before.

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:19.158
Pre-COVID, if you wanted takeaway or delivery food, in the majority of restaurants in

00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:25.608
Europe and the US that is, your options were limited mainly to fast food restaurants.

00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:32.668
Whether this was calling up your local pizza delivery restaurant, walking into a McDonald’s or

00:06:32.868 --> 00:06:39.948
going to a drive-thru, if you wanted to eat outside a restaurant fast food was the dominant option.

00:06:40.758 --> 00:06:45.808
COVID forced traditional restaurants to start offering a take-away or delivery

00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:51.488
service, and it also got customers used to the idea of ordering restaurant

00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:56.138
food to eat at at home, especially from apps such as Uber Eats, Deliveroo,

00:06:56.158 --> 00:07:01.868
Glovo, GrubHub or any of the hundreds of other options that have emerged.

00:07:02.418 --> 00:07:06.458
Many of these options already existed before the pandemic,

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:10.168
but it was a trend that was accelerated by COVID.

00:07:11.608 --> 00:07:15.678
People are getting more used to being able to order ready to eat

00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:19.458
food through an app, and now fast food isn’t the only option.

00:07:20.248 --> 00:07:24.748
Fast food might be cheaper than traditional restaurants, but for many people

00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:28.918
it is not so much cheaper that they are willing to compromise on taste.

00:07:29.588 --> 00:07:34.758
And even for the biggest fast food lovers, it is hard to deny that the

00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:38.558
quality is not the same as you would get at a traditional restaurant.

00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:46.148
So, when faced with the decision about paying a little bit more and having a higher quality meal

00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:52.538
delivered to your door or having to go out and buy a cheaper option but lower quality fast food

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:58.858
meal, well consumers now have this different option that wasn't so readily available before.

00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:04.018
There’s also an increasing consumer demand for more

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:09.198
environmentally-friendly options, vegan or plant-based burgers for example.

00:08:09.878 --> 00:08:15.798
You can now get the famous plant-based Impossible Burger at Burger King, and McDonald’s

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:21.796
is currently testing its own version of a plant-based burger, called the PLC.

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:28.528
And although these plant-based burgers have proved to be just as bad for you from

00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:34.608
a health perspective as regular burgers, there is this increasing demand with some

00:08:34.608 --> 00:08:40.428
consumers, especially younger consumers for both greener and healthier choices.

00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:46.653
Combined with all of this, and partly as a result of it, there has been a large

00:08:46.673 --> 00:08:51.353
increase in what’s called “fast casual” restaurants - restaurants that offer

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:57.633
better quality food, often healthier options and charge higher prices, so the

00:08:57.633 --> 00:09:03.563
division between what is fast food and what isn’t is less clear than ever before.

00:09:04.453 --> 00:09:10.483
This leaves the original fast food chains with a bit of a conundrum, a bit of a dilemma.

00:09:11.193 --> 00:09:16.373
Do they try to embrace these new trends or do they stick to their guns,

00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:21.743
stick to what originally made them successful: cheap, unhealthy comfort food?

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:27.503
Burger King, for example, is sticking to its guns, offering some new

00:09:27.503 --> 00:09:32.623
items but broadly sticking to what it knows best: burgers and fries.

00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:38.753
On the other hand the biggest fast food brand in the world, McDonald’s, has branched

00:09:38.783 --> 00:09:44.723
out into all sorts of new things, with up to 100 options available on its menus.

00:09:45.113 --> 00:09:51.643
Wraps, salads, fancy coffees, and a huge variety of options compared to when

00:09:51.643 --> 00:09:57.293
it launched in 1948 with only 9 options, burgers and fries for the most part.

00:09:58.443 --> 00:10:05.303
There are all sorts of news headlines about how McDonald’s has lost its mojo, how it has lost

00:10:05.303 --> 00:10:12.078
its identity, how it is trying to be everything to everyone, how it should go back to what

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:17.988
it knows best, and that people eating at McDonald’s aren’t doing so because they want healthy

00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:23.398
options - they know exactly what they want, and that’s a burger, fries and a fizzy drink.

00:10:23.938 --> 00:10:27.568
They know that it’s not healthy, but that’s ok - people

00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:30.248
aren’t stupid, they know exactly what they’re getting.

00:10:31.178 --> 00:10:35.288
Now, on that subject it would be irresponsible if we didn’t

00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:40.108
touch on what this rising addiction to fast food has done to us.

00:10:40.728 --> 00:10:45.558
The simple answer is it has been very bad news for our bodies.

00:10:46.268 --> 00:10:52.098
In the 1950s less than 10% of Americans were overweight or obese.

00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:57.198
By 1975, which was the same year McDonald’s launched

00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:00.898
its first Drive-Thru service, that number was 15%.

00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:07.498
Now it’s around 32%, and not one state in the United States

00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:12.818
meets the Healthy People Guidelines of obesity at 15% or less.

00:11:13.948 --> 00:11:18.568
The result of this is that heart disease has for years been the

00:11:18.698 --> 00:11:22.958
leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States.

00:11:23.488 --> 00:11:25.868
And it’s not just the United States.

00:11:26.548 --> 00:11:34.398
Globally, 39% of all adults are overweight and 13% of the world’s population is obese.

00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:41.768
Heart disease is now the biggest cause of death worldwide, responsible for 16% of

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:47.748
all deaths, and diabetes is now in the top 10 list of cause of deaths worldwide.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:54.148
Of course, not all of this can be attributed directly to fast food, but

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:59.468
if we continued to eat and drink as we did in the 1950s, without Big

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:03.878
Macs, fries and cokes, then these numbers would be significantly lower.

00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:09.478
It’s abundantly clear that eating fast food regularly is not healthy.

00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:15.458
If you’ve seen the 2004 documentary, Supersize Me, you’ll remember

00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:21.078
that its director eats only McDonald’s for 30 days in a row, and ends

00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:26.348
up putting on 13% of his body weight and having heart palpitations.

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:33.928
Now, as to the future of fast food, it is an industry that shows little sign of slowing down.

00:12:34.498 --> 00:12:39.588
Despite all of the warnings about the health dangers of eating lots of fast food

00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:45.308
and the competition from healthier options, we eat more and more of it every year.

00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:49.678
Fast food chains are very good at adapting to customer

00:12:49.698 --> 00:12:54.278
demands, whether that’s regional varieties or changing tastes.

00:12:54.898 --> 00:12:59.018
And for all of the articles that you might read about people opting

00:12:59.018 --> 00:13:03.898
for healthier lifestyles, when it comes to fast food that data suggests

00:13:03.898 --> 00:13:07.478
that most people are very happy to eat what they have always eaten.

00:13:08.248 --> 00:13:14.698
We might know that it’s bad for us, and it might be healthier and probably cheaper to eat a salad

00:13:14.738 --> 00:13:21.238
at home, but when it comes down to it, it is very tempting to pop into a McDonald’s or Burger

00:13:21.238 --> 00:13:27.888
King, to have that familiar smell, knowing you’ll have a familiar warm meal that will certainly

00:13:27.888 --> 00:13:33.418
fill you up, it will stop you being hungry, and it won’t break the bank, it won’t cost very much.

00:13:34.218 --> 00:13:40.968
So for as long as more and more of us continue to do this every year, and fast food restaurants get

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:48.378
better and better at finding ways to make us come back, fast food isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

00:13:50.613 --> 00:13:56.053
OK then, that is it for today's episode on fast food, today and tomorrow,

00:13:56.173 --> 00:14:00.563
and with that comes the end of this three-part mini series on fast food.

00:14:01.153 --> 00:14:05.593
As a reminder, in part one we talked about how the fast food industry

00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:10.103
got started, how giants like McDonald’s transformed the American

00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:14.253
dining experience, and some of the characters that were involved.

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:19.433
In part two, which was one of our member-only episodes, we talked

00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:24.673
about when and how fast food went global, how American fast food chains

00:14:24.773 --> 00:14:29.233
conquered the world and some of the times that it didn’t quite go to plan.

00:14:29.983 --> 00:14:33.403
I hope you enjoyed this mini-series, and that you learned something new.

00:14:33.723 --> 00:14:39.303
Literally hundreds of millions of people eat at American fast food restaurants every single

00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:45.383
day, and whether you are a fast food lover, someone who will never set foot in a fast food

00:14:45.383 --> 00:14:51.283
restaurant, or you’re somewhere in between, I hope that this mini-series helped shed light

00:14:51.313 --> 00:14:57.283
on this industry that touches on so many of our lives, either directly or indirectly.

00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:03.483
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series overall.

00:15:03.863 --> 00:15:07.803
For the fast food lovers, what is your favourite chain and why,

00:15:08.043 --> 00:15:12.003
and how has it adapted to the tastes of the country you live in?

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:15.073
And if you are the sort of person who wouldn’t be

00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:18.693
caught dead in a fast food restaurant, why is that?

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:23.143
Can you understand the appeal of fast food, or is it just a mystery to you?

00:15:23.573 --> 00:15:24.823
I would love to know.

00:15:25.443 --> 00:15:28.413

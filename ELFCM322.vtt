Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.658
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:20.968
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:26.656
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man who has been

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:33.306
preparing for his job since the age of three, a man who was only given this job 70 years

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:38.966
later, a man who had to take the job the minute after his mother took her last breath.

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:45.036
I am talking, of course, about King Charles III, the King of the United Kingdom.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:50.996
This is actually going to be part one of a two-part series on King Charles.

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:56.196
In this episode, we’ll talk about his life, and his long journey to the British crown.

00:00:56.616 --> 00:01:00.156
And in part two, we are going to go a little deeper, and

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:05.096
ask ourselves the question of Who Is The Real King Charles?

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:08.956
Who is Charles the man, what life experiences have shaped

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:12.356
his character, and what will this mean for his reign?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.719
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the life of Charles III.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.479
You may know that royals tend to have very long names,

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.869
and in this respect, Charles is no disappointment.

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:35.889
He was born Prince Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.469
on the 14th of November, 1948, at Buckingham Palace, in London.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.429
His mother, as you probably know, was then Princess Elizabeth,

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.549
and his father was Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:58.649
His grandfather was King George VI, and when his mother became Queen on February 6th of 1952, at the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.519
age of 3 Charles became the heir apparent to the British throne, in other words, the next in line.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.796
Unlike the children of Prince William today, Charles was kept relatively hidden, out of public view.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:19.706
There were pictures of him as a little baby, but his first “official outing”

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:24.676
was when Charles was just 4 years old and he sat between the Queen Mother

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:29.286
and his auntie, Princess Margaret, at his mother’s coronation ceremony.

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:34.046
He was in the public spotlight, and…he would never really

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.616
leave, he would spend the rest of his life in the public eye.

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:44.406
Interestingly enough, the young Prince Charles was the first British heir to actually go

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:50.556
to school instead of having private tutors, as was customary for future Kings and Queens.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:56.096
But of course, he didn’t go to any normal school, he went to exclusive

00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.386
private schools, first in west London, then just outside London.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:06.806
And then as a teenager, he changed to a harsh school in the far north of Scotland,

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:12.416
the school where his father had gone; this school was called Gordonstoun, a place

00:03:12.606 --> 00:03:17.876
this sensitive young boy would later reveal he loathed, he absolutely hated.

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:22.566
He was also the first heir to get a university degree when he

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:26.216
studied archaeology, anthropology and history at Cambridge.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:33.756
After graduating, as was customary for male members of the British royal family, Charles then

00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:40.126
served in the Royal Navy where he eventually became Commander of a ship called the HMS Bronington.

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:44.906
The other customary duty for a male heir to the British throne

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:49.746
was, of course, to find a wife, a woman who would become his queen.

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:55.426
As you can probably imagine, Charles was considered quite the eligible

00:03:55.536 --> 00:04:00.946
bachelor, a desirable single man, and had a whole host of potential wives

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:05.536
to choose from in Britain’s - and indeed Europe’s - aristocratic circles.

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:10.736
This wasn’t just about finding a suitable woman to become his wife

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:15.856
and Queen, it was about finding the right “mate”, in the more primary

00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:19.836
sense of the word - by this I mean the right mother for his children.

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:26.676
As you know, monarchies are hereditary or run by bloodline, and

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:30.186
as the king in waiting, Charles was expected to produce an heir.

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:36.546
After a decade or so of short-lived relationships with a range of potential

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:43.216
matches, Charles finally decided it was time to settle down and find his princess.

00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:50.146
In 1980, when he was 31 years old, Charles began seeing a lady called Diana

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:55.556
Spencer, who was 12 years his junior and just 19 years old at the time.

00:04:56.986 --> 00:05:01.696
Diana was herself from noble blood, the third child and

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:06.196
youngest daughter of Edward John Spencer, Viscount Althorp.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:10.016
Indeed, she was actually a distant relative of Charles.

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:11.246
Charles

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:11.976
met Diana

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:15.336
because he was initially involved with - or courting,

00:05:15.486 --> 00:05:19.196
as the Royals might say - Diana’s older sister, Sarah.

00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:25.842
The pair continued to see each other, and the following year, in February 1981,

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:31.116
there was an almighty media frenzy when their engagement was announced to the public.

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:37.656
As you will probably know, this was not a fairytale marriage, it did not end well.

00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:41.916
Even in the early days of their relationship, for anyone

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.556
looking closely enough, there were seeds of doubt.

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:50.296
In 1981, during an interview about their engagement on British

00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:54.156
television, the young couple were asked if they felt in love.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:55.786
Here’s their response:

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.951
I suppose in love

00:05:58.841 --> 00:05:59.441
of course

00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:02.216
whatever in love

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:02.406
means

00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:04.006
it's your own interpretation

00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:05.566
obviously it means two very happy people

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:05.966
Yes

00:06:06.826 --> 00:06:12.391
In case you missed that, when the reporter said “I suppose, in love”, Diana

00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:18.611
replied, “Of course,” but Charles awkwardly said, “Whatever ‘in love’ means.”

00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:24.111
A philosophical response, perhaps, a response of a deep thinker.

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:29.651
Or, perhaps, the response of a man who is about to marry a woman he doesn’t really love.

00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:36.711
Despite this, they married later that year on July 29th, 1981, at St.

00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:42.101
Paul’s Cathedral in London, and a record-breaking 750 million people

00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:45.941
tuned in from around the world to watch the service on television.

00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:51.011
The next year their first son, Prince William, who is now the Duke of

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:54.801
Cambridge, was born, and then Prince Harry arrived two years later.

00:06:55.541 --> 00:07:01.021
Diana had done her main duty, she had provided two heirs, but she was not

00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:05.321
the sort of lady to live in the shadows, to retreat into the background.

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:11.281
She was particularly admired for her humanitarian work, and in one famous

00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:17.941
episode, in 1987, at the height of the HIV/AIDS panic, Diana publicly shook

00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:23.501
hands with someone who was HIV-positive in a bid to destigmatise the disease.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:29.211
And she was hugely popular with the British public, far more so than

00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:33.271
Charles, and far more so than any other member of The Royal Family.

00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:38.661
Polling from 1997 showed that Diana had an approval rating

00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:45.341
of + 66, with Charles at minus 7 and the Royal Family at -15.

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:52.751
And Prince, now King Charles, has never been particularly popular with the British public.

00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:57.451
He has faced continued criticism in the media over the years for what

00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:02.251
was perceived to be an extravagant lifestyle - even by royal standards.

00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:08.461
By the time he was crowned King, Charles reportedly had six homes, a large

00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:13.601
staff of servants, 11 secretaries, and a selection of expensive cars.

00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:19.831
In the past he even, it was alleged, had a servant specifically to

00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:24.721
squeeze his toothpaste onto his toothbrush, and to iron his shoelaces.

00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:30.601
Now, back to his relationship with his wife, as you know, the

00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:34.241
story of Charles and Diana didn’t have a fairytale ending.

00:08:34.921 --> 00:08:37.591
The two were poorly suited for one another.

00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:44.201
But there was someone who Charles believed was his perfect match, his soul mate.

00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:46.691
And her name was Camilla.

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:52.981
Now, for this story, we need to go back in time slightly, to 1970,

00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:57.741
when Charles was 22 years old, 11 years before he married Diana.

00:08:58.811 --> 00:09:04.071
It was then that a young Charles met a lady by the name of Camilla Shand.

00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:11.051
Some say they met at a polo match, others that they were introduced by a mutual friend.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:17.911
However they met, the pair soon began courting, they were in a romantic relationship.

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.471
Charles adored Camilla.

00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:25.901
He felt that she treated him like a normal person, not as a king-in-waiting.

00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:31.591
They talked for hours on end, and it really was a relationship of equals.

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:38.271
But the royal family, meaning the Queen and Prince Phillip, did not approve of Camilla.

00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:45.211
She wasn’t aristocratic enough, and she was seen as an “experienced” woman - fine

00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:51.351
for Charles to continue to see and enjoy spending time with, but not queen material.

00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:58.411
They continued seeing one another until Charles joined the navy and they broke off the relationship.

00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:07.671
Then, shock horror, in July 1973, Camilla married another man, a man named Andrew Parker Bowles.

00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:14.311
Interestingly enough, he had also briefly courted Charles’s sister, Princess Anne.

00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:20.771
If you’re seeing a pattern here, that everyone seems to be in a relationship with everyone,

00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:26.771
yes this is the case with the British aristocracy, and the European aristocracy more generally.

00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:33.041
Despite the fact that she was now married to another man, Charles and Camilla

00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:38.541
remained close friends and Charles even became godfather to one of Camilla’s children.

00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:43.581
When Charles married Diana, Camilla even came to the wedding.

00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:48.801
And although the pair were now both married to different people, they

00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:52.681
continued their friendly relationship, with some people suggesting

00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:56.451
it was much more than a relationship between two old friends.

00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:02.601
Diana certainly wasn’t happy about it, and was even more unhappy when

00:11:02.921 --> 00:11:07.621
according to a royal biographer called Andrew Morton, the young bride was

00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:12.241
opening her wedding presents and she found a necklace intended for Camilla.

00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:18.401
By 1985 rumours were spreading that Charles and Camilla were having an

00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:23.421
affair, but so too were reports that Diana had begun seeing other men.

00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:29.681
In 1989 the British newspaper The Telegraph reported that Diana had

00:11:29.711 --> 00:11:35.301
confronted Camilla at a party, and then a few years later, in 1993, the

00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:39.901
Daily Mirror published a leaked phone recording between Charles and Camilla.

00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:44.621
In the call, the pair talked about their romantic relationship

00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:49.131
and love for one another, confirming the rumours of an affair.

00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:55.281
As you can imagine, much excitement ensued in the media.

00:11:55.831 --> 00:12:00.231
“Charles Rocked by Camilla Tape Shock,” reported one tabloid newspaper.

00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.141
“Charles Sex Talk Taped,” said another.

00:12:05.301 --> 00:12:09.731
With many tabloid newspapers printing detailed ‘manuscripts’ of the call,

00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:14.351
it became such big news that it became known simply as ‘Camillagate.’

00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:19.721
This leak caused a huge scandal for the Royal Family.

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:27.611
By 1992, Charles and Diana had effectively separated and rarely appeared in public together.

00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:33.161
Although there were allegations that Diana had been unfaithful, the public

00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:38.651
was almost unanimously on Diana’s side, painting her as an innocent victim,

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:42.911
a young beautiful girl who didn’t know what she was getting herself into.

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:49.051
She would also break royal protocol, and do something that Royals were not meant to

00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:54.761
do, when she gave honest, candid interviews about her marriage and mental health.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:13:00.301
British Royals, as you may know through the fact that the queen spent

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:04.381
70 years on the throne and practically never revealed anything about

00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:08.281
her own character, they are not meant to talk about their feelings.

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.061
Diana felt differently.

00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:17.281
In 1995 she shocked the nation when she stated in an interview that “there were

00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:22.121
three of us in this marriage”, with the third person obviously meant to be Camilla.

00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:30.441
Not only this, but she also confessed that she had self-harmed and suffered from bulimia, an eating

00:13:30.441 --> 00:13:37.531
disorder, and suggested that Prince Charles, as he was then, might not adapt too well to being King.

00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:42.231
This interview, which was watched by over 20 million

00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:45.431
people, was incredibly controversial at the time.

00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:52.031
Never before had a member of the Royal Family talked so openly about their private

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:57.281
life, and after the interview was broadcast the Queen wrote to both Charles

00:13:57.311 --> 00:14:03.276
and Diana   urging them to divorce and put the whole issue to bed, to end it.

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:09.176
And then, after years of rumour and relentless media scrutiny,

00:14:09.406 --> 00:14:14.286
on the 28th of August 1996, Charles and Diana finally divorced.

00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:20.286
Despite divorcing the future King of England, Diana remained an incredibly popular

00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:26.156
and loved figure in Britain, still seen as a victim, and Charles a villain.

00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:31.736
Then, almost exactly a year after the divorce, on the 31st

00:14:31.736 --> 00:14:37.106
of August 1997, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris.

00:14:37.866 --> 00:14:42.906
Just as the tabloid media had followed Diana’s every move in Britain, that night

00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:48.346
in France her driver was speeding into a tunnel to avoid paparazzi photographers.

00:14:49.486 --> 00:14:54.976
As you can probably imagine, this was, without question, the biggest news in the country.

00:14:56.006 --> 00:15:01.626
A week later, on September 6th, when Diana’s funeral was held in London at Westminster

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:07.466
Abbey, over 30 million people, half the population of the country, tuned in to watch.

00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:12.496
A further 2.5 billion people watched the event around the globe,

00:15:12.666 --> 00:15:15.876
making it one of the biggest television events in history.

00:15:16.826 --> 00:15:22.366
By this time, Charles and Camilla had actually rekindled their old relationship.

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:26.836
Camilla had divorced back in 1995, and it was

00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:30.496
semi-acceptable for the pair to be back together again.

00:15:31.586 --> 00:15:36.756
But clearly, it was too early to introduce her - Charles was still meant to be

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:42.356
in mourning for his ex-wife, even if his true love had always been elsewhere.

00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:49.086
It's said that in the aftermath, the Queen disapproved so much of Charles’ relationship with

00:15:49.086 --> 00:15:54.246
Camilla that she refused to attend his 50th birthday party because Camilla would be there.

00:15:55.386 --> 00:16:00.966
And it wasn’t until 1999 that the two appeared in public together for the first time.

00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:09.546
By 2000, the Queen had accepted Camilla, and a few years later, in 2004, Charles

00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:14.506
and Camilla announced  their engagement, almost 35 years after they had first met.

00:16:16.066 --> 00:16:19.886
The pair married the next year, in April of 2005.

00:16:20.286 --> 00:16:23.856
And though she was eventually accepted into the Royal

00:16:23.856 --> 00:16:28.016
Family, public opinion of Camilla has not really improved.

00:16:28.436 --> 00:16:34.346
There was an extensive public relations campaign launched to improve her image, but it was

00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:39.756
discovered that even seven years later it had not improved by a single percentage point.

00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:47.606
To many in Britain, she would always be, and still is, the woman who stole Charles away from Diana.

00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:53.516
Now, back to the protagonist of this story, who, as you may have

00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:58.166
realised, was in fact often a supporting character in his own story, in

00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:01.846
the shadow of his first wife, and in the bigger shadow of his mother.

00:17:02.686 --> 00:17:07.936
Charles was now happily married, with two adult sons, and a healthy and

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:12.656
energetic mother, meaning he had no immediate prospects of becoming king.

00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:16.716
So, he moved into a new phase of his life.

00:17:17.226 --> 00:17:19.726
One of preparation for what was to come.

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:25.586
In the 2000s Charles began to throw himself into public service.

00:17:26.406 --> 00:17:31.396
In 2008, The Daily Telegraph described him as the "hardest-working

00:17:31.396 --> 00:17:35.346
member of the royal family" and reported that he had carried out

00:17:35.356 --> 00:17:44.316
560 official engagements in 2008, 499 in 2010, and over 600 in 2011.

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:51.696
It’s a common criticism of the Royal family that they don’t have a job, or they don’t “do

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:57.856
anything”, but Charles' busy schedule suggests that he can’t really be accused of this.

00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:04.706
He took a particular interest in environmental affairs, and much of his time was spent representing

00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:09.716
the monarchy abroad, going to funerals and official events in the place of his ageing mother.

00:18:11.252 --> 00:18:16.304
As the 2010s went on, with the Queen celebrating her 90th birthday, there

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:20.954
was more and more speculation as to when exactly the inevitable would happen.

00:18:21.574 --> 00:18:25.824
When would Charles become king, and what type of King would he be.

00:18:26.464 --> 00:18:31.914
Or whether he would be king at all, with some questioning whether he would decide

00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:37.544
to skip being king altogether and pass the crown directly on to his son, William.

00:18:38.744 --> 00:18:42.994
Then, on the 8th of September, 2022, it happened.

00:18:43.714 --> 00:18:46.014
His mother, Queen Elizabeth died.

00:18:46.814 --> 00:18:50.714
After decades of waiting, Charles’ time had finally come.

00:18:51.844 --> 00:18:56.464
He was the longest-serving heir apparent in the history of the British monarchy,

00:18:56.794 --> 00:19:02.244
and at the age of 73, is the oldest person to ascend the British throne.

00:19:03.104 --> 00:19:09.234
He was the next in line for a staggering 70 years, he spent his entire adult life waiting.

00:19:10.295 --> 00:19:13.265
He became the third British king called Charles.

00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:19.235
If you know your British history, you’ll remember that it’s not a particularly lucky name.

00:19:19.855 --> 00:19:22.185
The first King Charles lost his head.

00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:27.585
His son, Charles II, had to fight to win back the throne, avoiding murder

00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:33.365
plots and political chaos and developed a reputation for excess and indulgence.

00:19:34.205 --> 00:19:39.425
So, the question remains, what kind of king will King Charles III be?

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:44.065
Your guess is as good as mine, but one thing is for

00:19:44.065 --> 00:19:47.735
sure, he has certainly had enough time to think about it.

00:19:50.245 --> 00:19:54.605
Ok then, that’s it for today’s episode on Charles III, the

00:19:54.765 --> 00:19:58.055
Prince who spent almost his entire life waiting to become King.

00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:02.815
As a reminder, this episode is going to be followed by another one

00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:06.605
where we’ll go deeper into the psyche and character of this man,

00:20:06.785 --> 00:20:11.245
and ask ourselves the question of Who Is The Real King Charles III?

00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:15.195
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:15.475 --> 00:20:17.565
What do you think of Charles III?

00:20:17.805 --> 00:20:19.935
How do you think he will do as King?

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:23.755
Would you have preferred him to pass the crown directly to his son?

00:20:24.455 --> 00:20:27.715
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

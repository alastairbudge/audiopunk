Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.130
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.590
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.640
I'm Alastair Budge, and today, if you are listening to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.550
this podcast on the day it’s released, is Christmas Day.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.280
So, Happy Christmas, I hope you are having a fantastic day.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.310
Today’s episode has a Christmas theme, and we are going

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.550
to talk about 9 things that happened on Christmas Day.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.380
Now, Christmas Day is normally a day of celebration, of being with friends and family,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.350
so you would be mistaken for thinking that not many notable things happened on this day.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.920
But, there are quite a few interesting historical events that happened on

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.210
this day, and in today's episode you are going to learn about 9 of them.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.940
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can follow along to

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.050
this episode with the subtitles, the transcript and its key vocabulary, so you don’t miss a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.250
word and build up your vocabulary as you go, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.790
If you’re ready to make 2021 the year you really focus on improving your

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.110
English, and you didn’t find a Leonardo English gift card in your stocking

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.370
this morning, then I’d definitely recommend checking out becoming a member.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.560
The place to go for that is leonardoenglish.com

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.440
OK, then Christmas Day, December the 25th, the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.990
As you may well know, there is actually very little

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.960
evidence that Jesus of Nazareth was born on this day.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.960
The Bible doesn’t specify the date that Jesus was born, and it’s now believed that

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.440
the date of December 25th was chosen to coincide with a Roman festival and the Winter

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.490
Solstice, the shortest day of the year, which actually falls on the 21st of December.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.540
So, this tale starts by saying that the most famous event to happen on Christmas

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.260
Day, the birth of Jesus Christ, most likely didn’t even take place on this day.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.880
But there are plenty of other interesting events that did happen on Christmas Day, the first of

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.860
which is the crowning of Charlemagne, and the creation of the position of the Holy Roman Emperor.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.690
Charlemagne, or Charles the First, was the King of the Franks, rulers of most of modern day France.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.860
After a series of successful military campaigns in Western Europe, and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.570
converting everyone he conquered to Christianity, on Christmas Day of the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.270
year 800 he was rewarded by the pope with the position of Holy Roman Emperor.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.310
His appointment by the pope essentially made him a divinely appointed leader,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.570
responsible for the protection of the Royal Catholic Church throughout Europe.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.470
By this time Charlemagne controlled large parts of Western Europe, including much

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.200
of modern day France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.850
He has been called the Father of Europe, and did a huge amount to unite

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.550
a continent that hadn’t been controlled by one power since the Romans.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.550
So, that was on Christmas Day 800, the height of Charlemagne’s power.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.010
Our next event is one that is perhaps less important on a

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.100
European scale, but is certainly very important in Britain.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.870
And that is the coronation of William the Conqueror, the Norman invader who set sail

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.330
from northern France, landed in Britain on the 28th of September 1066, beat King Harold

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.450
at the Battle of Hastings, and on the 25th of December 1066 was crowned King of England.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.890
This was almost 1000 years ago, but William The Conqueror has had a huge impact on

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.230
Britain, doing things like imposing the feudal system, building large castles, reorganising

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.260
the church, and of course changing the language, introducing lots of Norman words with

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.620
Latin origins to English, which was previously a predominantly Anglo-Saxon language.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.230
He was also the first and only Frenchman to successfully conquer

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.110
Britain, although the fact that William The Conqueror was ultimately

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.380
French has been conveniently forgotten in most of British history.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.820
Almost 700 years later, in 1741, our third Christmas Day

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.180
event involves the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.940
If you haven’t heard of the name, you probably can guess what Anders Celcius is

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.290
famous for - the measurement of temperature that most of the world uses, Celsius.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.220
It was on Christmas Day 1741 that he is said to have

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.250
developed his measurement of temperature, Celsius.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.550
Interestingly enough, when he first created it he decided that 0 should be

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.520
the temperature of boiling water, and 100 should be the temperature when

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.690
water freezes, and it wasn’t until after his death that this was switched.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.220
So, that was Christmas Day 1741.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.810
Fast forward to 1868, and it was on Christmas Day that the President of the

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.080
United States, Andrew Johnson issued a final pardon to the Confederate soldiers.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:28.840
Just as a quick reminder, the American Civil War lasted for 4 years, from 1861 to 1865.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.050
The Confederates, who were predominantly Southerners and pro slave ownership,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.480
had broken away from the United States and declared war on the Union.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.920
Americans had suffered 4 years of war, and naturally there was

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.540
still a lot of bad feeling from Unionists towards Confederates.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.540
In the previous few years Johnson had issued pardons to some Confederate soldiers, but there

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.750
were limits, and they had had to do things like swear their allegiance to the United States.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.630
The final pardon, on Christmas Day 1868 pardoned everyone who had fought

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.560
against the United States in the Civil War, and was one of Johnson’s last,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.390
certainly not obvious, and debatably most important acts as president.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:31.500
Christmas Day event number 5 took place in 1914, in the fields of

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.700
Northern France, during the first Christmas of the First World War.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.030
Now, you’ve probably heard tales of this, and it’s often pointed at as an unlikely display

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:52.500
of shared humanity in an otherwise inhumane period, and that is the spontaneous holiday

00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:00.310
ceasefire, a putting down of weapons, and 24 hours of peace between the two fighting sides.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:07.950
The story goes that on the evening of December 24th the Germans had decorated

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:14.950
their trenches with Christmas trees and candles, and began singing Christmas songs.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:22.840
The British responded with their own Christmas songs, and eventually the men from

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.910
the two sides went up over the top, into no man’s land, and greeted each other.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.670
They shared cigarettes, whisky, and shook each other’s hands.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.060
There’s even a report of a game of football.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.770
It’s really pretty mad to think that these two sides had been massacring each other

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.340
with machine guns just hours before, and then the following day, and for another

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.750
almost 4 years they would continue to do so, but it is one example of how, even in

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:02.140
the most tragic of circumstances, people can find a shared sense of brotherhood.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.970
Continuing the theme of a shared humanity, but on a slightly more

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:15.950
positive note, brings us to our 6th Christmas Day event, in 1968, and

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.680
that was the first time humans ever left the Earth’s gravitational pull.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.740
This event is a little bit of a cheat because it actually started on

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.960
Christmas Eve, on December the 24th, but it’s certainly worth mentioning.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:41.480
In 1968, on Christmas Eve, there was a live broadcast from the space shuttle Apollo 8.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:48.100
The astronauts had left Earth’s orbit and were circling around the moon.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:55.230
In this iconic piece of footage viewers could see the Earth emerging from behind the moon.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.560
You have probably seen a picture that the astronauts took

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:04.170
during this broadcast, the photo is nicknamed Earthrise.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.980
As the astronauts filmed this broadcast they read the book of Genesis

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.960
from the Bible, and ended the broadcast with the phrase “Good luck,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.800
Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth”.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:27.500
The astronauts ended up orbiting the moon 10 times on Christmas Eve, then on Christmas

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:34.270
morning they managed to leave the moon’s orbit, returning back to Earth on December the 27th.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:43.360
Man wasn’t to land on the moon until later on, in 1969, but this mission was remarkable

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.850
for the fact that it was the first time that humans had ever left the Earth’s orbit.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:55.060
After that uplifting message, it’s time for another not so

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.870
uplifting one, or perhaps it’s uplifting if you’re Romanian.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.300
And it relates to Nicolae Ceaușescu.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.180
As a bit of background here, Ceaușescu was the last Communist

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.240
leader of Romania, and had been the head of state since 1974.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:23.080
His rule was harsh and totalitarian, he ran up huge foreign debts, and poverty soared in Romania.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.520
By the late 1980s the Romanian people had grown

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.750
tired of him, and there was rioting and civil unrest.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:40.730
On Christmas Day of 1989, just 4 days after his famous last speech in Bucharest’s

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:46.750
Revolution Square, Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena, were executed.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.830
He had tried to run from the capital to escape the protestors, but

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:59.500
was caught, tried in a court, found guilty of crimes such as genocide

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:05.020
and the illegal gathering of wealth, then taken out the back and shot.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:11.220
Indeed, the Ceausescus were actually the last people to be executed in

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.180
Romania, before capital punishment was abolished the following year.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.040
Event number 8, our penultimate Christmas Day event, is certainly

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.490
one that is uplifting, and has been hugely beneficial to mankind.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:34.955
It happened exactly a year after the Ceausescus’ execution, on Christmas Day 1990, and that

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:41.955
was the first live testing of what we now call the World Wide Web, or just the Web for short.

00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:47.075
Now, you might think of the World Wide Web as the same

00:12:47.075 --> 00:12:50.385
as the Internet, but they aren’t exactly the same thing.

00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:58.105
The Internet is the system of computers all over the world that are connected together, and

00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:04.395
the World Wide Web is the system by which you can access files and pages on the internet.

00:13:05.675 --> 00:13:12.225
The World Wide Web runs on the Internet, but the Internet had existed 20 years before it.

00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:20.005
As you may know, the web was developed at CERN to share information between scientists,

00:13:20.365 --> 00:13:27.005
but it was on Christmas Day in 1990 that there was the first functional communication

00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:33.545
between a web browser, the software you use to browse the web, and an internet server.

00:13:34.785 --> 00:13:41.129
This may not have seemed like such a huge deal at the time, but it has probably had the largest

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:47.489
impact on mine and your day-to-day lives of any of the other events we've talked about today.

00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:50.974
Without it, you wouldn’t be listening to me now.

00:13:51.984 --> 00:13:55.264
So, thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, its inventor.

00:13:55.564 --> 00:13:58.494
That really was a great Christmas present to us all.

00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:05.754
And our final Christmas event again goes back to the theme of the collapse of the Soviet Union.

00:14:06.674 --> 00:14:12.964
Two years after Ceausescu was thrown out of power and executed, on Christmas Day

00:14:13.034 --> 00:14:20.124
1991 Mikhael Gorbachev met a similar fate, albeit significantly less dramatic.

00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:21.864
He only resigned.

00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:28.644
Again, just to recap, Gorbachev was the eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union.

00:14:29.274 --> 00:14:34.754
He was elected leader in 1985, and was hugely influential in

00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:39.164
reforming the country, but ultimately he wasn’t able to save it.

00:14:40.024 --> 00:14:46.234
By 1991, the writing was on the wall for Gorbachev and the country he was ruler of.

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:50.614
There were growing pro-independence movements throughout the Soviet

00:14:50.614 --> 00:14:54.974
Union, and even a growing independence movement within Russia.

00:14:55.934 --> 00:15:01.174
And just to clarify, Russia, or the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist

00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:06.324
Republic was the largest of the administrative units of the Soviet Union.

00:15:07.384 --> 00:15:11.684
Boris Yeltsin, who had been elected president of Russia earlier on

00:15:11.684 --> 00:15:17.504
that year, had declared that Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were forming

00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:23.184
a new commonwealth, and he was then joined by 8 other Soviet republics.

00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:29.024
There was simply no way that the Soviet Union could continue to exist,

00:15:29.504 --> 00:15:33.984
and Gorbachev realised that he had run out of options to stay in power.

00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:40.474
In a televised address Gorbachev resigned his position as President of the

00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:45.834
Soviet Union, the Soviet Union flag was lowered above the Kremlin for the last

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:51.994
time and replaced by the Russian one, and with that the Soviet Union was over.

00:15:53.024 --> 00:15:55.654
So that was Christmas Day 1991.

00:15:56.834 --> 00:16:03.414
So, we have whizzed through those 9 Christmas Day events, each of which could probably have their

00:16:03.474 --> 00:16:10.074
own episode, but I hope it has at least given you a taste of a few things that happened on this day.

00:16:11.424 --> 00:16:15.124
At least now if someone says to you ‘nothing important ever

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:20.094
happens on Christmas Day’, you can respond with, ‘well actually….’

00:16:22.434 --> 00:16:25.564
OK then, that is it for today’s episode.

00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:30.014
It’s a little shorter than usual, but you probably have many other

00:16:30.014 --> 00:16:33.374
things to be doing on Christmas day than listening to this podcast.

00:16:34.154 --> 00:16:39.104
So, if you are listening to this on Christmas Day, Merry Christmas, I hope you have a good one.

00:16:39.994 --> 00:16:45.764
And if you're listening to this after Christmas, then I hope you too had a fantastic day.

00:16:46.704 --> 00:16:53.524
I’d also just very briefly like to thank my wife, who reviewed this episode and told me to

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:59.904
remove an anecdote about William the Conqueror’s stomach exploding, so you will have to wait

00:16:59.914 --> 00:17:04.824
for a dedicated episode on William the Conqueror to hear all about that disgusting story.

00:17:05.994 --> 00:17:11.464
And as a final reminder, if you are looking to improve your English in a more interesting way,

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:17.373
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:21.613
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:25.953
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:29.853
about the discovery of the Egyptian pharaoh, Tutankhamun.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:36.463
It’s not only probably the most famous archaeological discovery of all time, but it

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:43.423
is also a fabulous story, with adventure, geo-political conflict, curses, and more.

00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:50.753
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into the story of the Discovery of Tutankhamun.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:01:01.089
In June of 1922, a wealthy English aristocrat was sitting at home, mulling over a problem.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:07.389
For the past 15 years, he had been financing the excavation

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:11.249
of various sites in the Valley of The Kings, in Egypt.

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:20.211
It had cost him dearly - he had ploughed the modern equivalent of over €25 million

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:27.529
into the project - but so far, it had not resulted in any major discoveries.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.629
He decided to cut his losses, and sent a telegram summoning his

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:40.159
chief archaeologist, a man named Howard Carter, to return to England.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:46.059
Carter returned, and made the trip to the aristocrat’s country

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:50.839
residence, a 300-room mansion to the south west of England.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.179
If you have watched the TV series “Downton Abbey”, yes the house in that

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.469
show was the house owned by the aristocrat in question, George Edward

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.959
Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, better known as the 5th Earl of Carnarvon.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.340
The Earl had bad news for Carter.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.340
He was pulling the plug, he was not willing to spend any more money.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.900
The project was over.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.380
Carter protested, “My Lord, just one more season, I promise”.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.230
He even offered to pay for it himself.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.230
He must have had a way with words, as he managed to get his wealthy benefactor to change his mind.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.830
Reluctantly, Lord Carnarvon agreed.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.880
“OK, but only one season, no more”.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.680
Carter returned to Egypt, arriving at the Valley of The Kings in late October.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.080
He got to work straight away.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.280
On November the 5th, a servant rushed into Lord Carnavan’s study back in England.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.470
“My Lord, a telegram from Carter."

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.480
As Carnavan opened the message, he saw the words he had been waiting 15 years for: “At last have

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.650
made wonderful discovery in valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact ... congratulations.”

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.740
There was no time to waste.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.930
Lord Carnavan immediately set off, arriving on November the 23rd.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.310
By the time Carnavan arrived at the site, Carter and his team had found a doorway with seals and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.184
signs above it, seals that bore the name of a pharaoh whose tomb had never been found: Tutankhamun.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.690
A few days later, having opened the door and cleared their way through the rubble,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.230
Howard Carter stood with his wealthy benefactor beside him, ready to open the tomb.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.562
He made a small hole, held out his candle, and peered through.

00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:14.292
Howard Carter’s diary recalls the entire incident,

00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:17.502
and I’m just going to read you a piece from it now:

00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:24.462
“It was sometime before one could see, the hot air escaping caused the candle

00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:30.432
to flicker, but as soon as one's eyes became accustomed to the glimmer of light

00:04:31.112 --> 00:04:36.542
the interior of the chamber gradually loomed before one, with its strange and

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:43.084
wonderful medley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one another.

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:47.178
There was naturally short suspense for those present who could

00:04:47.258 --> 00:04:52.068
not see, when Lord Carnarvon said to me: `Can you see anything?'.

00:04:52.888 --> 00:04:56.618
I replied to him: Yes, it is wonderful.”

00:04:58.028 --> 00:05:04.288
This is probably the most famous exchange in the history of archaeology, and it would

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:10.638
result in the most famous archaeological discovery in Egypt and debatably the whole world.

00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:14.438
The discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:20.698
But before we get into what happened next, and what these wonderful things Carter

00:05:20.698 --> 00:05:26.898
saw actually were, let me go back a few years to set the scene a little more clearly.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:33.038
In fact, first we need to go back more than a few years, we need to go

00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:39.678
back almost 5,000 years to ancient Egypt and the time of the pharaohs.

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:46.398
The Ancient Egyptians, as you may know, were great believers in the afterlife.

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:55.658
They believed that after death a person moved to the afterlife, a life that was quite similar to

00:05:55.678 --> 00:06:04.068
real life, so you needed a lot of the same worldly things: chariots, gold, that kind of stuff.

00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:11.388
The rulers of Ancient Egypt, the pharaohs, were buried in great tombs under the ground.

00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:18.718
The size of the tomb typically depended on how long the pharaoh had lived for.

00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:24.961
In a tradition that might sound a little creepy and unsettling to us, but

00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:30.581
apparently wasn’t for an Egyptian pharaoh, as soon as you became a pharaoh,

00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:36.741
work started on your burial chamber and continued for as long as you lived.

00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:42.111
Clearly, if you lived a long life, your burial chamber could be

00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:46.481
vast, filled with all manner of precious goods and treasures.

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:50.751
If your life was cut short, well, your tomb would be

00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:54.043
smaller as there wouldn’t have been much time to finish it.

00:06:55.401 --> 00:07:02.411
These tombs were first built under the pyramids, but later on, in an effort to conceal

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:09.181
their locations, they shifted to an area of Egypt called The Valley of the Kings, a rocky

00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:15.491
valley to the other side of the Nile from Luxor, about 500 kilometres south of Cairo.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.911
Because of all of the treasures that were typically

00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.311
kept inside the tombs, they had to be well hidden.

00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:29.851
They weren’t marked, and were normally dug into cliffs and concealed

00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:33.991
behind different tunnels, false doors, and that kind of stuff.

00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:40.581
Over time, many of these tombs were found and emptied

00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:44.041
completely; all that remained was an empty tomb.

00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.781
There was nothing more to take.

00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:54.021
Fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries, and there was an increasing interest in Ancient

00:07:54.041 --> 00:08:01.701
Egypt, especially among Europeans, and even more specifically, among the French and the British.

00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:08.845
You may remember the story of the discovery of the Rosetta Stone from episode 141.

00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:14.831
Discoveries like this, and an increasing understanding of Egypt’s

00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:19.711
rich cultural history, ignited fresh interest in the country.

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:26.401
And it is here that I must properly introduce you to the protagonist of our story,

00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:32.441
or at least one of the protagonists, a young Englishman called Howard Carter.

00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:38.081
Carter came from a wealthy family by most people's standards.

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:46.621
He was born in 1874, in Kensington, in London, and his father was a well-known artist.

00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:54.871
He didn’t spend much time at school, but showed some of the same artistic talents as his father.

00:08:56.031 --> 00:09:01.341
However, it wasn’t art that he would be famous for; after going to a

00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:06.691
family friend’s house and seeing some ancient Egyptian relics, he developed

00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:12.891
an intense interest and curiosity for all things Ancient Egyptian.

00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:19.921
He set off for Egypt at the first opportunity, when he was just 17 years old.

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:27.101
He had no formal training in archaeology but he learned on the job, and soon

00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:32.341
developed a name for himself as a thoughtful and meticulous archaeologist.

00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:37.951
There wasn't much money to be made in archaeology, and Carter

00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:42.501
kept afloat by selling his paintings to wealthy European tourists.

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:49.438
Sometime in 1907, he was to meet a wealthy tourist who would change

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:55.038
his life, and allow him to focus full time on his true passion.

00:09:56.688 --> 00:10:02.558
That wealthy tourist was Lord Carnavan, the aristocrat we met at the start of the episode.

00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:08.308
Now, Carnavan was more than just an aristocrat with a cheque book.

00:10:09.088 --> 00:10:12.638
He too was passionate about Ancient Egypt.

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:20.288
The pair struck up a friendship, united in particular in their interest in finding

00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:27.835
the final resting place of a relatively unknown and minor Egyptian king: Tutankhamun.

00:10:29.318 --> 00:10:32.588
Now, how did they know that Tutankhamun existed?

00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:37.628
Well, he was written about, and there was some evidence

00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:41.548
that his tomb might be somewhere in the Valley of The Kings.

00:10:42.418 --> 00:10:50.118
But all efforts to locate his resting place had, up to then, proved fruitless.

00:10:51.658 --> 00:10:55.718
Carnavan was impressed with Carter, and he agreed to

00:10:55.768 --> 00:10:58.778
finance the continued search for the tomb of the pharaoh.

00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:03.988
Now, he wasn't doing this only out of the goodness of his own heart.

00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:10.078
The people financing these archaeological digs usually did so because they

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:13.928
would take part of the treasures back home to their personal collection.

00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:22.318
Anyway, Carter hired a team and started digging, while Lord Carnavan paid the bills.

00:11:23.858 --> 00:11:26.538
This all started in 1907.

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:31.838
It had to stop for a few years during World War I, when Carter was

00:11:31.838 --> 00:11:35.538
called up to work as a courier and translator for the British army.

00:11:37.078 --> 00:11:44.418
Normality returned in 1917, and Carter was able to return to work, relentlessly

00:11:44.598 --> 00:11:49.878
scouring every last inch of the valley for the tomb of King Tutankhamun.

00:11:51.558 --> 00:12:01.488
5 years went by, yet Tutankhamun was proving as elusive as ever; there simply was no sign of him.

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:05.798
And this brings us to where we left our story.

00:12:06.948 --> 00:12:13.868
An Egyptian worker had reportedly discovered some stairs that looked like they led down to a tomb.

00:12:15.138 --> 00:12:22.158
Some reports say the worker had put down a jug of water, while others recall that he was digging.

00:12:23.498 --> 00:12:30.678
Whatever happened, stairs have been located, with signs above them bearing Tutankhamun's name.

00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:36.348
A telegram has been sent to Lord Carnavan, who immediately

00:12:36.478 --> 00:12:40.428
dropped everything and set off for the Valley of the Kings.

00:12:41.698 --> 00:12:46.178
And Carter has just made a small hole and peered

00:12:46.258 --> 00:12:51.458
through, describing what he saw as "wonderful things".

00:12:52.818 --> 00:12:57.538
Wonderful things is perhaps even an understatement for what he found.

00:12:58.848 --> 00:13:05.068
When he entered the tomb, he found three rooms in total: the first room would

00:13:05.068 --> 00:13:10.898
come to be known as the antechamber, and contained objects such as a bed

00:13:10.908 --> 00:13:16.268
and a chariot, objects that King Tutankahmun would need in the afterlife.

00:13:17.748 --> 00:13:23.278
The second contained the sarcophagus itself, a majestic tomb of

00:13:23.378 --> 00:13:29.208
25 kilograms of solid gold that held the king’s mummified body.

00:13:30.698 --> 00:13:38.908
And the third room is known as the treasury, and contained more objects as well as chests containing

00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:46.118
Tutankahmun’s organs, and two foetuses, which are believed to be the pharaoh’s stillborn children.

00:13:47.508 --> 00:13:54.058
Now, this description really hasn’t done justice to the wonders that were found in the tomb, and

00:13:54.248 --> 00:13:59.758
it would take us hours to go through all of the different beautiful objects and their significance,

00:14:00.228 --> 00:14:06.598
and really, you need to see them and see a picture of them to appreciate the true wonder.

00:14:07.568 --> 00:14:15.108
So, we are actually going to skip over most of the detail about what was found inside the tomb, and

00:14:15.378 --> 00:14:23.818
talk about three other curiosities about its discovery: the curse of Tutankhamun, the impact of the

00:14:23.818 --> 00:14:31.648
discovery on Egyptian identity, but first I want to talk about the Tutankhamun, the man himself.

00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:37.168
Or in fact, it might be more appropriate to call him a boy than a

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:41.758
man, as it’s believed that he died when he was around 19 years old.

00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:48.268
If you remember what I said about preparations starting for a burial tomb as

00:14:48.268 --> 00:14:53.628
soon as you become a pharaoh, well, one of the reasons that King Tutankhamun’s

00:14:53.648 --> 00:15:00.398
tomb is comparatively small and was hard to find is that he died so young;

00:15:01.008 --> 00:15:05.468
there simply wasn’t enough time to prepare a large and intricate tomb.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:11.803
We know that he died young, firstly because his body was literally still in the

00:15:11.803 --> 00:15:18.063
tomb, in mummified form, and archaeologists could see from his relatively small

00:15:18.073 --> 00:15:23.393
size and underdeveloped bones and teeth that he was a young man when he died.

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:29.913
What’s more, there were other clues in the tomb, such as board games,

00:15:30.093 --> 00:15:34.133
which a youthful ruler might have enjoyed playing in the afterlife.

00:15:35.713 --> 00:15:40.253
As to how and why he died so young, well, this is

00:15:40.293 --> 00:15:43.993
something that archaeologists are not so united about.

00:15:45.553 --> 00:15:51.863
One theory is that he died from malaria, another that he was run over by a chariot,

00:15:52.503 --> 00:15:57.953
and a later theory even put it that he was murdered with a blow to the head.

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:03.973
We will, in all likelihood, never know for sure, despite the number

00:16:03.983 --> 00:16:07.793
of clues that were found in the tomb, and the fact that his body was

00:16:07.813 --> 00:16:12.753
preserved exceptionally well for someone who died 3,500 years ago.

00:16:14.293 --> 00:16:18.663
Now, moving on, you might have heard something about the curse of

00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:23.843
Tutankhamun, rumours that there was some kind of magic spell that would be

00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:28.828
placed on anyone who disturbed the burial place of the Egyptian pharaohs.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.346
I should start by saying that there was no “official” curse, there was no

00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:40.466
sign or writing found anywhere near the tomb that said anything like that.

00:16:41.436 --> 00:16:47.266
But, as more and more Egyptian tombs were opened in the 19th century, and

00:16:47.492 --> 00:16:52.749
mummified bodies found inside, there was an increasing number of accounts of

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:58.549
unnatural and spooky events happening to those who had disturbed the tombs.

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:04.809
This clearly made for excellent newspaper stories, and there was a growing

00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:08.999
belief in something that came to be called “The Curse of The Pharaohs”.

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:13.419
So, how does Tutankahmun tie into this?

00:17:14.129 --> 00:17:16.009
Well, in a few ways.

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:20.729
Firstly, there was one account of a messenger being

00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:24.479
sent to Carter’s house after the discovery of the tomb.

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:33.309
When the messenger arrived, he found that a cobra, the snake that’s the symbol of the Egyptian

00:17:33.309 --> 00:17:40.609
monarchy, had killed Carter’s pet canary, his pet bird, and was holding it in his mouth.

00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:45.129
Was this the Egyptian king breaking into Carter’s

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:48.409
house, in retaliation for Carter breaking into his?

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:52.159
It was strange, to say the least.

00:17:53.689 --> 00:18:00.379
And secondly, and much more gravely, only a couple of months after opening the tomb,

00:18:00.869 --> 00:18:07.309
Lord Carnavan, the man who had financed it all, was bitten on his cheek by a mosquito.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:09.489
Nothing unusual there.

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:17.269
But later on, when he was shaving, he cut the mosquito bite, the cut got infected,

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:25.132
he got blood poisoning which developed into pneumonia, killing him at the age of 56.

00:18:26.577 --> 00:18:32.127
As this happened, there was a media frenzy, with reports of this curse

00:18:32.127 --> 00:18:37.197
being put on those who had broken into Tutankhamun’s tomb, and it only

00:18:37.207 --> 00:18:41.527
being a matter of time before fate caught up with the rest of them.

00:18:43.077 --> 00:18:47.407
The author of the Sherlock Holmes novels, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,

00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:52.797
joined in the frenzy and proclaimed that it was an evil spirit that

00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:57.897
killed Lord Carnavan, and would in all likelihood kill the rest of them.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:03.227
But, sorry to disappoint you, this simply didn’t happen.

00:19:04.407 --> 00:19:12.047
Of the 58 people who were there when the tomb was opened, only 8 of them died within 12 years of the

00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:18.537
tomb being opened, which, let’s remember we are still in the 1920s here, it's not such bad going.

00:19:19.997 --> 00:19:25.347
Now, the final point I want to touch on today is the political implications of the

00:19:25.347 --> 00:19:31.307
discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb and its effect on the Egyptian sense of identity.

00:19:32.727 --> 00:19:36.167
As you’ll have gathered by now, the discovery of the

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:40.737
tomb was a British-led and British-financed discovery.

00:19:41.707 --> 00:19:46.285
This is not to discount the many Egyptians who worked on the excavations,

00:19:46.649 --> 00:19:52.127
but the point is that it was led by Howard Carter, an Englishman, and

00:19:52.297 --> 00:19:56.737
the entire project financed by the Earl of Carnarvan, another Englishman.

00:19:57.757 --> 00:20:02.857
The entire process of the discovery was also not reported live in

00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:08.027
the Egyptian newspapers, but in a British newspaper, The Times.

00:20:09.517 --> 00:20:16.477
Lord Carnavan had sold the rights to the story to The Times, so Egyptians keen to find

00:20:16.477 --> 00:20:22.007
out what was going on in the Valley of The Kings had to wait for a copy of The Times to

00:20:22.007 --> 00:20:27.647
arrive from London before they got up to speed on what was happening in their own country.

00:20:29.036 --> 00:20:33.468
This was somewhat of a kick in the teeth for the Egyptians.

00:20:34.452 --> 00:20:41.702
Egypt had been under British rule from 1882, but, crucially, had achieved independence

00:20:41.912 --> 00:20:48.275
in February of 1922, 9 months before the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:20:49.422 --> 00:20:55.842
And there they were, the newly independent Egyptians getting their news about their most

00:20:55.912 --> 00:21:03.222
long-sought king, news about the glory of their past, from a foreign newspaper, and what’s

00:21:03.222 --> 00:21:09.722
more, a newspaper from a country that had occupied and ruled the country for the past 40 years.

00:21:11.322 --> 00:21:17.232
All this being said, the discovery of Tutankhamun was a huge boost to Egypt.

00:21:18.672 --> 00:21:24.742
Firstly, it was a sign to the world of the rich cultural heritage and history of the country.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:32.382
Secondly, it helped unite the different religions and ethnicities of Egypt behind this idea

00:21:32.562 --> 00:21:38.372
of all Egyptians being descendants of this incredibly sophisticated and advanced civilisation

00:21:38.662 --> 00:21:44.662
of ancient Egypt, a people that was destined not to be ruled by any external forces.

00:21:46.126 --> 00:21:51.456
Whether you were a Muslim, a Christian or a Jew, you could unite behind

00:21:51.456 --> 00:21:56.366
your Egyptian identity rather than whatever other group you identified with.

00:21:57.837 --> 00:22:02.077
And, importantly, unlike many other archeological discoveries,

00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:06.717
all of the objects that were found in the tomb remained in Egypt.

00:22:08.177 --> 00:22:13.687
There were some suggestions of small, tiny, objects being removed by some

00:22:13.687 --> 00:22:18.757
members of the British excavation team, but everything significant was

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:23.887
clearly numbered and documented, and is now property of the Egyptian state.

00:22:25.267 --> 00:22:31.857
And ever since, Egypt has used the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun rather cleverly.

00:22:32.797 --> 00:22:37.817
It was opened up to the public in 1924, and you can still visit it today.

00:22:39.243 --> 00:22:44.826
In the 1970s, Egypt sent a collection of 50 objects from Tutankhamun’s

00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:50.276
tomb, including the famous gold mask, on a tour of Europe and North America.

00:22:51.406 --> 00:22:57.326
This did wonders for Egyptian soft power, and encouraged a new generation

00:22:57.326 --> 00:23:01.916
of tourists to come and visit the wonders of Egypt for themselves.

00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:09.176
So, to conclude, Tutankhamun “the pharaoh” was a relatively minor king,

00:23:09.756 --> 00:23:14.436
he was a boy when he became king, and still only a boy when he died.

00:23:15.816 --> 00:23:21.696
This minor status was a major reason it took so long to find his final resting place.

00:23:22.299 --> 00:23:30.399
and when the tomb was finally discovered in 1922, modern Egypt was a shadow of its former glory.

00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:38.319
So perhaps it is ironic that it would be Tutankhamun, the boy king, who would do more

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:45.279
than any other pharaoh to showcase to the world, the glory and splendour of ancient Egypt.

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:53.575
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:59.455
If I were you, I would definitely spend some time looking up some of the things that we talked about

00:23:59.455 --> 00:24:05.905
in this episode, from the gold mask to the size of the tomb itself, it really is quite amazing.

00:24:06.685 --> 00:24:09.945
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:13.255
Do you have a particular interest in Ancient Egypt?

00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:15.015
Have you ever been to Egypt?

00:24:15.415 --> 00:24:20.145
Have you visited the Valley Of The Kings, or even been to King Tutankhamun’s tomb?

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:25.665

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.851
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:20.041
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:26.891
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part series on crime and punishment.

00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:32.541
In case you missed it, in part one we talked about the history of crime and punishment

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:37.931
in Britain, and learned about the various ways through British history that Britain

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:42.591
dealt with criminals, or people who were suspected to have committed crimes.

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:47.611
In part three we are going to talk about the evolving role of prisons, and

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:52.111
in today’s episode, part two, we’ll talk about the grisly but important

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:56.291
subject of capital punishment, otherwise known as the death penalty.

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:01.311
As a little warning before we start, this episode is about the death penalty,

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:06.141
it will contain some descriptions of capital punishment, although we will try

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:10.481
to keep it as family-friendly as a discussion about the death penalty can be.

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:17.031
So, with that disclaimer out of the way, let’s get started and talk about capital punishment.

00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.021
The word “capital” is a strange one in English.

00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:27.721
It can mean the main city in a country, the place

00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:30.491
that is the administrative and governmental centre.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:35.841
It can mean money or assets owned by an individual or a company.

00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:41.601
It can mean a large letter, the kind of letter you start a sentence with or

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:46.651
use at the start of someone’s name or the name of a town, city or country.

00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:53.691
In old fashioned English, when used as an adjective it even meant “very good”,

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:59.471
so you might say “that’s a capital idea”, meaning “that’s a very good idea”.

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:06.751
But put “capital” in front of punishment and it certainly does not mean “excellent”,

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:10.791
at least from the point of view of the person on the receiving end of it.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:17.921
In this sense, capital means the most extreme, the highest level of punishment.

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:26.111
Capital punishment means the death penalty, the state-sanctioned killing of a person for a crime.

00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:32.501
The classical scholars among you might know why this kind of punishment is called

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:39.911
“capital”; it is because it comes from the Latin word for head, caput, and many capital

00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:44.701
punishments involve doing something to someone’s head, typically chopping it off.

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:54.131
Now, the grim reality of capital punishment is that if you were to draw a large line starting at the

00:02:54.131 --> 00:03:01.078
beginning of human history and going all the way up to the modern day, only a tiny slither at the

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:07.448
very end would be “the bit without capital punishment”, or at least without much capital punishment.

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:13.572
If you remember from the last episode, 18th century Britain went through

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:18.182
a period where there was something called The Bloody Code, which listed

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:23.402
200 different crimes for which execution was a recommended punishment.

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:30.092
But of course, capital punishment is far from unique to Britain.

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:35.302
For as long as humans have documented history, there are

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:39.222
records of societies killing their citizens as punishment.

00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:48.164
To be precise, the 1700 BC Code of Hammurabi, which was written almost 4,000 years

00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:54.694
ago in Babylon, lays out 25 different crimes for which people could be put to death.

00:03:56.004 --> 00:04:01.824
Some, you might think “ok, fair enough, that really is a bad crime”, for example

00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:07.184
stealing the son of another citizen or sneaking into a house and committing rape.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.664
Others you might think are a little harsh.

00:04:11.594 --> 00:04:17.794
For example, the code specified that, and I’m quoting directly, “if a builder builds a

00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:23.574
house and a wall falls down and kills the person inside, the builder shall be put to death”.

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:30.704
Or “if a meeting of criminals takes place in a tavern and the tavern owner doesn’t

00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:35.589
immediately report it to the authorities, the tavern owner shall be put to death”.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.670
I can’t imagine that this would have encouraged many people to become builders

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.780
or tavern owners, if one honest mistake at work could cost them their life.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.170
Now, while The Code of Hammurabi might be the first recorded instance of a legal code

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.070
setting out capital punishment, there is evidence that it was used all over the world, it

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.710
is not as if the idea came from the Middle East and people elsewhere hadn’t thought of it.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.342
After all, for all its criticisms, one can see why it was considered an effective legal tool.

00:05:12.392 --> 00:05:16.742
It permanently removed people who committed undesirable acts from society,

00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:22.253
theoretically meaning that there would be fewer people in that society to commit crimes.

00:05:23.277 --> 00:05:27.767
Not only that, but it would act as a deterrent, a reason to

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.957
encourage people not to commit crimes in the first place.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.670
We’ll come to whether that’s true in a bit, but that was the theory at least.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.280
And with time, as the method of execution became more and more creative and executions

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.860
were carried out increasingly publicly, deterrent was an ever important reason.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.400
Nobody wanted to die if they could avoid it, but the prospect of being killed in some gruesome and

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.437
extremely painful way was an extra reason not to commit a crime and potentially face the same fate.

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:11.848
So, most societies justified capital punishment through a mixture of removing criminals

00:06:11.848 --> 00:06:16.598
from society and deterring people from committing criminal acts in the future.

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:21.788
And there was the extra element of when capital punishment was

00:06:21.788 --> 00:06:26.788
considered divine punishment, it was the will of God for someone to die.

00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:32.838
From Ancient Israel right through to Medieval Europe, and still in some countries today,

00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:39.858
people were and still are sentenced to death for crimes deemed contrary to the will of God.

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:46.858
In countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan this is still the case for blasphemy, and

00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:52.508
going back to Medieval England, for example, hundreds of women found themselves sentenced

00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:58.628
to death for crimes associated with witchcraft, which was seen as a religious crime.

00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:05.968
Clearly this was bad news if you were one of the poor women who found herself accused of being a

00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:14.298
witch and ended up burned at the stake, but there is an argument that this kind of brutality was a

00:07:14.298 --> 00:07:21.688
necessary step towards a realisation, in Europe at least, of the problems with capital punishment.

00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:29.592
Burning someone at the stake or drowning them in a pond is a horrific thing to do, especially

00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:34.492
if you later realise that they were completely innocent of the crime that they were accused of.

00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:40.792
And moving into the 17th and then 18th centuries, Enlightenment thinkers

00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:46.112
started to question capital punishment from a moral and practical perspective.

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:52.414
In much of Europe at least, this hadn’t really been a major concern for people.

00:07:52.874 --> 00:07:58.414
The death penalty was part and parcel of life, it was how societies had always

00:07:58.424 --> 00:08:04.194
dealt with criminals, and its use or effectiveness had rarely been questioned.

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:08.314
However, as we touched on in the last episode,

00:08:08.684 --> 00:08:11.824
Enlightenment thinkers started to ask these questions.

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:16.494
Could it ever be morally justified to end someone’s life?

00:08:17.334 --> 00:08:20.914
Was capital punishment really an effective deterrent?

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:25.514
In other words, did it do what it was meant to do?

00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:33.424
As you might remember from the last episode, a lot of this can be traced back to the great Italian

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:39.404
Enlightenment philosopher, Cesare Beccaria, and his seminal work, On Crimes and Punishments.

00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:46.214
Given that capital punishment was so prevalent in Europe at the time, and that it was such a

00:08:46.404 --> 00:08:53.464
final, non-reversible, sentence, Beccaria dedicated a sizable portion of the book to the subject.

00:08:54.404 --> 00:08:59.184
And he was against it, both on moral and practical grounds.

00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:04.594
He argued that there was no crime great enough to warrant capital punishment,.

00:09:05.514 --> 00:09:11.734
It was morally unacceptable because there was no legitimate social contract under which the state

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:17.854
could decide to end someone’s life, so the state deciding to execute someone constituted murder.

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:24.054
It was also practically a bad idea, because, it was not an effective

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:28.493
deterrent, it didn’t actually stop people from committing crimes, no

00:09:28.503 --> 00:09:33.063
matter how public and no matter how awful the method of execution.

00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:39.603
According to Beccaria, the greatest deterrent is the certainty of punishment,

00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:44.243
the knowledge that if you commit a crime, you will be caught and punished.

00:09:45.473 --> 00:09:49.183
Because the death penalty was the stated punishment for so many

00:09:49.183 --> 00:09:53.513
different crimes–often crimes that we would now consider minor

00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:59.353
crimes–sentences were often passed in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner.

00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:05.165
One judge might decide that someone should be executed for theft of a

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:10.165
horse, but another more lenient one, or one who was feeling particularly

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:14.435
generous that morning, might decide that a small fine would be sufficient.

00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:19.746
Same crime, but an inconsistent application of the law.

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:26.991
Beccaria argued that what needed to happen was for the law to be applied uniformly.

00:10:27.973 --> 00:10:31.809
It was this certainty of punishment that would be a better deterrent than

00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:36.389
thinking, “well, I might be hanged but I could well escape with a small fine”.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:42.889
What’s more, and we’ll touch on this in greater detail in the next episode, Beccaria

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:48.879
argued that a far greater deterrent than the death penalty was life imprisonment.

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:56.749
Life imprisonment was, by definition, a longer punishment than a swift execution.

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:04.139
Instead of being killed in front of a bloodthirsty crowd, and perhaps even being glorified in

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:11.389
the process, the criminal would be forced to live out the rest of their days in prison, and it

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:18.059
was this, not the threat of execution, that would be a bigger deterrent to would-be criminals.

00:11:19.534 --> 00:11:24.097
And lest I forget, another very important but obvious argument that

00:11:24.097 --> 00:11:29.427
Beccaria made against capital punishment was its irreversible nature.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:37.027
If someone was wrongly convicted, if evidence later came to light that they were innocent of the

00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:45.037
crime, capital punishment was irreversible, it could not be undone, someone cannot be un-executed.

00:11:46.017 --> 00:11:51.277
Now, Beccaria’s On Crimes and Punishments was published in 1764.

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:56.247
Although you might have been listening to his arguments and nodding along, thinking

00:11:56.767 --> 00:12:02.137
“that all sounds perfectly reasonable to me”, these ideas were revolutionary at the time.

00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:03.857
Why?

00:12:04.427 --> 00:12:07.587
Well, the prevailing view, at least in most of

00:12:07.587 --> 00:12:11.307
Europe, was almost diametrically opposite to Beccaria.

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:17.377
People believed that the state did have the moral right to execute people.

00:12:17.907 --> 00:12:22.257
People believed that capital punishment was an effective deterrent.

00:12:22.787 --> 00:12:27.087
People believed that criminals had forfeited their human rights.

00:12:27.937 --> 00:12:33.327
And the justice system was more about retribution–revenge–and

00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:36.657
absolute state control than reliable justice.

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:42.477
It didn’t matter, therefore, if the occasional innocent person was executed; the

00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:47.527
death penalty was all about cleansing society and deterring future criminals.

00:12:48.997 --> 00:12:54.590
Moving towards the modern day, clearly there still is this division between countries and

00:12:54.590 --> 00:13:00.210
societies that have come to the conclusion that capital punishment is barbaric and unacceptable,

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:06.070
and countries in which it is still considered to be an important part of the justice system.

00:13:07.356 --> 00:13:13.946
As of 2024, there are 112 countries that have abolished capital punishment altogether.

00:13:15.216 --> 00:13:20.216
7 more have removed the death penalty from regular law, but still have

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:24.986
a provision for it under special circumstances, for example during war.

00:13:25.755 --> 00:13:30.666
22 countries haven’t abolished it officially, but haven’t used it for at

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:35.656
least 10 years, so are believed to have internal guidance not to use it.

00:13:36.646 --> 00:13:44.006
So, that’s 141 countries, 72% of all nation states, most countries in the world.

00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:48.936
But when it comes to the number of people who live in

00:13:48.936 --> 00:13:52.086
countries with capital punishment, it is a different story.

00:13:53.286 --> 00:13:56.586
Over half of the world’s population lives in countries

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.166
where capital punishment is still legal and used.

00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:08.031
This is because, of the world’s 10 most populous countries, 9 still have capital punishment.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:14.891
The only one that doesn’t is Brazil, which practically abolished it in 1876.

00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:20.431
So, more than half of the world’s population live in a country in which

00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:24.831
they could theoretically be executed if they commit a serious enough crime.

00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:31.741
And, of course, what is considered a capital crime varies drastically by country,

00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:37.111
and some capital crimes are celebrated behaviours elsewhere in the world.

00:14:37.891 --> 00:14:43.501
Taking drugs, being gay or deciding to follow a different religion might be perfectly

00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:49.461
legal and even celebrated behaviours in many countries, but do exactly the same thing

00:14:49.851 --> 00:14:55.821
in somewhere like Saudi Arabia or Pakistan and you might find yourself beheaded or hung.

00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:01.771
Of course, there is also a religious element to this; most of the Islamic

00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:06.001
countries where capital punishment is still legal allow it on religious grounds,

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:11.221
whereas the majority of non-Islamic countries have a secular legal system.

00:15:12.031 --> 00:15:17.211
In other words, there is a clear division between the justice system and religious doctrine.

00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:24.181
Now, what is really interesting to talk about is public opinion towards capital punishment.

00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:32.641
In the UK, where capital punishment was abolished in 1965, public opinion is split.

00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:38.211
Surveys tend to show that more Brits oppose the death

00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:42.111
penalty than support it, but the margin is slim.

00:15:43.271 --> 00:15:50.031
The last survey from the market research company YouGov suggested that around 50% of the British

00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:58.461
population oppose the death penalty while 40% support it, and the remaining 10% are undecided.

00:15:59.844 --> 00:16:05.014
Interestingly, though, when you dig down deeper into surveys like this, support for the

00:16:05.024 --> 00:16:12.694
death penalty tends to rise when crimes are specified, especially particularly bad crimes.

00:16:13.594 --> 00:16:17.534
Terrorism, multiple murders, or the murder of a child.

00:16:18.554 --> 00:16:22.924
In these cases, in the UK at least, a majority of the population

00:16:23.164 --> 00:16:26.804
does support the death penalty over life imprisonment.

00:16:28.261 --> 00:16:34.661
Now, in the case of this survey at least, the respondents weren’t asked why they supported

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:40.761
it, but perhaps we can make some educated guesses when looking at surveys from elsewhere.

00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:48.751
In the United States, where 27 out of 50 states have the death penalty, the market research

00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:54.281
company Gallup has been tracking public opinion on the subject for almost 100 years.

00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:59.351
Although there is broader support for the death penalty in the United States

00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:05.991
than in the UK, with 53% supporting it and 44% opposing it as of the last

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:11.771
survey, support is decreasing and if it continues to decrease at a similar

00:17:11.771 --> 00:17:17.501
rate, in a decade or so the majority of Americans will oppose the death penalty.

00:17:18.725 --> 00:17:23.521
But what is particularly interesting in this Gallup data is to look at

00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:28.221
the reasons given by people who support or oppose the death penalty.

00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:34.806
For those who support the death penalty, the overwhelming reason, given

00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:41.046
by between 40 and 50% of respondents over the past 30 years, is some form

00:17:41.046 --> 00:17:46.016
of “they deserve it”, or “they killed therefore they should be killed”.

00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:53.376
It is punishment, retribution, that this is the morally and ethically right thing to do.

00:17:54.806 --> 00:18:00.276
And for those who oppose the death penalty, the similarly overwhelming

00:18:00.306 --> 00:18:05.056
top reason is some variant of “it is wrong to take a life”.

00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:10.966
There were all sorts of other options given in the survey, practical or economic

00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:16.956
reasons even, but none of these even came close to the emotional responses

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:22.446
on both sides: they deserve to be killed, or nobody deserves to be killed.

00:18:23.822 --> 00:18:30.656
And for all of the Enlightenment thinking, for all of the philosophers and moralists studiously

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:36.716
documenting the advantages and disadvantages of capital punishment, trying to think through the

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:44.086
subject logically and rationally, for most people it remains an emotional decision, a gut instinct.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.670
Statistically speaking, you, my dear listener, you

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.890
probably have strong opinions on capital punishment.

00:18:52.927 --> 00:18:57.860
Perhaps you think it is unacceptable in any situation, no matter the gravity of the crime.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:04.070
Perhaps you think that there are some crimes so terrible that it is the only solution.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.825
Perhaps you think that it is an effective tool in the justice system and that it

00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:14.460
is completely within the government’s mandate to choose to end someone’s life.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.160
No matter where you stand, it is hard to see capital

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.040
punishment being abolished worldwide in the near future.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.990
The overall global trend, over the past 150 years, might have been downward, but it is

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:35.150
still a part of the justice system that the majority of the global population lives under.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:44.410
And 2024, perhaps surprisingly, was the biggest year since 2015 for executions.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:52.220
According to Amnesty International, 1,153 people were executed last year, which doesn’t

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.370
include the thousands of people who are believed to have been executed in China.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.970
Don’t worry, this isn’t really a global trend.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.100
The reason for the jump is actually simple, it’s all down to Iran,

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.731
which accounted for 74% of all registered executions in 2023.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:17.900
Now, to wrap things up, the history of capital punishment is a fascinating one that gets

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:23.830
us asking questions about the role of the state, human rationality, and the justice system.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.640
We have thousands of years of evidence to show that executing criminals does stop them

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.450
from committing more criminal acts–because they are dead–but it doesn’t stop people

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:40.647
from becoming criminals, there is zero evidence that it is an effective deterrent.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.680
So what is capital punishment about?

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:45.960
Revenge?

00:20:46.423 --> 00:20:47.090
Justice?

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.270
Control?

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.680
The will of God?

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.010
It’s clear that the death penalty isn’t just about stopping

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.090
crime—it’s deeply tied to our ideas of justice, morality, and control.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.520
Whether you view it as a necessary tool or an outdated relic, capital punishment forces us to

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:13.050
ask questions about what justice truly means, and how far we’re willing to go to uphold it.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:21.410
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the veritable hot potato of a topic, capital punishment.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.950
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.770
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.800
The obvious question is…do you support or oppose the

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.580
death penalty, and what are your reasons for your opinion?

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.020
How has public opinion changed in your country, and what do you think the next 50 years will hold?

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.690
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.500
You can head right into our community forum, which is at

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.010
community.leonardoenglish.com and get chatting away to other curious minds.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.350
And as a quick reminder, this was part two of a three-part

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.830
mini-series on the general theme of crime and punishment.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:07.416
In part one we learned about the history of crime and punishment in the UK, and coming up

00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:13.506
next will be a deep dive into the evolving role of prison, so keep an eye out for that one.

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:19.046

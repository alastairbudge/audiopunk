Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:16.237
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:21.197
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.057 --> 00:00:29.377
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Oswald Mosley and British Fascism.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:36.489
Now, when you think of fascism in Europe, Britain probably isn’t the first country

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:41.953
that comes to mind, the usual suspects being Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:48.383
But just before The Second World War there was a growing fascist movement in

00:00:48.383 --> 00:00:55.273
Britain, led by a charismatic aristocratic Englishman, a man called Oswald Mosley.

00:00:56.103 --> 00:01:01.793
The story of how fascism started in Britain, how it was received by British people, and

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:07.923
ultimately how Britain managed to avoid the same fate as Germany, with Hitler, and Italy,

00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:13.263
with Mussolini, is a fascinating one, and it’s not something that many people know about.

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:18.272
So, let’s not waste any time, and get stuck right in.

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:24.692
If we turn the clocks back to 1930, the Great Depression had just hit the United States,

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:30.952
Europe was still trying to repair itself after The First World War, The Treaty of Versailles

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:37.282
had punished Germany to such an extent that it was struggling with hyperinflation, paving

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:44.542
the way for the Nazis to take power, Italy had been fascist since 1922, and of course

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:52.052
Russia, or rather the Soviet Union, was a big communist bear lurking to the east of Europe.

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:56.432
Britain was struggling with high levels of unemployment.

00:01:57.162 --> 00:02:04.592
Its colonial heyday, the peak of its colonial power, had passed, it had been badly damaged

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:10.162
by the Great Depression, and it was struggling to find its place in the modern world.

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:18.822
British exports had fallen by 50%, and 20% of the British workforce was out of work.

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:23.772
Things weren’t looking so rosy for Britain, and one young man

00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:28.412
sensed an opportunity to start a new chapter in British history.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.082
That man was Oswald Mosley, who was to end up being

00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:37.212
voted the worst historical Briton in a list by the BBC.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:46.012
On the 16th November 1896 at 47 Hill Street, Mayfair, one of the poshest

00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:51.792
addresses in London, Oslwald Ernald Mosley was born to an aristocratic

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:56.542
English family that traced its roots back to the 12th century.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:02.542
He enjoyed a privileged upbringing, attending one of the top schools

00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:06.332
in the country, joining the army and fighting in the First World War.

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:12.942
As a young man he reportedly developed a reputation for being rebellious, for

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:19.302
questioning the status quo, and for having incredible confidence in his own abilities.

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:25.842
He was a notorious womaniser, tall, dark and handsome, with a little moustache.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:31.852
He married well, to a girl from another aristocratic family, and

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:35.492
their wedding was attended by King George, the King of England.

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:39.192
So far he was the typical English aristocrat.

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:44.742
He entered politics in 1918, winning a seat as an MP, and

00:03:44.742 --> 00:03:48.392
became the youngest member of parliament, aged only 24.

00:03:49.452 --> 00:03:54.202
He soon developed a reputation as a fantastic orator, a great

00:03:54.262 --> 00:03:58.792
speaker, and could speak for extended periods without any notes.

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:03.372
When he first entered politics he was a member of the Conservative party,

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:08.272
then switched to become an Independent, and then moved over to Labour.

00:04:09.392 --> 00:04:14.112
Labour won the election of 1929, and Mosley hoped to

00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:17.392
be given a real position of power within government.

00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:23.692
He wasn’t, but what he was tasked to do was to solve the problem of

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:28.992
unemployment in Britain, which as you heard earlier, was at around 20%.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:34.142
He proposed something radical, something that had never been done

00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:38.512
before, but when you hear what it was, it might sound quite familiar.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:46.372
Essentially, he proposed that the state take on lots of debt, spend lots of money to create jobs

00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:53.332
for the unemployed, a sort of national programme of huge public works to get Britain working again.

00:04:54.092 --> 00:04:58.132
This probably sounds familiar because it’s now what almost

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:01.262
all governments do when there’s a problem of unemployment.

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:05.502
Take on debt, raise money, and invest in the country.

00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:09.052
But at the time it was a radical idea.

00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:11.262
Spend money that you don’t have?

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:16.702
That would be reckless and irresponsible, and it certainly wasn’t something that Britain should do.

00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:23.232
With his ideas shunned, and not listened to by his colleagues, he left the

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:29.122
Labour party and founded his own new party called, wait for it, The New

00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:34.942
Party, that appealed to left wing voters with promises to bring back jobs.

00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:42.982
Now, this might sound innocent enough at first, but it was the New Party that was to go on to

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:49.872
become The British Union of Fascists, the most famous fascist party in British political history.

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:52.732
It wasn’t an immediate success.

00:05:53.172 --> 00:06:00.032
Mosley’s New Party didn’t win any seats at a snap election in 1931, and,

00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:04.882
disillusioned, Mosley went on a tour of Europe to try to understand and

00:06:04.892 --> 00:06:09.322
study the new fascist movements that were taking place across Europe.

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:16.482
He went to Italy and met Mussolini, and to Germany where he was warmly received by Hitler.

00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:22.232
In Italy he saw how the country had been modernised under Mussolini’s fascist

00:06:22.232 --> 00:06:27.252
regime, and thought that a lot of lessons could be learned and applied in Britain.

00:06:28.202 --> 00:06:32.362
He didn’t really seem to rate Mussolini as an individual though,

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:37.962
calling him “affable but unimpressive”, but he was impressed with

00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:42.382
what he believed the fascists in Italy had managed to get done.

00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:49.462
He had seen firsthand the way in which fascism was a route to power, and he believed that

00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:55.342
fascist governments were a lot better at getting things done, and making tough economic

00:06:55.342 --> 00:07:00.242
decisions that traditional democratic governments, like Britain’s, didn’t want to make.

00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:09.612
In 1933 Mosley returned to Britain, and promptly established the British Union of Fascists, the BUF.

00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:18.212
When the BUF started, its goals were primarily economic, and they weren’t the kind

00:07:18.212 --> 00:07:23.322
of things that you would probably immediately associate with a fascist government.

00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:29.142
He pledged a huge reinvestment in British industry, and to

00:07:29.142 --> 00:07:33.442
create jobs for the millions of unemployed up and down the UK.

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:40.612
His messaging wasn’t immediately anti-Semitic, and Mosley hadn’t

00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:45.232
yet displayed any of the anti-Semitic tendencies that were to come.

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:52.952
Due to the fact that it was proposing primarily economic policies to start with, and because

00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:58.812
of its charismatic leader, it managed to get some support from the media, and the Daily

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:04.502
Mail, which is by the way the most popular newspaper in the UK, was an early supporter.

00:08:05.732 --> 00:08:12.987
However, Mosley didn’t try to hide his admiration for his fellow European fascists, Hitler and

00:08:12.987 --> 00:08:20.702
Mussolini, and especially as it became clearer and clearer that Hitler was not a very nice man, to

00:08:20.702 --> 00:08:27.672
put it politely, then public opinion of the British Union of Fascists grew more and more negative.

00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:33.802
After the Night of the Long Knives, in June 1934, where Hitler purged,

00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:39.122
he murdered, his own men, people in Britain saw that and thought, “well

00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:42.252
if that’s fascism, we don’t really like the idea of that in Britain”.

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:48.152
Mosley and the BUF were cut out of the media, they weren’t allowed to appear on

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:54.032
the TV or radio, so they had very limited means of getting their message across.

00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:58.942
What this meant was that Mosley would campaign up and

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:02.832
down the country, just giving huge numbers of speeches.

00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:10.232
From 1933 to 1937 he averaged 200 speeches per year.

00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:16.122
Blocked from the airwaves and newspapers, this was his only way of getting his message

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:22.172
out, and he continued to develop, to hone, his incredible skills as a public speaker.

00:09:23.552 --> 00:09:27.092
Membership of the British Union of Fascists continued to grow,

00:09:27.562 --> 00:09:32.222
and at its peak it’s said that it numbered around 50,000.

00:09:33.622 --> 00:09:37.602
They had their own flag, and their own uniform, the blackshirt.

00:09:38.862 --> 00:09:45.392
Members of the BUF developed a reputation for violence, and there would be huge fights

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:52.032
at their rallies between members of the blackshirts and anyone who was anti-fascist,

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:57.322
from communists to the Jewish population, which Mosley was starting to target.

00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:01.282
This came to a peak on two occasions.

00:10:02.432 --> 00:10:08.272
The first one was at a rally in Olympia, in West London, in June 1934.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:14.072
Mosley had advertised the fact that there was to be a huge rally, and a lot

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:18.692
of anti-fascists had managed to get tickets to it, in order to disrupt it.

00:10:19.862 --> 00:10:22.822
They certainly did disrupt it, but the blackshirts

00:10:22.892 --> 00:10:26.462
fought back, and the whole rally turned very violent.

00:10:27.512 --> 00:10:32.732
For anyone who might have been thinking that Mosley’s BUF was just interested in

00:10:32.912 --> 00:10:38.682
creating jobs and improving the life of the average person in Britain, its actions

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:43.872
at this rally showed that it certainly wasn’t a very friendly bunch of people.

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:51.282
Then two years later, in East London, Mosley was scheduled to go on a march through an area

00:10:51.282 --> 00:10:58.112
of the city with a large Jewish and Irish population, to antagonise them, to cause trouble.

00:10:59.262 --> 00:11:06.142
The BUF’s messaging had become increasingly anti-semitic, they had started to target

00:11:06.152 --> 00:11:12.332
the British Jewish population, using them as scapegoats for Britain’s economic problems.

00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:20.582
Perhaps this was because Mosley saw this as a way to change the fate of the BUF - he saw that

00:11:20.582 --> 00:11:27.512
Hitler’s anti-semitic policies, and scapegoating of the Jewish community, had resonated with

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:33.262
a proportion of the German population, and he thought a similar thing could work in Britain.

00:11:34.412 --> 00:11:36.962
Or was it because he truly believed it?

00:11:37.472 --> 00:11:43.112
It seems unlikely, as he hadn’t previously displayed any anti-Semitic tendencies.

00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:49.382
He was just prepared to do anything to get what he wanted, no matter who got in the way.

00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:53.292
Ultimately, the rationale behind it doesn’t really matter.

00:11:53.872 --> 00:11:57.222
The important thing is that he had started with the

00:11:57.222 --> 00:12:00.642
same anti-semitic rhetoric that Hitler was using.

00:12:01.802 --> 00:12:05.250
To get back to our story of this second event that really turned Britain away

00:12:05.352 --> 00:12:12.992
from Fascism, Mosley had planned a march through a Jewish area of London, but he

00:12:12.992 --> 00:12:18.612
was met with fierce resistance from the local Jewish and Irish population, and

00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:23.672
there was a huge fight between Mosley’s blackshirts and the local population.

00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:29.042
This event has gone down in history as the battle of Cable Street.

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:33.022
You can even go to Cable Street today, it’s in East

00:12:33.022 --> 00:12:36.752
London, and look at the mural commemorating the battle.

00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:44.902
By this time the BUF had lost most of the support that it had enjoyed soon after it was founded.

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:52.052
And indeed, the supporters it had gained through its reputation for violence and anti-semitism

00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:58.592
were not the type of supporters that Mosley wanted - he had originally envisioned it as a

00:12:58.832 --> 00:13:06.752
reputable political party focussed on rebuilding Britain, but instead he attracted violent,

00:13:06.982 --> 00:13:14.122
anti-Semitic supporters who not only destroyed any reputation he was hoping to develop for leading

00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:20.352
a serious political party, but also attracted more, similarly violent and anti-semitic people.

00:13:20.892 --> 00:13:25.602
Not that this is exonerating Mosley in any way, not that it's trying to make

00:13:25.602 --> 00:13:31.632
an excuse for his behaviour, he was obviously responsible for the vile rhetoric

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:37.882
of the British Union of Fascists, but it’s just to say that the BUF turned into

00:13:37.892 --> 00:13:43.742
an untamable monster that Mosley probably hadn’t envisioned when he created it.

00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:51.902
Indeed, there was such a feeling of public disgust towards the BUF, the views that it was proposing,

00:13:52.142 --> 00:14:00.512
and the way in which it acted, that a law was passed in 1936 explicitly against extremist political

00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:08.112
parties, which banned uniforms for political marches, and required police to be present for marches.

00:14:09.252 --> 00:14:16.312
This effectively ended the BUF, cutting off its one opportunity to get its message across.

00:14:17.402 --> 00:14:23.822
When the war started in 1939, and Britain was literally at war with fascists,

00:14:24.302 --> 00:14:28.202
there was no going back for fascism in Britain, at least at this time.

00:14:29.262 --> 00:14:34.312
Mosley was put in prison, as he was viewed as a Nazi sympathiser, and

00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:39.382
someone who could potentially be put in a puppet British government

00:14:39.562 --> 00:14:44.622
in the event of a Nazi victory, which looked very possible in 1940.

00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:51.572
As we know, luckily the Nazis were defeated, Mosley was released, but he was

00:14:51.572 --> 00:14:58.012
never to have anywhere near the power and influence that he had in the 1930s.

00:14:58.012 --> 00:15:03.842
One interesting thing about his later life though, which might surprise you, given some of

00:15:03.842 --> 00:15:09.962
the attitudes of lots of the more right-wing parties in Britain and other European countries

00:15:09.962 --> 00:15:15.652
towards the European Union, was that he actually formed something called the National

00:15:15.652 --> 00:15:22.642
Party of Europe, and advocated for one single nation state to rule the whole continent.

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:29.867
He didn’t succeed, but it is strange to think now that a fascist leader only 70 years

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:36.497
ago was promoting this idea of a union of Europe, when the fascist, or the rightest

00:15:36.507 --> 00:15:41.817
of the right-wing leaders of Europe currently are frequently calling for the abolition

00:15:42.377 --> 00:15:48.067
of something that actually does almost exactly what Mosley was wanting, the EU.

00:15:49.117 --> 00:15:55.827
And ever since Oswald Mosley and the BUF, fascism in Britain has never really taken off.

00:15:55.827 --> 00:16:01.597
From the British National Party to the United Kingdom Independence Party to the

00:16:01.847 --> 00:16:07.127
English Defence League, there have been attempts to reignite fascist ideas in the

00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:12.887
country, but none have had anywhere near the success or influence that Mosley had.

00:16:13.837 --> 00:16:20.347
There are evidently many economic, political, and societal explanations for this,

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:26.197
but a huge part of the success of the British Union of Fascists is thought to have

00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:32.457
come from Mosley himself, his magnetism and charisma, and his power as an orator.

00:16:33.387 --> 00:16:37.227
In 1940 he was described as "strikingly handsome.

00:16:37.527 --> 00:16:39.647
He is probably the best orator in England.

00:16:39.907 --> 00:16:42.057
His personal magnetism is very great".

00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:50.767
He was the respectable face of fascism - well spoken, aristocratic, handsome, and this was

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:58.257
one of the main reasons that his fascist message appealed, it was disguised by his fashionable

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:04.427
clothes and persuasive tongue, so it almost didn’t matter what he was saying, the way in which he

00:17:04.437 --> 00:17:10.247
said it was so appealing that he still managed to attract supporters from all over the country.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:17.757
What I want to end with though, as I’ve been talking about how he talks quite a lot, is

00:17:17.807 --> 00:17:24.867
two clips of him speaking, the first is of him speaking as a Labour MP about unemployment.

00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:28.707
So here we go, this is in 1930.

00:17:33.047 --> 00:17:40.307
Are you going to talk about unemployment today?

00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:41.877
Why of course.

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:44.587
It is the one problem that really matters today.

00:17:45.277 --> 00:17:55.477
We live in a period in which politicians are not very popular and believe me, you have my sympathy.

00:17:56.787 --> 00:18:07.007
Politicians are regarded as people who have learned to talk, but not to act and you demand action.

00:18:07.697 --> 00:18:11.627
And rightly demanded in dealing with unemployment.

00:18:12.747 --> 00:18:20.207
We live in a period in Britain can only survive by vigour and by action.

00:18:21.207 --> 00:18:30.657
We have resources of intellect, of energy, of craftsmanship, of skill, second to none in

00:18:30.657 --> 00:18:39.627
the world, but those resources must be mobilised for a great effort of a united nation.

00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:49.570
To do that government, and statesman, must take that courage in their hand.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.960
OK then so that was Oswald Mosley talking about unemployment in 1930.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.093
Our second clip is of him at a rally in Manchester.

00:19:02.623 --> 00:19:08.253
I can’t find the date of this one, but I guess it will be some time between 1934 and 1936.

00:19:10.073 --> 00:19:17.113
And now, at long last our men of the war our men of 1914, our grim

00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:22.223
ranks of our ex service men, again and again betrayed by politicians.

00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:26.818
They join hands with the new youth, the new generation which remembers the mighty past.

00:19:29.818 --> 00:19:32.983
We say that England is not dead.

00:19:33.713 --> 00:19:36.913
We say, and I ask you to say with us, lift up your

00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:40.618
voices in this great meeting in the heart of England.

00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:46.113
Send to all the world a message, England lives and marches on.

00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:53.393
Quite some transformation, right?

00:19:54.403 --> 00:19:57.943
Ultimately, Mosley introduced Britain to fascism.

00:19:58.563 --> 00:20:03.803
Without Mosley, and without the BUF, the British people might never have seen fascism up

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:10.363
close and personal, but they did, they didn’t like it, and it was convincingly rejected.

00:20:11.693 --> 00:20:18.053
So, in a strange twist of fate, Mosley managed to do more damage to fascism

00:20:18.293 --> 00:20:23.073
than Mussolini and Hitler put together, and has ensured that Britain

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:27.683
has soundly rejected fascism whenever it has come knocking ever since.

00:20:30.543 --> 00:20:36.073
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Oswald Mosley and British Fascism.

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:39.363
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and that you’ve learned something new.

00:20:40.693 --> 00:20:44.943
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, whether

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:49.073
you’re from a country that has experienced fascist rule, or whether you haven’t.

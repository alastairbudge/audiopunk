Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.821
English, the show where you can learn fascinating things about the world while improving your

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:15.421
English.

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:23.251
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about King Henry the Eighth of England and

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:25.081
his six wives.

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:32.311
He's probably the most notorious of all of the British monarchs, and today we are going to learn

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.741
about exactly why that is.

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:41.611
Before we get right into it, this is just your usual reminder for those of you listening to this

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:48.391
podcast on Spotify, iVoox, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts that you can get the

00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:54.771
transcript and key vocabulary and bonus podcasts over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:56.031 --> 00:01:02.495
The transcript also comes in lovely new animating form, so that's a bit like subtitles, and also in

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.185
PDF form.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.665
So do check that out if you haven't done so already.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:11.265
You can find out more at leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.115
Okay, then, Henry the Eighth and his wives.

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:22.145
Now you may know a little bit about Henry the Eighth, or maybe you know nothing.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.680
If you have heard of him, you probably imagine a huge greasy fat man who had a fondness for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.300
executing his wives.

00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:39.801
Henry the Eighth was King of England from 1509 until his death in 1547.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:50.276
His 36-year rule saw England break ties with the Catholic church and two of his wives lose their

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:50.756
heads.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:56.346
Today we are going to tell the story of exactly how that happened.

00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:02.516
So let's start with wife number one, Catherine of Aragon.

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:09.356
When Henry became King in 1509 he was only 17 years old.

00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:17.771
Within six weeks he had married Catherine of Aragon, who was the daughter of King Ferdinand and

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.421
Queen Isabella of Spain.

00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:28.371
Catherine was also the widow of Henry's older brother Arthur, who had died seven years before.

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.478
Henry was very fond of Catherine.

00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:37.278
It was said that he loved her dearly and she fell pregnant several times.

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:47.898
However, she failed to produce a son, the all-important male heir, and the only child to survive

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:55.758
from Henry and Catherine's marriage was a daughter, Mary, who was born in February, 1516.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:05.153
Henry was pretty obsessed with producing a son and his eyes soon started wandering towards other

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:13.673
women who he hoped would be able to provide him with the all-important, much desired, male heir.

00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:22.588
He became particularly fond of one of his Queens ladies in waiting - so a lady-in-waiting is a sort

00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:31.088
of fancy personal assistant - and the lady-in-waiting that he had eyes for was called Anne Boleyn.

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:40.098
However, Henry couldn't marry another woman, he was already married, and divorce was illegal in the

00:03:40.098 --> 00:03:41.538
eyes of the Catholic church.

00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:51.253
One of the only ways in which a marriage could be undone was if it could be proved that the marriage

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:54.133
was not valid in the first place.

00:03:54.673 --> 00:04:02.893
So Henry claimed that his marriage to Catherine was invalid because she had previously consummated

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:10.003
her marriage with her ex husband - so consummated means basically that they had had sex - despite

00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:13.033
Catherine assuring him that they hadn't.

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:23.499
Long story short, the Pope refused to annul the marriage and Henry, instead of just deciding that

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:29.679
that was fair enough and he should just continue his marriage with Catherine, he broke all ties with

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:37.179
the Catholic church, made himself head of the newly formed Church of England, divorced Catherine,

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.529
and married Anne Boleyn.

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:45.084
So this brings us on to wife number two, Anne Boleyn.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:53.469
Henry had previously had an affair with Anne's sister, Mary, which I guess isn't necessarily a good

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.239
way to start off a relationship.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:03.249
In any case, within nine months of getting married Anne Boleyn gave birth to a child.

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:07.299
However, the child was a girl, Elizabeth.

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.709
The long-awaited male heir was still eluding him.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:20.969
Anne also fell pregnant several times after that, but had a series of miscarriages and stillborn

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:21.389
children.

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:30.219
And as you might have gathered or guessed by now, Henry wasn't the most loyal of kings or the most

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.119
loyal of men, and he started having more affairs.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.779
When Anne cottoned on to this, when she realised what was going on, she got very angry with him and

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:47.279
instead of just saying, "yup sorry, that was me.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:55.211
I apologise for that", he accused her of adultery, he accused her of having an affair, and also of

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:55.841
treason.

00:05:58.301 --> 00:06:04.511
And if there was one thing that you didn't want to do, it was to get on the wrong side of Henry the

00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:06.221
Eighth, to make him angry.

00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:11.111
And Anne Boleyn got on the wrong side of Henry the Eighth.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:19.541
Just three years after they were married, Henry had her beheaded, executed in the Tower of London.

00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:29.326
And only days after Anne's head was separated from her body, Henry took his third wife, Jane

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:29.731
Seymour.

00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:38.771
Most historians actually believe that Henry and Jane had been having an affair while Henry was still

00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:47.791
married to Anne Boleyn and that actually it was Jane who had pushed Henry to execute Anne Boleyn,

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:48.771
her love rival.

00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:57.576
In any case, they were married for just over a year before Jane gave birth to a son, Henry's third

00:06:57.576 --> 00:07:00.346
child and his first male heir.

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:05.016
Finally, the long awaited male heir had arrived for the King.

00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:11.336
Unfortunately, due to problems during childbirth, Jane died 12 days later.

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:19.616
Henry was apparently distraught, incredibly upset, and Jane is actually the only one of Henry's

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:21.596
wives to be buried beside him.

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:30.490
Henry stayed a bachelor, at least from a marriage point of view, for the two years after Jane's

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.910
death.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.450
But then it was on to wife number four.

00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:43.676
One of his advisors had suggested that he sought a European alliance, or European partnership, and

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:50.756
had suggested that he marry one of the two daughters of the Duke of Cleves in Germany.

00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:59.381
Henry agreed to this, but he asked for their pictures so he could choose which one of the daughters

00:07:59.381 --> 00:07:59.831
to marry.

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:09.671
So a kind of 16th century version of Tinder, but if Henry the Eighth swipes right on you, you seem

00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:12.311
to have a 33% chance of losing your head.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:20.336
Anyway, he decided that Anne of Cleves was the more attractive of the daughters, and he agreed to

00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:20.936
marry her.

00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:29.866
But when she arrived in England, Henry saw her in real life, in the flesh, and he was furious,

00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:34.666
saying that she wasn't nearly as attractive as the woman in the picture.

00:08:36.276 --> 00:08:42.236
He tried to stop the wedding from going ahead, from happening, but he wasn't able to - the

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:44.546
arrangements had already gone too far.

00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:51.646
Reluctantly, he married Anne and nicknamed her "his ugly wife".

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:55.318
And the marriage wasn't to last for long.

00:08:55.768 --> 00:09:02.008
He requested a divorce and they were separated six months later, although it was said that they

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:06.478
actually remained on pretty friendly terms even after being separated.

00:09:08.123 --> 00:09:14.303
I guess Anne didn't want to argue with Henry on this one, as she had seen what had happened to his

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:15.993
previous wife named Anne.

00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:21.973
If you've lost track of how many wives we're on now, I wouldn't blame you.

00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:24.413
This is Anne, Anne of Cleves.

00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:25.363
This was number four.

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:35.023
Almost immediately after the annulment, the cancellation, of his marriage to Anne of Cleves, he

00:09:35.023 --> 00:09:44.158
married Catherine Howard, who was a beautiful 16 year old - yes, I did say 16 year old - who was

00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:48.508
also a cousin of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn.

00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:55.978
By the time that Henry married Catherine, he was an overweight 49 year old.

00:09:57.033 --> 00:10:03.003
And he was obsessed with his new young bride, calling her his "rose without a thorn."

00:10:03.783 --> 00:10:12.933
So far so good, the King was in love, but there were rumours that Catherine was unfaithful, that she

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.543
was having an affair with another man from court.

00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:24.903
These rumours did seem to have quite a lot of truth behind them, and Catherine obviously hadn't

00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:31.788
learned rule number one of being married to Henry the Eighth: don't annoy him, don't get on his

00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:39.528
wrong side Unfortunately, the rumours were too much for Henry to handle, and 18 months after they

00:10:39.528 --> 00:10:46.698
were married, Catherine was beheaded, her head chopped off, in exactly the same place as her cousin

00:10:47.058 --> 00:10:48.018
in the Tower of London.

00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:52.088
So that was wife number five.

00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:59.948
One might have thought that Henry would have decided, okay, I'm not having that much luck with

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:00.878
marriage.

00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:02.408
I think I'll just leave it there.

00:11:03.428 --> 00:11:04.868
But you'd be mistaken.

00:11:05.588 --> 00:11:11.498
A year and a half after wife number five was executed, he took wife number six.

00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:16.778
But this time he wasn't looking for excitement or love.

00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:18.878
He was looking for a companion.

00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:21.653
Someone to nurse him as he grew old.

00:11:23.363 --> 00:11:25.403
And he settled on Catherine Parr.

00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:32.663
Another Catherine, but this time, one that was a little more mature and a little more faithful.

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:38.183
For Catherine Parr, things did actually go pretty well.

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:44.123
She became a trusted confidant of Henry's and had a large influence on his court.

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:52.973
And most importantly, she managed to escape execution, actually outliving Henry by a year after his

00:11:52.973 --> 00:11:54.683
death in 1547.

00:11:56.543 --> 00:12:04.043
So if you need a reminder, because I certainly think I would need a reminder, we had wife number one

00:12:04.373 --> 00:12:06.593
Catherine of Aragon, divorced.

00:12:07.343 --> 00:12:10.763
Wife number two, Anne Boleyn, executed.

00:12:11.903 --> 00:12:16.973
Wife number three, Jane Seymour, died after complications from childbirth.

00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:23.933
Wife number four Anne of Cleves, separated after being considered to ugly.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:28.433
Wife number five, Catherine Howard, executed.

00:12:28.973 --> 00:12:32.243
And wife number six, Catherine Parr, survived.

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:36.053
So is there a moral to this story?

00:12:37.433 --> 00:12:40.463
Well, I'm not too sure, perhaps you can see one that I can't.

00:12:40.973 --> 00:12:47.108
I guess the moral at the time was "if Henry the Eighth wants to marry you, you should think very

00:12:47.108 --> 00:12:48.668
carefully before you say yes".

00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:55.791
Henry the Eighth was evidently a ruthless individual.

00:12:56.286 --> 00:13:00.936
And being his wife was a very thankless task.

00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:06.966
Okay that is it for Henry the Eighth and his wives.

00:13:07.296 --> 00:13:13.596
I hope that this has been an interesting introduction to one of Britain's most famous kings, and of

00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:16.296
course his mostly unfortunate waves.

00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:21.991
As a reminder, you can get the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website,

00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:23.961
which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:30.361
The transcript is now nice and animating, so that's a bit like subtitles, but actually cooler

00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:35.971
because you can press on a word and your browser will give you the definition, which I, for one,

00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:37.141
thing is pretty neat.

00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:42.721
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:46.741
I'm Alastair Budge and I'll catch you in the next episode.

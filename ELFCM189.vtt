Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:17.144
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:21.874
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:27.724
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about American

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:33.354
Exceptionalism, the idea that the United States of America is fundamentally

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:38.554
different, it’s exceptional, making it the best country in the world.

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:46.974
I wanted to explore this idea shortly after July 4th, Independence Day, which is a time that

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:53.754
Americans celebrate independence from Great Britain, and rejoice at how wonderful their country is.

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:59.884
In this episode we are not going to try to say that the US either is or

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.894
isn’t the greatest country in the world, but rather explore some of the

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:10.345
reasons, both historically and now,  why many Americans believe it is.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:17.145
As you can probably tell from my accent, I am not an American, I’m from the UK.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:23.315
As we both know, and especially if you’ve listened to the episode on The American

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:28.925
Revolution, the United States broke away from Great Britain, creating what many

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:35.565
Americans would say was a better, more equal, more free country, taking what was

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:41.805
good from Great Britain, from the old world, and leaving everything that was bad.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:49.925
You might say the fact I’m from the UK makes me a biased, an unfair, judge of the subject.

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:54.195
But I would argue the opposite, and say that it probably

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:59.205
takes an outsider to have as objective a view as possible.

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:05.495
And that the subject is probably best explored from a non-American perspective.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:10.845
So, in this episode we’ll explore four main ideas.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:15.405
Firstly, we’ll start with some statistics and facts about

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:19.185
American exceptionalism, and cover the history of the term.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:23.675
Secondly, we’ll look at the history of why many people in

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:28.855
America have historically believed that their country is special.

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:37.225
Thirdly, we’ll try to evaluate some of these through as clear or objective a lens as possible.

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:41.475
And finally, we’ll close with some thoughts on what

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:44.895
the future of American exceptionalism might look like.

00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:48.845
This is evidently a large and complicated subject.

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:50.865
So, let’s get started.

00:02:52.515 --> 00:02:59.475
For those of us who have spent much time with Americans, you have probably noticed a theme,

00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:07.335
and that is that life outside the United States is often compared to its US equivalent.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.285
The United States of America is how the world should be, it’s

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:15.915
a guiding example, and everywhere else is compared to it.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:22.335
Of course, there are plenty of exceptions, and people from other countries are also guilty of

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:29.245
this, but it is a tendency that, in my experience at least, is most commonly found in Americans.

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:36.445
And moving away from the slightly tenuous example of our own life experience,

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:41.365
the statistics do suggest that there is a strong belief in America

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:46.395
that it is either the best, or one of the best countries in the world.

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:55.355
Surveys taken over the past 10 years or so have consistently shown that between 85-90%

00:03:55.355 --> 00:04:00.985
of Americans believe it’s either the best, or one of the best countries in the world.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:07.965
As you might expect, the numbers are different for different political and demographic groups.

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:17.555
41% of Republicans say the US is the absolute best country in the world, while 19% of Democrats do.

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:26.605
44% of those aged 65 and over do, while only 12% of those under 30 do.

00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:35.085
30% of white Americans say it’s the greatest country on Earth, while only 26% of Hispanics do.

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:42.715
And there is an inverse relationship between education and how likely you are

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:48.805
to think that the US is the best country in the world - only 20% of those with a

00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:55.375
postgraduate degree believe it is, while 33% of those with just a high school degree do.

00:04:56.225 --> 00:05:02.065
To sum up, it is undeniable that, when compared to any other country, as we'll

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:07.345
see in a minute, the US always comes first in one category: the percentage

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:12.315
of citizens who believe that they live in the best country in the world.

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:17.695
Now, the question we will explore today is...why?

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:24.075
If you read articles written by patriotic Americans, or indeed ask

00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:28.415
many Americans, they will probably mention a combination of things.

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:34.405
That the United States is a country founded by people with a shared belief in freedom,

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:42.215
that it has a modern political system of checks and balances, that it has embraced modern

00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:48.243
capitalism, that it is embracing of immigrants, it is so large that you have everything

00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:54.543
from beaches to mountains, deserts to forests, that it is the home of free speech, and

00:05:54.793 --> 00:06:00.273
the result of all of this is that it’s the best place to start a business, that American

00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:05.923
salaries are higher, and that the quality of life is better than anywhere else in the world.

00:06:07.023 --> 00:06:12.043
They will no doubt admit that the country isn’t perfect, but that there is no

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:18.213
other country that comes close, that America is, as the term goes, exceptional.

00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:23.493
Now, let’s just define this word quickly, “exceptional”.

00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:30.761
It’s usually used to mean very good, amazing, but that’s not what it actually means.

00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:34.011
It means unusual, not typical.

00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:40.471
And this is the idea of American Exceptionalism, that there is something unusual

00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:46.381
and unique about the country, that when you put all of the factors I just mentioned

00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:52.341
earlier together, you have this magical mix, and you have created a country with

00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:58.191
a series of advantages, which is why America is the greatest country in the world.

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:04.961
This exceptionalism, this idea that America is somehow different and superior,

00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:10.941
has led to the belief firstly that other countries should want to be like it.

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:18.821
Throughout American history, presidents and politicians have continuously reiterated this message.

00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:26.621
Thomas Jefferson called the country an “empire of liberty”, Ronald Reagan called it a

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:33.891
"shining city on a hill”, Abraham Lincoln talked about the "last best hope of Earth”,

00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:39.921
George Bush Senior called it the "leader of the free world”, and Madeleine Albright,

00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:46.801
the former US secretary of state, referred to it as an "indispensable nation”.

00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:53.591
The second aspect of this exceptionalism is that, because the US is

00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:59.111
different, it can behave differently, and different rules apply to it.

00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:06.741
From its long history of intervening in the political systems of other countries to fighting

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:13.261
foreign wars to defend American values, there is an American belief that it doesn’t need to

00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:20.341
behave in the same way as other countries precisely because it isn’t like other countries.

00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:24.931
While the concept of “American Exceptionalism” is something that

00:08:24.931 --> 00:08:30.981
is quintessentially American, both the coining of the term and the

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:36.631
popularising of the term come from people who are certainly not American.

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:45.061
It was first used by the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville, after he traveled there in 1831.

00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:49.531
When he used the term, he was certainly referring to

00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:53.761
how America was different from European countries.

00:08:54.181 --> 00:09:01.001
It was a republic, it had a different political system, it rejected aristocratic hierarchy, it

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:08.941
put individual freedom above equality between men, which was a novel idea for a Frenchman, and the

00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:16.681
fact that US citizenship was based on beliefs and shared ideals, rather than who your parents were.

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.811
And the US was, of course, very different to Europe of the early

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.891
19th century, in that respect it certainly was exceptional.

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:31.831
Although de Tocqueville was the first person to use this phrase, it was

00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:38.251
actually popularised by someone you really wouldn’t expect: Josef Stalin.

00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.911
Now, he wasn’t using the phrase to describe how amazing America was,

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:48.771
but was using it in the context of the fact that there was nothing

00:09:49.031 --> 00:09:55.001
“exceptional” about America that would mean that it could resist socialism.

00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:59.051
In that, he was wrong of course, at least at the time,

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:03.641
but he did help bring back the phrase into popular usage.

00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:09.321
And this idea was embraced by America, and by Americans.

00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:17.681
The level of patriotism in America can seem unusual especially for many non-Americans.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:24.311
You may remember, on July 4th 2021, Independence Day this year, Mark

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:30.121
Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook posted a video of himself on a surfboard

00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:35.441
with an American flag, set to the music of Take Me Home, Country Roads.

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.971
You might say that this was a publicity stunt, but

00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:42.481
it’s hard to think of anything more American than this.

00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:50.721
Now, of course there was some domestic ridicule, some people laughing at it within America, but it’s

00:10:50.721 --> 00:10:57.081
hard to imagine many other countries where this would be something a corporate leader would ever do.

00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:03.361
Almost the worst insult that can be hurled at an American politician is that they aren’t

00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:10.291
a “patriot”, and anything but a deep love and belief in American values as superior is

00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:15.511
considered to be something to be sceptical about, especially within the Republican party.

00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:23.001
This is certainly extraordinary, exceptional even, given the high levels of immigration

00:11:23.051 --> 00:11:29.731
to the country - this idea that American ideals are capable of inspiring loyalty almost

00:11:29.751 --> 00:11:37.141
immediately, and as soon as one becomes an American citizen these levels of patriotism shoot up.

00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:41.941
Contrast this for a minute with some European countries.

00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:47.921
Now, you will of course be a better judge of how patriotic you feel people in

00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:54.481
your country to be, but from a recent survey only 13% of British people said

00:11:54.481 --> 00:12:00.681
their country was the best in the world, 5% of French people, 11% of people

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:07.071
from Finland, 13% of people from Denmark, and 5% of Germans said the same.

00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:14.341
And some of these countries score far higher than the United States in many important measures.

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:19.931
Finland, for example, is considered to have one of the best healthcare systems in the

00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:24.404
world, Denmark is considered to have one of the best systems of social care in the world,

00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:30.471
and France is always up there on the list of countries that most people want to move to.

00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:36.361
Of course, something that is important for one person might be unimportant for another.

00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:41.761
I imagine that the average resident of Texas would not be so happy to

00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:46.881
live in a country where guns were illegal, but the average Dutch citizen

00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:50.991
probably isn’t too bothered about not being able to buy a machine gun.

00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:57.551
What is most interesting about this to me is that this belief in the exceptionalism

00:12:57.591 --> 00:13:03.041
of America, and the subsequent patriotism, is so much higher than in other countries.

00:13:03.631 --> 00:13:07.951
There are, of course, many advantages to life in the United States,

00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:12.821
and quality of life by almost any measure will be higher for the

00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:17.141
average person born in the US than the average person in the world.

00:13:17.821 --> 00:13:23.231
America has for decades been the world leader in science and technology, it

00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:28.011
has the best universities, the best hospitals, the most successful companies in

00:13:28.011 --> 00:13:33.271
the world, people all over the world use products built by American companies.

00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:39.231
And it is the largest economy in the world, there are definitely a lot of amazing things

00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:44.621
that the United States has given the world, and a lot of great advantages to life in America.

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:53.091
But, if America really was so exceptional, if it still had these incredible unique qualities,

00:13:53.171 --> 00:14:00.261
and if 8 times more Americans than Germans say that they live in the best country in the world,

00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:06.261
should it not be head and shoulders above every other country in almost every single measure?

00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:12.441
The US doesn’t have the highest income per capita in the world, it is rarely number

00:14:12.441 --> 00:14:17.571
one when it comes to things like average education levels or access to healthcare.

00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:21.951
It might have the highest quality services for those that can

00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:26.731
afford it, but these are only accessible to a minority of Americans.

00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:32.461
And you have probably heard statistics such as the fact that the United States

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:40.311
has 4.4% of the world’s population but 22% of the world’s prison population, or

00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:46.011
that half a million Americans go bankrupt every year because of healthcare costs.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:52.941
Obviously, these aren’t all unique problems to America, every country has its own issues, but

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:59.221
the point is, if we are in agreement that it’s hard to say that the US is objectively the best

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:04.121
country to live in the world, and should be an example to the world of how a country should

00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:11.461
be, why do such a large proportion of Americans believe it deserves this exceptional status?

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:17.071
Well, firstly there is a strong cultural myth of this exceptionalism.

00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:22.541
If you have been brought up in a country where a large proportion of people believe they

00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:27.351
live in the best country in the world, then you are more likely to take that view yourself.

00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:31.351
Secondly, it’s built into the education system.

00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:38.261
Millions of American schoolchildren every day recite what’s called The Pledge of Allegiance.

00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:44.061
They say "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic

00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:50.921
for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:57.841
Obviously, they aren’t all taking this seriously every time they do it, but it is a serious affair.

00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:03.411
Indeed, even in 2019 a high school student in Florida

00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:06.961
was arrested for not taking part in the pledge.

00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:12.831
He was later released without charge, because it’s not actually a criminal

00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:18.451
act to not take part, but it gives you an idea of how seriously it is taken.

00:16:19.201 --> 00:16:24.151
This expectation of deep respect that is required towards the flag,

00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:28.531
and the nation, is something that continues well into adulthood.

00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:34.601
You will no doubt have been aware of the uproar against the sports players

00:16:34.771 --> 00:16:39.731
who knelt down during the national anthem in solidarity with the Black Lives

00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:44.341
Matter movement, with the former President Donald Trump calling for them to

00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:50.301
be banned, to be kicked off the pitch for disrespecting the national anthem.

00:16:51.031 --> 00:16:54.691
Thirdly, there is the fact that, compared to many other

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:58.131
people, Americans travel less outside their country.

00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:03.051
The United States is obviously a very large country, it’s practically

00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:07.481
its own continent, international travel is expensive, and there is a

00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:11.381
huge amount of great travelling you can do without ever going abroad.

00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:17.021
Indeed, a recent survey suggested that 63% of Americans had

00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:20.841
never left the country and 50% don’t even have a passport.

00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:28.421
If you have never experienced life in another country, and your experience of other countries is

00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:35.701
through your often very patriotic cable news channels with limited global news, you might think

00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:40.581
it’s completely understandable that you would think that you live in the best country on Earth.

00:17:41.711 --> 00:17:47.441
And our fourth reason, which isn’t the case for every citizen, is to do with religion.

00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:52.221
If you have listened to the episode on Mormonism, you’ll remember

00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:56.241
that in Mormonism America has a special place in the religion.

00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:01.451
And even in more mainstream American Christianity, there is

00:18:01.451 --> 00:18:06.231
a common theme that God has some special role for America.

00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:12.531
Even Ronald Reagan once said that there was a divine plan for America.

00:18:13.431 --> 00:18:17.821
Of course, if you think that your country has a special purpose, given to

00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:23.981
it by God, then this almost by default makes it special, and exceptional.

00:18:25.091 --> 00:18:29.511
The United States of America is most certainly an incredible country, and

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:34.941
the world has a huge amount to be thankful to it for, that is undeniable.

00:18:35.571 --> 00:18:40.301
It’s also undeniable that its effects on the world have not always been

00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:45.351
positive - from its foreign policy disasters through to its poor environmental

00:18:45.351 --> 00:18:51.311
record, the list of negative exceptionalism, one could say, is long and ongoing.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:56.051
And in recent years this idea of American Exceptionalism

00:18:56.241 --> 00:19:00.551
has been challenged like never before from within America.

00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:06.281
Whether it’s the questioning of the American model of capitalism by many on the left,

00:19:06.611 --> 00:19:12.321
or even the move away from intervention in foreign wars during the Trump presidency,

00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:17.721
there has been an increasing amount of questioning of whether the United States

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:22.691
really is exceptional, whether the country should act as the world’s policeman,

00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:27.841
and whether it is so superior that other countries should model themselves on it.

00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:33.361
But, despite this criticism, the idea of American Exceptionalism

00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:37.201
is one that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon.

00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:42.911
The sense of patriotism in the US, at least in terms of numbers of people who

00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:48.931
consider themselves “patriots”, has really not changed much over the past few decades.

00:19:49.511 --> 00:19:54.839
And certainly under the Biden administration , at least before the recent

00:19:54.869 --> 00:20:00.289
disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, it looks, or at least it looked like

00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:06.739
there was going to be a renewed focus on the US’s role as a global leader, and an

00:20:06.739 --> 00:20:12.189
example to other countries of what can be achieved if you embrace American values.

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:19.069
To conclude, there is certainly something interesting and admirable about American

00:20:19.129 --> 00:20:25.699
confidence, both in themselves and in the superiority and exceptionalism of their country.

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:30.219
Americans are some of the most confident people in the world, with

00:20:30.489 --> 00:20:35.419
big hopes and dreams, big ambitions, and a true sense of self-belief.

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:40.949
A sense that, perhaps, only comes from believing you

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:44.419
live in the most exceptional country in the world.

00:20:47.686 --> 00:20:54.636
OK then, that is it for today's episode on American Exceptionalism, an exploration

00:20:54.786 --> 00:21:00.806
of the idea that the US is special, extraordinary, and the best country in the world.

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:04.206
I always say that I’d love to know what you thought of

00:21:04.206 --> 00:21:07.966
this episode, but it is particularly true in this case.

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:14.566
We have only just scratched the surface here, and it’s a discussion that could go on for hours.

00:21:15.016 --> 00:21:21.056
Why do you think that Americans have this sense of national superiority and exceptionalism?

00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:23.516
What did you agree or disagree with?

00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:27.436
What else is important that we didn’t get to in this episode?

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:32.946
It is a really interesting subject, so let’s get this discussion started - the

00:21:32.946 --> 00:21:38.946
place for that is our community forum, over at community.leonardoenglish.com.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.749
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.479
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:28.579
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about How We Sleep.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.489
Sleep is something that everyone in the world does, every

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.899
single day, or at least we should do it every single day.

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:44.079
Indeed, we will all spend anywhere from a quarter to a third of our entire lives asleep.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.689
Yet there is still quite a lot of mystery about what

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.649
actually happens when we sleep, and why we sleep.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.079
So, that is what we’re going to be talking about today, I hope it’ll be an interesting one.

00:01:00.754 --> 00:01:07.084
Sleep is an activity that has mystified people throughout the course of human history.

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:15.094
Not just every human, but also every animal, needs to sleep, at least once every 24 hours.

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:22.434
Humans normally sleep in one go, all at once, while other animals, dogs

00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:27.054
for example, tend to sleep in shorter periods, multiple times a day.

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:34.344
We are hardwired to do this, we need to sleep, there’s no way of getting around the

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:40.064
fact that after a certain period of time, no matter how much coffee you might have drunk

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:45.504
or other stimulants that you might have consumed, your body is going to need to sleep.

00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:49.184
But why do we need to do this?

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:54.354
What biological reason is there that causes us to need to sleep?

00:01:55.404 --> 00:02:01.264
In fact, the answer to this question has eluded scientists for centuries.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:09.264
We still don’t know exactly what function sleep plays, we don’t know exactly why we sleep.

00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:13.294
We do know that there must be a very good reason for it.

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:19.524
Firstly, from an evolutionary point of view, sleeping is when an animal

00:02:19.524 --> 00:02:25.134
is most vulnerable to attacks, if you’re asleep you have a limited ability

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:30.514
to defend yourself or even realise that a predator is creeping up on you.

00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:35.614
So if there weren’t a very good reason to do it, animals

00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:39.244
wouldn’t have developed the biological requirement to sleep.

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:44.934
Secondly, we know that we normally feel a lot better after we sleep.

00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:49.914
We feel refreshed, re-energised, and ready for the day.

00:02:50.354 --> 00:02:52.634
So something good must be happening.

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:58.634
Conversely, if you haven’t had enough sleep you feel tired,

00:02:58.684 --> 00:03:03.934
grumpy, unable to think clearly, and just generally, not very well.

00:03:04.664 --> 00:03:11.114
So if not sleeping is bad, and sleeping makes you feel better and refreshed, then it clearly

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:17.954
plays an important role in our general wellbeing, even if we don’t know exactly what role that is.

00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:27.004
Before the 1950s, people used to think that the function of sleep was just for you to be

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:34.464
completely still, completely passive, with your brain almost on standby, not doing anything.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:41.944
While people didn’t know why this was important, they thought that a period of switching

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:48.214
off was important, because of course everyone knows that you feel better after sleeping.

00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:54.824
As scientists started to do more research into why we sleep, it became

00:03:54.824 --> 00:04:00.434
clear that the brain is far from switched off, there is actually a lot of

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:05.654
activity that is going on while we sleep, even though it may not look like it.

00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:10.974
If you see someone asleep, it certainly doesn’t seem like there’s a lot going

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:16.584
on - their eyes are closed, they aren’t moving, their heartbeat and breathing is slow.

00:04:17.354 --> 00:04:21.854
But beneath the surface, there’s a lot of activity happening.

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:28.044
While we don’t know exactly what function sleep plays, it’s now believed that the brain

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:34.394
is engaging in a number of different activities that are crucial for our quality of life.

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:40.648
While it’s hard to say exactly what sleep is doing just by analysing people sleeping,

00:04:40.908 --> 00:04:47.898
it’s easier to study the consequence of people not getting enough sleep and hypothesise,

00:04:48.128 --> 00:04:53.048
well, sleep must be doing something that stops people developing these problems.

00:04:54.318 --> 00:04:58.858
And as I’m sure you know, not getting enough sleep is linked to all manner

00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:04.148
of different negative health consequences, from heart problems to a risk

00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:09.858
of obesity, from a weakened immune system to depression and anxiety.

00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:14.408
It’s clear that we need to sleep to avoid these kinds of

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:19.898
health conditions, but scientists still don’t know exactly why.

00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:24.558
What we do have some idea about though, is what happens to

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:29.258
our bodies when we sleep, and the different stages of sleep.

00:05:30.378 --> 00:05:34.398
To an outside observer, it might seem like you just close your

00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:39.448
eyes and wake up several hours later, refreshed and re-energised.

00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:46.818
But our sleep is divided into two different categories of sleep, what’s called Rapid

00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:53.958
Eye Movement, or REM, sleep and non-REM sleep, and you can split this further to

00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:59.968
give four distinct stages of sleep, which are repeated throughout a normal night.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:07.738
The first stage of non-REM sleep is when you go from being awake to being asleep.

00:06:08.658 --> 00:06:16.148
This normally isn’t an immediate process, you feel yourself fall towards sleep, and you drift off.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:21.618
What’s happening to your body is that your brain is beginning to slow

00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:27.388
down, your muscles are starting to relax, and your eyes stop moving.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.828
This part normally lasts less than 5 minutes.

00:06:33.178 --> 00:06:38.248
This isn’t that it takes everyone only 5 minutes from when they start trying

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:43.018
to go to sleep to falling asleep, for lots of people it takes a lot longer,

00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:48.898
but this period of actually falling asleep typically takes around 5 minutes.

00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:57.348
The second stage of non-REM sleep is the period of light sleep before you start to sleep deeply.

00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:03.578
By this time your heartbeat and your breathing have slowed, your muscles

00:07:03.738 --> 00:07:08.658
have relaxed even more, and your eyes have completely stopped moving.

00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:15.708
This stage normally lasts about an hour, and is the longest of the four stages of sleep.

00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:21.958
Then it’s on to stage 3, we’re still in the non-REM type here,

00:07:22.218 --> 00:07:27.428
and this is when everything slows to its slowest during the night.

00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:33.528
It’s thought to be the part when you are most deeply asleep, it’s hardest to wake

00:07:33.528 --> 00:07:39.198
you, and if you are woken up during this part you won’t feel particularly refreshed.

00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:44.448
This stage only lasts for around 20 minutes in general.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:51.638
The final stage of sleep, stage 4, is REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.

00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:56.238
If you’ve been adding up the numbers now, this normally

00:07:56.238 --> 00:07:59.678
happens around 90 minutes after you fall asleep.

00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:06.058
Even though your eyes are still closed and you’re still very much asleep, your brain activity

00:08:06.058 --> 00:08:11.968
starts increasing again, and your eyes move around quickly, hence the name, Rapid Eye Movement.

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:17.848
Your breathing becomes faster and less regular, and your muscles

00:08:17.858 --> 00:08:22.208
start to tighten, to be almost paralysed, unable to move.

00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:26.828
It’s during this phase of sleep that we dream.

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:35.048
Now, dreaming is too large a subject to cram into this one episode, so I think

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:40.038
we’ll need to do another episode just on dreaming, but here’s an overview

00:08:40.238 --> 00:08:44.858
of some of the theories about why we dream, and what happens when we dream.

00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:51.158
If sleep is still mysterious to us, dreaming is even more so.

00:08:52.258 --> 00:08:56.218
There’s no obvious biological reason why we dream,

00:08:56.848 --> 00:09:00.608
and it's a magical experience that all humans share.

00:09:01.848 --> 00:09:05.518
The current theories about why we dream are mainly based

00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:09.998
around the fact that it helps us process our emotions.

00:09:11.228 --> 00:09:18.798
Throughout history people have tried to interpret their dreams, and while most people now don’t

00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:24.978
believe that our dreams show us what’s going to happen in the future, they are a way of processing

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:31.598
what has happened during the day, and often reflect emotions that we felt during that day.

00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:37.758
It’s thought that dreams happen because the brain creates random

00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:43.758
electrical activity, and the analytical part of our brain, the part that

00:09:43.808 --> 00:09:49.518
processes and interprets information, tries to process what’s going on.

00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:56.548
We don't normally have any control over how our brains interpret this activity,

00:09:57.018 --> 00:10:02.108
which is why you can’t control what you want to dream about, it just happens.

00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:09.728
In a normal night’s sleep of between 7 and 9 hours we normally spend around 2 hours

00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:16.148
dreaming, but the most intense periods of the dream might only take a few minutes, with

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:23.008
the most vivid and longest dreams normally taking place at the very end of our sleep,

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:29.388
which is why we often wake up in the morning from a dream and it seems very real.

00:10:30.388 --> 00:10:35.948
Indeed, unless you wake up immediately after a dream, it’s normally forgotten.

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:42.078
95% of dreams are believed to be forgotten, and there are

00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:45.768
some people who say that they never remember any dreams.

00:10:47.048 --> 00:10:53.268
So, dreams are complicated, both evolutionarily speaking why we dream, if

00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:58.608
indeed there is an evolutionary reason, and what actually happens when we dream.

00:10:59.688 --> 00:11:05.438
One thing you might be left wondering though is how do we know when we need to go to sleep?

00:11:06.338 --> 00:11:10.928
This is actually something that we do know, unlike why we sleep or why we dream.

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:15.028
Our bodies regulate our sleep in two ways.

00:11:15.428 --> 00:11:17.958
Firstly, something called homeostasis.

00:11:18.608 --> 00:11:25.078
It’s a technical term, but it’s essentially an internal timer on how long we’ve been awake for.

00:11:26.088 --> 00:11:29.688
As you know, the longer you’ve been awake, the more you need to go to sleep.

00:11:30.448 --> 00:11:35.098
Our bodies need a certain amount of sleep, depending on factors like our age,

00:11:35.408 --> 00:11:40.888
and homeostasis is what makes us feel tired if we haven’t slept enough, and

00:11:41.138 --> 00:11:46.568
eventually what sends our bodies to sleep if we are seriously sleep deprived.

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:51.898
The other factor that regulates our sleep is the circadian

00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:55.898
alerting system, your body’s daily biological clock.

00:11:57.078 --> 00:12:01.358
Our bodies are naturally programmed to be awake when it’s light

00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:06.388
outside, and we fall asleep more naturally when it’s dark outside.

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:14.548
There are, of course, lots of things that can alter this - from stimulants like caffeine and

00:12:14.558 --> 00:12:21.528
cigarettes to being exposed to light in the night time, there are lots of things that can

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:28.518
disrupt our body’s natural rhythms, but we are hardwired, we are biologically programmed,

00:12:28.688 --> 00:12:34.898
to feel tired at certain times of the day, and having a sleep pattern that’s radically

00:12:34.908 --> 00:12:40.718
different to this, for example working night shifts, can be very difficult to adjust to.

00:12:41.818 --> 00:12:46.308
We’re going to end this episode with an idea about sleep that I became

00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:51.258
really interested in when I was a student, and it’s the concept of polyphasic

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:56.488
sleep, of sleeping multiple times during the day, for short periods.

00:12:58.018 --> 00:13:03.218
As I said at the start of the episode, humans generally sleep all in one go.

00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:09.138
Other animals, such as dogs, sleep in smaller batches throughout the day.

00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:14.948
But what would happen if we slept in small batches, like dogs do?

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:20.808
Indeed, this isn’t just a theory, it’s not just a ‘what if’ situation.

00:13:21.178 --> 00:13:23.248
It’s called polyphasic sleep.

00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:28.418
There are some famous people from history who were reportedly

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:33.718
polyphasic sleepers, and the people who do it today claim that it’s

00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:39.128
an incredibly liberating life change, and it has a devoted following.

00:13:40.128 --> 00:13:45.858
The idea is that you can sleep for short periods of time throughout the day, meaning you

00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:51.198
end up sleeping a lot less than you would do if you slept just once during the night.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:57.028
To give you a working example, one idea of polyphasic sleep is

00:13:57.028 --> 00:14:02.118
to sleep once every 4 hours, but only for 20 minutes at a time.

00:14:02.928 --> 00:14:09.648
This means that you end up sleeping for just 120 minutes, 2 hours, during every 24

00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:14.798
hour period, which obviously means that you have a lot more time to do other things.

00:14:16.268 --> 00:14:21.528
Proponents of polyphasic sleep point at people such as Napoleon, Leonardo

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:27.048
Da Vinci, and Nikolas Tesla, who were all supposed polyphasic sleepers.

00:14:28.188 --> 00:14:34.428
The theory goes that if you get into the rhythm of sleeping polyphasically you can go to sleep

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:40.968
immediately, and wake up feeling refreshed 20 minutes later, then have another 4 hours of being

00:14:40.968 --> 00:14:48.248
awake, then sleep again, wake up feeling refreshed, and this just goes on forever, in perpetuity.

00:14:49.098 --> 00:14:54.858
Although it’s quite an interesting concept, especially for those of us who think that there are

00:14:55.078 --> 00:15:02.928
never enough hours in the day, most serious sleep scientists are pretty wary of this, and there

00:15:02.938 --> 00:15:08.838
haven’t been any long term studies on the health effects of living and sleeping in this way.

00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:17.228
Indeed, if you end up having 6 more waking hours every day but you drop dead 20 years

00:15:17.278 --> 00:15:23.278
earlier, I wonder how many people would still be interested in becoming polyphasic sleepers.

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:29.938
OK then, that is it for this little look at How We Sleep.

00:15:30.508 --> 00:15:35.628
I hope it’s been an interesting one, that it’s shone a little light onto this crucial

00:15:35.628 --> 00:15:40.748
part of being a human, although it’s clear that there is a lot that we still don’t know.

00:15:42.068 --> 00:15:45.498
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:47.548
Do you remember your dreams?

00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:51.288
Have you ever dreamt in English, or in a foreign language?

00:15:51.808 --> 00:15:53.608
Have you tried polyphasic sleep?

00:15:54.308 --> 00:15:55.028
I’d love to know.

00:15:55.338 --> 00:16:01.518
The place to go for all of that is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com

00:16:02.578 --> 00:16:07.258
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

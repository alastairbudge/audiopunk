Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.050
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.092
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:25.222
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:29.022
talking about a place you probably know: the office.

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:34.442
Perhaps you’re on your way to an office now, perhaps you’re on the way back

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:38.802
after a long day at work, perhaps you’re even listening to this episode

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:43.452
while sitting at your desk at an office, hoping your boss doesn’t see you.

00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:47.012
Perhaps you don’t work in an office, and never have.

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:52.292
If so, you’re in a minority, as literally billions of

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.652
people around the world go to an office every single day.

00:00:56.032 --> 00:01:02.622
So in this episode we are going to explore the question of why and how  the modern

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:07.602
office was created, and look at some of the developments that led us to this place.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.860
OK then, the creation of the modern office.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:24.020
If you were to travel back in time, let’s say to 500 years ago, find someone from the year 1523 and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.770
tell them about life in 2023, no doubt they would have lots of observations, plenty of questions.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.090
You wear funny clothes, you have huge objects that fly in the sky, you

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.270
all seem to live so long, and you live in tall buildings in big cities.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.600
And what do you do all day?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.820
You get in something you call a car, or maybe you take a bus

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.310
with other people, maybe you walk or you get on a bicycle.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.520
And you go to sit in a big room with other people all day long, looking at something

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.230
you call a computer, stopping only to sit around a table and talk to other people.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.090
And you do this for…40 years?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.140
Almost all of your adult life?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.280
What is this mysterious place you go to all day, what do you do there, and…why?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.360
Of course, this person from 1523 would be no stranger to the concept of work, they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.240
might even spend more of their lives working than you, but the idea of a dedicated

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.240
indoor space for working, the so-called “office”, would be most unfamiliar to them.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.360
So, in this episode we’re going to explore how we got to this point, how the idea of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.250
an office has developed over the years, and what lies ahead for how and where we work.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.700
If you look up the term “office” in a dictionary, you’ll find a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.300
definition that’s something like this: “a room, set of rooms, or building

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.290
used as a place for commercial, professional, or bureaucratic work.”

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.510
The key terms there are those three adjectives: commercial, professional or bureaucratic.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.580
If you are not involved in this sort of work, an office is something you probably don’t need.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.700
And for our person in 1523, and pretty much any period in history until relatively recently,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.250
the vast majority of the population were simply not involved with this sort of work.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.160
There were some notable exceptions - Chinese imperial bureaucrats or Medieval monks

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.660
in Europe, for example, but the nature of work for most people was manual: growing or

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.790
making stuff with their hands, or buying and selling things to other people directly.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.620
Monks might have had a separate room or cubicle where they would copy religious texts at a desk,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.090
but this was independent, solitary, work; there was little need for any kind of collaborative space.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.140
And even for people involved in more commercial activities, buying and selling goods,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.400
their place or work would have typically been, in Europe at least, also where they lived.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.520
The first real “offices”, in the sense of a large space dedicated to bureaucratic work,

00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:36.030
are thought to have arrived on the scene in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.740
What is thought to be the first large office was built in

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.940
1726 in London, and was called The Old Admiralty Office.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.992
If you recognise the word “Admiralty” there, you might be able to guess what it was used for.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.726
An admiral is the most senior naval officer in the army.

00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:03.514
it’s the person who commands the navy.

00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:09.544
So, The Old Admiralty Office was the headquarters of the British Navy.

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:16.704
And this word, combined with the date that this was built, 1726, gives

00:05:16.744 --> 00:05:22.114
us some indication about why this new “office” might have been required.

00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:28.524
It was just as the British Empire was starting, as British ships sailed around the

00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:34.364
world looking for new territories, new people to colonise, new dominions to rule over.

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:40.774
We’ll skip over any discussion of the morality of this, but what is

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:46.764
undeniable is that it was a very large, gargantuan, sprawling, organisation.

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:51.974
Lots of people were involved, information needed to be shared,

00:05:52.244 --> 00:05:56.244
documents written, decisions to be made, orders to be given.

00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:01.824
There needed to be a centralised physical location where all of this

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:07.744
would take place, and this was The Old Admiralty Office in central London.

00:06:09.254 --> 00:06:14.214
Strangely enough, the office is still standing, it’s used by the British government

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:20.244
as the headquarters of the Department of International Trade, so funnily enough not

00:06:20.374 --> 00:06:25.804
all that much has changed in the almost 300 years since the building was first used.

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:32.474
Shortly afterwards, The East India Company, which you can learn about in episode

00:06:32.474 --> 00:06:39.084
number 279, by the way, The East India Company opened its own dedicated office in

00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:44.584
the City of London, using it as a base to manage the huge bureaucracy involved with

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:49.394
essentially governing an entire country, India, from thousands of kilometres away.

00:06:50.354 --> 00:06:54.324
So, what was actually happening in these early offices?

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.224
Well, paperwork, essentially.

00:06:57.744 --> 00:07:00.924
Writing and copying letters, all by hand.

00:07:01.764 --> 00:07:07.484
It must have been deadly boring, and there is actually plenty of evidence of early

00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:12.714
office workers feeling exactly the same boredom and tedium that people do today.

00:07:14.124 --> 00:07:19.754
Here’s a short poem from an East India Company employee from 1852:

00:07:21.154 --> 00:07:23.854
“From twelve to one, think what’s to be done;

00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:26.884
From one to two, find nothing to do;

00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:30.214
From two to three, think it will be

00:07:30.694 --> 00:07:32.804
A great bore to stay till four”

00:07:34.144 --> 00:07:40.974
And here’s another quote, again from an East India Company employee in a letter complaining about

00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:48.804
his job: "Thirty years I have served the Philistines, and my neck is not subdued to the yoke.

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:53.044
You don't know how wearisome it is to breathe the

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:58.054
air of four pent walls without relief day after day."

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:05.764
So, if you have had a bad day at work and you write a cross email to your colleague or your

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:11.664
partner about how you can’t take it any more and you’re going to quit, well you will be

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:17.014
following in a tradition that dates back as long as anyone has ever worked in an office.

00:08:18.454 --> 00:08:23.704
And in terms of the first 150 years or so of “office life”, of the

00:08:23.914 --> 00:08:29.384
existence of the office, the actual tasks required in an office were

00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:34.174
fairly similar and straightforward: writing letters, that was it, mostly.

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:40.304
But in the late 19th century, there was a technological development that would

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:45.594
revolutionise office life and would bring many more people into the office.

00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:51.394
Whether this was for better or worse, well you can be the judge of that.

00:08:52.764 --> 00:08:57.320
In 1868, an American inventor called Christopher

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.817
Latham Sholes patented a machine for typing on paper.

00:09:02.497 --> 00:09:04.477
He had invented the typewriter.

00:09:05.897 --> 00:09:10.737
The effect of this was to greatly increase the speed at which letters could be written,

00:09:11.277 --> 00:09:17.237
and in so doing, greatly increase the number of letters being sent, therefore the number

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:22.537
of letters that needed to be responded to, essentially ballooning the bureaucratic class.

00:09:24.087 --> 00:09:27.967
The office became a place dominated by the tapping of

00:09:28.137 --> 00:09:31.737
typewriters, as workers spent their days typing letters.

00:09:33.137 --> 00:09:38.257
The typewriter also revolutionised the demographic makeup of the office.

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:45.877
Up until then, so we’re talking about the late 19th century, the office had been dominated

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:54.077
by men, with only 2.5% of the office workforce in the United States being female in 1870.

00:09:55.615 --> 00:10:01.225
By 1930, over half of American office workers were female, reflecting

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:05.065
the number of women who were employed tapping away on the typewriters.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:11.392
Although you can look at the typewriter and conclude that it was something of

00:10:11.392 --> 00:10:17.252
a slavemaster to tens of millions of women over the years, with offices being

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:21.842
sexist places where women were thought capable of nothing more than mindless

00:10:22.092 --> 00:10:28.342
bureaucratic work, it did give women a socially acceptable shot at independence.

00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:33.501
Up until the invention of the typewriter, employment options

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:38.091
for women in places like the US and the UK were pretty limited.

00:10:39.564 --> 00:10:44.164
Becoming a typist was a respectable job that a well-educated

00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:47.424
woman could do without damaging her marriage prospects.

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:54.384
Before this, really the only other socially acceptable option for an educated

00:10:54.384 --> 00:11:00.084
woman, in the UK at least, was to become a governess, a sort of live-in teacher.

00:11:01.314 --> 00:11:06.444
So, strangely enough, the typewriter did offer new opportunities to women who

00:11:06.444 --> 00:11:10.884
were forced to live in a society that still considered them second-class citizens.

00:11:12.444 --> 00:11:16.324
Right, so the typewriter was invented in the late 19th century.

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:20.644
It made written communication much faster, with some estimates

00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:25.626
having it tripling productivity of workers versus handwritten notes.

00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:32.284
Of course, this didn’t mean that people did one third as much work, they worked for

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:37.504
one third of the amount of time, or the number of office employees shrunk by a third.

00:11:38.484 --> 00:11:39.294
Quite the opposite.

00:11:39.874 --> 00:11:44.714
It resulted in an increase in bureaucracy, more letters needing to be

00:11:44.714 --> 00:11:49.244
written, and more people spending their days working at the office.

00:11:50.734 --> 00:11:56.014
As to the layout of the typical office of the era of the typewriter, well,

00:11:56.274 --> 00:12:02.024
this will no doubt be familiar to fans of TV series from this era, and perhaps

00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:05.374
if you are one of our older listeners, you might remember this era yourself.

00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:12.134
Offices were typically divided into large central areas, more like a factory floor,

00:12:12.484 --> 00:12:17.044
where the mainly female secretarial work was done  - the typing of letters, essentially.

00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:21.794
And then smaller, private offices where the men worked.

00:12:22.724 --> 00:12:27.844
And as the office class continued to grow, and there was an increasing

00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:32.864
scientific interest, we could say, in the efficiency of offices, there were

00:12:32.864 --> 00:12:37.844
some radical new proposals about how these spaces should be structured.

00:12:39.394 --> 00:12:43.904
Probably the most influential came in 1964, with an

00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:47.164
invention from the furniture company Herman Miller.

00:12:48.044 --> 00:12:53.134
Now, you might know the name Herman Miller from its very expensive office chairs,

00:12:53.504 --> 00:12:59.534
but its revolutionary invention was not a chair, or at least it was not only a chair.

00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:07.164
Two designers from Herman Miller had looked at how modern offices were set up, with

00:13:07.164 --> 00:13:12.024
their big factory-like banks of workers in the middle, they had realised that work

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:18.004
was increasingly knowledge work, it required thought and some level of creativity,

00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:24.654
and decided that the set-up of modern offices wasn’t conducive to this kind of work.

00:13:25.624 --> 00:13:29.824
So, they designed something called “The Action Office”.

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:37.224
The Action Office was essentially a series of desks and pieces of furniture that got a worker

00:13:37.424 --> 00:13:43.724
moving around, physically doing stuff, rather than sitting at one simple desk all day long.

00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:51.794
The idea was to give the worker more freedom of expression, and thus lead to productivity increases.

00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:58.928
Although it was well-received by the design community, office bosses didn’t like it.

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:02.918
It was too expensive and took up too much space.

00:14:04.078 --> 00:14:08.588
The designers went back to the drawing board, taking the best parts from “The

00:14:08.628 --> 00:14:14.258
Action Office”, and they came up with “The Action Office II”, the revamped model.

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:19.498
The Action Office II was similar in many ways, but it

00:14:19.498 --> 00:14:23.218
was cheaper and packed workers more closely together.

00:14:24.618 --> 00:14:28.738
You might be able to imagine what The Action Office II would come to be called.

00:14:29.528 --> 00:14:35.028
It was the office cubicle, the set of moveable low walls that

00:14:35.028 --> 00:14:39.338
creates a kind of mini private office within a larger room.

00:14:40.778 --> 00:14:48.008
It sold like hotcakes, it was incredibly popular, and this “cubicle” format became the

00:14:48.048 --> 00:14:54.338
dominant form of office design in most American offices, and in many offices around the world.

00:14:55.588 --> 00:15:00.258
It was loved by bosses, because it was cheap and meant that workers could be

00:15:00.298 --> 00:15:05.668
packed into relatively small spaces, while still having some sense of privacy.

00:15:06.778 --> 00:15:13.318
And as for workers, well, perhaps if you work or have worked in a cubicle you’ll have your

00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:19.568
own idea about whether it’s a pleasant experience or not, but cubicle-based offices are often

00:15:19.598 --> 00:15:26.908
criticised as being hostile and impersonal work environments, factories pretending to be offices.

00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:33.145
But as more and more offices subscribed to this “cubicle” design, there were

00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:39.475
differing proposals for alternatives, other visions of how offices could be arranged.

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:46.205
Cubicles had been popular because they were cheap ways of creating semi-private offices

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:53.305
for everyone, but they stood criticised of creating unnecessary walls, barriers, between

00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:59.985
employees, with one architect going so far as to call them “fascist and totalitarian”.

00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:03.365
So, what was the alternative?

00:16:04.175 --> 00:16:09.215
Well, tearing down the walls, returning to something more akin to a

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:15.725
factory-style set-up of banks of desks, workers sitting side by side, able

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:20.225
to see one another and talk to each other without anything in the way.

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:27.545
The name for this was the “open-plan office”, and the logic for laying out offices in

00:16:27.545 --> 00:16:33.375
this way was to increase communication between employees, to facilitate collaboration,

00:16:33.765 --> 00:16:39.065
to enable better decisions, and ultimately to make workers more productive.

00:16:40.445 --> 00:16:46.335
These open-plan offices were first proposed, in fact, shortly after the arrival

00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:51.085
of the cubicles, but they too were not without their fair share of critics.

00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:56.905
If you work or have worked in an open-plan office, no doubt

00:16:56.905 --> 00:17:00.375
you’ll be familiar with some of the criticisms of this set-up.

00:17:01.505 --> 00:17:06.795
Big banks of desks with no partitions between people, you can see everyone else,

00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:12.355
overhear conversations, people can see your computer screen, you have no privacy.

00:17:13.835 --> 00:17:19.635
Of course, this is the point, the entire idea is to break down the barriers,

00:17:20.065 --> 00:17:25.455
but half a century after the invention, or at least the popularisation of the

00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:30.385
open-plan office, there are plenty of questions about whether it actually works.

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:34.795
Is it a better set-up, are employees more productive,

00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:38.135
do they collaborate more in an open-plan office?

00:17:39.415 --> 00:17:42.795
As you might imagine, there has been plenty of research into this.

00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:46.245
And the results are often surprising.

00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:51.655
Strangely enough, there was one study done that suggested that people

00:17:51.665 --> 00:17:57.545
working in open-plan offices have 70% fewer face-to-face interactions

00:17:57.815 --> 00:18:01.535
than in offices where workers work in their own private areas.

00:18:03.023 --> 00:18:08.263
This is probably exactly the opposite of what you would think would happen, as

00:18:08.543 --> 00:18:13.623
if you can see someone it’s much easier to lean over and ask them a question, but

00:18:13.823 --> 00:18:18.893
what this survey found is that open-plan offices actually mean that people tend to

00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:25.103
send instant messages or emails more if they can see someone than if they can’t.

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:29.646
Perhaps you can recognise this in your own behaviour.

00:18:30.522 --> 00:18:36.216
I certainly can with mine, as the offices I’ve worked in have almost always been open plan,

00:18:36.746 --> 00:18:43.246
and with instant messaging and email, if I can see someone is concentrating hard it’s easier

00:18:43.486 --> 00:18:48.536
to send them a message rather than go over and tap on their shoulder to ask them a question.

00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:54.696
In a cubicle or personal office environment, as you can’t see what the other person is

00:18:54.736 --> 00:19:01.316
doing, it’s much more common, so this study suggested, to physically go over to that person.

00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:08.476
So, somewhat counterintuitively, breaking down the physical walls puts up an

00:19:08.486 --> 00:19:14.476
imaginary wall, and it is worse for collaboration, according to this study at least.

00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:18.676
Right, this brings us to the modern day.

00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:23.396
Clearly, the internet and software have meant that many jobs that

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:27.996
would previously have required people to go into offices now can be

00:19:27.996 --> 00:19:32.646
done without an office: from home, from a coffee shop, from anywhere.

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:39.006
If you worked in an office in 2020, you probably only did so for

00:19:39.006 --> 00:19:42.636
a few months before you were sent home to see this for yourself.

00:19:43.966 --> 00:19:49.386
All of a sudden, offices lay empty, kitchen tables or spare bedrooms

00:19:49.386 --> 00:19:54.716
became “offices”, and remote work became the norm, not the exception.

00:19:56.186 --> 00:20:03.406
When it seemed clear that, yes, most companies could function like this without imploding, and

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:09.486
obviously it is cheaper to not pay for every employee to sit at an office, there were a plethora of

00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:15.826
articles announcing the “death of the office”, imagining a world where everyone worked from home.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.320
On one level, it sounded like it made sense.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.270
Many employees liked the flexibility of being able to work from home.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.830
Whether it was being able to spend more time with kids or on your own activities,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.010
given that you didn’t have to commute, or whether it was simply being able to be

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:40.750
in your own environment, clearly remote working was popular with many employees.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.880
What’s more, office space, especially in prime city centre locations, is really expensive.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.990
Even for a relatively small company, 100 people let’s say, office costs can easily

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.040
reach €100,000 a month in a city like London, so if this really was an unnecessary

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:11.160
expense, and people would prefer not to go to the office, well sure, the office was dead.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:17.610
But fast forward three years, as you’ll know, many companies have

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.780
gone the other way, forcing employees to come back to the office.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.050
No doubt you have seen headlines or videos about this, with bosses complaining about

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:33.720
workers being less productive, or simply not working when they are “working from

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.430
home”, and their company cultures suffering when everyone is in a different place.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.550
Now, this isn’t the place to comment on the extent to which this is true.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:51.260
I’ve worked in an office, and I’ve also worked remotely, both for other companies and for myself.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.010
I can see both arguments.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.100
If you’ve worked in an office, you’ve probably also worked remotely

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.500
over the past few years, so you no doubt have your own perspective

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.650
on your preference and how COVID affected your working environment.

00:22:07.853 --> 00:22:13.553
Bringing it back to the creation of the modern office, and the evolution of the place

00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:18.673
in which we work, the point to underline is that many companies are now opting for

00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:24.343
some sort of hybrid situation, allowing employees to work from home for a few days of

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:29.953
the week, while perhaps reducing the size of their office or turning it into more of a

00:22:30.093 --> 00:22:35.853
collaborative space rather than a place to come every day and sit to do independent work.

00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:42.633
Google searches for “hybrid working” increased by 500% between November

00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:47.893
2020, at the height of lockdowns in many countries, and February of

00:22:47.893 --> 00:22:52.483
2022, when employees were being called back to the office en masse.

00:22:53.943 --> 00:22:59.743
So, is this the future of the office, some mix of in-person working with the

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:03.853
flexibility of being able to work from home, or from anywhere in the world?

00:23:04.923 --> 00:23:05.323
Who knows.

00:23:06.773 --> 00:23:12.833
People have been working in offices for almost 300 years now, and the nature of what

00:23:12.863 --> 00:23:18.723
actually happens in an office, and how it should be structured, has been changing ever since.

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:25.213
The final thing I’ll say is that, were I a betting man, I’d certainly put money

00:23:25.383 --> 00:23:30.223
on the office of the future looking very different from any office of today.

00:23:32.653 --> 00:23:37.633
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Creation Of The Modern Office.

00:23:38.123 --> 00:23:44.113
I hope it's been an interesting one, and whether you are a die-hard cubicle lover, a devotee

00:23:44.113 --> 00:23:48.943
of the open-plan office, or you have never spent a day of your life working in an office,

00:23:49.193 --> 00:23:54.183
well, I hope this episode gave you a bit of background about how we got to this situation.

00:23:55.313 --> 00:23:58.443
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:01.663
What do you think the office of the future will look like?

00:24:02.153 --> 00:24:06.553
What do you like or dislike about cubicles or open plan offices?

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:10.703
What is the best and worst office you have ever worked in?

00:24:11.623 --> 00:24:14.573
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

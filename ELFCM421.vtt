Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.740
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.880
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.790
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about hippies and the hippy movement.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.650
It was one of the defining countercultural movements in the post-war period, with hundreds

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.250
of thousands of young people rejecting mainstream society and opting for something different.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.589
And in today’s episode we are going to explore it in detail.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.780
We’ll look at some of the factors that led to the hippy movement, how it developed

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.120
and then largely disappeared, and ask ourselves what lasting impact it left.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.640
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.530
The American Dream is a powerful force.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.470
It's something that has attracted hundreds of millions of people,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.990
perhaps even billions, pulled them into the United States.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.450
For people outside the US, it held the promise of a new start in the land of opportunity.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.120
And even for those in the US, the proposal of the American Dream was and still is an

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.419
alluring one: work hard, do the right thing, and you’ll be able to live a good life.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:42.950
But starting in the 1960s, there was a growing section of American youth that rejected

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.780
it, or at least rejected the traditional, mainstream, vision of the American dream.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.600
To these young people, the conventional view of the American Dream, a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.910
stable 9-5 job, a house in the suburbs, a car, a trip to the movies on a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.199
Saturday night, this did not represent their vision of “a life well lived”.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.790
Instead of houses in the suburbs, they lived in shared

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.620
accommodation in cities or travelled around the country in buses.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.010
Instead of disposable razors and cheap deodorant, they

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.660
grew their hair long and said no to the Old Spice.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.240
Instead of Sunday church, they practised Eastern spirituality.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.960
Instead of wearing tailored suits, they wore tie-dye t-shirts and bell-bottomed trousers.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.380
Instead of coffee on the commute to work, they took LSD and congregated in parks.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.870
These young people were, of course, what would come to be called hippies, and would form part

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.380
of a movement that would define a generation and leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.750
Now, as to the question of where the hippy movement came from, the prevailing opinion is that it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.320
is exclusively American, but there is an alternative view that its roots can actually be traced

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.786
back to something called Wandervogel, which was a German movement that started in the 1890s.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.000
Wandervogel translates as “wandering bird”, and this movement was all about rebelling

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.400
against industrialization and instead going and immersing yourself in nature.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.960
The movement was outlawed in 1933 by the Nazis, but

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.880
by this time it had been going for almost 40 years.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.580
Plenty of Germans who had participated in this movement had emigrated to the United

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.769
States, settling there, making a life for themselves across the Atlantic, and sowing the

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:03.400
seeds for the American countercultural movement that would emerge several decades later.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.479
Now, when trying to understand any countercultural movement, it’s important to start

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.969
with a reminder of what mainstream culture was, to see what was being rejected.

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.320
Post-war America, as you will know, was a time of great economic prosperity.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.070
TVs, dishwashers, fast food, disposable razors, cars, drive-in movie

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.140
theatres, credit cards that would allow you to buy anything you wanted.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.170
All you needed to do was slot into the system, and your

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.350
slice of the American dream was there for the taking.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.720
For men, there were jobs aplenty, and good paying jobs at that.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.710
For women, generally speaking, life meant staying at home, cooking, cleaning and raising your kids.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.900
Understandably, for a generation of people who had lived through the Second

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.760
World War, and especially the slightly older generation who had lived through

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.890
the Great Depression AND the Second World War, this must have sounded wonderful.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.259
Finally, a peaceful, “good” life, no war, no hunger, life

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.560
seemed to be getting better with every year that passed.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.410
But for a certain segment of the younger generation, those who had never lived through this hardship

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.060
and only known this increasing prosperity, they were left asking themselves: what was it all for?

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.090
All the adverts on TV for new toothpaste or razor blades or tupperwares or

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.520
deodorants…life seemed aimed at getting people to buy more and more material goods.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.250
Was this really what life was all about?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.739
And in fact, was it really so peaceful and prosperous?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.909
The Korean War, which started in 1950, had been a disaster.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.400
The Cold War was starting to rev up.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.380
Sputnik was launched into space in 1957, the Cuban Revolution came a couple of years later.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.830
American families might be able to have a house in the suburbs and

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.750
afford a TV, but the world was undergoing rapid and confusing change.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.349
And starting even in the late 1940s, writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg had rejected

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.330
the traditional American path, the get an office job, a car and a house in the suburbs route.

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:47.200
Novels like On The Road and Howl talked about spiritual quests and about a rejection of conformity,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.549
and this kickstarted a literary movement that would come to be called The Beat Generation.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.550
The Beat Generation was all about rejecting the standard path, instead embracing

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.840
things like swearing, drug use and more liberal views towards sexuality.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:15.010
This was a precursor to the movement we’re talking about today; it laid the groundwork for the

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.710
countercultural “hippy” movement that would really come into full bloom a decade or so later.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.040
Now, the transition from the Beat Generation to the hippie

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.569
movement wasn't a sharp divide but more like a natural evolution.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.920
The Beats explored Eastern spirituality and got involved in civil rights activism, but they

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.330
were more introspective and literary; the hippies were more communal and action-oriented.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:53.259
And as the 1950s gave way to the 1960s, the political and social landscape became

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.070
more turbulent, fueled by events like the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.920
A new generation of young people emerged.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.959
This generation was inspired by the anti-authoritarian ethos of the Beats but was driven by

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:15.229
their own unique set of socio-political circumstances, by what was going on in their world.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.789
And they began to come together to form communities

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.750
that promoted peace, love, and an alternative lifestyle.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:31.450
In other words, to pursue their own interpretation of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness".

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:38.489
In practical terms, young people flocked to areas where other young people were congregating,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.770
which tended to be in cities: New York, Oregon, and most famously, San Francisco.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:52.240
They lived communally, grew their hair long, wore loose fitting clothes, lived frugally

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.029
and didn’t buy the latest consumer goods that were being advertised on billboards or on TV.

00:08:59.469 --> 00:09:04.969
Not only did most of these young people show absolutely no interest in getting a job

00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:10.640
and following a conventional path, they spent their days engaging in behaviour that was

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.149
deeply disapproved of by much of the older generation, their parents and grandparents.

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:20.990
Specifically, two fundamental behaviours of the hippy

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.870
movement were free love and a change of consciousness.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.924
Or to translate this into language that their parents might

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:32.780
have used, having lots of sex and taking lots of drugs.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.600
Now, I’m sure you knew this already, but there are a couple of

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.480
technological inventions that helped enable this behavioural shift.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:51.150
Firstly, on the free love question, the first female contraceptive pill was invented in 1960.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.379
For the first time in history, the pill gave women control, and

00:09:57.549 --> 00:10:01.680
allowed young women to have sex without the fear of getting pregnant.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:09.050
And on the “change of consciousness” question, the drug LSD had been

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:14.239
invented in 1938 and its hallucinogenic properties were discovered in

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.230
1943 when its creator accidentally took some and had a surreal experience.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.010
It spread quickly in 1960s America, especially with hippies,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.110
who used the drug to ascend to a higher state of consciousness.

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:37.680
Importantly, LSD wasn’t made illegal until 1966, so

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.130
people could take it without fear of criminal prosecution.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.819
Now, we’ll come back to touch on sex and drugs later, as they are clearly an important part of

00:10:47.969 --> 00:10:54.610
being a hippy, but first let’s talk about the kinds of people who were drawn to this hippy movement.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.730
It was primarily young Americans between the ages of 16 and 25 or so, and

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.660
people who came from middle class, so-called “good”, mainstream, families.

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:13.319
These were young people who would otherwise have slotted right

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.890
into the American system, but instead decided to reject it all.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.870
In fact, one of the criticisms of the hippy movement was

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.310
because of how unrepresentative it was of young Americans.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.079
It was a predominantly white, middle class movement.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.520
Young people from poorer backgrounds firstly had never tasted the

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.820
prosperity that the hippies were rejecting, and secondly they didn’t

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.510
have the kind of economic safety net to fall back on if it was required.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.789
Middle class kids did.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.310
They might have some money to get them started in San Francisco, or their parents

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.220
might send them some money every month to tide them over, so not having any kind

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.830
of paid employment wasn’t an issue; the bank of mum and dad would sort it out.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.420
For people from a poorer background, they didn’t have this luxury,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.580
therefore they were less likely to become a hippy in the first place.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.969
So, moving on, what did these people believe?

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:19.430
What were the fundamental tenets of being a hippy?

00:12:19.911 --> 00:12:22.530
What was the ideology behind the movement?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.940
Although there was a wide variety of beliefs, the

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.710
overarching ideology was about peace, love, and freedom.

00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:38.340
Peace was about peace on a domestic and international level.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.280
It meant anti-war activism, especially towards the Vietnam War.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.649
Importantly, it meant non-violent resistance, a kind of resistance

00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:54.969
heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism and Hinduism.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:03.839
Love meant universal and unconditional love, that humans should love other humans regardless

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.890
of who they were, where they came from, what they believed or what colour their skin was.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.690
This was manifested through communal living and shared experiences, and of

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.699
course sexual activity that their parents might have considered immoral.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.060
And finally came Freedom.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.300
This freedom was ultimately about having the freedom to choose how you lived your life:

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:35.509
what clothes you wore, what music you listened to, who you shared your bed with, what drugs

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:41.660
you took, and ultimately, the freedom to live your life in whatever manner you so chose.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:48.920
Peace, love, and freedom - it’s not hard, if you ask me, to understand the attraction

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.860
of these principles, and as more and more people heard about the hippy movement, more

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.570
and more people gravitated towards the cities and towns where hippies congregated.

00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:06.790
On top of this, there were several large events that served as important catalysts,

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:12.240
reasons for people to travel to a city like San Francisco, to taste communal living.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.420
And many never left, or at least didn’t leave for several years.

00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:24.546
The first official large gathering came in January of 1967.

00:14:25.556 --> 00:14:29.356
It was something called the "Human Be-In" which attracted

00:14:29.356 --> 00:14:33.416
somewhere between 20 and 30 thousand people to San Francisco

00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:41.137
Later on that year, the summer of 1967 would come to be known as The Summer of Love,

00:14:41.677 --> 00:14:47.227
and involved an estimated 100,000 people descending on the city of San Francisco.

00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:54.757
And a couple of years later, in 1969, there was the legendary Woodstock Festival, which

00:14:54.757 --> 00:15:00.497
was attended by 400,000 people, who were entertained by some of the most famous musicians

00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:06.857
of the era: Jimmy Hendrix, Santana, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Grateful Dead.

00:15:08.281 --> 00:15:15.501
By this time, hippie culture was, debatably, not quite so counterculture as it had once been.

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:22.041
If literally hundreds of thousands of people were in the same place, behaving

00:15:22.051 --> 00:15:26.851
in the same way, wearing the same clothes, and all professing to be different,

00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:33.681
critics took the opportunity to point out that it wasn’t so alternative after all.

00:15:35.531 --> 00:15:40.851
And not so long after Woodstock Festival, the so-called “pinnacle” of the hippy

00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:46.231
movement, the hippie lifestyle was starting to become somewhat less viable.

00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:55.171
In the 1970s the US economy started to experience high inflation and high unemployment, meaning

00:15:55.181 --> 00:16:01.471
that the bohemian lifestyle that hippies had enjoyed during the boom years became somewhat harder.

00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:09.531
Everyday goods became more expensive, property prices and rents increased, and there was a

00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:15.161
decreasing tolerance from the general public towards people who were considered to be scroungers,

00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:21.271
people who were not contributing to mainstream society and were reliant on the generosity of others.

00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:28.431
When the going got tough, and the “alternative” to hippie society started to look more comfortable,

00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:36.171
many of these young people got jobs, settled down, and lived more conventional lives, slipping

00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:42.281
back into conventional American society just as they had slipped out several years before.

00:16:43.621 --> 00:16:48.221
But, and here’s another but, the counterpoint to those who suggest that the

00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:54.951
hippie movement fizzled out in the 1970s is just that it evolved and got stronger.

00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:01.631
The people who really bought into the hippie lifestyle were not the sort of people to be put off

00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:08.021
by a little hardship or to be attracted by the prospect of a 9-5 job and a house in the suburbs.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:12.761
There were new forms of communal living, new alternative

00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:15.051
communities and co-operatives that sprung up.

00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:20.171
The “fair weather” hippies, the hippies that were hippies when the times

00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:25.481
were good, were gone, and only the most dedicated, “true”, hippies remained.

00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:31.411
So, what was the hippy movement for, then, if it seemed to fizzle out?

00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:36.321
Was it a complete failure, did it really leave any lasting change?

00:17:37.261 --> 00:17:44.301
Ultimately, “mainstream” society today is not so radically different to how it was in the 1960s.

00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:49.911
I mean, Americans still tend to live in houses with their families and children, people

00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:54.491
go to work, they have jobs, they cut their hair, they don’t take drugs every day.

00:17:55.301 --> 00:17:59.901
Sure, on one level the hippy movement did not turn the entire country

00:18:00.051 --> 00:18:04.371
into hippies, it did not successfully end wars, it did not popularise

00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:09.501
communal living or free love or succeed in the legalisation of all drugs.

00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:15.671
But, there are plenty of important legacies that can be linked back to this period in

00:18:15.671 --> 00:18:21.681
time, legacies that can trace their roots back, albeit indirectly, to the hippy movement.

00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:27.301
There is, of course, the musical impact, but there’s also the anti-war

00:18:27.321 --> 00:18:32.481
activism, the environmentalism and veganism, and there’s the anti-consumerism.

00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:39.271
There’s also an increasingly liberal attitude towards recreational drugs, although of course

00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:44.381
you might disagree over whether this is a positive or a negative legacy of the hippy movement.

00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:49.881
So, to wrap things up, was the hippie movement just about

00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:55.301
sex, drugs, flowers, beards, long skirts and tie-dye t-shirts?

00:18:56.071 --> 00:19:01.281
To its critics, yes, it was an opportunity for spoiled middle class

00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:05.851
children to drop out of society and have some fun for a few years,

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.531
only to come running back to the mainstream when the going got tough.

00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:16.591
But, to others, arguably, it laid the foundations for many important changes in

00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:21.841
society that we are still benefiting from today, developments that might not have

00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:26.881
happened had it not been for the trailblazing nature of the hippies of the 1960s.

00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:35.191
So, to quote a recent article from GQ Magazine, maybe The Hippies Were Right After All.

00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:43.051
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration of hippies and hippy culture.

00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:46.581
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:47.261 --> 00:19:50.201
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:51.541
Were you a hippy?

00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:53.021
Were your parents hippies?

00:19:53.481 --> 00:19:56.541
How was hippy culture different and unique in your country?

00:19:57.181 --> 00:20:01.321
And what legacy do you think hippy culture left on the modern world?

00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:04.961
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

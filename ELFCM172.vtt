Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.916
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:21.486
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:29.776
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Curious Taste of British Food.

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:35.626
Now, when you hear the words “British Food” you might think of all sorts of things.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:37.186
Fish and chips.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.726
Large breakfasts.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:39.566
Roast Beef.

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:45.366
But British food probably isn’t at the top of your list of favourite foods.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:51.496
If you had one last meal on Earth, you might not choose to spend it at a British restaurant.

00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:58.806
So, in this episode we are going to talk about the history of British food, how the overall

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:04.726
tastes of British food have developed over the years, and the factors that have influenced it.

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:10.106
Perhaps you might come to the conclusion that it is now not nearly as

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:14.546
bad as people think it is, and even if you don’t come to that conclusion,

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:19.136
you’ll know a little bit more about why it tastes the way it does.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:24.636
Before we get right into today’s episode though, I want to remind you that you

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:29.526

00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:07.546
the most interesting place for curious people just like you to improve their English.

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:12.106
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:16.286
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:23.946
Right, let’s get started, and talk about The Curious Taste of British Food.

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:31.046
This podcast has many listeners from countries like Spain, France, and Italy.

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:35.266
Countries where British food doesn’t have a great reputation.

00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:41.116
For many people, it is considered dull, boring, without a taste.

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:49.186
A cuisine full of heavy food, meat covered in too much sauce, potatoes, and overcooked pasta.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:56.906
Now, British food is not completely innocent of those accusations, and there is a lot

00:02:56.946 --> 00:03:02.626
about the cuisine of the British isles that is rightly deserving of some criticism.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.156
But it is not as bad as you might think!

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:11.556
Whatever your view on British food, it is undeniable that it is a

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:16.916
curious mix, and is a product of a myriad of foreign influences.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:21.566
Some of which, as we will find out, have been changed so much

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:26.226
that it is hard to see any relation between them and the original.

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:31.656
To understand how British food got to where it is today, we need to

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:36.776
go on a little trip down memory lane, we need to go back almost a

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:41.816
thousand years to find the first major event that impacted British food.

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:45.993
And that was with the arrival of the Normans.

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:53.486
As you may know, in 1066 William the Conqueror sailed over from northern France to

00:03:53.506 --> 00:04:01.086
Britain, overcame the local Saxon king, King Harold, and became King William I of England.

00:04:02.296 --> 00:04:07.866
Although the Norman Conquest involved some brutal behaviour by the new King towards

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:13.386
the local people, the influence of the invasion on British cooking was a positive one.

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:20.306
The Normans had strong trade links with the southern Mediterranean, which in turn traded

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:26.066
with the middle east, and therefore there were some Persian influences in Norman cuisine.

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:30.806
The Normans also changed the meat that British people ate.

00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:38.386
Previously, the most popular meats were beef, lamb and mutton, the meat of sheep, and goat.

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:43.626
The Normans were also fans of pork and chicken, and these

00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:47.386
two meats started to find their way onto British tables.

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:54.046
Much of the more sophisticated cooking, the cooking involving exciting spices, was only

00:04:54.056 --> 00:04:59.856
available to the richest in society, but a clear tradition was established in Southern

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:05.606
England in particular of good and imaginative cooking amongst those who could afford it.

00:05:06.796 --> 00:05:12.756
Our next influential event is the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century when

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:17.446
King Henry VIII, who, if you can have seen his portrait, looks like the sort of

00:05:17.446 --> 00:05:22.626
person who might have enjoyed a large meal, took England out of the Church of Rome.

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:27.816
What has this possibly got to do with cooking, you might ask?

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:29.996
Well, quite a lot, actually.

00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:36.906
Before the break with Rome, the medieval Christian calendar contained almost 200 holy

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:42.326
days: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, as well as lots of other Christian holidays.

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:48.786
These were days when, because of the need for people to maintain a calm, contemplative

00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:54.896
and devout state of mind, you were not allowed to eat meat, as it was thought that it

00:05:54.916 --> 00:06:01.006
was likely to make you full of passion or strong feelings – sexual passion in particular.

00:06:01.902 --> 00:06:06.422
Instead of eating meat, those that could afford to would eat fish.

00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:14.652
Much of the inventiveness, of the invention of new dishes, had actually come from cooks in

00:06:14.652 --> 00:06:22.912
monasteries and aristocratic homes inventing clever, heavily flavoured or spiced recipes to

00:06:22.912 --> 00:06:29.002
make the fish that had to be eaten on the nearly 200 holy days of the year as tasty as possible.

00:06:30.242 --> 00:06:34.162
And one way in which cooks made these fish dishes more

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:38.592
interesting was through the clever use of herbs and spices.

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:44.022
The Reformation resulted in the banning of all monks and their

00:06:44.052 --> 00:06:47.832
monasteries – the dissolution of the monasteries as it was called.

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:54.452
Its main effect was to make Henry VIII much richer as he took the land for the

00:06:54.452 --> 00:07:00.502
crown - for himself - and distributed some to his favourite noblemen; but the effect

00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:06.642
on British cuisine was that the incentive to create interesting dishes disappeared.

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:13.432
You could now eat meat any day you wanted, so fish plummeted in popularity.

00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:18.722
At the same time, there was a general move against what were regarded

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:23.722
as dangerously foreign dishes, food with too much spice or taste,

00:07:24.072 --> 00:07:28.602
associated with the now forbidden Catholicism, from continental Europe.

00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:35.472
English food, plain, healthy and in its natural form was especially promoted.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:42.292
With no shortage of fertile land for animals, beef and mutton, often roasted or

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:47.872
boiled, became the main ingredient of the diet of wealthy people in the 16th century.

00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:53.622
The next stopping point on our British culinary journey comes with The

00:07:53.632 --> 00:07:59.302
Industrial Revolution, and the French Revolution shortly afterwards, in 1789.

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:04.742
What impact might these two events have had on the development of British food?

00:08:05.682 --> 00:08:09.402
Firstly, the Industrial Revolution brought significant

00:08:09.432 --> 00:08:12.802
advances in the way in which food could be produced.

00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:19.482
Not only did the amount of grain or potatoes that each hectare of land could produce increase by

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:26.182
several times, but also the technology that allowed food to be preserved improved dramatically.

00:08:27.002 --> 00:08:33.502
Indeed, the use of industrial methods in food production - from the development of nitrates

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:40.062
in fertiliser to freezing, drying and canning - was the beginning of mass food manufacture

00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:46.562
and was a mixed blessing for people in Britain, there were positive and negative aspects.

00:08:47.382 --> 00:08:53.152
For the British the invention of canning, of using a can to preserve food,

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:58.442
was the most influential invention, so here is a brief summary of how we

00:08:58.442 --> 00:09:03.782
learned to preserve food in cans, and the impact it had on British cuisine.

00:09:04.832 --> 00:09:09.102
The technology was initially devised by a Frenchman by the name of

00:09:09.102 --> 00:09:14.342
Appert in 1809, but quickly spread to Britain shortly afterwards.

00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:21.983
It was designed initially for military use, but before long became a vital way of dealing

00:09:21.983 --> 00:09:29.403
with food shortages; for example in the 1860s a cow disease in Britain was no reason for the

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:35.563
people to stop eating beef, as tinned beef could be imported from South America and Australia.

00:09:36.353 --> 00:09:43.345
American producers joined in - notably Heinz, the famous producer of baked beans - and by

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:50.086
the 1930s, cheap canned food had increased choice and convenience in all British homes.

00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:53.707
Food became cheaper, and would last for longer.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:58.056
The average British person could now eat meat more frequently

00:09:58.066 --> 00:10:01.866
than before, albeit highly processed meat out of a can.

00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:08.716
But another related result of the Industrial Revolution was that workers spent more time

00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:13.926
working in the factories, and there simply wasn’t a huge amount of time to cook properly.

00:10:14.706 --> 00:10:18.746
Combined with the fact that food was cheaper and didn’t really need to

00:10:18.746 --> 00:10:22.817
be prepared, many Brits just ended up eating quick, low quality food,

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:30.382
and a lot of the culture of preparing healthy, fresh food was forgotten.

00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:38.102
Indeed George Orwell, writing in 1937, said "We may find in the long

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:43.042
run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun."

00:10:43.922 --> 00:10:48.642
This was for the average person in Britain, but for the richest in

00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:52.922
society it was a different story directly after the French Revolution.

00:10:54.192 --> 00:10:59.332
As you will have heard if you have listened to the episode on the French Revolution, the French

00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:05.882
aristocracy suffered considerably during these bloody years; some, like the King, literally

00:11:06.012 --> 00:11:11.922
lost their heads to the guillotine, whilst the more lucky or wise ones fled the country.

00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:20.382
A considerable number of chefs employed by their aristocratic French masters fled to England and

00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:27.272
found work as chefs in large English houses, in the houses of the richest people in British society.

00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:33.522
These British people were not only the traditional aristocrats, the lords and

00:11:33.522 --> 00:11:39.752
ladies, but they were also joined by merchants and early industrialists who were

00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:45.342
the main beneficiaries of the enormous wealth created by the Industrial Revolution.

00:11:46.532 --> 00:11:54.162
For the richest in society, the arrival of so many expert French chefs and the British attraction

00:11:54.162 --> 00:12:00.702
to French high class cooking or, to use the correct French term, “haute cuisine”, meant that

00:12:00.702 --> 00:12:06.952
this wealthy or affluent landed class could display their wealth in the most fashionable

00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:13.872
way, through showing off the best French dishes at their lavish, extravagant dinner parties.

00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:20.582
The wealth that was creating so many newly rich people in this large, socially

00:12:20.582 --> 00:12:25.902
competitive upper middle-class meant that the display of wealth and sophistication

00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:31.072
may well have become even more important than the quality of the food itself.

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:37.925
If you visit any of these great houses that were owned by wealthy industrialists,

00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:42.402
many of which are now owned by the National Trust, so they are open to the public,

00:12:42.642 --> 00:12:48.462
you can often see examples of menus from this era, from this time in history.

00:12:49.392 --> 00:12:53.922
These menus are displayed in the grand, elegant dining rooms of the time.

00:12:54.522 --> 00:13:00.902
With industrialised methods of making beautiful China plates and cups, and expensive, silver

00:13:00.932 --> 00:13:08.202
cutlery, dinners must have been quite theatrical in their display of opulence - or extreme wealth.

00:13:09.602 --> 00:13:14.882
Fast forward now to the early 20th century and the eve of the 1st World

00:13:14.882 --> 00:13:19.572
War, which is probably just after the highest point of the British

00:13:19.592 --> 00:13:23.822
Empire and Britain's industrial power relative to other nations.

00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:30.772
The British Empire had a profound effect on what Britons eat - both through what early

00:13:30.782 --> 00:13:38.002
imperialists brought back from far-flung, from distant lands and, yet more significantly,

00:13:38.212 --> 00:13:43.792
from what immigrants from the former empire brought into the country after 1945.

00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:49.862
The first of these influences of empire on the national palate is

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:54.972
perhaps best illustrated by the story of the well known dish, curry.

00:13:56.042 --> 00:14:01.752
When you hear or see the word curry, you might think of it as an Indian dish.

00:14:02.502 --> 00:14:04.472
Well, you are half-right.

00:14:05.072 --> 00:14:09.752
The word curry is an Anglicised version of the word “kari”,

00:14:10.212 --> 00:14:14.562
from the Tamil word meaning a sauce that is added to rice.

00:14:15.442 --> 00:14:21.682
What had happened was that the British incomers to India, with their appetite for

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:27.082
meat and their desire to take their meat-eating habits into this foreign territory,

00:14:27.382 --> 00:14:33.322
took a liking to a combination of meat and this sauce that the locals ate.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:40.392
This new dish made their favourite beef or mutton much tastier through

00:14:40.502 --> 00:14:44.602
all the wonderful spices, especially the most important spices for

00:14:44.812 --> 00:14:49.802
curry, being coriander seeds, turmeric, cumin and chili peppers.

00:14:50.962 --> 00:14:56.162
By 1747 curry had appeared in a book of British recipes.

00:14:56.732 --> 00:15:00.182
By 1809 it was served in coffee houses in Britain.

00:15:00.962 --> 00:15:07.642
When the most influential cookery book of the Victorian era was published, by a lady called Mrs

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:15.112
Beeton in 1860, numerous curry recipes, sent to her by enthusiastic housewives, were included.

00:15:16.212 --> 00:15:21.972
This lady, Mrs Beeton, and her famous book, “Mrs Beeton's Book of Household

00:15:21.982 --> 00:15:26.872
Management”, had a powerful influence on British cooking for decades.

00:15:27.682 --> 00:15:31.562
It is thought that in the 1930s her book was still

00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:34.932
being used in almost half of the households in Britain.

00:15:36.012 --> 00:15:42.112
Many food historians, searching for the reasons that British food had become

00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:47.852
so unimaginative and boring, drew attention to the influence of Mrs Beeton.

00:15:49.232 --> 00:15:54.382
Her book was influential in setting out what was socially acceptable in what

00:15:54.382 --> 00:15:59.882
was often called polite society [meaning the higher classes of British society].

00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:06.277
In the minds of many generations of British women, and it being a patriarchal society,

00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:11.367
it was almost exclusively the women who were responsible for cooking, these strict

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:16.177
rules, combined with a strong fear of being seen to do the wrong thing and the

00:16:16.397 --> 00:16:22.517
resulting social stigma, led to a real decline in inventiveness of British cooking.

00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:29.077
It is important to remember that the Victorian era, that is Britain in the 19th Century,

00:16:29.237 --> 00:16:37.237
was an age of puritanism with its fear of pleasure and a particular emphasis on decorum

00:16:37.437 --> 00:16:43.407
- meaning a set of rules, or a code of behaviour - which needed to be kept strictly.

00:16:44.297 --> 00:16:47.507
How you run your house and what you serve at your dining

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:51.297
table were all part of decorum and social respectability.

00:16:52.157 --> 00:16:58.767
So, Mrs Beeton laid down the rules with this incredibly influential culinary guidebook.

00:16:59.327 --> 00:17:05.777
No to spices and other foreign flavourings - unless in the familiar creation of curry.

00:17:06.337 --> 00:17:11.597
Vegetables needed to be heavily cooked – boiled to death in fact - as

00:17:11.737 --> 00:17:15.837
she believed they could cause stomach problems if eaten raw.

00:17:16.897 --> 00:17:22.177
So, to summarise the potential causes of the decline in British cuisine by,

00:17:22.647 --> 00:17:29.687
say, 1930 they include an over-emphasis on display and decorum, the fear of any

00:17:29.687 --> 00:17:35.557
strong flavouring or spices, suspicion of foreign influences, the frequent use

00:17:35.717 --> 00:17:41.627
of tinned food and the resulting forgetting of how to prepare good, fresh food.

00:17:42.847 --> 00:17:46.947
The Second World War brought with it an additional factor which would

00:17:46.957 --> 00:17:52.297
mark British eating for decades afterwards: austerity and food rationing,

00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:56.117
meaning limits being placed on what food you were allowed to buy.

00:17:57.247 --> 00:18:06.037
With food rationing in place from 1939 until 1953, a whole generation of people grew up with war

00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:12.787
time habits of frugality – or, to put it another way, the habit of living simply and cheaply.

00:18:13.737 --> 00:18:18.437
If you add these factors into the ones mentioned previously, you can see why

00:18:18.437 --> 00:18:24.387
the diets of those, like my parents, who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, were

00:18:24.427 --> 00:18:30.337
characterised by dishes that were born out of post-wartime austerity and shortages.

00:18:30.997 --> 00:18:37.637
For example, my father will talk of a childhood favourite of his, called corned beef hash.

00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:45.677
This was in fact a dish made out of Argentinian tinned beef but mainly consisting of potatoes.

00:18:46.477 --> 00:18:49.627
There’s a reason you will struggle to find it in a modern

00:18:49.637 --> 00:18:52.977
British restaurant because...well, it’s not very nice.

00:18:53.897 --> 00:18:59.297
Some wartime eating habits still remain; for example, the national love of

00:18:59.317 --> 00:19:04.447
the sausage [or “banger” to use the affectionate name it acquired in the War].

00:19:05.537 --> 00:19:09.907
Home cooking in Britain was given a boost by the popularity and

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:15.147
health benefits of the so-called Mediterranean diet in the 1970s.

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:21.203
A cookery writer called Elizabeth David helped popularise French cooking in particular.

00:19:22.343 --> 00:19:28.443
Subsequent TV cooks, such as Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay, have done much to increase

00:19:28.443 --> 00:19:33.993
the glamour of cooking and thereby encourage Britons to cook more imaginatively.

00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:40.953
Well, what is the situation like now in 2021, perhaps you are asking yourself?

00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:48.163
Thankfully, things have moved on from the days of the endless tinned and dehydrated food of the

00:19:48.323 --> 00:19:57.383
1960s and 1970s, but the British diet is still markedly different to that of other European nations.

00:19:58.543 --> 00:20:05.283
One perhaps surprising difference is the UK’s addiction to takeaways, to takeaway food.

00:20:05.783 --> 00:20:11.563
Indeed, the UK has 40% of the takeaway market of the whole of Europe.

00:20:12.673 --> 00:20:18.373
These are not just in the long-established styles of Chinese and Indian food which

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:24.733
dominated the foreign restaurant scene some 40 years ago, but people‘s tastes are

00:20:24.773 --> 00:20:31.133
truly global and include Thai, Middle Eastern, Turkish, Greek, Mexican, you name it.

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:36.863
The influx of immigrants from all over the world means that the national

00:20:36.863 --> 00:20:43.310
palate has become much more receptive to all these wonderful, varied tastes.

00:20:43.923 --> 00:20:50.963
This draw towards ethnic foods is evident in supermarkets as well, where the sections containing

00:20:50.963 --> 00:20:58.563
“ready meals” are huge – far larger than similar sections in, say, French or Italian supermarkets.

00:20:59.303 --> 00:21:04.573
And in general, the standard of these oven-ready meals is pretty good.

00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:11.503
COVID-19 has, of course, accelerated a trend which was already quite marked:

00:21:11.993 --> 00:21:16.783
Brits are eating an increasing proportion of food which they either bring

00:21:16.803 --> 00:21:21.663
into the house already completely cooked or which they take home and warm up.

00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:27.879
And when it comes to ‘foreign’ food, to dishes that Brits might consider to be

00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:34.029
foreign, but are very often eaten in Britain, many are either British adaptations

00:21:34.049 --> 00:21:39.029
of foreign dishes or, in the case of one of the country‘s favourite meals,

00:21:39.337 --> 00:21:44.477
Chicken Korma, a dish which was invented in Britain and given an Indian name.

00:21:45.697 --> 00:21:50.527
So, that is a brief introduction to the curious taste of British food.

00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:54.717
Like many British things, British cuisine is a mix, a

00:21:54.967 --> 00:21:58.837
mish-mash one could say, of influences from all over the world.

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:04.507
From France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, India, China, the Middle East.

00:22:04.507 --> 00:22:10.407
And much like the English language, all of these influences have been brought to this

00:22:10.507 --> 00:22:16.687
little island, in many cases put together, and that’s how we have come up with British food.

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:22.057
The result is, I hope you’ll agree, not as bad as most people think.

00:22:25.457 --> 00:22:31.297
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Curious Taste of British Food.

00:22:31.627 --> 00:22:34.567
I hope you enjoyed it, and that it has given you a

00:22:34.607 --> 00:22:38.947
little insight into why British food tastes like it does.

00:22:39.827 --> 00:22:45.287
We actually did a mini-series on some specific British dishes, such as Oysters,

00:22:45.467 --> 00:22:49.877
The Sandwich, Fish and Chips and the English Breakfast, so if you want to

00:22:49.877 --> 00:22:53.607
know more about those, then I would recommend giving those ones a listen.

00:22:53.847 --> 00:22:59.217
Those are actually episodes 16, 17, 18, and 19, from about 18 months ago.

00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:03.727
And as always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.747
Have you ever actually tried British food?

00:23:07.397 --> 00:23:08.347
What do you think of it?

00:23:08.897 --> 00:23:11.307

Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:08.573
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:10.533
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:12.213
The show where you can listen to

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:14.773
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:16.963
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:19.033
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.533
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.523
is part two of this mini-series

00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:25.393
looking at the Ku Klux Klan.

00:00:25.973 --> 00:00:28.113
In the last episode, we looked at the

00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:30.643
three major historical phases of the

00:00:30.643 --> 00:00:33.883
KKK: its birth and rise in the post-civil

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.883
war south during the Reconstruction

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:38.773
Era, its anti-immigrant resurrection in

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:41.983
the 1920s, and its final wave against

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:44.403
the Civil Rights era of the 1960s.

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:47.353
Today, in part-two, we’re looking

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:49.363
at what came after that third and

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:51.553
final wave, and what the Klan, or

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:54.153
more specifically, what one man and

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.223
his leadership did as it declined.

00:00:57.103 --> 00:00:59.053
Before this man took over, the

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:01.403
Ku Klux Klan had always operated

00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:03.983
in secrecy, hidden behind hoods

00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:05.933
and robes and the cover of night.

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:09.523
But as the Klan began its slow and steady

00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:12.193
decline, one man tried to change this.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.363
He tried to make the Klan - and

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:16.583
its ideas - more mainstream,

00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:19.043
relatable, and family friendly.

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:22.133
He was clean cut, ran for and

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:24.083
even won political office,

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:25.883
and appeared on television.

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.143
But behind that public face was

00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:31.603
the racist, anti-semitic, white

00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:33.653
supremacist ideas common to the

00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:35.193
Klan throughout its history.

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:39.290
I am talking, about David Duke - America’s

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.370
best salesman of racial hate, the man

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.800
who tried to take the KKK mainstream.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.680
So, let’s get right into it.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160
David Duke sat in his New Orleans

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200
office at the headquarters of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.860
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.060
His phone rang.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.880
He leaned forward, and picked it up.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.520
On the other end of the phone,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.580
a man introduced himself as Ron

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.150
Stallworth, a new Klan applicant

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.100
from the Colorado Springs Chapter.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.970
The phone to his ear, Duke began

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.720
looking through paperwork until

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.250
he found the man’s application.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.470
“There’s been a delay in

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.190
getting things processed,” Duke

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.270
said, apologising profusely.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.290
In fact, Duke promised that

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.320
he would personally process

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.000
the application himself.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.670
For a man hoping to join the Klan,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.300
this was some honour - David Duke

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.000
was famous, a celebrity of sorts.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.110
Shortly after, Ron Stallworth’s membership

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.780
card arrived in Colorado Springs.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.820
He was now a fully-fledged member of the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.441
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and would

00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:54.351
go on to speak on the phone with its

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.591
leader, David Duke, once or twice a week.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.491
The only problem?

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:02.401
Ron Stallworth was black,

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:05.014
and David Duke  had no idea.

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:08.174
David Ernest Duke was born

00:03:08.184 --> 00:03:10.596
in 1950, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:13.646
His father was an engineer for the

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:16.106
Shell Oil Company, and his mother an

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:18.906
alcoholic who was often disorientated

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:20.806
and distant towards her son.

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:24.816
Because of his father’s job, the young

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:27.376
Duke spent some time living abroad, before

00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:29.656
the family eventually settled in New

00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:32.886
Orleans, in Louisiana, in the mid-1950s.

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:36.266
Duke, therefore, was a teenager

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:39.246
in the 1960s, the height of racial

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:41.406
tensions in 20th century America.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.611
Though it’s true that his father was

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.221
often away and his mother a distant

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.125
drunk, it’s hard to pinpoint, or

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:53.355
specify, exactly where or when Duke’s

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:55.715
white supremacist worldview came from.

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:00.235
One biography of Duke suggests that it had

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:02.975
already begun to form when he was just 14

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:05.405
years old, when he wrote an essay arguing

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:08.215
against integration for a class project.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.855
In order to research the paper, Duke went

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:14.115
down to the New Orleans Citizens Council,

00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:16.665
one of many anti-integration groups

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:18.505
across the American south at the time.

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:22.005
It was there that he read a book that

00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:25.195
argued racial integration was doomed to

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.945
fail, and after reading more and more

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.465
white supremacist literature he developed

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:33.375
the idea that race and genetics were

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:35.915
the most important aspects of society.

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.165
As Duke grew older, the New Orleans

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:42.635
Citizens Council became like his

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:45.365
second home, and he became interested

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:47.725
in Nazism and the Ku Klux Klan.

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:51.166
One neighbour of the Duke family later

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.936
said that the teenage David Duke even

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:56.426
had the Nazi flag on his bedroom wall.

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:59.646
The boy then fell under the

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.686
influence of a man called Jim

00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:02.483
Lindsay,

00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:04.617
a Klan leader who stepped in

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:07.107
as a father figure while his

00:05:07.177 --> 00:05:09.237
own father, David Duke Sr.

00:05:09.418 --> 00:05:10.058
was abroad.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:13.917
By the time he left high school - an

00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:15.627
integrated high school, by the way,

00:05:15.687 --> 00:05:18.027
a school with black and white pupils

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:20.607
- Duke was already a fully-fledged

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:22.357
member of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:26.687
In 1968, he enrolled at Louisiana

00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:29.067
State University, and first came

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:31.167
to public attention for starting

00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:32.727
something called the White Youth

00:05:32.777 --> 00:05:35.117
Alliance and for his many racist

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.727
and anti-semitic speeches on campus.

00:05:38.497 --> 00:05:40.007
He became well-known for

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:41.647
wearing a Nazi swastika,

00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:42.377
and

00:05:42.527 --> 00:05:44.467
when a civil rights campaigner called

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.927
William Kunstler gave a speech at another

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:49.627
university in New Orleans, Duke travelled

00:05:49.627 --> 00:05:51.817
there for the event, dressed in full

00:05:51.827 --> 00:05:54.807
Nazi uniform and carrying a sign with the

00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:57.977
message: "Kunstler is a Communist Jew”.

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.877
One contemporary, one colleague from

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:03.917
Duke’s time at university, would later

00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:06.587
say that Duke "would talk about 'Mein

00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:08.967
Kampf" - Hitler’s political manifesto.

00:06:09.697 --> 00:06:11.637
"He would describe how he was going

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.167
to become mainstream and get elected

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:16.177
to the legislature,” he said.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.067
It seems that even back then, in

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:21.457
college, Duke already had plans

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:23.687
to take his vile views mainstream,

00:06:23.987 --> 00:06:25.657
and into the world of politics.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.370
After graduating from university,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.560
Duke remained involved in fringe

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.650
white supremacist groups and protests.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.800
In 1974 he founded an organisation called

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.820
“The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan”, a

00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:43.090
rebranded, offshoot group that appealed

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.420
to traditional Klan members but also

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.730
tried to modernise the organisation.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.300
As you may remember from the last

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.780
episode, throughout the Klan’s history

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.470
there have been several offshoots, such

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.040
as the Knights of the White Camelia

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.220
and the White Brotherhood, that all

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.770
existed under the loosely connected

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.700
Klan name, and Duke’s Knights of the

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.220
Ku Klux Klan is best understood as

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.340
another iteration, another form of this,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.870
rather than a separate or rival group.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.330
The name might have been slightly

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.840
different, but the hate was the same.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.720
And Duke continued to make

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.010
no secret of his vile views.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.780
That same year, he and a Klan colleague

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.090
dressed in blackface - that is,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.420
they painted their faces black - and

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.380
they interrupted the unveiling of

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.740
a statue of a man called P.B.S.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.450
Pinchback, a black man who was governor

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.550
of Louisiana in the Reconstruction era.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.430
Two years later, at the age of 26, Duke

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.730
became Grand Wizard, the big boss, the

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.770
youngest ever in Klan history, and he

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.330
developed a reputation as an efficient

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.360
salesman of Klan ideology and literature.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.310
Crucially, he knew about the Klan’s

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.350
violent history and viewed it as

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.380
baggage, or a distraction, stopping

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.350
him from taking his white supremacist

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.540
agenda into the political arena.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.420
During his time as leader, he tried to

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.030
change and modernise the group, making

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.860
it more palatable - more tolerable - to

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.300
a mainstream middle-class audience.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.710
Although he was an unashamed racist

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.900
and anti-semite, in public Duke tried

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.150
to project an image of a well-dressed,

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.478
educated, and family-friendly type of

00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:39.020
Klansman, one less associated with the

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.420
traditional symbols and behaviour of

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.417
the organisation’s past iterations.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.500
Under Duke’s leadership, Klan members

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.920
were instructed to - and I'm quoting

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.940
directly - "get out of the cow

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.510
pasture and into hotel meeting rooms.”

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.160
Think less rural south, more

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.130
suburban middle-management.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.740
Duke renamed the position of Grand

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.310
Wizard "National Director" to give it a

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.360
more official sounding name, and began

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.780
calling cross burnings "illuminations."

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.560
As the director of the Klanwatch project

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.560
of the Southern Poverty Law Centre put

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.150
it: "He used tactics that had never

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.430
been used before -- throw away the

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.440
robe, put on a three-piece suit, cut

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.000
your hair, and get yourself on TV."

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.070
Clearly, David Duke was trying to

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.350
take white supremacy mainstream.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.400
And not just mainstream TV, he was

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.360
making a bid for political power.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.790
In 1975, he had run unsuccessfully

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.230
for the Louisiana Senate,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.560
gaining just 11,000 votes.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.300
Although he lost, Duke’s speeches,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.550
rallies and television appearances

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.260
gently normalised white supremacist

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.410
views as legitimate political

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.290
positions, with nice suits and haircuts

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.340
in television studios and debates.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.670
By 1980, however, Duke rather suddenly

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.760
left the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.860
He gave up his position as Grand Wizard

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.890
after a dispute with another Klan

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.810
leader, Bill Wilkinson, who believed that

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.540
Duke had sold a list of Klan members.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.410
You might remember from the last episode

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.120
that by this time Ku Klux Klan groups

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.610
across the country had been infiltrated

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.420
by a targeted campaign of FBI undercover

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.690
agents, and as Klan membership declined

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.760
in the 1970s, what was left of it became

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.220
increasingly distrustful of one another.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.030
After leaving, Duke founded a white

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.110
civil rights group called the National

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.460
Association for the Advancement of White

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.030
People and tried to recover his image,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.510
distancing himself from the KKK and

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.560
presenting himself not as anti-black,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.500
or anti-semitic, but pro-white and

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.930
pro-Christian, a tactic to try to

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.860
normalise his ideas of racial superiority.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.870
Although he would forever be

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.870
associated with it, Duke was in

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.850
fact the leader of the KKK for

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.475
just four years, from 1976 to 1980.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:22.082
Though his tenure was short, it would

00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:24.272
prove to be a very useful stepping

00:11:24.272 --> 00:11:26.702
stone for what was coming next, the

00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:29.082
political aspirations he had held

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:30.732
ever since his days at university.

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:35.512
In 1988, Duke put himself forward for the

00:11:35.532 --> 00:11:38.072
Democratic party presidential nomination

00:11:38.512 --> 00:11:40.932
but he failed to win any primaries.

00:11:42.072 --> 00:11:44.642
Instead he won the nomination of the

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:47.252
white nationalist Populist Party but

00:11:47.412 --> 00:11:50.522
won just 47,000 votes on election day.

00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:54.632
The next year, in 1989, however,

00:11:55.112 --> 00:11:57.262
Duke finally made his jump into

00:11:57.262 --> 00:11:59.682
the mainstream and finally got,

00:11:59.842 --> 00:12:02.172
in his eyes, his political reward.

00:12:03.102 --> 00:12:05.302
He left the Democrats and joined

00:12:05.312 --> 00:12:07.572
the Republican party, and won a

00:12:07.572 --> 00:12:09.089
seat in the Louisiana House of

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:11.419
Representatives by a very narrow

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:14.979
margin - taking 50.7 percent of the vote.

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:19.119
Just like Klansmen before him, Duke

00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:21.739
capitalised on, or took advantage of,

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:24.659
times of social and economic unrest.

00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:27.399
The American economy was

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.399
struggling in the mid-1980s.

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:31.779
Duke blamed this on affirmative

00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:34.029
action - or positive discrimination

00:12:34.469 --> 00:12:36.459
- and capitalised on the fears of

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:38.189
white voters to win election.

00:12:39.289 --> 00:12:41.519
Now, Duke didn’t really do anything

00:12:41.549 --> 00:12:43.719
of note during his time in office,

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:46.149
preferring to focus on his personal

00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:48.599
brand and further trying to

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:50.549
normalise white supremacist views.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:55.389
In 1990, however, he decided that a

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.389
lowly state legislature wasn’t enough

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:01.049
for his ambition and he ran for Senator.

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:04.979
He lost, and the following year, in

00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:08.319
1991, he ran for Governor of Louisiana.

00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:11.059
Though he did lose the election,

00:13:11.349 --> 00:13:13.539
Duke’s white supremacist platform

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.549
won him almost half a million votes.

00:13:17.469 --> 00:13:19.059
Between the two elections - for

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:21.779
Senator and Governor - Duke won

00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:24.489
almost 60 percent of the white vote.

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:28.239
And just like another more recent divisive

00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:30.319
figure in American politics, Donald

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:33.049
Trump, David Duke found himself initially

00:13:33.289 --> 00:13:35.929
somewhat cast out by the Republican Party.

00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:38.579
Some of the biggest Republican figures

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:40.519
in American politics, including

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:42.829
Presidents Reagan and George W.

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:44.549
Bush, publicly criticised

00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:46.809
Duke and tried to distance the

00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:49.379
party from his abhorrent views.

00:13:50.549 --> 00:13:53.569
But like with Trump, his supporters backed

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:55.999
him anyway, and anyone who criticised

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:58.059
him was branded an establishment

00:13:58.069 --> 00:14:00.279
liberal, part of the status quo.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.610
I should add here that his political

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.780
views weren’t the only unusual,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.280
unorthodox, things in David Duke’s life.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.810
It might not surprise you, but Duke was

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.640
an incredibly strange man, and engaged in

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.650
many unusual activities, typically with

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.910
the aim of either sowing racial division

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.490
or personal enrichment, making money.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.140
Normally both.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.380
In the 1970s, he wrote a martial arts

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.990
guide for black militants under the

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.910
pseudonym, or fake name, "Mohammed X."

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.950
Years later Duke would say that it was

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.230
an attempt to collect a database of black

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.693
people who were potentially anti-white.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.780
During the 1980s, after his

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.620
divorce, he wrote a self-help sex

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.920
manual for women - writing under

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.240
the name of Dorothy Vanderbilt.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.860
He was also implicated in a bizarre plot

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.680
to establish a white supremacist regime on

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.760
the island of Dominica and attended "white

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.270
leadership" training sessions to prepare.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.470
And in 1989, while he was a Member of

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.360
the Louisiana House of Representatives,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.870
he reportedly sold Nazi literature

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.440
from his office, and it was around

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.970
this time that reports emerged that for

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.490
many years he had celebrated Hitler’s

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.810
birthday - cake included, of course.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.730
Yet perhaps the most remarkably strange

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.460
thing from Duke’s life, and an incredible

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.790
story that inspired Spike Lee’s film

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.420
BlacKkKlansman, was Duke’s relationship

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.040
with this man called Ron Stallworth.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.870
Now, if you haven’t seen BlacKkKlansman,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.690
by the way, I thoroughly recommend

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.090
it because that initial phone

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.360
call we touched on in the

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.130
introduction was just the beginning.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.340
As you heard at the start, Ron Stallworth

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.990
was African-American, he was black, he

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.100
was not your typical member of the KKK.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.300
What I didn’t mention was that he was

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.400
also a police officer - the first black

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.570
undercover police officer in the history

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.620
of the Colorado Springs police department.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.240
Incredibly, Stallworth managed to

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.540
infiltrate the Colorado Springs

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.480
Chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.820
Now, it almost goes without saying that

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.930
it would have been incredibly dangerous

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.809
- perhaps even fatal - for Stallworth

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.100
to infiltrate the group in person.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.990
So how did he do it?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.960
Well, after making initial contact

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.450
over the phone, Stallworth built up

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.660
a rapport - a relationship - with

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.790
local Klan members over the phone,

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.780
and sent one of his white - and very

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.520
brave - colleagues along to the meetings.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.700
As Stallworth would later write in his

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.570
memoir none of the Klan members were ‘the

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.550
brightest bulbs in the socket,’ meaning

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.440
particularly clever, and nobody noticed

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.670
nor asked why Ron Stallworth had one

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.470
voice on the phone and another in person.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.550
Incredibly, and this is where it

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.150
gets really good, after that initial

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.465
phone call with Duke, Stallworth

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.790
began a phone correspondence, or

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.073
relationship, with David Duke himself

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.673
- the national leader of the Klan.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:21.333
According to Stallworth, the two got

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:23.753
on very well and spoke once or twice

00:17:23.753 --> 00:17:26.543
a week - Duke still having absolutely

00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:29.173
no idea that Stallworth was black.

00:17:30.543 --> 00:17:33.363
In his memoir Stallworth even said that,

00:17:33.843 --> 00:17:35.933
“As a matter of fact, when you took away

00:17:35.933 --> 00:17:38.483
the topic of white supremacy and K.K.K.

00:17:38.483 --> 00:17:40.623
nonsense from discourse with Duke, he

00:17:40.623 --> 00:17:42.383
was a very pleasant conversationalist.”

00:17:43.403 --> 00:17:45.113
In other words, if you didn’t think

00:17:45.113 --> 00:17:46.423
about the fact that he was the

00:17:46.443 --> 00:17:48.503
country’s most famous racist, he

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:49.963
was quite a nice man to talk to.

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:54.263
When Stallworth asked Duke if he was

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.083
worried that somebody might play a

00:17:56.103 --> 00:17:58.483
trick on him, and pretend to be white

00:17:58.563 --> 00:18:00.863
on the phone, Duke confidently told

00:18:00.863 --> 00:18:02.843
him: “I can tell that you’re white

00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:04.493
because you don’t talk like a black

00:18:04.493 --> 00:18:06.763
man… you talk like a very smart,

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:09.443
intellectual white man, and I can tell

00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:11.393
by the way you pronounce certain words.”

00:18:12.523 --> 00:18:15.443
Duke then visited Colorado Spring for the

00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:19.203
fake Ron’s initiation to the KKK, and the

00:18:19.203 --> 00:18:22.423
real Stallworth was assigned to be Duke’s

00:18:22.553 --> 00:18:24.833
personal protection officer for the day.

00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:27.863
Now, it might sound like a Hollywood

00:18:27.863 --> 00:18:30.433
movie, and of course it was made into one,

00:18:30.663 --> 00:18:33.283
but I assure you, this is a true story.

00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:37.773
When Stallworth - the real one - arrived,

00:18:38.023 --> 00:18:40.113
he told Duke that although he didn’t

00:18:40.123 --> 00:18:42.633
respect the KKK he would do his

00:18:42.633 --> 00:18:44.483
professional duty and protect him.

00:18:46.033 --> 00:18:48.413
Incredibly, Duke never made the

00:18:48.413 --> 00:18:50.863
connection that the black man standing

00:18:50.873 --> 00:18:53.323
in front of him was the real Ron

00:18:53.323 --> 00:18:55.553
Stallworth, the man that he had talked

00:18:55.553 --> 00:18:57.483
to for hours over the phone - he

00:18:57.483 --> 00:18:58.943
didn’t even recognise his voice.

00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:02.653
Duke never realised who Stallworth was

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.103
and the story came out decades later.

00:19:06.073 --> 00:19:07.883
So, for someone who thought he

00:19:07.883 --> 00:19:09.873
was the face of what he called the

00:19:09.873 --> 00:19:12.243
‘master race’, perhaps Duke wasn’t

00:19:12.243 --> 00:19:13.943
quite as intelligent as he thought.

00:19:15.143 --> 00:19:17.683
And it turned out that, aside from

00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:20.153
being a famous racist and not as good

00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:22.028
as he thought at deciding the colour

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.683
of people’s skin from their voice,

00:19:24.003 --> 00:19:26.893
like many American politicians, he also

00:19:27.053 --> 00:19:29.473
wasn’t very good at paying his taxes.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:34.624
In December of 2002 Duke was convicted of

00:19:34.684 --> 00:19:38.254
tax fraud and served 15 months in prison.

00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:41.594
When he got out, he spent time travelling

00:19:41.594 --> 00:19:44.154
around Europe giving lectures and making

00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:46.964
connections with European neo-nazi groups.

00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:51.384
Duke’s focus now was not on the Klan or

00:19:51.404 --> 00:19:54.104
racism towards black Americans, but he

00:19:54.114 --> 00:19:56.414
developed an obsession with anti-semitic

00:19:56.414 --> 00:19:59.674
conspiracies about Judaism and Zionism.

00:20:00.194 --> 00:20:02.644
He mingled with Holocaust deniers,

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.669
travelling around the world speaking at

00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:07.224
anti-Zionist conferences, which is what

00:20:07.224 --> 00:20:09.204
he is still doing really to this day.

00:20:10.454 --> 00:20:13.474
So, to wrap things up, David Duke

00:20:13.564 --> 00:20:15.824
was only leader of the Ku Klux Klan

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:17.699
for a few years in the late-1970s,

00:20:18.454 --> 00:20:20.194
during a period when its membership

00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:22.484
declined and never really recovered.

00:20:23.344 --> 00:20:25.514
Until he became Grand Wizard of

00:20:25.514 --> 00:20:27.504
the Ku Klux Klan, it had generally

00:20:27.504 --> 00:20:29.864
tried to operate in secret to some

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:32.674
extent, and as a result its leaders

00:20:32.804 --> 00:20:34.204
weren’t often in the spotlight.

00:20:34.854 --> 00:20:37.134
David Duke tried to change all that.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.544
He put himself front and centre

00:20:39.704 --> 00:20:41.664
of the Klan’s activities and white

00:20:41.664 --> 00:20:43.714
nationalist ideas, and tried to

00:20:43.734 --> 00:20:46.574
cultivate, create, a more professional

00:20:46.574 --> 00:20:48.544
and clean cut image for the group.

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:51.634
He swapped white robes and pitchforks

00:20:51.764 --> 00:20:53.914
for smart suits and television screens.

00:20:54.634 --> 00:20:57.654
The beaming smile, the well-groomed

00:20:57.664 --> 00:21:00.694
hairdo, he looked and behaved like tens

00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:02.724
of millions of other American businessmen.

00:21:03.694 --> 00:21:07.054
But beneath the surface, and not even that

00:21:07.054 --> 00:21:09.334
far beneath the surface, he shared the

00:21:09.344 --> 00:21:12.294
same hateful ideas as his predecessors.

00:21:13.044 --> 00:21:15.554
Fortunately, he seems now to be further

00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:17.654
than ever from any real political power

00:21:17.814 --> 00:21:20.534
himself, but his political success,

00:21:20.744 --> 00:21:22.234
although it was never really a great

00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:25.084
success, did a great deal to legitimise

00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:27.604
white supremacy on a national level.

00:21:28.584 --> 00:21:31.964
And the consequences of this are indirect,

00:21:32.454 --> 00:21:35.354
far-reaching, and unfortunately may

00:21:35.354 --> 00:21:37.674
not be clear for many years to come.

00:21:39.764 --> 00:21:41.854
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:21:41.874 --> 00:21:44.604
episode on David Duke, “America’s most

00:21:44.604 --> 00:21:46.551
well-known racist and anti-Semite”,

00:21:46.664 --> 00:21:48.754
and not a very nice man indeed.

00:21:49.314 --> 00:21:50.554
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:21:50.834 --> 00:21:52.464
and whether you knew a lot about

00:21:52.464 --> 00:21:54.244
Duke, or this was the first time

00:21:54.244 --> 00:21:56.124
you’d heard anything about him, well

00:21:56.334 --> 00:21:57.524
I hope you learned something new.

00:21:58.194 --> 00:21:59.994
As always, I would love to know

00:21:59.994 --> 00:22:01.404
what you thought about this episode.

00:22:01.674 --> 00:22:03.594
What impact and influence do

00:22:03.594 --> 00:22:05.584
you think David Duke really had?

00:22:06.044 --> 00:22:07.414
What do you think the relative

00:22:07.414 --> 00:22:09.864
political success of a man like David

00:22:09.874 --> 00:22:11.924
Duke says about American society?

00:22:12.334 --> 00:22:13.954
And have you seen the Spike

00:22:13.974 --> 00:22:15.464
Lee film, BlacKkKlansman?

00:22:15.914 --> 00:22:17.834
I would love to know, so let’s

00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.194
get this discussion started.

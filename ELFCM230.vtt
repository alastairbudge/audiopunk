Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.199
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.409
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.869
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Opioid Crisis in America.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.379
In the United States, 75,000 people every year, that’s over 200

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.419
people every single day, die from opioid-related drug overdoses.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.059
This is a number that has boomed since the mid 1990s.

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:52.939
So, in this episode we are going to talk about some of the reasons why that is, why has the US

00:00:53.069 --> 00:01:00.049
become the world’s hotspot, or world capital even, of opioid addiction, why so many Americans

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:07.239
are becoming addicted to opioids, who is responsible for this, and what it is doing to society.

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.355
OK, then, the opioid crisis.

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:16.734
Let’s start with a quick definition of what an opioid is.

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:22.155
An opioid is a drug that kills pain and causes pleasure.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:26.565
The name comes from the original, natural, opioid:

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:30.655
opium - the drug that can be found in poppy seeds.

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:37.605
Other opioids include morphine, heroin, fentanyl, codeine, and oxycodone.

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:43.765
And in the past twenty years, over half a million Americans, that’s

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:49.045
more than the population of Malta and almost 10 times as many Americans

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:54.325
as died in the Vietnam war, have died after overdosing on opioids.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:59.029
It is a uniquely American problem, it’s something that

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:02.799
doesn’t happen anywhere else to anywhere near the same degree.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:09.749
In the United States there are 19 opioid-related deaths per 100,000 people.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:18.059
The average for Western Europe is 2.14, so the average person in the United States is almost

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.559
9 times more likely to die of an opioid overdose than someone living in Western Europe.

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.309
In 1990, however, those two numbers were much closer.

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:36.119
In the United States there were 2.01 opioid deaths per 100,000 people vs.

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.819
1.39 in Western Europe.

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:45.289
So, the question you might be quite rightly asking yourself is…what happened?

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:53.459
The United States has spent over a trillion dollars on the so-called “War on Drugs”, yet there

00:02:53.469 --> 00:03:00.669
have never before been more Americans using and dying from drugs and opioids in particular.

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:02.709
What is going on?

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.489
Well, if you are unfamiliar with the Opioid Crisis, how the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.589
United States got itself into this situation may surprise you.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.109
When we are taught in schools about why we shouldn’t take drugs, we are normally shown videos

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:26.189
of teenagers being pressured to take drugs at a party or at the swings at a public park.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.649
The traditional view of drug addiction, or at least the view when I was growing

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:37.549
up, was that it might start with something small - a few puffs of a cigarette or

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:42.159
secretly stealing a bottle of alcohol from your parents’ cupboard to drink with your

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.539
friends, which might lead to smoking cannabis, snorting cocaine, and before long

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.159
you are addicted to heroin and selling all of your possessions to feed your habit.

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.149
In the American case, however, the boom in drug use

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.789
was not caused by teenagers just getting naughtier.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:08.479
In fact, when the majority of problem opioid users were first introduced to

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:14.299
opioids, it wasn’t on a park bench or at a party when they were teenagers.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:22.229
It was in a doctor’s clinic, by their doctor, who prescribed them as a way to treat pain.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:29.509
Now, although the boom in prescription opioids started in the late 1990s, doctors

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:34.499
have known about the pain-killing properties of opioids for hundreds of years.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.639
In the American Civil War large numbers of soldiers returned home

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.099
addicted to morphine, which they had first taken as a painkiller.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:52.479
Heroin was also legally manufactured, and it was sold at pharmacies until 1924.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.899
The reason that it was stopped, that it was made illegal, and that doctors stopped

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:05.479
freely prescribing opioids to patients was precisely because they’re addictive.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.212
Opioids don’t just kill pain, they make you feel pleasure, and

00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:14.922
the more you take them, the harder it is to stop taking them.

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:20.502
They are highly addictive, and even though they might be very effective

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:26.052
drugs to stop the pain, the body often becomes dependent on the drug.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:33.692
Doctors could prescribe opioids, but they were often reluctant to do so unless there were no

00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:40.512
alternatives - they knew that patients could get addicted, and wanted to avoid this at all costs.

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:47.352
Then, in the mid 1990s there was a new kid on the block, a new

00:05:47.352 --> 00:05:52.342
drug that came along, which its creators claimed wasn’t addictive.

00:05:53.552 --> 00:06:00.282
In 1996 an American pharmaceutical company called Purdue Pharma released a drug called

00:06:00.322 --> 00:06:07.242
OxyContin, which its representatives claimed was significantly less addictive than other

00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:15.022
opioids, indeed underlining that less than 1% of people using the drug become addicted.

00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:21.372
Purdue Pharma already had a number of other successful painkillers, but they

00:06:21.372 --> 00:06:27.672
were used to treat severe pain for people suffering from diseases such as cancer.

00:06:28.372 --> 00:06:35.282
If they could convince doctors that this new drug was non-addictive, then doctors would be more

00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:42.262
likely to prescribe it for patients with less severe pain - people recovering from accidents,

00:06:42.332 --> 00:06:48.852
people who weren’t always in extreme pain but people who would benefit from pain relief.

00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:57.732
And if these patients were able to be relieved of their pain, no matter how small, on this drug that

00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:04.332
was incredibly unlikely to lead to addiction, then that was the right thing for the doctors to do.

00:07:05.742 --> 00:07:11.102
What’s more, sales representatives, the employees who were responsible for

00:07:11.342 --> 00:07:16.152
encouraging doctors to prescribe these drugs to their patients, were highly

00:07:16.162 --> 00:07:21.592
incentivised to get doctors to start prescribing their drugs - the more

00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:26.302
drugs their doctors prescribed, the bigger bonus the salesperson would get.

00:07:27.252 --> 00:07:35.812
Indeed, in 2001 the average sales representative’s salary for Purdue Pharma was $55,000

00:07:35.812 --> 00:07:45.292
yet the average bonus paid out was $71,500, so more than half of their total pay was coming

00:07:45.302 --> 00:07:51.647
from these bonuses they got after persuading doctors to sell more and more OxyContin.

00:07:53.012 --> 00:08:00.382
As you might expect, sales grew quickly, and by 2001 Oxycontin was the most

00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:05.792
prescribed brand name narcotic medication for treating moderate-to-severe pain.

00:08:07.322 --> 00:08:12.472
Millions of Americans were using it, and the Purdue Pharma salespeople

00:08:12.702 --> 00:08:16.862
had become increasingly efficient at getting doctors to prescribe

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:21.432
it to more and more people, and in larger and larger doses.

00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:29.672
The FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, first approved 10mg, 20mg

00:08:29.672 --> 00:08:37.642
and 40mg doses of the pill, but later on approved 80 and 160mg doses.

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:44.842
The larger the dose and the more pills doctors prescribed, the more money Purdue

00:08:44.842 --> 00:08:51.032
Pharma and its salespeople made, and there are multiple reports of employees

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:56.482
being encouraged to pressure the doctors into prescribing more and more OxyContin.

00:08:57.627 --> 00:09:02.219
After all, fewer than 1% of patients become addicted, and it

00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:06.229
was very effective at killing the pain, so what was the issue?

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:12.199
Well, the issue was that the “less than 1%” number could not be

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:16.649
substantiated, they couldn’t prove it, and it simply wasn’t true.

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:21.649
Before long, doctors started to see this for themselves,

00:09:21.849 --> 00:09:25.159
and to suspect that the real number was much higher.

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:30.939
Patients couldn’t get off OxyContin, they couldn’t stop using it.

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:37.669
When they did, many suffered withdrawal symptoms, pain, and mood swings.

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:41.769
Their bodies needed the drug to continue functioning.

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:44.179
They couldn’t live a normal life without it.

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:51.129
What’s more, people had started to abuse OxyContin, they had started

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:55.469
to use it in a way it wasn’t designed for, and in a way that Purdue

00:09:55.469 --> 00:10:00.659
Pharma had claimed was not possible, or at least was not easy to do.

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:08.009
In its original form, it came as a tablet, which the patient would swallow,

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:13.409
and the pill would be broken down in the body over a period of 12 hours.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:20.869
Essentially, the claim was that, although one pill contained a powerful drug, only

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:25.899
small amounts of the drug would be released into the body over a prolonged period.

00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:34.249
Before long, people found ways to take the pill in other ways, either crushing up the pill and

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:42.529
snorting it, that's sucking it up into their nose, or even injecting it directly into their veins.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:52.279
Taking the drug in this way meant that the high, the feeling of pleasure, was a lot more intense

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:59.389
- the drug went directly into the system, as opposed to being released over a longer period.

00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:06.859
Recent investigations have shown that Purdue Pharma senior executives were aware

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:12.319
of this - they knew exactly what was going on - but didn’t do anything about it.

00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:19.999
This increasing abuse of OxyContin led to both a black market in the drug

00:11:20.289 --> 00:11:25.899
and the growth of so-called “pill mills”, doctors’ clinics that were happy

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:31.489
to provide prescriptions to anyone even if they didn’t medically need them.

00:11:32.668 --> 00:11:38.609
But even if these pills were bought on the black market, from a pill mill

00:11:38.609 --> 00:11:44.229
or from another unlicensed individual, prescription opioids weren’t cheap.

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:51.469
It might cost $15 or $20 for one OxyContin pill, if bought illegally.

00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:58.229
And the same types of people that were illegally selling these prescription pills, the

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:03.679
drug dealers essentially, they would often have something else for sale that was much

00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:11.349
more powerful and much cheaper: heroin, and later its even more powerful cousin, fentanyl.

00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:19.519
The cycle of addiction that doctors started to see would be someone first prescribed

00:12:19.549 --> 00:12:26.729
an opioid to treat pain, which would lead to abuse of the drug - either using it more

00:12:26.729 --> 00:12:32.869
frequently or in larger quantities than prescribed by the doctor - and often lead to the

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:39.834
abuse of more serious, illegal and really dangerous opiods such as heroin and fentanyl.

00:12:41.034 --> 00:12:46.594
To give you some numbers on this, data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse

00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:54.423
suggests that in America anywhere between 20-30% of patients who are prescribed opioids

00:12:54.674 --> 00:13:02.284
misuse them, and around 10% of people who use opioids develop some sort of addiction.

00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:11.754
Of those people who misuse opioids, around 5% of them move on to heroin and fentanyl.

00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:16.374
So, for every 100 people who are prescribed opioids by their

00:13:16.374 --> 00:13:21.394
doctor, 1 is likely to develop a heroin or fentanyl addiction.

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:29.924
Put the other way, of heroin users in the United States, 80% of them first abused prescription

00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:37.934
opioids - 4 out of 5 heroin users in the country got started with drugs prescribed by a doctor.

00:13:38.894 --> 00:13:43.074
And to state the obvious, to say what we all know, becoming

00:13:43.074 --> 00:13:47.004
a heroin addict isn’t generally a sensible life choice.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:52.884
For most addicts, it is an all-consuming disease, and your entire

00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:57.144
life becomes based on feeding your expensive drug addiction.

00:13:57.814 --> 00:14:02.194
For many people it is a disease that leads to homelessness,

00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:06.864
increased criminal activity, and overdose and death.

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:13.834
What’s more, the boom in use of fentanyl, which is a synthetic opioid

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:18.740
even more powerful and dangerous than heroin, has made the life of an

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:25.220
American opioid addict even more precarious, even more scary and dangerous.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.550
Fentanyl, like heroin and morphine, is nothing new.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.790
It was first made in 1960 and used as a pain killer.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:40.620
But it is even stronger than heroin - about 50 times stronger to be precise - and cheaper.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:48.670
So, as more and more Americans looked for cheaper alternatives to the opioids their doctors

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:54.580
were prescribing them, there was a boom in the production of fentanyl for sale on the street.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.730
Because it is so powerful and cheap to produce, it can be

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.110
smuggled into the United States more easily than any other drug.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.170
One kilogramme of fentanyl can be bought from suppliers in East Asia for around

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:17.440
$3,000, and relatively easily brought into the United States, either simply posted

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.010
in the normal post or sent first to Mexico and then smuggled across the border.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.680
This one kilo, because it is so incredibly powerful, can be cut up and mixed with

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:37.380
other substances and can lead to up to $1.5 million in profits for the drug dealers.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:45.620
And of course, for the drug users, the people who are either using fentanyl knowingly, or are

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:51.830
using other drugs that have small amounts of fentanyl in them, this can be incredibly dangerous.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:02.710
Just 2mg, 0.002 grammes, is considered to be a lethal dose for the average person, so it is

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:09.290
very easy for someone to unwittingly, unintentionally, take more than they think and die.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.890
Indeed, of the 100,000 people who died of a drug overdose in the

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.250
United States in the last year, two thirds were linked to fentanyl.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.980
So, you might be thinking, who is actually responsible for

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.080
this, and is this situation going to change any time soon?

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:37.260
In terms of the responsibility question, there have been numerous lawsuits against the

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:43.660
drug manufacturers and sales organisations for pushing their drugs on doctors, encouraging

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.240
them to prescribe them while being aware that they were more addictive than they claimed.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.776
The main target in this is Purdue Pharma, the company behind OxyContin,

00:16:56.171 --> 00:17:00.642
and indeed the Sackler family, the people who own Purdue Pharma.

00:17:01.942 --> 00:17:08.652
There is no doubt that Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family grew fabulously wealthy on the back of

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:16.222
OxyContin, with estimates of sales of the drug totalling $30 billion over the past 25 years or so.

00:17:17.322 --> 00:17:22.772
Evidence has come to light that has shown that senior executives were aware

00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:29.202
of the fact that it was addictive, and the company was fined $4.5 billion in

00:17:29.202 --> 00:17:34.502
exchange for the Sackler family receiving immunity from future prosecution.

00:17:35.602 --> 00:17:40.854
Essentially, the Sacklers agreed to pay out this vast amount of money so that

00:17:40.864 --> 00:17:45.864
they wouldn’t have to pay out any more, or didn’t risk being thrown in prison.

00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:51.604
This case is still ongoing, so we will have to see where it ends.

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:59.064
US authorities have been clamping down on “pill mills”, the doctors clinics and pharmacies that

00:17:59.064 --> 00:18:04.654
were giving out prescriptions to anyone, regardless of whether they were actually in pain or not.

00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:10.944
And dozens of doctors and pharmacy owners have been prosecuted and ended up in jail.

00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:17.494
But the reality is that the very drugs that started the opioid crisis - drugs

00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:22.954
such as OxyContin - are still prescribed in vast amounts every single day.

00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:37.004
In 2020 there were 142,816,781 opioid prescriptions, one for every 2.4 people, including children.

00:18:38.164 --> 00:18:42.444
To put it another way, if you were to take five average

00:18:42.474 --> 00:18:46.724
Americans, two would have a prescription for opioids.

00:18:47.954 --> 00:18:51.414
In the interests of balance - this number has gone down.

00:18:51.904 --> 00:19:02.914
At its peak in 2012 there were 255,207,954 opioid prescriptions, almost

00:19:03.114 --> 00:19:08.714
exactly one opioid prescription for every single adult in the United States.

00:19:09.654 --> 00:19:13.584
So, doctors are prescribing fewer opioids than they

00:19:13.584 --> 00:19:16.854
were 10 years ago, but the number is still massive.

00:19:17.674 --> 00:19:19.234
What’s next, you might be thinking?

00:19:20.194 --> 00:19:27.384
“Fixing” the opioid crisis is clearly far more complicated than simply stopping prescribing opioids.

00:19:28.277 --> 00:19:34.144
Opioids are incredibly effective at reducing pain, and pain is recognised

00:19:34.334 --> 00:19:39.094
as a global health problem that affects 20% of the adult population.

00:19:39.674 --> 00:19:44.394
There are hundreds of millions of people who use opioids, use prescription

00:19:44.394 --> 00:19:49.854
painkillers, safely and happily, and for whom these drugs allow them to live

00:19:49.864 --> 00:19:55.214
a normal and pain-free life when the alternative would be constant pain.

00:19:55.964 --> 00:20:01.674
So there are few that are suggesting that preventing the use of opioids is the answer.

00:20:02.314 --> 00:20:06.884
Indeed, there are plenty of other countries, Germany for example, that

00:20:06.884 --> 00:20:12.194
prescribe opioids in similarly high levels to the United States, but where

00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:17.304
there has not been a corresponding epidemic of opioid misuse and addiction.

00:20:18.844 --> 00:20:24.094
There is also the problem of the ten million or so Americans who currently misuse

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:29.784
opioids, and the million or so who are currently addicted to heroin and fentanyl.

00:20:30.504 --> 00:20:37.844
Again, clearly simply telling them to “stop” is not a solution, especially - for the ones addicted

00:20:37.844 --> 00:20:42.794
to heroin and fentanyl at least - they are already getting their drugs from illegal drug dealers.

00:20:43.074 --> 00:20:47.684
The fact that what they are doing is illegal is not a sufficient deterrent.

00:20:49.184 --> 00:20:53.814
In terms of making it harder to abuse these opioids, the

00:20:53.814 --> 00:20:58.354
makers of OxyContin have made the drug harder to misuse.

00:20:59.084 --> 00:21:04.974
In 2010 they released a new form of the pill which meant that if it was

00:21:04.974 --> 00:21:10.544
crushed it would turn into a substance that was harder to snort or inject.

00:21:11.244 --> 00:21:18.064
The idea was good - the theory was that if it were harder to abuse, people would abuse it less.

00:21:18.314 --> 00:21:21.365
They would have to swallow it, and the slow-release

00:21:21.365 --> 00:21:24.955
system would mean that there wasn’t a near-instant high.

00:21:26.235 --> 00:21:33.675
Unfortunately, data suggests that this simply accelerated people’s switch to heroin and fentanyl.

00:21:34.385 --> 00:21:41.045
Almost immediately after this new “abuse-proof” pill was released, heroin overdoses jumped up.

00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:48.835
So the theory goes that abusing this legal, prescription pill became such a hassle that

00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:55.155
people just switched over to the easy, illegal, cheaper and more powerful alternatives.

00:21:56.475 --> 00:22:00.515
Of course, there are plenty of theories about how to reduce the number

00:22:00.515 --> 00:22:05.305
of people who end up addicted to opioids, and there are really three

00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:09.955
key stages to this journey, three key areas that people talk about.

00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:16.895
Firstly, it starts with the manufacturers of prescription opioids, and ensuring that

00:22:16.905 --> 00:22:22.615
the drugs that they are bringing to market can be taken as safely as possible, and that

00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:28.345
these drugs are offered to doctors with correct, evidence-based guidance on their use.

00:22:29.845 --> 00:22:33.535
Secondly, that the doctors are prescribing the drugs to the

00:22:33.535 --> 00:22:37.835
people who really need them, not to people who want to abuse them.

00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:46.645
And thirdly, for people who do unfortunately end up abusing opioids, especially those who move

00:22:46.645 --> 00:22:52.905
to more powerful and dangerous “street” drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl, that there are

00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:59.825
support networks for them to both take drugs safely, without the risk of dying, and to overcome

00:22:59.825 --> 00:23:06.295
their addiction, to kick their habit, and to return to society and live a normal life again.

00:23:07.765 --> 00:23:13.255
There is increasing pressure on the government, especially from groups of people who have lost a

00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:20.815
loved one to the opioid crisis, to work on each of these three stages, three areas, but the Opioid

00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:26.815
Crisis is not just still in full swing, there are more and more people dying every single year.

00:23:27.765 --> 00:23:37.555
Indeed, there were 35% more opioid-related deaths in 2021 than in 2020, and although the number

00:23:37.585 --> 00:23:44.925
of opioids prescribed is reducing, the number of people dying continues to increase every year.

00:23:46.315 --> 00:23:50.945
In some areas of the United States, the levels of opioid-related deaths

00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:57.435
have even meant that the average life expectancy has decreased, so for

00:23:57.435 --> 00:24:02.925
the first time in history people are dying younger than their parents.

00:24:04.285 --> 00:24:10.305
So, while there is no easy or simple solution in sight, and the American opioid

00:24:10.305 --> 00:24:16.075
industry remains a multi-billion dollar market, the grim reality is that hundreds

00:24:16.095 --> 00:24:21.555
of thousands, if not millions, of people will continue to die unnecessarily.

00:24:22.515 --> 00:24:27.555
And the terrible irony of it all is that for the majority of people

00:24:27.555 --> 00:24:32.261
who will die, the journey towards addiction and death will start

00:24:32.531 --> 00:24:36.571
with being handed a harmless-looking piece of paper by their doctor.

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:44.141
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Opioid Crisis.

00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:48.871
I know we normally like to finish on a positive note, but unfortunately when

00:24:48.871 --> 00:24:53.161
it comes to this particular subject, there isn’t a lot of good news to share.

00:24:54.241 --> 00:24:57.581
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:01.651
What do you see as some potential solutions to this crisis?

00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:06.281
What are the policies towards drug use and drug addiction in your country?

00:25:06.611 --> 00:25:09.441
What do you think works, and doesn’t work?

00:25:10.081 --> 00:25:11.551
I would love to know.

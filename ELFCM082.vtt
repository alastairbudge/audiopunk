They say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.390
And the whole world is talking about it.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.297
The level of stupidity is incredible.

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:12.857
I'm telling you, I used to use the word incompetent now just call them stupid.

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:14.597
I went to an Ivy league school.

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:16.787
I'm very highly educated.

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:22.367
I know words I have the best words but there's no better word than stupid, right?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.739
Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.809
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.149
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:54.319
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the English of Donald Trump.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.219
Now Donald Trump is obviously a pretty divisive character, but we are going

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.289
to try to avoid talking too much about his politics or the man himself.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.939
We are going to stick to talking about his language, how he talks, why

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.369
he talks like he talks, and what, if anything, you can learn from it.

00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:27.036
Before we get right into that though, let me remind you that you can get all of the bonus episodes

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:34.146
plus subtitles, transcripts, and key vocabulary over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:39.246
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:45.336
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:50.466
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:59.069
So if that is of interest and I certainly hope it is then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:03.973
Okay then, Donald Trump and his English.

00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.305
I'm sure what that Donald Trump needs no introduction.

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:13.735
He was mildly famous before he became president of the United States.

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:18.595
And since then, well, he seems to dominate the news cycle and it's

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:22.855
hard to find a day where he isn't on the front page of a newspaper.

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:28.340
Compared to most politicians, he is of course, very

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.810
different and not just in character, style or substance.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.138
He also uses a very different kind of language.

00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:43.872
To start this episode, we are going to talk about the kind of language that Trump uses

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:49.632
and you can see if you can recognise some of the traits, some of the characteristics.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:55.221
We had a short clip of Trump speaking at the start of the podcast,

00:02:55.431 --> 00:03:00.141
but I'm going to play another clip now from a recent interview he did.

00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:02.541
So here we go.

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:05.479
Well, I certainly think so.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:06.769
And I certainly hope so.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.991
And, the relationships we have are incredible, the spirit

00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:12.931
of this country, and especially considering what happened.

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:16.051
I mean, we had out of nowhere, a plague come in from

00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:21.171
China, it just came in and it came to all over the world.

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:26.571
When all over the world, you look at it 186 countries, and they were devastated and we were

00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:31.881
certainly hit very hard, some were hit harder than us relatively, but we were hit very, very hard.

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.231
And now we're making our comeback.

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:39.468
And then on top of it, we had the riots, which were unnecessary to the extent they were.

00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:42.888
If the governors and mayors would have taken a stronger action, I

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.888
think the riots would have been, you could call them protesters.

00:03:45.888 --> 00:03:48.578
You could call them riots so different nights different things.

00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:51.865
In Minneapolis they went numerous nights.

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:55.285
And then I said, you got to get the guard in there we got the guard in there and it all stopped.

00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:58.632
Okay then I'm sure you recognise that voice.

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:05.577
Now let's talk about some of the aspects of language that make Donald Trump different.

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:12.263
Firstly, the actual vocabulary he uses is very different to the sort

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:16.853
of vocabulary that English speaking politicians traditionally use.

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:22.098
There was a study carried out by Carnegie Mellon University, which

00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:27.258
reported that Trump's level of grammar and vocabulary was equivalent

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:32.388
to that of a sixth grade student, someone who is 12 or 13 years old.

00:04:33.354 --> 00:04:37.864
If you find the words that he uses easier to understand than

00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:42.394
other politicians that's because they are indeed easier words.

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:49.684
He uses simple vocabulary: big, beautiful, great, strong, bad, nasty,

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:54.454
horrible, adjectives that you probably know, and that any learner

00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:58.384
would pick up relatively early on in their language learning journey.

00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:03.764
So from that point of view, he is very easy to understand.

00:05:04.814 --> 00:05:09.314
However, the second trait of Donald Trump is actually something that

00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:13.853
makes him a lot harder to understand for a lot of people and has been

00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:18.983
something that has made the life of professional translators a lot harder.

00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:23.843
And this is that he is not a coherent speaker.

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:30.713
He jumps around a lot from idea to idea and gets distracted as he is speaking.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:37.643
He will be talking about one thing, then his mind will wander and he'll move on to a

00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:42.803
different subject, often, not even finishing the sentence that he had just started.

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.673
Just listen to this example from a recent interview.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.868
I look at school, I watch, I read, look at the stuff.

00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:53.578
Now they want to change.

00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:58.678
If 1492 Columbus discovered America, you know, we grew up, you grew up, we all did.

00:05:58.678 --> 00:05:59.428
That's what we learned.

00:05:59.428 --> 00:05:59.578
Now.

00:05:59.578 --> 00:06:01.708
They want to make it the 1619 project.

00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:02.578
Where did that come from?

00:06:02.848 --> 00:06:03.838
What does it represent?

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.578
I don't even know slavery.

00:06:05.818 --> 00:06:07.618
That's what they're saying, but they don't even know.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.788
They just want to make a change

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:13.503
If you find this hard to follow, I don't blame you.

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:18.813
It has been extremely difficult for professional translators to deal with

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:24.783
him, especially those who are translating into languages that use different

00:06:24.813 --> 00:06:30.213
sentence structures and word orders, such as German, Arabic, or Japanese.

00:06:31.428 --> 00:06:35.958
In English, a sentence typically starts with a subject, then there's a verb and

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.848
an object, but this isn't the case for every language, as you may well know.

00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:45.048
The verb might come first or the object might come first.

00:06:46.428 --> 00:06:52.008
With Donald Trump, he often starts with the subject and the verb, but then

00:06:52.008 --> 00:06:57.348
might get distracted and go off on a completely unrelated subject, on a complete

00:06:57.498 --> 00:07:01.998
tangent, before coming back to finish what he was originally talking about.

00:07:02.658 --> 00:07:05.658
Or sometimes he doesn't complete the sentence at all.

00:07:07.203 --> 00:07:12.948
Understandably, this makes it incredibly difficult for anyone trying to professionally

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:17.782
translate it, and it makes it difficult to follow for a non-native speaker.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.036
Thirdly, and this is something that probably doesn't come

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:28.166
as a surprise to you, but he uses a lot of vulgar language.

00:07:28.446 --> 00:07:32.466
Swear words, he gives derogatory nicknames to other people

00:07:32.736 --> 00:07:36.696
and generally speaks like a child might do in a playground.

00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:41.981
This might be good for expanding your vocabulary of swear words,

00:07:42.148 --> 00:07:46.711
but it's not very useful for professional or polite conversations.

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:52.158
And in terms of the style of his speech, there are

00:07:52.158 --> 00:07:55.038
a few additional things that are worth mentioning.

00:07:56.398 --> 00:08:02.728
These aren't all remarks about the actual language he uses, but more around the style.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:07.438
Some of these make him easier to be understood, some make it harder.

00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:13.288
So he uses a technique that linguists call paralipsis.

00:08:13.918 --> 00:08:18.808
This is when you mention another subject, but pretend not to mention

00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:23.308
it, normally so you can deny that you actually did mention it.

00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:28.288
For example, he says things like, some people say that,

00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:32.678
or I've heard that, or I don't want to mention it but...

00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:41.538
It's a way of raising the subject, of letting people know what you want to talk about and

00:08:41.598 --> 00:08:48.408
planting an idea in their heads while maintaining the ability to deny that you believe it.

00:08:49.798 --> 00:08:55.738
It's a technique that he uses all the time and unfortunately it's pretty effective.

00:08:57.304 --> 00:09:01.349
Secondly, he repeats everything multiple times.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:06.389
If he wants to make a point, he doesn't say it again using different words.

00:09:06.569 --> 00:09:11.819
He will literally just repeat the same thing, using the same words multiple times.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:18.089
Again, this poses some problems for translators because repeating

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:22.649
yourself multiple times makes you sound a bit stupid in some languages.

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:28.387
So do you translate him literally and make him sound a bit stupid or do

00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:32.827
you find another way of translating his language to make him sound more

00:09:32.857 --> 00:09:37.717
like a politician, but you are actually changing his style of speech?

00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:44.707
It's been something that professional translators have been grappling with for years now.

00:09:46.207 --> 00:09:52.998
And finally, he is a master of ambiguity, of leaving a subject open, of not saying

00:09:52.998 --> 00:09:58.758
something directly, but allowing you - the listener - to believe whatever you want.

00:10:00.153 --> 00:10:04.593
From saying things like, you all know what I'm talking about or we'll have

00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:09.573
to wait and see without ever clarifying what it is he is referring to.

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:15.327
He first creates this sense of suspense and he also makes you the

00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:19.347
listener feel like you can believe whatever you want to believe.

00:10:20.727 --> 00:10:23.307
Again, it is incredibly effective.

00:10:24.845 --> 00:10:31.884
Now love him or loathe him, it's impossible to deny that the words of Donald Trump have

00:10:31.884 --> 00:10:37.194
managed to persuade the most powerful country in the world to elect him as their leader.

00:10:38.784 --> 00:10:43.104
Knowing what we know about the style of his language, let's take a minute

00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:48.254
to think about what linguistically might have helped him appeal to voters.

00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:53.908
Our first stylistic point was that he has the vocabulary

00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:57.448
and grammar of a sixth grader, of a 12 year old.

00:10:58.528 --> 00:11:04.078
Now, while you might say that this is something that would repel voters,

00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:09.478
that would mean he would be hard to take seriously as a politician, political

00:11:09.478 --> 00:11:14.188
analysts and commentators believe this is a major part of his appeal.

00:11:15.268 --> 00:11:19.849
He talks like someone you might meet at a bar or watching a sports

00:11:19.849 --> 00:11:24.709
game, not someone who wears a suit and a tie and sits behind a desk.

00:11:25.939 --> 00:11:32.809
It's this really weird juxtaposition where, on the one hand he is there talking about how rich

00:11:32.809 --> 00:11:40.339
he is and how he has a gold bathroom, but he is also using the language of the man next door,

00:11:40.774 --> 00:11:47.044
making grammatical errors, using childish vocabulary and talking in a very simple manner.

00:11:48.484 --> 00:11:53.524
It's completely the opposite of his predecessor and nemesis, Barack

00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:59.944
Obama, who spoke using rich, profound language, often stopping to

00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:04.908
pause for thought and never seeming to lose his train of thought.

00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:11.192
But for the people who hated Obama, Donald Trump was the polar

00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:14.762
opposite they were looking for, in linguistic terms as well.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:23.160
He also was a practiced showman, a reality TV host, and a chief manipulator of the media.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.750
He is a master of grabbing people's attention and knows how to use language to get what he wants,

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:38.580
from using paralipsis to get people to think about the subject without actually saying he believes

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:46.290
it through to using suspense and ambiguity, to get people to tune in again to what he says.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.940
He has decades of experience at capturing the attention

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.870
of the American public, and boy, does he exploit it.

00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:59.101
So the question you might be asking yourself is,

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:02.611
what can you learn from the English of Donald Trump?

00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:08.851
Is there something about the way he speaks, the vocabulary he uses, or

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:13.051
his style that you can use to make yourself a better English speaker?

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:20.152
Well, you could probably look at the English of Donald Trump and say that it is a very

00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:25.192
good argument for not worrying too much about expanding your vocabulary or grammar.

00:13:26.362 --> 00:13:31.162
If a man can get elected to the highest political office in America

00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:35.478
with the vocabulary of a 12 year old, then you probably shouldn't

00:13:35.478 --> 00:13:40.338
worry about not having 10 different ways of saying big or beautiful.

00:13:41.827 --> 00:13:47.152
However, if you are a curious language learner, and someone who thinks of language,

00:13:47.392 --> 00:13:53.992
not just as a tool to get what you want, but an art form, a flower which you enjoy

00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:59.542
constantly cultivating, then I think there's probably a limited amount of practical

00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:04.530
things that you can take from Donald Trump, and a lot of things that you should avoid.

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:11.650
His racist and sexist language is of course something to avoid, but developing

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.788
a sophisticated vocabulary and a richer way to say different things is

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:21.948
something that we, as curious language learners should all be working towards.

00:14:23.058 --> 00:14:26.718
The good news is that, linguistically at least, you're

00:14:26.718 --> 00:14:29.988
probably already not too far behind Donald Trump.

00:14:32.598 --> 00:14:37.697
Okay then that is it for today's episode on the English of Donald Trump.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:45.047
Often in these episodes, I tell you where you can go to find more information on the subject, but in

00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:50.177
this case, there are literally hundreds of thousands of clips of him speaking all over the internet.

00:14:51.132 --> 00:14:53.262
If you haven't already listened to him speaking in

00:14:53.262 --> 00:14:56.772
English, do give it a try and let me know what you think.

00:14:57.312 --> 00:14:59.112
Do you find him easy to understand?

00:14:59.862 --> 00:15:01.632
If not what's difficult?

00:15:02.412 --> 00:15:08.262
I would love to know how you get on, you can email hi, Hi@leonardoenglish.com.

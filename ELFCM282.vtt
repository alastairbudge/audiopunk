Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:16.604
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:20.694
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:27.674
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Joe Rogan and Spotify.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.814
In May of 2020 Spotify announced that it had acquired the

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:37.524
exclusive rights to a podcast by a man called Joe Rogan.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:43.554
The amount Spotify reportedly paid for it was initially thought to be $100

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:48.304
million, but it’s now thought to have been double this amount, with the

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:54.854
company paying about $200 million to have this one podcast on Spotify.

00:00:55.414 --> 00:01:00.424
So the question we are going to ask ourselves in this episode is…why?

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:06.066
Why did Spotify pay so much money for one podcast, was it worth

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.954
it, and what does the future hold for podcasts on Spotify?

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:15.413
Ok then, Joe Rogan and Spotify.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:19.913
Now, you may well be listening to this episode on Spotify.

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:26.363
Up to half of the listeners of this show use Spotify to listen to it, and this percentage,

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:31.773
at least for English Learning for Curious Minds, has been increasing almost every month.

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:36.353
But until relatively recently, until a few years

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:39.823
ago, you couldn’t even listen to podcasts on Spotify.

00:01:40.523 --> 00:01:45.193
It was somewhere to listen to your favourite music, somewhere to make playlists,

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:49.733
and you went elsewhere, you went to another app to listen to podcasts.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:58.853
Spotify wanted to change that, and since 2019 Spotify has spent around $1 billion

00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:03.853
dollars trying to make its app the go-to place for people to listen to podcasts.

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:10.683
It has bought podcast production companies, it has bought podcast technology companies, podcast

00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:17.833
advertising companies, but it’s most high-profile acquisition, the most famous “thing” it has

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:23.773
bought was one podcast, the “Joe Rogan Experience”, which is what we’ll be talking about today.

00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:30.683
Before we get into why Joe Rogan, it’s useful to have a quick reminder of

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:35.883
how Spotify’s business model works, which will help us understand why it

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:40.876
decided to pay more money than it had ever paid before for a single podcast.

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:44.866
So, Spotify is a music streaming app.

00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:48.796
Anyone can download it and listen to their favourite songs.

00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:54.016
You can listen to songs for free, but you have adverts after every few

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:59.606
songs, and you have a limited number of times you can skip back and forward.

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:04.666
Or, if you want the full functionality of the service, you can buy

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:09.783
a “Premium” version, which gives you unlimited skips and no adverts.

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:13.456
Simple enough, and if you are one of the hundreds

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:16.846
of millions of Spotify users, you knew this already.

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:25.306
But what you might not have known is how exactly Spotify makes money, or rather, how it loses money.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:31.386
With the Free version of Spotify, which about 60% of Spotify

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:36.146
users are on, Spotify makes money every time an advert is played.

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:43.376
But every time you listen to a song, Spotify needs to pay the record label for that song.

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:48.546
Now, you may have read articles about how little this amount of money

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:53.006
actually is, and how little the artists actually make from Spotify.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:04:01.446
But what perhaps you didn’t know is that Spotify actually loses money overall on every free user.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:06.666
For the finance nerds out there, Spotify has a negative gross

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:12.826
margin, a gross margin of -1.5%, for every non-Premium user.

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:21.926
The Premium, on the other hand, is highly profitable, and makes up about 90% of Spotify’s revenue.

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:28.276
One way of looking at this is that the adverts exist primarily to

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:33.066
annoy you, and push you into upgrading your subscription to Premium.

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:37.776
So, why all this chat about Spotify’s business model?

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:43.926
Well, because it’s helpful to understand why Spotify is interested in podcasts.

00:04:45.116 --> 00:04:49.346
If Spotify owns the rights to the content its users are

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:53.156
listening to, it doesn’t need to pay when users listen to it.

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:56.736
It can collect the money from advertising or from the

00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:00.056
Premium subscription without having to pay anything.

00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:02.816
And this is where podcasts come in.

00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:08.686
Now, the business model for the majority of podcasts is advertising.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:14.286
A podcast will go to a business and say “hey, I’ll tell my listeners to buy your

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:20.276
insurance, or energy drink or vitamin pills, and you pay me a certain amount of money”.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:25.876
Depending on how many downloads a podcast has and how dedicated

00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:30.166
and valuable its listeners are, the amount it can charge varies.

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:35.606
And the podcast with both an incredibly large number of listeners and

00:05:35.906 --> 00:05:42.266
die-hard loyal and dedicated fans is one called the Joe Rogan Experience.

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:48.116
Now, you may have heard of this podcast before, and perhaps you’ve even listened to it.

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:53.856
It wouldn’t be surprising, as it has been for several years the most popular

00:05:53.856 --> 00:05:59.636
podcast in the world, with an estimated 200 million downloads every month.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:04.506
The Joe Rogan Experience has been going since 2009.

00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:09.956
It’s an interview-style podcast, where Joe Rogan interviews people

00:06:10.066 --> 00:06:14.956
from a wide range of backgrounds, often with controversial viewpoints.

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:21.476
He has interviewed Elon Musk, where the pair famously smoked cannabis on air.

00:06:21.846 --> 00:06:26.996
He interviewed the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the disgraced cyclist, Lance

00:06:27.026 --> 00:06:32.846
Armstrong, and he even interviewed the famous and also disgraced boxer, Mike Tyson.

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:37.076
Joe Rogan himself is an interesting character.

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:41.446
He was an actor and comedian, then became a commentator

00:06:41.486 --> 00:06:45.636
for UFC, the American Mixed Martial Arts show.

00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:51.846
He isn’t tall, but he is a big, muscly guy with tattoos all up his arms.

00:06:52.396 --> 00:06:57.716
He looks like the sort of person you wouldn’t want to pick a fight with, and looks very

00:06:57.756 --> 00:07:03.476
different to the sort of person that people were used to seeing as a talk-show host.

00:07:04.606 --> 00:07:11.586
And, despite what other criticisms people might have of him, he is an excellent interviewer.

00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:18.516
He has done almost 2000 podcast episodes, with episodes ranging anywhere

00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:23.526
from 1 to 5 hours long, so he certainly has had time to practise.

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:29.626
But he has this remarkable down-to-earth nature, almost like a guy

00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:34.296
you would meet at a bar who is just great at asking questions, and can

00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:38.916
keep a conversation going for hours on end, for a long period of time.

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:42.476
And clearly, his approach works.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:49.556
His fans, who are predominantly young men, hang on his every word, they trust

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:54.356
him, if he says something, or they hear something on his show, they are much more

00:07:54.356 --> 00:08:00.476
likely to believe it than if they saw it on CNN or a more mainstream media outlet.

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:02.826
This will be important later on.

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:10.166
This combination of a very large and engaged audience put him on Spotify’s radar.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:15.376
If it could “own” Joe Rogan, then it could make the tens of

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:18.866
millions of dollars that Joe Rogan made every year from advertising.

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:27.286
But, much more importantly, if it could force Joe Rogan’s loyal audience to use Spotify, not

00:08:27.316 --> 00:08:33.616
any other podcast app, then it would be able to bring tens of millions of new users to the app.

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:40.426
These new users would hopefully start to listen to music on the app, probably on

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:46.626
the free version, but like 40% of all Spotify users, they would get annoyed with

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:52.256
the perpetual adverts and get pushed into the more profitable Premium subscription.

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:59.546
So, after extended negotiations, reportedly with Joe Rogan initially unhappy

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:05.816
with the offer from Spotify, on May 19th of 2020, Spotify announced that

00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:10.716
it had acquired the exclusive rights to stream The Joe Rogan Experience.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:18.056
The media reported the price tag as $100 million, but it’s now thought to be about double that.

00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:26.256
To commentators at the time, it seemed like a lot of money, even at the lower $100 million mark,

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:32.406
but Spotify clearly thought that the bet would pay off, that they would make money from it.

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:34.816
So, has it?

00:09:35.596 --> 00:09:38.326
Well, it certainly didn’t get off to a good start.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.836
A major part of Joe Rogan’s appeal was that he was a controversial character,

00:09:45.156 --> 00:09:50.316
and he was unafraid to have guests with controversial viewpoints on his show.

00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:56.906
With a 10-year history, it wasn’t hard for people to find Joe Rogan episodes

00:09:57.056 --> 00:10:02.176
from the back catalogue with controversial guests and controversial viewpoints.

00:10:03.346 --> 00:10:09.156
And when he moved to Spotify, Rogan vowed that the show wasn’t going to change.

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:13.996
It wasn’t going to become some clean, professional interview-style

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:18.276
show like the tens of thousands of others that were out there because

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:22.876
that wasn’t Joe Rogan, and that wasn’t what people wanted to listen to.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:28.106
People wanted the raw, messy, unedited interview.

00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:32.726
They wanted conversations that would go on for hours at a time, they

00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:37.316
wanted Joe Rogan to interview people that they would never see on TV.

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:41.826
And Joe Rogan, as he promised, didn’t change.

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:49.226
He continued to be divisive, and this culminated in April of 2021 when he

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:53.856
suggested that young, healthy people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine.

00:10:55.086 --> 00:11:02.056
To Joe Rogan fans and watchers, it was hardly surprising that he would take such a viewpoint.

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:06.586
His opinions towards traditional medicine have always been

00:11:06.756 --> 00:11:11.107
slightly sceptical, and Spotify knew this when it bought his show.

00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:18.407
The critics, however, said that this was reckless and dangerous by Spotify, and

00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:23.595
that it was spreading COVID misinformation via the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:31.087
Initially, Spotify put up its hands and said “hey, we’re just the streaming service, we don’t

00:11:31.097 --> 00:11:37.717
have editorial control over Joe Rogan”, but this didn’t cut the mustard, it wasn’t enough.

00:11:38.717 --> 00:11:46.027
A group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals wrote an open letter to Spotify

00:11:46.227 --> 00:11:52.627
expressing their concern, and then in January of 2022 several high-profile musicians,

00:11:52.807 --> 00:11:58.226
including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, started removing their music from Spotify.

00:11:59.087 --> 00:12:04.767
There were calls for Spotify to drop Joe Rogan altogether, calls that he was too

00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:10.107
controversial for an uncontroversial company like Spotify to continue to support.

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:18.157
Spotify knew that its attractiveness as a service relies on having lots of music available on it.

00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:24.437
If people can’t listen to their favourite musicians on Spotify, well they’ll go somewhere else.

00:12:25.897 --> 00:12:31.067
It was, understandably, a worrying time, but like these things tend

00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:36.017
to do, the controversy fizzled out, and Neil Young and Joni Mitchell’s

00:12:36.027 --> 00:12:41.027
boycott of the company didn’t lead to a mass exodus by other artists.

00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:46.477
This controversy, however, did raise important questions

00:12:46.717 --> 00:12:51.597
about the line, the division, between publisher and platform.

00:12:52.817 --> 00:12:58.907
A publisher is something that actually publishes content and is responsible for it.

00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:05.597
If an article is published in The Guardian newspaper, The Guardian has chosen

00:13:05.727 --> 00:13:11.657
to publish it, if the article is misleading or controversial or wrong, The

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:16.197
Guardian takes responsibility for it, it doesn’t put up its hands and say

00:13:16.457 --> 00:13:20.525
“hey, we’re just a newspaper, you should blame the journalist who wrote it”.

00:13:21.657 --> 00:13:27.577
A platform on the other hand, is something like Twitter, YouTube or Facebook.

00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:34.027
Given the instant nature of posting something on those platforms, and the sheer amount of

00:13:34.037 --> 00:13:40.317
content that is uploaded every second, it is very hard for these companies to actually police,

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:45.633
to monitor, what people are uploading, if you even believe that it should be policed, that is.

00:13:46.573 --> 00:13:51.743
Of course, this is a much more complicated subject than we have time for in this episode, but

00:13:51.923 --> 00:13:57.833
the point to underline is that the Spotify and Joe Rogan situation was a little different.

00:13:58.933 --> 00:14:04.973
For most podcasts on the Spotify app, Spotify can rightfully say that it doesn’t have any

00:14:05.183 --> 00:14:10.503
editorial control over what is said in the podcast, because, well, there are millions to

00:14:10.503 --> 00:14:15.403
choose from and Spotify simply provides a convenient way for people to listen to them.

00:14:16.573 --> 00:14:23.133
With Joe Rogan, Spotify not only had the exclusive rights to it, but it made money from it.

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:28.823
Surely, the critics said, this meant that it had more responsibility?

00:14:29.993 --> 00:14:37.313
Spotify eventually decided to remove over 100 of Joe Rogan’s most controversial episodes from its

00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:44.003
service, but this again put it into the dangerous category of “publisher” rather than “platform”.

00:14:44.893 --> 00:14:50.393
If it says it’s just a platform and not responsible for what Joe Rogan says, yet

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:56.033
it pays him $200 million to have controversial guests and opinions and it has

00:14:56.033 --> 00:15:00.943
the right to remove episodes, can it really continue to claim to be a platform?

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.433
It’s certainly an interesting debate, and one without a definitive answer.

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:13.533
Something that does seem clearer, though, is that Spotify’s big bet

00:15:13.543 --> 00:15:18.303
into podcasting is showing early promise, it is looking encouraging.

00:15:19.223 --> 00:15:24.653
Spotify’s podcast advertising business generated €200 million

00:15:24.653 --> 00:15:29.593
in revenue in 2021, it was up 300% from the previous year.

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:35.163
There are now 4 million podcasts available on Spotify, including this one of

00:15:35.163 --> 00:15:40.633
course, and Spotify users are increasingly listening to podcasts as well as music.

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:46.213
And it’s doing exactly what it hoped in terms of encouraging users

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:51.223
to turn Spotify into their go-to app for listening to anything audio.

00:15:52.553 --> 00:15:57.373
And although Spotify doesn’t currently put adverts between podcast

00:15:57.413 --> 00:16:01.553
episodes, analysts have suggested that this won’t be the case forever.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:08.703
Spotify knows that the main reason people upgrade to their Premium subscription is to get

00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:13.883
rid off these adverts, so when it feels confident that there are enough people listening

00:16:13.883 --> 00:16:20.113
to podcasts on Spotify, it can add advertising to push people towards upgrading their

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:25.133
accounts, and that will be when the money starts to roll in, theoretically at least.

00:16:26.033 --> 00:16:30.163
And because it has the exclusive rights to shows like the Joe Rogan

00:16:30.163 --> 00:16:34.434
Experience, people can’t simply go to another podcast app, because

00:16:34.664 --> 00:16:37.953
they'll have to stay with Spotify to listen to their favourite show.

00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:44.278
What’s more, and this is one of the major reasons why podcasting is so attractive

00:16:44.288 --> 00:16:48.828
to Spotify, Spotify doesn’t pay podcasters when someone listens to the show.

00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:57.268
Unlike songs, where Spotify pays between 0.3 and 0.5 cents every time a song

00:16:57.268 --> 00:17:02.678
is played, Spotify pays nothing to podcasts, so it has considerably lower

00:17:02.718 --> 00:17:07.168
costs when someone listens to a podcast compared to when they listen to a song.

00:17:08.248 --> 00:17:11.778
So, where does this leave Spotify, where does this leave

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:15.508
Joe Rogan, and where does it leave the podcast industry?

00:17:16.818 --> 00:17:21.658
For Spotify, it looks like a canny bet, a sensible decision.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:28.928
Spotify’s plan to become the go-to app for everything audio looks to be underway, and

00:17:29.098 --> 00:17:34.488
even though it hasn’t been complete plain sailing, it hasn't been completely easy,

00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:38.868
there have been some difficulties with Joe Rogan, there are encouraging results.

00:17:40.358 --> 00:17:46.148
For Joe Rogan, there are some critics that said he should have stayed independent, and that

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:51.158
he was already earning tens of millions of dollars a year without having to be answerable to

00:17:51.158 --> 00:17:57.458
anyone, but he no doubt wasn’t too upset with a cheque for a couple of hundred million dollars.

00:17:58.588 --> 00:18:03.128
And for all of the other millions of podcasts out there, such as this one,

00:18:03.528 --> 00:18:08.598
what does the future hold, and how does Joe Rogan and Spotify change this?

00:18:09.308 --> 00:18:15.118
Well, one of the great things about podcasts has historically been that they’re available anywhere.

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:21.278
There are dozens of podcast apps, and every podcast is available everywhere, to anyone.

00:18:22.498 --> 00:18:27.830
Not only does this mean that there isn’t one company that controls access to podcasts,

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:33.828
but for podcast listeners it means that it’s very easy to change apps, and for podcast

00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:39.238
producers, they can focus on making a great show rather than pleasing an algorithm.

00:18:40.644 --> 00:18:45.901
What Spotify is doing is…quite scary for lots of independent podcasts.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:50.328
It could, in theory, make podcasts pay to ensure their new

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:54.468
episodes are seen by their followers, in a similar way to Facebook.

00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:58.418
It could make podcasts pay every time an episode is listened to.

00:18:58.978 --> 00:19:02.388
It could charge a monthly fee to podcasters.

00:19:02.678 --> 00:19:07.558
It could add inappropriate adverts between episodes and collect 100%

00:19:07.568 --> 00:19:11.268
of the money from them, further squeezing independent podcasters.

00:19:12.338 --> 00:19:15.888
Talking about this show in particular, English Learning for Curious

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:20.178
Minds, Spotify has brought an increasing number of listeners to it.

00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:24.298
Perhaps you discovered it on Spotify, and in that case,

00:19:24.428 --> 00:19:28.078
great, I’m happy that Spotify decided to recommend it to you.

00:19:29.128 --> 00:19:35.878
But when any platform gets too powerful it can be bad news for independent businesses, so

00:19:36.048 --> 00:19:41.478
one can only hope that Spotify has the best interests of independent podcasters in mind.

00:19:42.528 --> 00:19:48.968
So, back to Joe Rogan, the highest-paid podcaster in the world, with a show Spotify wanted

00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:53.628
so much it was prepared to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to get its hands on it.

00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:57.928
If you haven’t listened to it, I’d definitely recommend checking it out.

00:19:58.758 --> 00:20:04.958
Of course, you have to go to Spotify to get it, but there are almost 2,000 episodes to choose from.

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:10.438
They’re long, the language can be tricky to understand, it is full of

00:20:10.648 --> 00:20:14.838
controversial figures and viewpoints, but it is certainly entertaining.

00:20:15.538 --> 00:20:16.398
Give it a listen.

00:20:16.418 --> 00:20:19.578
It’s full of adverts, but it is free to listen to.

00:20:20.578 --> 00:20:26.598
If you do, just remember that you’ll be listening to the most expensive podcast in the world.

00:20:28.858 --> 00:20:33.888
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Joe Rogan & Spotify.

00:20:34.258 --> 00:20:38.828
I know it’s a bit of a different topic to our normal ones, but especially for

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:43.198
those of you interested in the business side of podcasting, I hope you enjoyed it.

00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:47.448
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:47.808 --> 00:20:50.508
Have you listened to the Joe Rogan podcast before?

00:20:51.048 --> 00:20:51.683
Do you like it?

00:20:51.908 --> 00:20:53.398
Can you see why it is so popular?

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:59.698
What do you think Spotify’s responsibilities are as a publisher, or is it a platform?

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:03.212
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:06.604

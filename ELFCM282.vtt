Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:16.604
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:20.694
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:27.674
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Joe Rogan and Spotify.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.814
In May of 2020 Spotify announced that it had acquired the

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:37.524
exclusive rights to a podcast by a man called Joe Rogan.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:43.554
The amount Spotify reportedly paid for it was initially thought to be $100

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:48.304
million, but it’s now thought to have been double this amount, with the

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:54.854
company paying about $200 million to have this one podcast on Spotify.

00:00:55.414 --> 00:01:00.424
So the question we are going to ask ourselves in this episode is…why?

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:06.066
Why did Spotify pay so much money for one podcast, was it worth

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.954
it, and what does the future hold for podcasts on Spotify?

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:15.484
But before we get right into this episode, I want to remind you that you can

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:19.774

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:48.584
So, if you are ready to take the next step on your English

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:52.314
learning journey the place to go is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:57.594
Ok then, Joe Rogan and Spotify.

00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:02.094
Now, you may well be listening to this episode on Spotify.

00:02:02.714 --> 00:02:08.544
Up to half of the listeners of this show use Spotify to listen to it, and this percentage,

00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:13.954
at least for English Learning for Curious Minds, has been increasing almost every month.

00:02:14.714 --> 00:02:18.534
But until relatively recently, until a few years

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:22.004
ago, you couldn’t even listen to podcasts on Spotify.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:27.374
It was somewhere to listen to your favourite music, somewhere to make playlists,

00:02:27.374 --> 00:02:31.914
and you went elsewhere, you went to another app to listen to podcasts.

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:41.034
Spotify wanted to change that, and since 2019 Spotify has spent around $1 billion

00:02:41.034 --> 00:02:46.034
dollars trying to make its app the go-to place for people to listen to podcasts.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:52.864
It has bought podcast production companies, it has bought podcast technology companies, podcast

00:02:53.074 --> 00:03:00.014
advertising companies, but it’s most high-profile acquisition, the most famous “thing” it has

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:05.954
bought was one podcast, the “Joe Rogan Experience”, which is what we’ll be talking about today.

00:03:07.094 --> 00:03:12.864
Before we get into why Joe Rogan, it’s useful to have a quick reminder of

00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:18.064
how Spotify’s business model works, which will help us understand why it

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:23.057
decided to pay more money than it had ever paid before for a single podcast.

00:03:23.947 --> 00:03:27.047
So, Spotify is a music streaming app.

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:30.977
Anyone can download it and listen to their favourite songs.

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:36.197
You can listen to songs for free, but you have adverts after every few

00:03:36.197 --> 00:03:41.787
songs, and you have a limited number of times you can skip back and forward.

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:46.847
Or, if you want the full functionality of the service, you can buy

00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:51.964
a “Premium” version, which gives you unlimited skips and no adverts.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:55.637
Simple enough, and if you are one of the hundreds

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:59.027
of millions of Spotify users, you knew this already.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:07.487
But what you might not have known is how exactly Spotify makes money, or rather, how it loses money.

00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:13.567
With the Free version of Spotify, which about 60% of Spotify

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:18.327
users are on, Spotify makes money every time an advert is played.

00:04:18.787 --> 00:04:25.557
But every time you listen to a song, Spotify needs to pay the record label for that song.

00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:30.727
Now, you may have read articles about how little this amount of money

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:35.187
actually is, and how little the artists actually make from Spotify.

00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:43.627
But what perhaps you didn’t know is that Spotify actually loses money overall on every free user.

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:48.847
For the finance nerds out there, Spotify has a negative gross

00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:55.007
margin, a gross margin of -1.5%, for every non-Premium user.

00:04:56.417 --> 00:05:04.107
The Premium, on the other hand, is highly profitable, and makes up about 90% of Spotify’s revenue.

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:10.457
One way of looking at this is that the adverts exist primarily to

00:05:10.737 --> 00:05:15.247
annoy you, and push you into upgrading your subscription to Premium.

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:19.957
So, why all this chat about Spotify’s business model?

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:26.107
Well, because it’s helpful to understand why Spotify is interested in podcasts.

00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:31.527
If Spotify owns the rights to the content its users are

00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:35.337
listening to, it doesn’t need to pay when users listen to it.

00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:38.917
It can collect the money from advertising or from the

00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:42.237
Premium subscription without having to pay anything.

00:05:42.937 --> 00:05:44.997
And this is where podcasts come in.

00:05:45.847 --> 00:05:50.867
Now, the business model for the majority of podcasts is advertising.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:56.467
A podcast will go to a business and say “hey, I’ll tell my listeners to buy your

00:05:56.607 --> 00:06:02.457
insurance, or energy drink or vitamin pills, and you pay me a certain amount of money”.

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:08.057
Depending on how many downloads a podcast has and how dedicated

00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:12.347
and valuable its listeners are, the amount it can charge varies.

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:17.787
And the podcast with both an incredibly large number of listeners and

00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:24.447
die-hard loyal and dedicated fans is one called the Joe Rogan Experience.

00:06:25.057 --> 00:06:30.297
Now, you may have heard of this podcast before, and perhaps you’ve even listened to it.

00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:36.037
It wouldn’t be surprising, as it has been for several years the most popular

00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:41.817
podcast in the world, with an estimated 200 million downloads every month.

00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:46.687
The Joe Rogan Experience has been going since 2009.

00:06:47.017 --> 00:06:52.137
It’s an interview-style podcast, where Joe Rogan interviews people

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:57.137
from a wide range of backgrounds, often with controversial viewpoints.

00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:03.657
He has interviewed Elon Musk, where the pair famously smoked cannabis on air.

00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:09.177
He interviewed the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the disgraced cyclist, Lance

00:07:09.207 --> 00:07:15.027
Armstrong, and he even interviewed the famous and also disgraced boxer, Mike Tyson.

00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:19.257
Joe Rogan himself is an interesting character.

00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:23.627
He was an actor and comedian, then became a commentator

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:27.817
for UFC, the American Mixed Martial Arts show.

00:07:28.557 --> 00:07:34.027
He isn’t tall, but he is a big, muscly guy with tattoos all up his arms.

00:07:34.577 --> 00:07:39.897
He looks like the sort of person you wouldn’t want to pick a fight with, and looks very

00:07:39.937 --> 00:07:45.657
different to the sort of person that people were used to seeing as a talk-show host.

00:07:46.787 --> 00:07:53.767
And, despite what other criticisms people might have of him, he is an excellent interviewer.

00:07:54.637 --> 00:08:00.697
He has done almost 2000 podcast episodes, with episodes ranging anywhere

00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:05.707
from 1 to 5 hours long, so he certainly has had time to practise.

00:08:06.627 --> 00:08:11.807
But he has this remarkable down-to-earth nature, almost like a guy

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:16.477
you would meet at a bar who is just great at asking questions, and can

00:08:16.507 --> 00:08:21.097
keep a conversation going for hours on end, for a long period of time.

00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:24.657
And clearly, his approach works.

00:08:25.477 --> 00:08:31.737
His fans, who are predominantly young men, hang on his every word, they trust

00:08:31.737 --> 00:08:36.537
him, if he says something, or they hear something on his show, they are much more

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:42.657
likely to believe it than if they saw it on CNN or a more mainstream media outlet.

00:08:43.297 --> 00:08:45.007
This will be important later on.

00:08:46.397 --> 00:08:52.347
This combination of a very large and engaged audience put him on Spotify’s radar.

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:57.557
If it could “own” Joe Rogan, then it could make the tens of

00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:01.047
millions of dollars that Joe Rogan made every year from advertising.

00:09:01.757 --> 00:09:09.467
But, much more importantly, if it could force Joe Rogan’s loyal audience to use Spotify, not

00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:15.797
any other podcast app, then it would be able to bring tens of millions of new users to the app.

00:09:17.217 --> 00:09:22.607
These new users would hopefully start to listen to music on the app, probably on

00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:28.807
the free version, but like 40% of all Spotify users, they would get annoyed with

00:09:28.807 --> 00:09:34.437
the perpetual adverts and get pushed into the more profitable Premium subscription.

00:09:35.657 --> 00:09:41.727
So, after extended negotiations, reportedly with Joe Rogan initially unhappy

00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:47.997
with the offer from Spotify, on May 19th of 2020, Spotify announced that

00:09:48.017 --> 00:09:52.897
it had acquired the exclusive rights to stream The Joe Rogan Experience.

00:09:53.347 --> 00:10:00.237
The media reported the price tag as $100 million, but it’s now thought to be about double that.

00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:08.437
To commentators at the time, it seemed like a lot of money, even at the lower $100 million mark,

00:10:08.677 --> 00:10:14.587
but Spotify clearly thought that the bet would pay off, that they would make money from it.

00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:16.997
So, has it?

00:10:17.777 --> 00:10:20.507
Well, it certainly didn’t get off to a good start.

00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:27.017
A major part of Joe Rogan’s appeal was that he was a controversial character,

00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:32.497
and he was unafraid to have guests with controversial viewpoints on his show.

00:10:33.817 --> 00:10:39.087
With a 10-year history, it wasn’t hard for people to find Joe Rogan episodes

00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:44.357
from the back catalogue with controversial guests and controversial viewpoints.

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:51.337
And when he moved to Spotify, Rogan vowed that the show wasn’t going to change.

00:10:51.637 --> 00:10:56.177
It wasn’t going to become some clean, professional interview-style

00:10:56.187 --> 00:11:00.457
show like the tens of thousands of others that were out there because

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:05.057
that wasn’t Joe Rogan, and that wasn’t what people wanted to listen to.

00:11:05.637 --> 00:11:10.287
People wanted the raw, messy, unedited interview.

00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:14.907
They wanted conversations that would go on for hours at a time, they

00:11:15.037 --> 00:11:19.497
wanted Joe Rogan to interview people that they would never see on TV.

00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:24.007
And Joe Rogan, as he promised, didn’t change.

00:11:24.327 --> 00:11:31.407
He continued to be divisive, and this culminated in April of 2021 when he

00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:36.037
suggested that young, healthy people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine.

00:11:37.267 --> 00:11:44.237
To Joe Rogan fans and watchers, it was hardly surprising that he would take such a viewpoint.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:48.767
His opinions towards traditional medicine have always been

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:53.288
slightly sceptical, and Spotify knew this when it bought his show.

00:11:54.538 --> 00:12:00.588
The critics, however, said that this was reckless and dangerous by Spotify, and

00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:05.776
that it was spreading COVID misinformation via the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

00:12:06.948 --> 00:12:13.268
Initially, Spotify put up its hands and said “hey, we’re just the streaming service, we don’t

00:12:13.278 --> 00:12:19.898
have editorial control over Joe Rogan”, but this didn’t cut the mustard, it wasn’t enough.

00:12:20.898 --> 00:12:28.208
A group of 270 scientists and healthcare professionals wrote an open letter to Spotify

00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:34.808
expressing their concern, and then in January of 2022 several high-profile musicians,

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:40.407
including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, started removing their music from Spotify.

00:12:41.268 --> 00:12:46.948
There were calls for Spotify to drop Joe Rogan altogether, calls that he was too

00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:52.288
controversial for an uncontroversial company like Spotify to continue to support.

00:12:53.494 --> 00:13:00.338
Spotify knew that its attractiveness as a service relies on having lots of music available on it.

00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:06.618
If people can’t listen to their favourite musicians on Spotify, well they’ll go somewhere else.

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:13.248
It was, understandably, a worrying time, but like these things tend

00:13:13.248 --> 00:13:18.198
to do, the controversy fizzled out, and Neil Young and Joni Mitchell’s

00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:23.208
boycott of the company didn’t lead to a mass exodus by other artists.

00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:28.658
This controversy, however, did raise important questions

00:13:28.898 --> 00:13:33.778
about the line, the division, between publisher and platform.

00:13:34.998 --> 00:13:41.088
A publisher is something that actually publishes content and is responsible for it.

00:13:41.878 --> 00:13:47.778
If an article is published in The Guardian newspaper, The Guardian has chosen

00:13:47.908 --> 00:13:53.838
to publish it, if the article is misleading or controversial or wrong, The

00:13:53.838 --> 00:13:58.378
Guardian takes responsibility for it, it doesn’t put up its hands and say

00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:02.706
“hey, we’re just a newspaper, you should blame the journalist who wrote it”.

00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:09.758
A platform on the other hand, is something like Twitter, YouTube or Facebook.

00:14:10.378 --> 00:14:16.208
Given the instant nature of posting something on those platforms, and the sheer amount of

00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:22.498
content that is uploaded every second, it is very hard for these companies to actually police,

00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:27.814
to monitor, what people are uploading, if you even believe that it should be policed, that is.

00:14:28.754 --> 00:14:33.924
Of course, this is a much more complicated subject than we have time for in this episode, but

00:14:34.104 --> 00:14:40.014
the point to underline is that the Spotify and Joe Rogan situation was a little different.

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:47.154
For most podcasts on the Spotify app, Spotify can rightfully say that it doesn’t have any

00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:52.684
editorial control over what is said in the podcast, because, well, there are millions to

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:57.584
choose from and Spotify simply provides a convenient way for people to listen to them.

00:14:58.754 --> 00:15:05.314
With Joe Rogan, Spotify not only had the exclusive rights to it, but it made money from it.

00:15:06.144 --> 00:15:11.004
Surely, the critics said, this meant that it had more responsibility?

00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:19.494
Spotify eventually decided to remove over 100 of Joe Rogan’s most controversial episodes from its

00:15:19.494 --> 00:15:26.184
service, but this again put it into the dangerous category of “publisher” rather than “platform”.

00:15:27.074 --> 00:15:32.574
If it says it’s just a platform and not responsible for what Joe Rogan says, yet

00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:38.214
it pays him $200 million to have controversial guests and opinions and it has

00:15:38.214 --> 00:15:43.124
the right to remove episodes, can it really continue to claim to be a platform?

00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:49.614
It’s certainly an interesting debate, and one without a definitive answer.

00:15:50.924 --> 00:15:55.714
Something that does seem clearer, though, is that Spotify’s big bet

00:15:55.724 --> 00:16:00.484
into podcasting is showing early promise, it is looking encouraging.

00:16:01.404 --> 00:16:06.834
Spotify’s podcast advertising business generated €200 million

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:11.774
in revenue in 2021, it was up 300% from the previous year.

00:16:12.584 --> 00:16:17.344
There are now 4 million podcasts available on Spotify, including this one of

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:22.814
course, and Spotify users are increasingly listening to podcasts as well as music.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:28.394
And it’s doing exactly what it hoped in terms of encouraging users

00:16:28.394 --> 00:16:33.404
to turn Spotify into their go-to app for listening to anything audio.

00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:39.554
And although Spotify doesn’t currently put adverts between podcast

00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:43.734
episodes, analysts have suggested that this won’t be the case forever.

00:16:44.684 --> 00:16:50.884
Spotify knows that the main reason people upgrade to their Premium subscription is to get

00:16:50.894 --> 00:16:56.064
rid off these adverts, so when it feels confident that there are enough people listening

00:16:56.064 --> 00:17:02.294
to podcasts on Spotify, it can add advertising to push people towards upgrading their

00:17:02.294 --> 00:17:07.314
accounts, and that will be when the money starts to roll in, theoretically at least.

00:17:08.214 --> 00:17:12.344
And because it has the exclusive rights to shows like the Joe Rogan

00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:16.615
Experience, people can’t simply go to another podcast app, because

00:17:16.845 --> 00:17:20.134
they'll have to stay with Spotify to listen to their favourite show.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.460
What’s more, and this is one of the major reasons why podcasting is so attractive

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:31.010
to Spotify, Spotify doesn’t pay podcasters when someone listens to the show.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:39.450
Unlike songs, where Spotify pays between 0.3 and 0.5 cents every time a song

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.860
is played, Spotify pays nothing to podcasts, so it has considerably lower

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.350
costs when someone listens to a podcast compared to when they listen to a song.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.960
So, where does this leave Spotify, where does this leave

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.690
Joe Rogan, and where does it leave the podcast industry?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.840
For Spotify, it looks like a canny bet, a sensible decision.

00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:11.110
Spotify’s plan to become the go-to app for everything audio looks to be underway, and

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.670
even though it hasn’t been complete plain sailing, it hasn't been completely easy,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.050
there have been some difficulties with Joe Rogan, there are encouraging results.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:28.330
For Joe Rogan, there are some critics that said he should have stayed independent, and that

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.340
he was already earning tens of millions of dollars a year without having to be answerable to

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:39.640
anyone, but he no doubt wasn’t too upset with a cheque for a couple of hundred million dollars.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.310
And for all of the other millions of podcasts out there, such as this one,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:50.780
what does the future hold, and how does Joe Rogan and Spotify change this?

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:57.300
Well, one of the great things about podcasts has historically been that they’re available anywhere.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.460
There are dozens of podcast apps, and every podcast is available everywhere, to anyone.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.011
Not only does this mean that there isn’t one company that controls access to podcasts,

00:19:10.206 --> 00:19:16.010
but for podcast listeners it means that it’s very easy to change apps, and for podcast

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:21.420
producers, they can focus on making a great show rather than pleasing an algorithm.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:28.082
What Spotify is doing is…quite scary for lots of independent podcasts.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.510
It could, in theory, make podcasts pay to ensure their new

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.650
episodes are seen by their followers, in a similar way to Facebook.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.600
It could make podcasts pay every time an episode is listened to.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.569
It could charge a monthly fee to podcasters.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.740
It could add inappropriate adverts between episodes and collect 100%

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.450
of the money from them, further squeezing independent podcasters.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.070
Talking about this show in particular, English Learning for Curious

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.360
Minds, Spotify has brought an increasing number of listeners to it.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.480
Perhaps you discovered it on Spotify, and in that case,

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.260
great, I’m happy that Spotify decided to recommend it to you.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:18.060
But when any platform gets too powerful it can be bad news for independent businesses, so

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.660
one can only hope that Spotify has the best interests of independent podcasters in mind.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:31.150
So, back to Joe Rogan, the highest-paid podcaster in the world, with a show Spotify wanted

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.810
so much it was prepared to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to get its hands on it.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.110
If you haven’t listened to it, I’d definitely recommend checking it out.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:47.140
Of course, you have to go to Spotify to get it, but there are almost 2,000 episodes to choose from.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.620
They’re long, the language can be tricky to understand, it is full of

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.020
controversial figures and viewpoints, but it is certainly entertaining.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.580
Give it a listen.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.760
It’s full of adverts, but it is free to listen to.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:08.780
If you do, just remember that you’ll be listening to the most expensive podcast in the world.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.070
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Joe Rogan & Spotify.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.010
I know it’s a bit of a different topic to our normal ones, but especially for

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.380
those of you interested in the business side of podcasting, I hope you enjoyed it.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.630
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.690
Have you listened to the Joe Rogan podcast before?

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.865
Do you like it?

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.580
Can you see why it is so popular?

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.880
What do you think Spotify’s responsibilities are as a publisher, or is it a platform?

00:21:42.464 --> 00:21:45.634
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:50.445

00:21:55.715 --> 00:22:01.395
And in case you needed a reminder, this podcast isn’t paid $200 million dollars by Spotify.

00:22:01.715 --> 00:22:04.099
In fact, it’s not paid anything by Spotify.

00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:08.765
The business model of this show is a little different - we have a membership, which

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:13.775
gives you access to all of our bonus episodes, transcripts, subtitles and vocabulary.

00:22:34.635 --> 00:22:40.045
the show, then I would love for you to think about leaving a review, or a star rating on Spotify.

00:22:40.355 --> 00:22:43.265
It takes less than 30 seconds to do, but they are

00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:47.155
super helpful, and each one brings a smile to my face.

00:22:48.435 --> 00:22:52.755

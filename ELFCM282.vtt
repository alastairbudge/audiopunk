Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:15.931
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:20.071
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:27.331
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of this three-part mini series on The Atomic Bomb.

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:32.911
In part one we looked at the Manhattan Project and the creation of the bomb.

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:38.690
In part two, we looked at what happened when the bombs were actually dropped on Hiroshima and

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.980
Nagasaki, and in today’s episode, part three, we are going to talk about the aftermath of the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.970
atomic bomb, and look at some of the difficult ethical questions that the atomic bomb has raised.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.460
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.540
At the end of the last episode, part two, an American bomber had

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.360
just dropped “Fat Man”, an innocent sounding object, on Nagasaki.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.080
“Fat Man” was far from innocent.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.730
It was a plutonium bomb with an explosive force of 21,000 kilotonnes, and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.210
together with its little brother, Little Boy", the two bombs killed anywhere from

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.680
130,000 to 230,000 people in the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima respectively.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.710
Shortly afterwards, Japan surrendered, and World War II was over.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.610
This was over three quarters of a century ago now, but ever since

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.890
questions have been asked about whether the United States was justified

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.380
in its use of the most powerful deadly weapons ever used on civilians.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.250
In short, should the United States have dropped the bombs?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.310
To explore this subject further, let’s first remind ourselves of the background.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.920
Since the 1930s scientists in Europe had hypotheses about

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.090
the explosive and destructive power of atomic energy.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.860
With developments in nuclear fission–the process of actually splitting

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.340
the nucleus to create a powerful reaction–the idea of creating

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.620
an atomic bomb was moving from the theoretical to the possible.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.840
When war broke out in Europe in 1939, there was increasing pressure in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.500
America to push forward and start work developing a bomb, as there was the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.600
very real fear that Hitler and the Nazis would be able to develop one first.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.510
This resulted in the Manhattan Project in 1942, which resulted in

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.430
the first atomic test in New Mexico in July of 1945, and then the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.690
first detonation of an atomic bomb a wartime enemy in August of 1945.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.890
The American rationale for dropping the atomic bomb was, on one level, a simple one.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.010
It will save American lives in the long run.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.127
Here’s President Truman saying exactly that:

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.071
We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war in order

00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.661
to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:28.330
If you missed that, he said: "We have used it in order to shorten the agony of

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.131
war in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.”

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:39.345
The United States had lost around 160,000 soldiers in the Pacific War,

00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:44.865
including 20,000 taking just the small islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:50.285
And almost a quarter of a million more were injured, and the war in

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:54.505
the Pacific showed few signs of easing up, of becoming any less bloody.

00:03:55.995 --> 00:04:00.635
On the Japanese side, the losses were considerable, and Japanese

00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:03.855
soldiers really did fight to the death rather than surrender.

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:11.275
In the fierce battle to take Okinawa, of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers defending the island,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:18.465
99% fought to the death rather than surrendered, and in the case of Okinawa it was 94%.

00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:25.025
The Japanese military leaders proudly said that any invasion of the Japanese

00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:30.255
mainland would be met with similar resistance, and the Japanese Vice Admiral,

00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:36.395
Takijirō Ōnishi, who was known as the father of the kamikaze, estimated that up to

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:42.175
20 million Japanese would lose their lives if and when the Allied forces invaded.

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:47.705
And a full-scale invasion of Japan would most likely have been the next

00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:53.475
step, and plans had been drawn up to start this in November of 1945.

00:04:54.565 --> 00:05:00.095
American military strategists estimated that this would have cost between 130,000

00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:06.695
and 220,000 American lives just in the first phase of the invasion, and there would

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:13.495
be between 400,000 and 800,000 Allied deaths in total before Japan surrendered.

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:19.725
The Americans, or rather the Allied forces, were sure that victory

00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:24.315
would come, it would just be a question of how many lives, and let’s be

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:28.195
frank, American lives, would be lost before the Japanese surrendered.

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:34.485
The Atomic Bomb, so the argument went, would be a quick and clean

00:05:34.485 --> 00:05:38.975
way of forcing Japan to surrender without losing any Allied lives.

00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:43.395
And you might think that the dropping of the atomic bombs

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:47.895
resulted in no Allied deaths, but this isn’t actually quite right.

00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:54.385
There were several prisoners of war being held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and when the

00:05:54.385 --> 00:06:01.275
bombs were dropped 12 Americans, 1 British and 7 Dutch soldiers were killed in the blast.

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:08.728
Still 20 Allied deaths as opposed to an estimated 800,000 is, at

00:06:08.738 --> 00:06:12.528
least by the standards of the original objective, a positive result.

00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:19.228
And, not that this was the primary concern for the Americans, the death toll

00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:24.398
for the Japanese from the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even if we

00:06:24.398 --> 00:06:30.768
take the higher estimate of 230,000, was still significantly less than might

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:34.988
have been expected had the Japanese mainland been invaded by the Allied forces.

00:06:35.898 --> 00:06:42.428
As a reminder, Japanese Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi’s estimated that up to 20 million Japanese

00:06:42.428 --> 00:06:49.508
would lose their lives, so “only” losing 230,000 seems like quite a good deal by that standard.

00:06:50.438 --> 00:06:57.838
So, at first glance, to many back in Europe and in America, and still today to its supporters,

00:06:57.988 --> 00:07:03.008
the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had done exactly what they were meant to have done.

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:08.858
But almost ever since the bombs exploded, questions have

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:11.628
been asked about whether they were really necessary.

00:07:12.618 --> 00:07:16.828
As you will no doubt know, this is a debate that has been going on

00:07:17.068 --> 00:07:22.458
for decades with no easy answers, but I will try to summarise some of

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:26.706
the main arguments for and against the dropping of the atomic bombs.

00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:33.358
In terms of the main arguments for the dropping of the bombs, these were the

00:07:33.358 --> 00:07:37.888
ones put forward by the American military, and indeed by President Truman,

00:07:38.148 --> 00:07:42.568
who authorised the use of atomic weapons on the Japanese civilian population.

00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:47.958
It’s also clear that this was not a rash decision, a

00:07:48.098 --> 00:07:51.608
choice taken without substantial thought and consideration.

00:07:52.588 --> 00:07:57.418
There was a top-secret committee set up in May of 1945 called “The

00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:02.438
Interim Committee”, which was dedicated to researching, debating, and

00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:07.328
ultimately advising the president on the use of nuclear weapons in war.

00:08:08.648 --> 00:08:13.368
President Truman wrote in his diary: “It seems to be the most

00:08:13.378 --> 00:08:18.208
terrible thing ever discovered, but it can be made the most useful…”

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:24.268
Truman clearly believed that dropping the atomic bomb was the most effective

00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:30.188
way of ending World War II, but this act has subsequently been criticised as a

00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:36.788
war crime, an act of state terrorism, and simply unnecessary in winning the war.

00:08:38.148 --> 00:08:41.418
These arguments, the arguments against dropping the bomb

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:45.988
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki fall into three main categories.

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:52.578
Firstly, that the United States should have dropped a bomb, but it should have

00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:58.738
been dropped in an empty area, a neutral area, or above the sea, where people

00:08:58.968 --> 00:09:02.638
wouldn’t have been killed but the power of the bomb would have been clear.

00:09:03.468 --> 00:09:09.148
Essentially the US should have dropped a bomb to frighten the Japanese into surrender.

00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:14.338
Secondly, that the United States shouldn’t have used the atomic

00:09:14.338 --> 00:09:17.758
bomb because the Japense would have surrendered without it.

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:23.838
As you may remember, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:28.278
invaded Manchuoko hours before the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.

00:09:29.122 --> 00:09:33.952
With the Soviet Union coming from the west and the Allies coming from

00:09:33.952 --> 00:09:37.697
the south and east, things were really not looking good for Japan.

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:46.297
Japan was also running dangerously short of supplies, 1945 had been the worst rice

00:09:46.327 --> 00:09:52.451
harvest since 1909, so not only was the country running out of supplies to fight a

00:09:52.451 --> 00:09:57.677
war, it was running out of supplies to feed its already tired and hungry population.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:04.997
A combination of a naval blockade of Japan, not allowing ships to get in and out,

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:11.177
and a traditional bombing would have resulted in far fewer deaths, and crippled

00:10:11.307 --> 00:10:16.837
Japan militarily, which, combined with increasing pressure from Russia from the

00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:21.977
west would have resulted in a Japanese surrender, so the second argument goes.

00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:28.947
And the third category of objection is on a moral or ethical level.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:35.627
The vast majority of those who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians, not soldiers.

00:10:36.377 --> 00:10:42.097
Of the up to 230,000 people killed, it’s estimated that only 20,000

00:10:42.097 --> 00:10:48.017
were soldiers, so only 9% of the victims were valid “military” targets.

00:10:49.012 --> 00:10:53.432
However many American lives Truman might have thought he was saving, there is no

00:10:53.432 --> 00:10:59.322
moral rationale for purposefully targeting innocent civilians, so the argument goes.

00:11:00.762 --> 00:11:06.382
To these arguments, the supporters of the use of atomic weapons tend to have counterpoints.

00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:13.542
The Japanese soldiers had shown themselves to be utterly fearless, and ready to fight to the end.

00:11:14.252 --> 00:11:19.432
There had already been a concentrated bombing campaign on mainland Japan for most

00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:26.005
of 1945, but firstly, damage to Japanese military factories had been less than

00:11:26.005 --> 00:11:31.715
anticipated, because these factories tended to be small workshops, and secondly these

00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:38.285
bombing campaigns simply didn’t seem to have really dented, damaged, Japanese morale.

00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:44.115
To the argument about a symbolic detonation of the bomb, proponents

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:48.975
suggest that it was too risky, and had the possibility of backfiring.

00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:55.815
If the US said to the Japanese, watch out at 12pm on this day we’re going to show

00:11:55.815 --> 00:12:01.095
you something powerful over this bit of the Pacific Ocean and the bomb hadn’t

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:07.075
detonated properly, or worse, if the Japanese had somehow managed to shoot down the

00:12:07.075 --> 00:12:11.865
aeroplane carrying the bomb, it would have had completely the opposite effect, it

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:18.035
would have bolstered Japanese morale and potentially prolonged, or extended, the war.

00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:25.135
At least by taking Japan by surprise, so the argument goes, these risks were minimised.

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:31.625
Now, in terms of who some of the major critics of using the bomb were, it might surprise

00:12:31.665 --> 00:12:36.375
you to find out, or maybe it won’t surprise you at all, that it tended to be the

00:12:36.395 --> 00:12:42.645
scientists who played a part in creating the bomb who were often most opposed to its use.

00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:50.165
Leó Szilárd, the Hungarian scientist who conceived the idea for splitting the atomic nucleus

00:12:50.285 --> 00:12:56.225
and urged Albert Einstein to write to FD Roosevelt in 1939 to start work on an atomic

00:12:56.225 --> 00:13:02.965
bomb, he became one of the biggest critics, pointing out that if Germans had used an atomic

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:08.375
bomb on a civilian population they would have been hanged for war crimes at Nuremberg.

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:15.705
Even Einstein came to regret his role in encouraging Roosevelt to invest in an atomic programme,

00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:21.552
saying that it was the biggest mistake he made in his life, and commenting "had I known

00:13:21.692 --> 00:13:26.702
that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing."

00:13:27.892 --> 00:13:33.286
In the years since the bombs were dropped, it is no exaggeration to say that hundreds of

00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:39.282
thousands of pages have been written and lives dedicated to the study of the rights and

00:13:39.282 --> 00:13:44.522
wrongs of dropping the atomic bombs, and what would have happened had they not been dropped.

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:50.282
Building on some of the arguments we’ve already mentioned, there was the theory that the

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:56.782
bombs were dropped as a sign to Soviet Russia of US military capability, and as a sign to

00:13:57.012 --> 00:14:02.552
“keep out” of East Asia and to not attempt any further military action in Eastern Europe.

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:09.332
There’s also the argument that racism and the dehumanisation of the Japanese people

00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:15.002
made it easier to justify dropping the bomb, as the American public had been so

00:14:15.002 --> 00:14:20.752
conditioned to think of the Japanese as fundamentally different to Americans that

00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:26.022
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Japanese wouldn’t be problematic to Americans.

00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:32.222
Historians have spent much of the past 75 years combing through piles

00:14:32.222 --> 00:14:36.962
of evidence, documents, and recordings, trying to understand whether the

00:14:36.962 --> 00:14:41.882
Japanese really were close to surrender, and whether the Americans knew this.

00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:48.462
Because, ultimately, the question of justification for dropping the bomb hinges on this.

00:14:49.212 --> 00:14:54.072
If the Japanese were not close to surrender, and wouldn’t have surrendered unless there

00:14:54.072 --> 00:14:59.502
was a full-scale invasion, then supporters of dropping the bomb have one valid point.

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:05.652
But if the Japanese were on the verge of surrender and the Americans knew it, well

00:15:05.952 --> 00:15:10.892
justifying the death of almost a quarter of a million civilians becomes a lot more difficult.

00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:18.008
And this is before we even get to the question of the atomic world we now live in, a world

00:15:18.088 --> 00:15:23.568
with atomic weapons with technology that can all be traced back to this period in time.

00:15:24.788 --> 00:15:31.128
It’s estimated that nine countries now have nuclear weapons: China, France, India,

00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:37.108
Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the UK and, of course, the United States.

00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:43.758
Between these nine countries, there are an estimated 13,000 nuclear weapons,

00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:49.848
with two countries, Russia and the USA, accounting for about 90% of the

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:54.328
world’s nuclear weapon supply, with Russia having slightly more than the US.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:59.208
And many of these weapons are significantly more powerful

00:15:59.378 --> 00:16:02.438
than the bombs that were dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:16:03.638 --> 00:16:08.798
While at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the US was able to drop atomic weapons being

00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:13.528
pretty sure that the Japanese hadn’t developed their own atomic weapons, so there

00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:18.308
was very little that they could do to fight back, this was soon no longer the case.

00:16:19.148 --> 00:16:26.668
As soon as the USSR developed its first atomic bomb, in August of 1949, it became clear that

00:16:26.678 --> 00:16:33.318
one atomic power using an atomic bomb on another atomic power would lead to mass destruction,

00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:39.293
potentially even what’s called Mutually Assured Destruction - the idea that by using these

00:16:39.293 --> 00:16:45.453
weapons you guarantee not just the destruction of your enemy, but also your own destruction.

00:16:46.615 --> 00:16:52.015
And coming to the present day, while for many people in the 21st century the

00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:59.195
idea of atomic, or nuclear war, seemed theoretical, a relic of the Cold War, the

00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:03.405
Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought it right back to the public attention.

00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:10.245
So, bringing it back to the original subject of this mini-series, the atomic bombs at Hiroshima

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:16.335
and Nagasaki, there are few events in history that have been so divisive, that have been so

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:21.875
deadly, and where there has been such a clear choice to either take one path or the other.

00:17:23.065 --> 00:17:30.345
The path was chosen, two bombs were dropped, and the Pandora’s box of a nuclear world was opened.

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:37.405
Time will only tell whether humans will ever decide that there is the shared willpower, strength

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:44.335
and determination to work together to put those 13,000 nuclear bombs back in their Pandora's box.

00:17:47.302 --> 00:17:52.632
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the aftermath of Hiroshima and

00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:57.842
Nagasaki, and with that comes the end of this mini-series on the Atomic Bomb.

00:17:58.312 --> 00:18:04.359
It’s evidently a frightening topic, but it’s fascinating and important, so I hope you enjoyed it.

00:18:04.782 --> 00:18:09.452
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series.

00:18:09.972 --> 00:18:14.142
Do you think the United States was justified in dropping the atomic bomb?

00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:17.722
Do you think there will ever be a world without nuclear weapons?

00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:22.562
How has your opinion on this changed, if at all, in the past year or so?

00:18:23.212 --> 00:18:24.322
I would love to know.

00:18:24.532 --> 00:18:27.362

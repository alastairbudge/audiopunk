Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:11.130
English.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.730
The show where you can learn weird and wonderful things about the world at the same time as

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.960
improving your English.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:25.515
Today, we are talking about the countries that sell their passports.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:34.395
It may just be a piece of paper, but a passport has become the ultimate status symbol for the ultra

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:40.635
rich, with around a billion dollars in passports being bought every year.

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:49.740
Today we'll be discussing why people are buying passports, how it all works and what the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:57.930
implications might be for our concept of sovereignty and nationality, of what a country actually is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.220
and what it means.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.510
Before all that though, let me just quickly remind those of you listening to the podcast on your

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.020
favourite podcast app that you can find a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.540
over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.880
The transcript and key vocabulary are super helpful for following every single word and building up

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.810
your vocabulary, and if you are listening to this episode with the express intention of improving

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.200
your English, well, I'm confident that you will do that a lot faster with the learning materials in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.680
front of you.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.320
So go and check that out, it is at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.525
Okay then, let's talk about buying passports.

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:56.281
I think we all know what a passport is, so we can skip that part, but what is worth clarifying is

00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:01.141
exactly how you can get a passport and what a passport gives you.

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:07.531
So there are five general ways in which you can get a passport.

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:15.266
Firstly, the most obvious one is through birth, through your ancestry, by descent.

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:23.796
The rules depend on the country, of course, but generally some combination of parents, grandparents,

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:30.216
and even great-grandparents will mean that you can get a passport just because of who your family

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:30.576
is.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:36.536
Secondly, just being born in a particular place.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:42.476
Some countries grant citizenship to that country just by birthright.

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:49.206
The United States is probably the example of this that most of you will be aware of.

00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:55.116
Thirdly, we could call this category "time".

00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:01.286
If you live in a country for a certain period of time, you can often get a passport from that

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:01.736
country.

00:03:02.273 --> 00:03:10.420
The times vary hugely, but most countries offer some sort of this way to get a passport.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.080
Fourth, we have a sort of weird category of "being flexible" or "big life changes", as I'd call it.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:27.691
So that's things like marrying a citizen of another country, giving birth in another country, or

00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:31.021
even converting to another religion, like Judaism.

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:37.831
These are some of the things that you can do to get another passport of certain countries.

00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.291
We are not really going to talk about any of these ones today though.

00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:48.022
We are going to talk about reason number five, method number five.

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:56.047
And that's for people who either don't have the time, the will, or the ability to do any of the

00:03:56.047 --> 00:04:01.388
above, but what they do have is cold, hard cash.

00:04:02.528 --> 00:04:04.518
Money, dollar bills.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.638
Our option number five is that you can buy citizenship.

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:12.818
You can buy a passport from another country.

00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:24.488
Now, the concept of buying a passport goes back to 1984 when Saint Kitts and Nevis, a small

00:04:24.548 --> 00:04:32.228
two-island country in the Caribbean, introduced the first and original what's called "Citizenship

00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:33.498
Investment Programme".

00:04:34.388 --> 00:04:40.148
In short, the way for you to pay the government and get a passport from that country.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:48.476
But back in 1984, to state the obvious, the world was a very different place.

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:50.936
The Cold War was still going on.

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:58.496
East Asia and the Middle East were still relatively underdeveloped and there were considerably fewer

00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:02.036
ultra rich people in the world than there are now.

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:12.836
So, to give you an example, the richest person in America in 1984 was John Paul Getty, who had an

00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:16.436
estimated fortune of $4.2 billion.

00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:25.837
Yes, obviously that's a lot of money, but even adjusting for inflation, he wouldn't be in the top

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.377
100 richest people in the world in 2020.

00:05:31.777 --> 00:05:39.677
So when the first cash for passports scheme opened up, it wasn't hugely popular as firstly, there

00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:42.787
just weren't that many massively rich people.

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:51.183
And secondly, there weren't that many advantages of getting a passport from another country, of

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:52.083
buying a passport.

00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:56.853
It was mainly for tax and security reasons.

00:05:57.303 --> 00:06:03.463
You could, in some cases, pay a lower rate of tax, and if you lived in a country with a government

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:10.278
that you didn't trust not to steal your possessions, well, you could become a citizen of Saint Kitts

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:10.938
and Nevis.

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:20.071
However, over the next 30 years or so, as the world has become more and more globalised, and places

00:06:20.071 --> 00:06:27.241
like Russia, China, and countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East have started to produce

00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:33.016
incredibly rich people, demand for passports has boomed.

00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:35.224
And why is this?

00:06:35.764 --> 00:06:40.564
Why are the super rich suddenly so keen to start collecting passports?

00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:43.313
Well, there are a few reasons.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:51.803
Firstly, as I said before, with some countries offering pretty generous tax incentives for people to

00:06:51.803 --> 00:06:58.938
buy a passport and take up residency in a country, for some super rich people, it becomes a

00:06:58.938 --> 00:06:59.988
financial decision.

00:07:00.618 --> 00:07:02.148
They just want to save money.

00:07:03.828 --> 00:07:08.388
And the second reason we could sort of call an insurance policy.

00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:14.943
As I said, if you don't trust the government not to steal your money if you get on the wrong side of

00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:21.663
them, well then it's quite sensible to be able to take that money out of the country and leave it

00:07:21.663 --> 00:07:25.113
somewhere else, in a country that you trust a little bit more.

00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:31.449
And it's not just that people sometimes don't trust the government not to steal their money, things

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:32.469
can be even worse.

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:39.939
If you really get on the wrong side of your government, as has happened to quite a few super rich

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:46.629
people in Russia, for example, some oligarchs, well then you might find yourself not only with all

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:52.659
of your money being taken, being seized, but you might also find yourself in a prison cell.

00:07:53.845 --> 00:08:02.110
So you want to have the ability to have the safety of having a new home, a new country that counts

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.089
you as one of its own, that counts you as one of its own citizens.

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:15.869
But the key thing here is that for many of the holders of these bought passports, they don't

00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:20.547
actually need to go to that country very much, if at all.

00:08:21.245 --> 00:08:29.685
One of the main attractions now is the ability to travel to other countries visa free, without a

00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:30.075
visa.

00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:39.310
Especially for people from places like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, if they want to visit a

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:46.060
country in Europe, let's say, they have to go to the embassy, apply for a visa, and obviously it

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.490
takes time and is a hassle to do.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:57.580
Yes, they might fly to Europe on a private jet, but without the right passport, they still have the

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.330
same visa problems as anyone else from their country.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:10.477
The attraction of getting a second, or sometimes even third, fourth or fifth passport is that these

00:09:10.477 --> 00:09:17.557
passports offer you visa-free access to a plethora of different countries.

00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:27.307
Europe, for example, has the Schengen area and so one passport, even from a non Schengen country

00:09:27.487 --> 00:09:34.747
such as Saint Kitts and Nevis since 2009, means that you can visit all 26 countries in the Schengen

00:09:34.747 --> 00:09:35.167
area.

00:09:36.123 --> 00:09:41.315
For some people who are buying these passports, this is a lifestyle thing.

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:50.100
They are so rich and unaccustomed, unused, to any restrictions in their day-to-day life that they

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.010
just want the freedom to travel and not worry.

00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:57.224
And for others, it's partly a business thing.

00:09:57.884 --> 00:10:05.214
If you are, let's say, a business person from China and you want to visit a client in London, then

00:10:05.264 --> 00:10:13.334
Paris and Berlin, you would have to go and apply for a UK and a Schengen visa, wait a few weeks for

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:18.584
it to be processed, then you'd have a long and tedious immigration process.

00:10:19.334 --> 00:10:26.324
With the right passport, you skip the queue, literally, and walk into almost any country you want.

00:10:27.784 --> 00:10:30.964
So it's pretty evident why people want them.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:37.584
It's the flexibility, the protection, and in lots of cases, the tax savings.

00:10:38.908 --> 00:10:42.628
But who are the countries that are actually selling them though?

00:10:43.438 --> 00:10:46.378
And how much does it actually cost to get one?

00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:52.758
In terms of the countries that are selling them, there are almost too many to name really.

00:10:54.015 --> 00:10:59.965
A passport from Antigua and Barbuda can be yours from $100,000.

00:11:00.835 --> 00:11:08.275
The classic Saint Kitts and Nevis passport is slightly more, so it's from around $150,000.

00:11:09.595 --> 00:11:16.525
Malta, one of the most popular passports, will set you back around a million dollars when you factor

00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:17.455
everything in.

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:25.450
The UK will even grant you a British passport if you fork out over two and a half million dollars,

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:30.574
although I should point out that the requirements here are quite a bit more strict.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:39.670
In general, the more powerful the passport in terms of the visa-free travel that it offers, the more

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.890
expensive it is, as you might imagine.

00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:47.722
But you might ask, why are these countries selling passports?

00:11:48.532 --> 00:11:54.686
Some of them have fought hard for independence, often from colonial powers.

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:59.786
They fought hard to be their own country, to be able to offer their own passports.

00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:08.141
Why are they then just selling the right to become a citizen to the highest bidder, who in many

00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:12.941
cases isn't actually bidding very much, in the grand scheme of things?

00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:17.861
The answer is easy: money, cash.

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:24.551
There are a few similarities between the countries that sell passports most aggressively.

00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:31.347
Often they are small islands, frequently with some kind of colonial past.

00:12:32.427 --> 00:12:39.927
They don't have that many natural resources or ways to generate money, so they need to get a little

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:40.677
bit creative.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:48.193
Passports don't really cost them anything to produce, in financial terms at least.

00:12:48.973 --> 00:12:54.913
And they can be incredibly lucrative, they can make these countries a lot of money.

00:12:55.769 --> 00:13:07.133
For Saint Kitts and Nevis, passport sales account for about 25% of its GDP, 25% of all of the money

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:08.543
generated in the country.

00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:17.553
And even for Malta, a European Union country, and one that prides itself on various other

00:13:17.553 --> 00:13:27.513
industries, passport sales accounted for almost the entire government surplus in 2018, and are

00:13:27.513 --> 00:13:35.089
partially credited for Malta being one of the fastest growing economies in Europe over the last five

00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:35.719
years or so.

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:39.679
So for Malta, passports are very important.

00:13:40.797 --> 00:13:47.817
For these countries, selling passports is an absolute gold mine, at least on a superficial level.

00:13:48.904 --> 00:13:55.681
They don't really need to give anything away, and in most cases, the people who they are selling the

00:13:55.681 --> 00:14:01.921
passports to don't really need to spend much time at all in the country.

00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:12.396
For Vanuatu, the small group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, only one in ten people who bought

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:15.966
Vanuatu passports have ever even been to the country.

00:14:16.998 --> 00:14:23.482
There are many cash for passport schemes in the Caribbean, where countries struggle to raise

00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:32.092
investment through traditional means, and so they have turned to passports as a quick, easy and

00:14:32.302 --> 00:14:35.062
cheap way to bring money into the country.

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:45.089
Of course in a lot of these countries, there are quite a lot of question marks over who the real

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:51.479
beneficiaries are of this money, where the money actually ends up.

00:14:53.009 --> 00:15:00.089
In Malta, for example, there are widespread allegations of corruption relating to the passport sales

00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:00.539
program.

00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:08.444
Daphne Caruana Galizia, whose name you may recognise, was Malta's most famous investigative

00:15:08.444 --> 00:15:12.554
journalist, and she was a huge critic of the passport scheme.

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:22.424
The reason you may recognise her name is because she was blown up by a car bomb in October, 2017.

00:15:23.636 --> 00:15:28.946
I should add though, it's not thought that she was murdered because she was investigating the

00:15:28.946 --> 00:15:29.546
passport scheme.

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:39.976
In any case, it's thought by many to be a pretty murky business, filled with slightly unscrupulous

00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:42.796
characters, some quite shady people.

00:15:43.996 --> 00:15:52.066
Critics of the schemes in general say that they erode the value of nationhood and of sovereignty.

00:15:53.186 --> 00:16:04.998
If a passport can be bought and sold, borders don't really exist for the 1% or the 0.1%, 0.01%, for

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:06.108
the ultra rich.

00:16:07.608 --> 00:16:16.248
And for these ultra rich with multiple passports, on the one hand, they have now become citizens of

00:16:16.248 --> 00:16:23.358
several countries, but on the other hand, they are sort of citizens of none.

00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:29.718
In many cases, the passport holders spend very little time in the country.

00:16:30.258 --> 00:16:36.348
They don't speak the language and have no interaction with the local people or culture.

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:45.299
They are citizens in name only, really, and if they have escaped their home country, they are now

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:47.279
essentially stateless.

00:16:49.326 --> 00:16:56.586
In addition to this, as many of the "cash for passports" schemes make the person buying their

00:16:56.586 --> 00:17:03.336
passport buy or rent a property in the country, this reduces the amount of available property for

00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:07.626
local people and of course increases the prices for local people.

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:15.906
Houses lay empty, with entire blocks of flats just pitch black in the evening, with the lights out,

00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:23.203
because they are all owned by "citizens", in inverted commas, citizens who never actually live

00:17:23.203 --> 00:17:23.473
there.

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:30.967
This is certainly the case in Malta, which suffers from a huge housing shortage and has been

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:39.997
experiencing a construction boom, all while the properties from these new citizens are empty, with

00:17:39.997 --> 00:17:45.292
some of the houses, probably never having been set foot in by their owners.

00:17:45.502 --> 00:17:48.382
They just exist so that they can say they have a house there.

00:17:50.001 --> 00:17:56.215
In the "cash for passports" industry, or the citizenship by investment, as it's technically called,

00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:05.449
it's clear that there's definitely one big winner though, and that is the middlemen, the agents, the

00:18:05.779 --> 00:18:09.319
companies who arrange all of these passport sales.

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:20.221
The most famous one is called Henley & Partners and its founder, a Swiss man called Christian Kälin

00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:24.586
has been dubbed, he's been nicknamed "The Passport King".

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:33.026
Henley & Partners is the company that markets and sells passports for countries all over the world,

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:41.306
and it was the mastermind behind the schemes in Saint Kitts and Nevis as well as in Malta.

00:18:42.217 --> 00:18:44.133
And they made a lot of money.

00:18:44.913 --> 00:18:52.683
In Saint Kitts, Henley & Partners would reportedly earn $20,000 for each passport it sold.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:19:02.900
As of October, 2018 Saint Kitts had sold 16,000 of them, which if they had all been sold by Henley

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.060
& Partners would have netted them a cool $32 million.

00:19:08.494 --> 00:19:16.837
In Malta, Henley & Partners gets around 4% of each passport sale, so that's around $40,000.

00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:24.907
And since the scheme started in 2014 they have made around $40 million in commission.

00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:29.929
So you know what they say about the gold rush in America?

00:19:30.427 --> 00:19:36.710
It wasn't the people digging for gold that became rich, but the people selling shovels, the people

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.560
who sold the tools to find the gold.

00:19:40.832 --> 00:19:48.033
If we think of passports as the new gold for the ultra rich, then Henley & Partners, and The

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:52.563
Passport King are definitely getting rich selling the shovels.

00:19:54.309 --> 00:19:58.007
Okay then that is it for passports.

00:19:58.262 --> 00:20:07.147
It is a pretty interesting concept and the concept of who gets a passport and why is quite relevant

00:20:07.177 --> 00:20:08.467
to me personally.

00:20:09.607 --> 00:20:15.667
As regular listeners to the podcast may remember, I actually live in Malta, one of the biggest

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:17.257
passport sellers in the world.

00:20:17.774 --> 00:20:23.605
I don't live here because I bought a passport, but I can live here because I was lucky enough to be

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:30.715
born in the UK, to British parents and get a British passport for free, I guess.

00:20:31.015 --> 00:20:37.675
So just through luck, I get a passport that other people need to pay millions of dollars for.

00:20:38.547 --> 00:20:45.187
And at the end of this month, at the end of April, I will also be able to get an Italian passport,

00:20:45.517 --> 00:20:47.317
because my wife is Italian.

00:20:48.037 --> 00:20:49.927
I'll be able to get one for free, I should add.

00:20:51.262 --> 00:20:53.122
But do I really need one?

00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:55.012
Do I deserve to have one?

00:20:55.792 --> 00:21:03.352
I certainly don't think I'm any more deserving than someone who was born in Italy and who has lived

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:10.882
all of their life in Italy, but to non-Italian parents, which by the way is the case for a child

00:21:10.912 --> 00:21:16.832
born in Italy who might live in Italy for the formative years of their life, but to non-Italian

00:21:16.852 --> 00:21:19.252
parents - they can't get an Italian passport.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:27.760
And finally, I have a little boy who was born in Malta and has lived all of his six-month life so

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.660
far in Malta.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:35.320
He doesn't get a Maltese passport at least until he decides to pay the Maltese government $1

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:35.770
million.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:44.020
But someone else who has absolutely no connections to Malta whatsoever can, for the right price, of

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.320
course.

00:21:45.882 --> 00:21:51.836
So whatever you think of the countries that sell the passports, the people who buy them, and the

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:58.406
middlemen who make it all possible, you can't deny that it is a pretty weird and interesting

00:21:58.466 --> 00:21:59.006
phenomenon.

00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:04.786
Right, as always, I'd love to know what you think of the show.

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:11.596
We do actually have a few listeners from some of the countries that I mentioned, so if that's you,

00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:14.761
or even if it isn't, I'd love to hear from you.

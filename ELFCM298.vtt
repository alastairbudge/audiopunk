Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:16.508
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:20.698
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:27.238
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the history of climate change.

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:34.428
We all know about the crisis our planet faces due to its rising temperature, and given that this

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:40.858
rise has only accelerated over the last fifty years, it may seem like a fairly recent discovery.

00:00:41.648 --> 00:00:47.298
But the understanding of mankind’s impact on the climate is much older than you may think.

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:50.988
So that’s what we will be talking about today, the long,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:55.298
complicated, but absolutely fascinating history of climate change.

00:00:56.457 --> 00:01:00.065
Okay then a brief history of climate change.

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:06.565
Ideas around humanity’s influence on the environment have existed for millennia.

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:13.514
Theophrastus, a student of ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, wrote about how

00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:20.014
draining marshlands caused certain areas to freeze, and he discussed how clearing

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:25.664
forests may warm up the land by allowing more sunlight to reach the Earth’s surface.

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:32.524
By the time of the Renaissance, in the 16th century, European scholars were writing about

00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:38.754
how deforestation and farming had altered the landscape and potentially, weather systems too.

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:45.244
And such theories became commonplace after North America was colonised and

00:01:45.444 --> 00:01:51.014
transformed from forest land to farmland throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:01:51.894 --> 00:01:57.834
American farmers noticed such a change in the weather that by the 19th century people

00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:04.524
began to believe that cultivating soil increased rainfall and made the land more fertile.

00:02:05.384 --> 00:02:09.214
This led to a boom in settlements across America’s Great

00:02:09.214 --> 00:02:13.954
Plains, an arid, dry, area east of the Rocky Mountains.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:19.874
The theory became known as the ‘Rain Follows the Plough’ theory but

00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:24.974
it has now been discredited, it has been proved to not be true, after

00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:29.404
modern scientists revealed that it was based on unreliable data.

00:02:29.944 --> 00:02:31.824
It was all just a coincidence.

00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:40.614
Around the same time that America’s landscape was being altered, in the 1820s Joseph Fourier, a

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:47.464
French Mathematician, began studying the Earth’s temperature, and he made an important discovery.

00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:55.084
Fourier calculated that due to the Earth’s size and distance from the Sun, it should be far

00:02:55.084 --> 00:03:01.964
cooler than it is, which lead him to propose that the Earth’s atmosphere insulated the planet.

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:08.164
Fourier was the first to theorise what is now known as the Greenhouse Effect.

00:03:08.894 --> 00:03:14.044
The Greenhouse Effect is, as you may know – in very simple terms – how

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:18.284
certain gases in the Earth’s atmosphere prevent heat from the sun

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:22.694
escaping back into the solar system, thus insulating the planet.

00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:30.237
This idea was developed in 1856 by an American scientist called Eunice Newton

00:03:30.237 --> 00:03:35.414
Foote who conducted experiments to assess how gases interact with sunlight.

00:03:36.364 --> 00:03:43.598
She found that CO2, Carbon Dioxide, heated up the quickest and kept its temperature the longest.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:48.346
Foote theorised that a change in the level of CO2 in

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:51.586
the atmosphere could affect the Earth’s temperature.

00:03:52.956 --> 00:03:59.216
This was clearly an incredibly important discovery, but being in the unfortunate position

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:05.526
of a woman in the 19th century, Foote was not taken seriously in the scientific community.

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:11.666
Her paper was presented by fellow scientist Joseph Henry at the American

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:16.476
Association for the Advancement of Science, but it was largely ignored,

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:22.817
with Foote’s findings dismissed as amateur, as not credible, not believable.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:28.896
Therefore, despite her landmark study, Foote’s findings fell

00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:32.585
into the shadow of those of the Irish physicist, John Tyndall.

00:04:33.555 --> 00:04:36.955
Tyndall, as a man, of course, did not suffer the

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:40.215
disadvantage of a woman’s position in society at the time.

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:47.385
He was well educated and had access to superior resources to aid, to help his experiments.

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:52.915
Tyndall’s experiments were similar to Foote’s but far more advanced.

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:59.828
In 1859, he analysed how infrared radiation specifically was absorbed

00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:05.168
by different gases, and found that gas produced by burning coal [which

00:05:05.308 --> 00:05:10.538
contained water vapour, methane and CO2], absorbed almost all the heat.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.378
CO2 in particular absorbed 1000 times more than normal air.

00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:21.678
Perhaps the vast quantity of coal that was being burned to power

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:25.918
Western industrial growth might be having unintended effects...

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:32.968
By 1896, the role of CO2 in the atmosphere began to get more attention.

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:37.508
Around this time, there was also much interest in the scientific

00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:41.598
community around the causes for the Earth’s periodic Ice Ages.

00:05:42.798 --> 00:05:47.608
Such interest influenced the studies of the Swedish scientist Svante

00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:52.008
Arrhenius, whose mother was called Carolina Thunberg Arrhenius.

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:58.808
You may recognise the name Thunberg from a more recent and more famous climate change figure.

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:05.388
And indeed, Greta Thunberg is, apparently, a very distant relation to Arrhenius.

00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:12.788
But Arrhenius was not initially interested in global warming, rather, the opposite.

00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:19.786
He initially set out to see whether decreasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere could have been

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:27.506
a reason for past Ice Ages, and he found that if CO2 levels halved, the Earth’s temperature

00:06:27.746 --> 00:06:33.216
could cool by roughly 5 degrees, which would have been enough to bring about an Ice Age.

00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:38.666
This led Arrhenius to thinking about whether the reverse was true,

00:06:39.216 --> 00:06:43.666
and if increased CO2 levels could increase the Earth’s temperature.

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:48.166
Unsurprisingly perhaps, he found that this was correct.

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:50.506
But he didn’t stop there.

00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:55.646
He went on to conclude in later work that emissions caused by burning

00:06:55.646 --> 00:07:00.326
fossil-fuels such as coal could also contribute to a rise in temperature.

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:06.216
For Arrhenius, though, this was not a concern, it wasn’t a problem, as he

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:12.526
calculated that it would take 3000 years for CO2 levels to rise by 50%.

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:19.996
He was right in principle, but his timeline was way off, it was a large miscalculation.

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:27.418
In reality, it has actually taken 100 years for CO2 levels to rise 30%.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:34.256
But besides his conservative prediction, Arrhenius actually liked the idea of a warmer planet.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:39.566
In 1908, he wrote about how increasing CO2 levels could

00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:42.766
bring ‘better climates’ for ‘colder regions of the Earth’.

00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:47.926
It would also, he claimed, bring ‘much more abundant crops than

00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:51.936
at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind’.

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:58.817
In other words, a warmer planet meant more food and the growth of human civilisation.

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:04.546
Another key figure involved in the early science of climate change, the

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:09.716
Englishman Guy Callendar, also thought global warming was a good thing.

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:15.896
And in 1938 he supported Arrhenius’s proposals, demonstrating

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:19.466
that the planet had, in fact, warmed due to human activity.

00:08:20.376 --> 00:08:25.436
Callendar had a keen interest in meteorology, the study of the weather

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:29.586
and the atmosphere, and he began collecting data in his spare time.

00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:36.736
With records from 147 weather stations around the world, Callendar identified that

00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:45.396
global temperatures had risen by 0.05 °C every decade, and he calculated that 150

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:50.436
billion tonnes of CO2 had been added to the atmosphere due to burning fossil-fuels.

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:57.286
Only a quarter of this CO2 could be absorbed by the Earth, primarily via the ocean.

00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:04.103
But despite his findings, Callendar was largely ignored by the scientific community.

00:09:04.803 --> 00:09:08.933
Being a wealthy engineer only conducting such research in his

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:14.193
spare time, he was viewed as a meddling gentleman, an interfering

00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:19.183
non-scientist, who had no credentials or reliability in meteorology.

00:09:20.183 --> 00:09:25.223
Additionally, even since Arrhenius’s research, people could not believe that

00:09:25.223 --> 00:09:29.623
humanity could have an impact on something as large as the Earth’s climate.

00:09:30.663 --> 00:09:34.873
Studies that suggested this were often scoffed at, ridiculed,

00:09:35.063 --> 00:09:38.573
dismissed, and considered to be errors within data.

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:43.493
As such, Callendar’s results were not given much attention.

00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:50.833
And, besides, the Earth’s warming was still believed by many to be potentially a good thing.

00:09:51.843 --> 00:09:56.234
Callendar himself claimed that it would prevent what he called ‘the return

00:09:56.364 --> 00:10:01.044
of the deadly glaciers’, the large blocks of ice that had caused the Ice Age.

00:10:01.714 --> 00:10:05.414
He also believed that burning fossil-fuels would warm the

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:08.914
Earth enough to allow plants to be cultivated further North.

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:13.987
However, within twenty years of this statement, London would

00:10:13.987 --> 00:10:17.747
suffer extreme consequences because of its polluting emissions.

00:10:19.207 --> 00:10:24.207
Since the Industrial Revolution, smog, fog made from pollutants in

00:10:24.217 --> 00:10:28.407
the atmosphere, had become a fairly normal thing for life in London.

00:10:29.557 --> 00:10:34.077
But on the evening of the 5th December 1952, there

00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:37.967
was a smog like nobody had ever experienced before.

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:41.657
This became known as The Great Smog.

00:10:42.647 --> 00:10:46.997
The day came after a period of very cold and windless weather.

00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:52.132
The conditions meant that pollution in the air could not be dispersed,

00:10:52.322 --> 00:10:57.312
spread out or blown away, and instead, pollutants collected over the city.

00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:02.802
By nightfall, visibility was just a few metres.

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:08.522
In certain areas people could not even see their own feet, they were stuck inside

00:11:08.522 --> 00:11:14.362
a black cloud, caused entirely by burning fossil fuels in and around the capital.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:21.122
People were told to stay indoors, public transport was stopped and driving was impossible.

00:11:21.912 --> 00:11:24.802
It became dangerous to get those suffering to hospitals.

00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:31.172
The thick toxic fog lasted for four days and modern research suggests

00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:36.442
that between 10 and 12 thousand people lost their lives due to the smog.

00:11:37.612 --> 00:11:41.612
We know now that this kind of pollution can cause a massive collection of

00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:46.942
health issues, including respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer.

00:11:47.702 --> 00:11:54.362
Even today, it is estimated that pollution is responsible for around one in six deaths worldwide.

00:11:55.442 --> 00:12:00.252
And this is despite the attention that the Great Smog brought to the dangers of pollution.

00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:06.372
Clearly, burning fossil fuels showed itself to have a negative direct impact

00:12:06.382 --> 00:12:11.602
on people in the form of pollution, but its impact on the global climate was

00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:15.832
still debated, despite increasing evidence from the scientific community.

00:12:16.962 --> 00:12:25.122
In 1958, the American scientist Charles David Keeling actually proved that CO2 levels were rising

00:12:25.332 --> 00:12:32.062
and that it could be attributed to human activities – this has become known as the Keeling Curve.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:39.752
Keeling, with a PhD and access to accurate laboratory equipment managed to convince the scientific

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:47.312
community more than Callendar had, but still, the effects of this proof was largely undecided.

00:12:48.062 --> 00:12:50.722
Were rising CO2 levels bad?

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:51.632
Were they good?

00:12:51.852 --> 00:12:53.702
Or did they simply not matter?

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:58.712
The following decades even saw fears that the Earth may

00:12:58.982 --> 00:13:03.312
actually cool and there was concern over a future Ice Age.

00:13:04.022 --> 00:13:10.542
This might seem ludicrous, hard to believe to us today but a 1971 paper

00:13:10.772 --> 00:13:15.902
by Stephen Schneider led to a media frenzy which quickly spread the idea.

00:13:16.972 --> 00:13:21.112
Schneider had suggested that the cooling potential of pollution particles

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:27.232
could actually outweigh the warming effects of CO2, and he proposed

00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:31.352
that if the pollutants increased there could be another Ice Age.

00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:35.852
Put another way, we needed to keep increasing fossil fuel

00:13:35.852 --> 00:13:39.622
consumption to avoid the world falling into another Ice Age.

00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:48.542
The following years, in 1972 and 1973, there were severe winters in Asia and the U.S,

00:13:48.882 --> 00:13:53.871
and–as you can imagine–this did little to convince people that Schneider was wrong.

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:59.731
What if rising CO2 levels meant global cooling, not global warming?

00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:05.011
In reality, Schneider’s paper was still a minority and

00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:08.041
there were far more studies to support global warming.

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:14.801
In 1977 Schneider himself even admitted that he had overestimated the

00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:19.621
cooling effects of pollution and underestimated the heating effects of CO2.

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:23.011
In other words, he said that he was wrong.

00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:28.631
But it was not until the 1980s that the scientific community began

00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:32.661
to come to a consensus about global warming and its damaging impact.

00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:37.271
One event in particular had a huge influence.

00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:43.021
On the 23rd of June 1988, NASA scientist James E.

00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:47.181
Hansen delivered a speech to the US Senate in a bid to get the

00:14:47.181 --> 00:14:51.841
U.S government to take real action in combating rising CO2 levels.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:57.211
It was one of the hottest summers on record and Hansen had

00:14:57.211 --> 00:15:01.151
the A/C turned off during his speech to make a bigger impact.

00:15:02.251 --> 00:15:06.711
This speech was a big success and in the same year the

00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:11.661
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, was established.

00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:13.381
Calls from prominent

00:15:13.381 --> 00:15:17.261
scientists grew, together with freak weather patterns and droughts,

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:21.521
and the world began to take global warming a little bit more seriously.

00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:27.601
However, scientists’ voices were often in competition with another group, a group

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.931
that would suffer greatly if the world’s dependence on fossil fuels was reduced.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.071
The oil and gas industry.

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:38.561
As you may well know, this resulted in a huge

00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:42.331
disinformation campaign sponsored by oil and gas companies.

00:15:42.931 --> 00:15:50.361
ExxonMobil were very active in this controversy, and in the 1990s its CEO infamously claimed

00:15:50.411 --> 00:15:55.911
that evidence for climate change was ‘inconclusive’ and that global warming was doubtful.

00:15:56.911 --> 00:16:02.771
He made this statement despite his own company’s research proving global warming and its dangers.

00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:08.501
Nonetheless, over the next 20 years research continued into the possible

00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:12.961
consequences of global warming, all while its impact was clear to see.

00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:19.831
Acid rain, heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and melting glaciers were all

00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:25.581
identified as products of climate change, or “global heating” as it is now called by some.

00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:32.281
Despite all of this, and despite the massive amount of research and near unanimous

00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:37.751
agreement among scientists that climate change is man-made and is a great existential

00:16:37.751 --> 00:16:42.521
threat, the number of so-called “climate change deniers” has continued to grow.

00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:48.411
As you may have noticed, there are some similarities between modern “climate

00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:52.781
change deniers” and characters like Callendar from the early 20th century.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.851
Callendar believed that global warming might be a good

00:16:56.851 --> 00:17:00.571
thing, that cooler places will become warm and habitable.

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:08.351
As you may also have noticed, Callendar was English and Svante Arrhenius was Swedish, so warmer

00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:14.401
summers and less cold winters might be welcome in these cold, northern European countries.

00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:20.211
But clearly this ignores the fact that warm climates would become inhospitable

00:17:20.501 --> 00:17:24.291
and that it would lead to rising sea levels and catastrophic floods.

00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:30.847
And Callendar and Svante Arrhenius had none of the extensive research and studies that have

00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:38.071
been done now, so while we can understand and perhaps excuse an amateur meteorologist and a

00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:44.141
19th century Swede, the fact that every major global scientific body agrees that climate change

00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:50.341
is a large man-made problem suggests that the same excuses don’t apply in the 21st century.

00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:55.061
As you will know, politicians in many of the wealthiest nations in

00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:59.411
the world have found it politically useful to question climate change.

00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:07.051
In 2016, every single Republican presidential candidate had questioned or dismissed climate change.

00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:12.201
When Donald Trump became President, as you will remember, he removed the

00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:16.181
U.S from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change.

00:18:16.881 --> 00:18:22.727
What's more, and perhaps unbelievably, in 2020 Trump blamed the disastrous

00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:27.357
wildfires in California on the fact that forest floors were not clean enough,

00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:31.917
and he continued to insist that ‘It will start getting cooler, just you watch’.

00:18:32.907 --> 00:18:35.147
Of course, it has not been getting cooler.

00:18:36.147 --> 00:18:40.773
Over the last decade, we have seen countless consequences of global warming and

00:18:40.913 --> 00:18:46.263
the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit global warming to 1.5 °C is unlikely to be met.

00:18:47.353 --> 00:18:50.913
Consequently, when one thinks about global warming, it is

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:54.443
easy to be filled with a sense of hopelessness and despair.

00:18:55.363 --> 00:19:00.893
However, there is some hope against what often feels like the bleak reality of climate change.

00:19:01.743 --> 00:19:07.373
The targets set in the Paris Agreement have not been met but there is some positive news.

00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:12.993
Coal consumption has plummeted in the UK and the USA, while India’s

00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:17.523
growth in coal usage has slowed and China’s usage is levelling off.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:21.463
Renewable energy has become far less expensive and

00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:24.523
more efficient, a positive pattern for the future.

00:19:25.313 --> 00:19:30.553
In the last decade, wind energy has become 3 times cheaper, solar electricity 10

00:19:30.553 --> 00:19:35.573
times cheaper, and the batteries required to store their energy are 60% cheaper.

00:19:36.323 --> 00:19:40.533
And there have been technological developments in a huge variety of other

00:19:40.553 --> 00:19:45.193
areas that have a positive impact on reducing global carbon dioxide levels.

00:19:45.943 --> 00:19:51.043
From carbon removal technologies, which we strongly support and contribute to here at

00:19:51.053 --> 00:19:55.673
Leonardo English, through to lab-grown meat, there are a lot of positive developments.

00:19:56.283 --> 00:19:59.963
And there is clearly an increasing understanding of what can be

00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:03.393
done to reduce our individual contribution to climate change.

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:07.513
We can see some of the effects of all these positive trends

00:20:07.523 --> 00:20:13.578
already; for example, since 1990 EU emissions have fallen 34%.

00:20:14.408 --> 00:20:14.648
The U.K.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:18.325
emissions have fallen by 29% since 2010.

00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:22.743
And in the United States, the country that has emitted more

00:20:22.743 --> 00:20:28.623
CO2 than any other, emissions are 21% lower than 2005 levels.

00:20:29.503 --> 00:20:33.143
It might have taken well over a century to recognise the threat,

00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:37.033
but there is, perhaps, some light at the end of the tunnel.

00:20:39.283 --> 00:20:44.403
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on A Brief History of Climate Change.

00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:48.443
While I’m sure you know lots about global warming, perhaps you didn't know

00:20:48.443 --> 00:20:52.773
the story behind its discovery and how we got to the point we are today.

00:20:53.403 --> 00:20:57.353
Perhaps if more attention had been paid to neglected figures

00:20:57.353 --> 00:21:00.473
like Foote and Callendar, it may not have taken so long.

00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:05.103
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:05.483 --> 00:21:10.883
Why do you think it has taken so long for humans to accept the reality of climate change?

00:21:11.253 --> 00:21:13.193
Why do you think some people still don’t?

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:16.433
Do you feel hopeful about the planet’s climate future?

00:21:17.023 --> 00:21:19.843
What renewable technologies are you most interested in?

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:21.213
Carbon reduction?

00:21:21.483 --> 00:21:22.273
Electric cars?

00:21:22.443 --> 00:21:23.673
Or lab-grown burgers?

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:27.193
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

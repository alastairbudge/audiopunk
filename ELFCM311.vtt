Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:16.525
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:20.755
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:27.915
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of a three-part mini-series on the theme of Halloween.

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:35.195
In part one, we followed the story of vampires, from fictional vampires to real-life

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:40.295
ones, and discovered that even the real-life ones weren’t quite so real after all.

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:45.515
In part three we will look at the unfortunate life of witches,

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:49.065
or rather, women who have been accused of being witches.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:55.355
But today, in part two, we will be talking about werewolves, humans who have the

00:00:55.355 --> 00:01:01.715
mysterious power to turn into wolves, and who cause all sorts of chaos and violence.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:07.765
It’s an amazing story of accusation, torture, murder and cannibalism.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:13.395
This episode does also come with a bit of a warning that there will be some graphic

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:19.135
descriptions, so if you would rather not listen to those, then now is the time to press pause.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:26.995
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the mysterious and horrifying history of werewolves.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:36.331
Throughout the 1580s, around the rural town of Bedburg in Germany, there were a series

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:42.541
of violent and strange attacks on livestock, on sheep, cattle, and other animals.

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:48.131
At first the townspeople just blamed it on wolves, as

00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:50.621
they were known to have attacked animals in the past.

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:56.561
But after a couple of years of the attacks on animals, fears reached new

00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:01.021
heights when the first villagers, young children no less, were killed.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:07.221
Wolf attacks on people had always been far less common so the town

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.531
began to wonder what was to blame for the new string of casualties.

00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:18.351
Before long, two pregnant women were also among the ever-growing number of victims.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:23.031
And they had all been killed in truly horrific ways.

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:28.801
Both women had been sexually assaulted and their babies ripped from their wombs.

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:33.761
The children had been beaten, strangled, and some ripped open

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:38.401
and disembowelled, in other words, their organs had been removed.

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.111
Given the brutal nature of the attacks, people soon believed that

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:48.131
no ordinary man could have possibly carried out these crimes.

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:53.101
People began to talk of what beast could have possibly done this,

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:58.181
some arguing it was a demon, others insisting the violence must

00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:03.131
have been the act of a werewolf, a man who had turned into a wolf.

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:09.211
As the attacks on villagers continued, rumours began to emerge that people

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:14.941
had actually seen a fearsome wolf-like beast stalking residents’ properties.

00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:22.151
The town soon came to an agreement that they must take action and catch the beast.

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:28.231
So, the villagers armed themselves in preparation for the next attack.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:33.648
They also began to investigate individuals known, or I

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:37.858
should say “thought”, to be associated with black magic.

00:03:39.098 --> 00:03:43.033
One of these individuals was a man called Peter Stubbe.

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:49.088
Stubbe was a wealthy farmer who lived on the outskirts of the town and had

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:53.478
kept himself to himself after the death of his wife several years before.

00:03:54.843 --> 00:04:00.513
Although he was investigated, Stubbe was one of the townspeople to have suffered terribly

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:05.973
from the recent tragedies, as his son was one of the first children to be killed.

00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:13.343
Despite his personal tragedy, though, suspicions over Stubbe grew and they came

00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:18.653
to a head, or, reached their limit, after the events of one fateful evening.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:24.833
One evening, the townspeople were nervously awaiting the arrival of the beast.

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.063
It arrived, but the villagers were prepared.

00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:37.703
There was a ferocious fight, and in the commotion the villagers chopped off one of the beast’s paws.

00:04:38.813 --> 00:04:45.493
But they weren’t able to kill or catch it; it ran off into the night, never to be seen again.

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:52.733
Stubbe, however, was also nowhere to be seen during the battle with the beast.

00:04:54.133 --> 00:05:01.093
Suspicious of Stubbe’s coincidental absence that night, investigators decided to visit his home.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:06.123
When they arrived they were shocked to discover him

00:05:06.143 --> 00:05:11.423
treating a very serious wound, the loss of his hand.

00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:19.653
This was all the evidence they needed, they now knew the beast was none other than Stubbe himself.

00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:26.123
He was immediately arrested and brought in for interrogation but it did not take long

00:05:26.123 --> 00:05:32.713
to descend into brutal torture, which ultimately led to Stubbe confessing to the crimes.

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:40.473
During his confession, Stubbe made a shocking claim that he had made a deal with the Devil.

00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:47.593
He said that the Devil had awarded him a magic belt made from wolf fur which

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:54.233
transformed Stubbe into a giant, ferocious wolf with a hunger for human flesh.

00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:00.463
He admitted that he had indeed sexually assaulted the women he had killed, and

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:05.593
that not only had he taken their unborn babies, he had actually eaten them,

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:10.873
along with the organs of the children, children that included his own son.

00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:13.393
Grisly stuff indeed.

00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:17.893
And, as you will know, people in the 16th century

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:21.443
weren’t exactly known for their lenient punishments.

00:06:22.073 --> 00:06:30.003
So, Stubbe was sentenced to a horrific execution on the 31st of October, yes, on Halloween.

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:33.563
He was strapped to a large wheel.

00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:38.363
His flesh was pulled from his bones, his arms and legs were broken

00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:42.683
and only after all this, was his head chopped off with an axe.

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:50.303
Finally, his body was burnt to ensure he could never return and terrorise Bedburg again.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:54.663
A truly gruesome ending to a truly gruesome tale.

00:06:55.743 --> 00:07:02.633
Now, scholars have cast doubts over whether Stubbe really was a serial killer, or whether

00:07:02.703 --> 00:07:07.683
he had made a false confession due to the agony he suffered during his interrogation.

00:07:09.173 --> 00:07:14.373
Either way, the story demonstrates how werewolves were believed to be real

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:19.853
and were deeply feared throughout history, perhaps even more so than vampires.

00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:26.653
Indeed Stubbe was not alone, for throughout the Middle Ages tens of thousands

00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:31.607
of people were killed after facing similar accusations of being werewolves.

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:38.163
So, let’s rewind a bit, and see where the beliefs about werewolves came from.

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:42.926
Many consider the first account of a werewolf to be from the

00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:49.233
The Epic of Gilgamesh, the epic poem dating from around 2100 BC.

00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:54.753
The story tells of how Gilgamesh refuses to marry the goddess

00:07:54.883 --> 00:07:59.183
Ishtar because she had turned her previous lover into a wolf.

00:08:00.653 --> 00:08:06.233
Whether this story invented the idea of werewolves or was written because of existing

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:12.083
cultural beliefs is unclear, but it is the oldest surviving example of such a legend.

00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:15.377
That’s not to say it is the only example, though.

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:20.723
There are plenty of instances of werewolves in Greek and Norse mythology, too.

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:27.263
The Greek god Zeus, for example, transformed the tyrant Lycaon into a wolf

00:08:27.313 --> 00:08:32.413
after Lycaon had attempted to trick Zeus into eating human flesh at a banquet.

00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:37.803
In the 13th century, one of the original Norse werewolf

00:08:37.803 --> 00:08:41.933
tales was also immortalised in the Saga of the Volsungs.

00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:48.263
This story follows a father and son who, when in the forest, had found

00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:53.143
magical wolf skins that could turn people into wolves for ten days,

00:08:53.453 --> 00:08:57.543
similar to the belt Stubbe had claimed to have received from the Devil.

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:04.243
Unable to resist such powers, the father and son put on the wolf fur and

00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:09.833
began a killing spree which only ended when the father turned on his own son.

00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:16.233
Clearly, it’s a common feature in werewolf myths to see humans turned

00:09:16.293 --> 00:09:21.273
to ravenous beasts and who, like Stubbe, lose any human conscience

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:25.373
or sympathy for their fellow man, and cannot not resist killing.

00:09:26.753 --> 00:09:30.613
And although these two stories are from myth there are also

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:34.213
accounts discussing the real-life existence of werewolves, too.

00:09:35.163 --> 00:09:42.353
As early as 425 BC, the Greek historian Herodotus tells of a tribe of magical men,

00:09:42.593 --> 00:09:47.923
the Neuri, who transformed themselves into wolves for several days of the year.

00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:54.603
As you might expect, historians now believe that there was a perfectly logical

00:09:54.633 --> 00:10:01.433
explanation for this: the Neuri lived near Russia, in modern day Belarus, and their

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:07.533
so-called transformation was them wearing wolf skins in order to stay warm in winter.

00:10:08.443 --> 00:10:09.623
All very logical.

00:10:10.853 --> 00:10:16.783
But mistaking someone wearing a wolf skin for someone who has turned into a wolf is one

00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:22.973
isolated incident, and certainly doesn’t explain the huge popularity of the werewolf myth.

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:29.503
We might now say that it’s simply an attractive story, a great monster to

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:35.873
invent and believe in, but modern scholars argue that the belief in werewolves

00:10:36.173 --> 00:10:40.793
may have stemmed from some fundamental misunderstandings about the human body.

00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:45.103
Specifically, misunderstandings about illnesses.

00:10:46.573 --> 00:10:52.953
For instance, the concept of someone being bitten and then acting strangely could have

00:10:52.963 --> 00:10:58.813
come from, well, you may well have guessed it, rabies, the disease that still exists

00:10:58.813 --> 00:11:04.953
today and that you can get if you are bitten by an infected dog, fox, or other animal.

00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:10.283
Rabies affects the entire nervous system and even your

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:14.298
saliva, which means it is transferable through bites.

00:11:14.843 --> 00:11:19.703
When infected with the virus, people will often begin to act very strangely

00:11:19.943 --> 00:11:24.657
due to chemical imbalances in the brain that could even cause hallucinations.

00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:31.693
Those affected can struggle to sleep, making them active through the night just like werewolves.

00:11:32.783 --> 00:11:37.513
And that's not to mention the frothing at the mouth, dribbling, which certainly

00:11:37.513 --> 00:11:42.623
might have rang alarm bells at a time when these diseases were not at all understood.

00:11:43.443 --> 00:11:48.903
In fact, a werewolf would have been a pretty good explanation for all those symptoms,

00:11:49.263 --> 00:11:54.363
especially when there are other illnesses that could support the belief in such beasts, as well.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.383
One such condition, called congenital hypertrichosis

00:11:59.383 --> 00:12:03.103
terminalis, has even become known as werewolf syndrome.

00:12:04.443 --> 00:12:09.823
This condition causes excessive growth of dark hair and can lead to a sufferer’s

00:12:09.853 --> 00:12:15.923
entire face and hands being covered in thick dark hair that resembles animal fur.

00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:21.483
Though this condition is far rarer than rabies, it certainly

00:12:21.483 --> 00:12:24.273
would have strengthened beliefs in werewolves in the past.

00:12:25.213 --> 00:12:29.603
Even in the 19th century, sufferers of this condition were called

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:35.123
‘wolf-men’, and they were often put on display in circus freakshows.

00:12:35.973 --> 00:12:40.753
And while this caused no real health risks, there would clearly have

00:12:40.753 --> 00:12:45.163
been pretty serious psychological effects of being treated in such a way.

00:12:46.363 --> 00:12:52.533
There is, however, a rare illness, or delusion, that has no physical signs

00:12:52.743 --> 00:12:56.743
but does actually cause the sufferer to believe that they have become a wolf.

00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:00.193
And it’s called lycanthropy.

00:13:01.243 --> 00:13:05.503
Sure, this is a word you are incredibly unlikely to come across in any

00:13:05.503 --> 00:13:10.583
kind of normal conversation, but this is an episode about werewolves, and

00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:14.523
it’s a bit of fun trivia, so let me tell you a little bit more about it.

00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:21.433
People who suffer from lycanthropy actually believe that they have become wolves.

00:13:21.913 --> 00:13:27.793
They insist that their bodies have changed, they have grown fur and that they have large

00:13:27.913 --> 00:13:33.623
wolf-like teeth, though, in reality, none of this is true and they have not changed at all.

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:42.403
In some cases, sufferers even begin acting like wolves walking on their hands and feet and howling.

00:13:43.793 --> 00:13:50.033
In the 4th century, the Greek doctor Oribasus even discusses the condition

00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:55.583
saying that this behaviour was a symptom of ‘melancholia’, which was sort

00:13:55.583 --> 00:14:01.263
of a catch-all term used in the past for a variety of mental illnesses.

00:14:02.523 --> 00:14:09.083
Today, scientists are not exactly sure what causes lycanthropy but they believe it is often

00:14:09.093 --> 00:14:15.073
related to illnesses such as schizophrenia, severe mood disorders or even brain injuries.

00:14:15.943 --> 00:14:21.943
Although it's an incredibly rare condition, if someone had been exhibiting such behaviour

00:14:22.013 --> 00:14:26.983
in ancient times, then they would certainly have aroused suspicion of being a werewolf.

00:14:28.423 --> 00:14:33.513
And if you were accused of being a werewolf, well it wasn’t good news at all.

00:14:34.223 --> 00:14:38.333
Anyone who was accused of being a werewolf would be put on trial,

00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:42.223
and these trials were far more common than you might think.

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:47.763
Not in Britain, I should say, for the very good reason that wolves had been

00:14:47.763 --> 00:14:52.813
hunted to extinction by the 15th century, there were no wolves living in Britain.

00:14:53.873 --> 00:15:00.583
In France, however, wolves were still a real threat at the time and this of course fuelled

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:07.183
fears over werewolves, and France became the leader in werewolf trials and prosecutions.

00:15:08.553 --> 00:15:12.964
Some of the first to be put on trial, in the year 1521,

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:16.503
were the shepherds Michel Verdun and Pierre Burgot.

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:24.103
During the trial, Burgot had claimed that one night twenty years earlier, he was fearing

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:29.873
for the safety of his sheep when three figures wearing black had rode to his farm.

00:15:31.103 --> 00:15:37.743
One of the figures had told Burgot that if he acknowledged him as his lord he would protect

00:15:37.783 --> 00:15:44.833
the sheep, so Burgot renounced God and kissed the hand of the figure who offered protection.

00:15:45.893 --> 00:15:50.973
This strange encounter was his first step on a very dark path.

00:15:51.943 --> 00:15:55.283
A couple of years later, fellow shepherd Michel Verdun

00:15:55.563 --> 00:15:59.423
brought Burgot into the woods and forced him to strip naked.

00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:04.413
Burgot was then anointed, covered in a liquid, that

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:07.893
Verdun claimed could transform him into a werewolf.

00:16:09.373 --> 00:16:13.583
Shortly afterwards, Burgot said he had grown fur and

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:17.693
his hands and feet turned into giant wolf-like claws.

00:16:18.423 --> 00:16:25.053
The pair then went on a murderous rampage preying on travellers, fellow farmers and children.

00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:32.263
Like Stubbe, the pair tore their victims to pieces and even ate many of the children.

00:16:33.443 --> 00:16:37.793
At trial, the pair even admitted to acts of bestiality.

00:16:38.643 --> 00:16:42.933
Their reign of terror was stopped in a similar way to Stubbe’s as a

00:16:42.933 --> 00:16:48.023
traveller had fought off Verdun and severely injured him causing him to flee.

00:16:49.173 --> 00:16:54.933
But the brave, or perhaps foolish, traveller decided to follow the trail of blood

00:16:55.153 --> 00:17:00.543
and stumbled across a man with a wound in the very same place as the beast’s injury.

00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:05.333
Both men were found guilty and burnt alive.

00:17:06.203 --> 00:17:12.183
But they were far from the only ones, and scholars estimate that around 30,000

00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:17.959
people in France were executed for being werewolves between 1520 and 1630.

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:22.473
Clearly, they were not actually werewolves, but they

00:17:22.473 --> 00:17:25.683
were more likely people suffering serious mental illness.

00:17:26.383 --> 00:17:31.383
Some had, perhaps, committed terrible crimes, but it seems probable

00:17:31.503 --> 00:17:34.863
that most were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:17:36.203 --> 00:17:42.721
And as our understanding of science and the human body improved, and belief in superstition

00:17:42.883 --> 00:17:49.343
started to wane, the belief in werewolves began to fade just like it did for vampires.

00:17:50.423 --> 00:17:54.293
Instead of being at the centre of sensational trials at

00:17:54.293 --> 00:17:58.523
court, the creatures were relegated to stories and literature.

00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:03.363
Indeed, werewolves do appear in Bram Stoker’s Dracula.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:09.093
But in many of these early novels, including Stoker’s, werewolves

00:18:09.093 --> 00:18:13.663
were more minor figures while the vampires took the starring roles.

00:18:14.813 --> 00:18:19.443
It was not until 1933 that werewolves in popular culture really

00:18:19.443 --> 00:18:24.423
got their starring role, with Guy Endore’s The Werewolf of Paris, a

00:18:24.553 --> 00:18:28.733
novel which has been described as the Dracula of werewolf literature.

00:18:29.823 --> 00:18:34.203
This book has all you’d expect from a werewolf story, painful

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:38.153
transformations, secret killings, and feastings on flesh.

00:18:38.873 --> 00:18:44.702
It quickly rose to become a New York Times  bestseller, it was a huge hit.

00:18:45.952 --> 00:18:50.352
Keen to jump on the trend, cinema producers did not take long to bring

00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:55.612
the beast onto the big screen and in 1935 audiences were presented

00:18:55.742 --> 00:19:01.022
with the first image of a half-man half-wolf in The Werewolf of London.

00:19:02.062 --> 00:19:08.122
However, the film was a flop, a disappointment, it was a commercial and critical failure.

00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:13.242
It was not until The Wolf Man in 1941, that a werewolf

00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:16.782
movie would be celebrated and gain critical acclaim.

00:19:18.112 --> 00:19:22.312
And from here, werewolves were on an upward trajectory.

00:19:23.672 --> 00:19:29.472
Like vampires and witches, they became a mainstay of horror, science fiction and

00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:35.802
fantasy, and rather than being portrayed only as murderous beasts, they are often

00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:41.702
portrayed in a more nuanced, more complicated way, with hopes and dreams of their own.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:48.592
So, to wrap up this little jaunt into the world of werewolves, werewolves

00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:53.602
were once used to make sense of barbaric human acts, appearing in

00:19:53.772 --> 00:19:58.642
sensational stories that capture the fear of deeply superstitious societies.

00:19:59.292 --> 00:20:03.202
They were used as a convenient way to scapegoat people who

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.202
were probably suffering from terrible mental illnesses.

00:20:06.862 --> 00:20:11.152
But while their history can be, at least semi-rationally

00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:15.792
explained today, the idea of the werewolf has an enduring appeal.

00:20:16.622 --> 00:20:23.707
Perhaps it’s because wolves are the epitome of a wild and ravenous animal, perhaps it’s because

00:20:23.707 --> 00:20:30.727
it taps into pre-existing fears and superstitions about what happens on a full moon, or perhaps

00:20:30.907 --> 00:20:39.287
it’s because they remind us of the at times blurry, unclear, boundary between man and beast.

00:20:41.877 --> 00:20:46.517
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on werewolves.

00:20:46.697 --> 00:20:52.277
As a reminder, this was part two of a three part mini-series on the theme of Halloween.

00:20:52.827 --> 00:20:55.887
In our next and final episode of the series, we will

00:20:55.897 --> 00:20:59.027
be exploring the unfortunate history of witches.

00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:02.727
And if you missed part one, that was on Vampires.

00:21:03.577 --> 00:21:06.767
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:07.177 --> 00:21:12.007
What do you think the cultural obsession with werewolves tells us about ourselves?

00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:16.657
Are there interesting and unusual stories about werewolves from your country?

00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:20.307
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

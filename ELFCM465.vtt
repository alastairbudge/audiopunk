Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.239
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.379
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.049
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part four, the finale,

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.319
of our four-part series on the theme of Scotland.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.539
In case you missed them, part one was on “weird Scotland”,

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.599
where we looked at some unusual Scottish facts and traditions.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.149
Part two was on Donald Trump’s battle against Scottish villagers to build a golf course.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:47.389
Part three was on Scottish independence and part four, today’s episode, is going to be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:53.439
about one of the most brutal and divisive events in Scottish history: the Glencoe Massacre.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:01.569
It’s a story of politics, division, kings, religion, revolution, treachery and murder.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.829
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.319
There is a pub in Scotland called The Clachaig Inn.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.379
It’s a popular spot for hikers and locals alike, it has 25 bedrooms,

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:22.765
and even boasts a selection of 150 Scottish distilled gins.

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:29.009
But on the door to the pub is a perhaps confusing sign.

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:34.409
It reads “No hawkers or Campbells”.

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:40.589
To a non-native speaker, the word “hawker” might be unknown.

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:45.219
It means someone who goes from place to place trying to sell something.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:53.349
But you might know that Campbell is a surname, and it is a relatively popular one at that.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.559
You might have heard of Naomi Campbell, the supermodel, Alastair

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.939
Campbell, the journalist, or even Sol Campbell, the former footballer.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.239
A ban on hawkers might seem understandable, but on anyone with the surname Campbell?

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:16.459
A clue as to the reason why will come when I tell you that The Clachaig Inn

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.289
is in Glencoe, the site of the most atrocious and treacherous massacre in

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.219
Scottish history, a crime for which some people hold the Campbells responsible.

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.479
Now, before we get into the details of what actually happened,

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.239
let me paint you a picture of the lead up to this event.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.689
Scotland and England had historically been completely separate countries,

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:47.449
but like most European powers, had closely linked royal families,

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:52.829
with sons and daughters married to one another to maintain alliances.

00:02:54.619 --> 00:03:02.849
And in 1603, when Queen Elizabeth I of England died, she left no direct descendants to inherit

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.869
the English throne, so it went to her cousin James, who was the King of Scotland at that time.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:17.689
So James VI of Scotland became James I of England as well.

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.389
Scotland and England remained two separate countries, with their

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.879
own parliaments and laws, but they were both ruled by the same king.

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.829
This was called “The Union Of The Crowns”.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.699
Now we must talk about religion.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.799
James I was Protestant, but James II, who became king,

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:46.529
both of England and Scotland, in 1685, was Catholic.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.279
And Catholics by this point were a minority in Britain.

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.689
Initially, there was general public goodwill towards James II, the new

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:04.279
Catholic king, but as he started to implement pro-Catholic policies,

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:10.419
his popularity started to wane, and plots started to be hatched.

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.369
What happened next was the so-called “Glorious Revolution” of 1688, when

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:24.619
James II was kicked off the throne and a protestant Dutch prince called

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.609
William of Orange was invited to sail over to Britain and become king.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:37.259
And so he did, becoming William III of England, with James II going into exile.

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:46.589
The majority protestant population was happy with this, as there had been fears that James II was

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:53.149
going to impose greater restrictions on protestants, and turn the country back towards Catholicism.

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.069
But there was still a section of the population, in England,

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.719
Scotland, Wales and Ireland, that professed its loyalty to James.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:09.429
These were the so-called Jacobites, coming from the Latin word for James, “Jacobus”.

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:16.389
Now, they weren’t all supporters of James for religious reasons, they weren’t all Catholics.

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:24.869
Some supported him because they felt that he was the true king, appointed by God, and what

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.139
was the monarchy if some Dutchman could hop across the water and proclaim himself king?

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.849
Others were supporters of James because they felt that he would treat them

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:40.179
better than William would, and give back land that had been taken from them.

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:47.779
And outside Britain, the Jacobite movement was supported by Britain’s rivals for strategic reasons.

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:53.709
The movement was supported by European powers like the French, who believed it would be

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:59.819
politically and strategically useful to have William fighting threats on various sides.

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.039
And it wasn’t just a theoretical movement.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.366
James and the Jacobites were a real military threat, which culminated

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.989
in the Battle of The Boyne in Ireland in 1690, when forces loyal to

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:19.259
William of Orange defeated forces loyal to James, the exiled king.

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:26.269
James fled to France, but this was not the end of Jacobitism; he

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:30.369
still had supporters, in particular, in the Highlands of Scotland.

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:37.739
Now, as you may remember, the Highlands are in the northern part of Scotland, the mountainous

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:43.989
region that starts shortly north of Glasgow and Edinburgh and covers the north west of the country.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:50.759
It is an absolutely beautiful part of the British Isles, in my opinion nothing beats it.

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:56.949
There are mountains, rivers, forests and lakes, or “lochs”, as they are known in Scotland.

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:02.743
There are also valleys, or to give them their Scottish term, “glens”.

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.879
And at the time that we’re talking about now, the late 17th century,

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:15.269
these glens would typically be inhabited and ruled by a particular “clan”.

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.049
A clan is a group of people, similar to a tribe.

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:25.679
Clans are thought to have existed in Scotland from the 12th century or so,

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:30.579
and were typically structured with a clan chief, who would make decisions for

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:35.259
the clan, and if the king or queen of the country needed something, the clan

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:39.589
chief was the person who would enact their orders and speak for the clan..

00:07:41.148 --> 00:07:46.878
Now, many of these clans were Jacobites, and for various reasons.

00:07:48.078 --> 00:07:54.008
A minority were Catholics, but most supported James returning to the throne for

00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:59.898
political, economic or cultural reasons, believing that life would be better under

00:07:59.898 --> 00:08:06.338
James than William, and that James was the rightful heir to the throne, ordained by God.

00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:13.038
Fortunately for William, these Highland clans were relatively out of

00:08:13.048 --> 00:08:17.348
the way, right to the north of the country, and they did not have the

00:08:17.348 --> 00:08:22.328
military might or finances to pose a significant threat on their own.

00:08:23.658 --> 00:08:27.278
But still, they were there, biding their time.

00:08:28.448 --> 00:08:33.838
If a French, let’s say, army landed on the west coast of Scotland,

00:08:34.168 --> 00:08:38.758
it knew that it could quickly raise an army of loyal highlanders, and

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:44.148
march south towards government outposts and ultimately the capital.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:50.308
What William wanted was to quash this resistance once and

00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:54.028
for all, to put an end to support for the previous king.

00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:57.878
So he offered the clans a deal.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:08:59.138
Money.

00:09:00.568 --> 00:09:06.088
In March of 1690, William offered the Scottish clans a cash payment

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:12.578
of £12,000 in exchange for pledging their allegiance to him as king.

00:09:14.098 --> 00:09:21.318
It’s hard to get an exact conversion for £12,000 to today’s money, but it would have been in the

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:28.648
millions of Euros, a considerable amount of money, and a sum large enough to test anyone’s loyalty.

00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:37.058
The clans took a while to decide, and then wrote to their exiled king, James I, asking for

00:09:37.058 --> 00:09:44.507
permission to take the deal if he wasn’t going to mount an invasion before January 1st of 1692.

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:51.668
This was an important date, because the Scottish government had said that anyone who

00:09:51.718 --> 00:09:57.958
pledged allegiance to William before that date would be pardoned for any historic rebellion.

00:09:59.358 --> 00:10:06.478
And for those who hadn’t pledged alliance by then, well, the consequences would be serious.

00:10:08.198 --> 00:10:11.958
Most clans did sign the agreement, but not all.

00:10:13.428 --> 00:10:18.928
Once such a clan that missed the deadline was the MacDonalds of Glencoe.

00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:24.878
In fact, the MacDonald clan chief had tried to take the oath.

00:10:25.628 --> 00:10:30.288
He had gone to Fort William, where the Scottish government forces were garrisoned,

00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:35.108
to take the oath, but when he arrived the military governor said that he

00:10:35.108 --> 00:10:39.978
was not authorised to accept the oath, so the clan chief was sent elsewhere.

00:10:41.588 --> 00:10:45.148
In any case, the MacDonald clan missed the deadline.

00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:53.578
In fact, secretly, even before this deadline was missed, government officials had been

00:10:53.628 --> 00:10:59.268
planning to make an example of the MacDonalds, to show what happens when you resist the king.

00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:05.686
There are letters from the Secretary of State where he wrote to the military commander

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:12.056
of Scotland expressing his wish that the MacDonalds were wiped out, destroyed entirely.

00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:18.836
They had chosen the MacDonalds, reportedly, because they were a bit of a troublesome bunch.

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:23.226
They were big drinkers, minor criminals, not particularly

00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:26.546
well-liked by the neighbouring clans, and poor.

00:11:27.776 --> 00:11:28.796
They wouldn’t be missed.

00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:33.756
In the lead up to the fateful events that would unfold, a group of around

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:38.736
120 Scottish soldiers were sent to stay with the MacDonalds, in Glencoe.

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:43.496
There was nothing particularly unusual about this.

00:11:44.026 --> 00:11:47.356
Indeed, it was a form of tax that all clans would pay.

00:11:48.136 --> 00:11:51.836
Instead of making cash payments, clans would provide food

00:11:51.856 --> 00:11:55.756
and shelter for government forces, a sort of payment in kind.

00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:01.486
This group of soldiers had been with the MacDonalds for almost two weeks.

00:12:02.186 --> 00:12:06.496
They had eaten together, slept together, drank together, joked together,

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:10.376
they had spent two weeks together in the harsh Scottish winter.

00:12:11.126 --> 00:12:12.396
They would have grown close.

00:12:12.876 --> 00:12:16.656
And neither the soldiers on the ground nor the MacDonalds

00:12:16.876 --> 00:12:20.316
had any idea about the true reason they had been sent there.

00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:28.476
Then on the evening of February 12th, 1692, the commander of the forces, a minor

00:12:28.486 --> 00:12:34.486
Scottish lord called Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, received orders from above.

00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:38.876
Kill every member of the MacDonalds.

00:12:39.206 --> 00:12:40.276
Exterminate them.

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:47.546
In fact, the word used in the directive that had come all the way from the top, signed

00:12:47.786 --> 00:12:55.396
by King William III, was “extirpate”, meaning to completely eradicate, or destroy.

00:12:56.466 --> 00:13:02.566
The plan was as follows: the men would use the natural landscape to their advantage.

00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:06.526
One group of soldiers would block the northern exit of the

00:13:06.526 --> 00:13:10.776
valley, or glen, while another group would come up from the south.

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:17.756
In the valley, the soldiers, commanded by Captain Campbell, would kill every

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:23.246
man, woman and child and burn all property belonging to the MacDonalds.

00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:26.036
It was a massacre.

00:13:27.596 --> 00:13:32.096
It all started early, at 5am on February 13th.

00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:38.286
The soldiers went into the hut of the chief, Alasdair MacIain, yes,

00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:42.016
a man with the same name as me, albeit a slightly different spelling.

00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:45.066
The chief was not alarmed.

00:13:45.486 --> 00:13:48.306
He thought that the government soldiers were coming to greet him,

00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:52.256
perhaps they were leaving, and they had come to bid him farewell.

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:59.006
After all, he had welcomed them with open arms 12 days beforehand, he had broken bread with them,

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:04.796
joked with them, his family had provided them with warm hospitality, in the Highland tradition.

00:14:06.266 --> 00:14:10.966
They woke him up and shot him at point blank range four times.

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.766
The choice of weapon was deliberate.

00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:19.126
If they had liked, they could have killed him with a knife, or silently.

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:24.556
But no, they wanted to wake everyone up, to announce what was about to happen.

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:29.466
Now, was this because they wanted to strike fear into their

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:33.206
enemies hearts, or was it because they wanted to warn them?

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:39.026
The soldiers then went through the glen, massacring anyone that got

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:43.179
in their way, shooting them and stabbing them with their bayonets.

00:14:44.496 --> 00:14:51.166
Now, the final death toll is unknown and debated, thought to be at least 38 people,

00:14:51.586 --> 00:14:56.616
mostly women and young children, but it could be much higher, with others dying

00:14:56.616 --> 00:15:01.666
from exposure after running away and sheltering in the sub-zero temperatures.

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:07.746
Many of the MacDonalds did manage to flee, and there are historians who

00:15:07.746 --> 00:15:12.706
believe that many of the government soldiers who were tasked with carrying

00:15:12.706 --> 00:15:16.746
out this gruesome mission would have been happy to let the MacDonalds escape.

00:15:17.926 --> 00:15:22.376
After all, they had little issue with them personally, and would have been

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:26.576
fed and cared for by them for the best part of the previous two weeks.

00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:32.796
There are records of a couple of low-ranking soldiers who threw down their swords

00:15:32.826 --> 00:15:38.096
and refused to take part in the massacre, but no record of how many soldiers

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:42.736
might have turned a blind eye to the mother and her children fleeing to the hills.

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:49.776
Despite the number that might have got away, it was a massacre, with at least

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:56.136
30 lifeless bodies lying in the glen, their blood turning the February snow red.

00:15:57.136 --> 00:16:02.426
It was an atrocious event in British history, but for many years, it was

00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:07.746
painted as a local rivalry between two clans, the MacDonalds and the Campbells.

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:12.546
As I hope will be clear by now, it was much more than this.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.366
A Campbell might have been in command of the government

00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:19.826
forces, but he was acting on the orders of his king.

00:16:20.916 --> 00:16:27.096
Now, this is not to excuse his actions, but to paint the Glencoe Massacre as a

00:16:27.126 --> 00:16:32.756
crime masterminded and committed by the Campbells against the MacDonalds is to

00:16:32.776 --> 00:16:38.026
greatly misunderstand the background to it, and who was really pulling the strings.

00:16:39.516 --> 00:16:44.956
Nevertheless, that does makes a better story, and is the one that came to be popularised

00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:51.116
starting with British poets in the 19th century, with the revival of the Highland myth.

00:16:52.176 --> 00:16:56.816
And this myth even appears in the excellent TV series Mad Men.

00:16:57.756 --> 00:17:03.566
In fact, I’m going to play you a clip from this scene, where one of the characters is going to

00:17:03.566 --> 00:17:09.426
meet the principal of an elite New York school to find out why his daughter has been rejected.

00:17:10.606 --> 00:17:14.366
One man, the one whose daughter has been rejected, is called

00:17:14.386 --> 00:17:17.946
Campbell, and the principal of the school is called MacDonald.

00:17:19.066 --> 00:17:26.136
And, bear in mind, this is set in the 1970s, so almost 300 years since the event happened.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:28.013
Would you like to step outside?

00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:32.483
Are you sure you wouldn't rather get me while I'm sleeping, like a real Campbell?

00:17:32.993 --> 00:17:34.073
Are you kidding me?

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:36.653
No McDonald will ever mix with a Campbell.

00:17:36.653 --> 00:17:39.083
What are you talking about?

00:17:39.113 --> 00:17:40.463
It's some stupid story.

00:17:40.463 --> 00:17:41.903
It's 300 years old.

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:43.703
He's obviously nuts.

00:17:43.703 --> 00:17:45.983
You should know that his clan took advantage of the gift

00:17:45.983 --> 00:17:48.863
of hospitality and murdered my ancestors while they slept.

00:17:48.953 --> 00:17:50.333
The king ordered it.

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:57.601
Now, it makes for a good addition to a TV series, but to suggest that there is huge animosity

00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:03.071
between anyone named MacDonald towards anyone named Campbell is to overstate the truth.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:10.431
Campbell is the 6th most common surname in Scotland, and MacDonald is the 11th, and

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:15.391
put together, there are more Campbells and MacDonalds than any other single surname.

00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:20.821
So if this group was still at war with one another, well

00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:24.101
Scotland wouldn’t be a particularly functional country.

00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:30.201
Fortunately, it is an urban myth, something that makes for a good pub sign, and

00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:35.021
something that is more likely to be believed in the US than anywhere in Scotland.

00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:39.221
But the Glencoe Massacre is no myth.

00:18:39.581 --> 00:18:44.711
It has gone down in history as a heinous crime, and even gave rise to a

00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:49.591
legal definition of a crime greater than murder, and that’s something called

00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:54.601
“murder under trust”, murdering someone who has placed their trust in you.

00:18:56.011 --> 00:19:02.271
Popular history remembers the Campbells as being responsible for this terrible act, but the

00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:08.301
reality is that, although they didn’t wield the sword or pull the trigger, the responsibility

00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:15.051
must lie with those who gave the orders: the senior government officials, and ultimately the

00:19:15.101 --> 00:19:22.221
true butcher of the glen must be the man who signed off on it all: King William III of England.

00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:28.591
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Glencoe Massacre.

00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:33.261
I know it isn’t the most uplifting of stories, but it is one that helps you

00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:37.271
understand Scottish history, and its strained relationship with England.

00:19:38.391 --> 00:19:43.821
And with this comes the end of this four-part mini-series, our first four-parter I should add.

00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:48.331
In case you missed them, part one was on unusual Scottish facts and traditions,

00:19:48.651 --> 00:19:52.371
part two was on Donald Trump’s quest to build a Scottish golf course, and

00:19:52.371 --> 00:19:55.981
part three was on whether Scotland will ever be an independent country.

00:19:56.891 --> 00:19:59.001
As always, I would love to know what you thought about

00:19:59.021 --> 00:20:01.631
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:03.121
Have you been to Scotland?

00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:06.131
If so, where did you go, and what did you see?

00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:09.611
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:16.197
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:20.237
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:26.703
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something called Transhumanism.

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:33.747
It’s the idea that humans can enhance our bodies with the use of technology, turning us from

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:39.907
flesh and blood into flesh, blood and, well, anything from microchips to semiconductors,

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:46.357
silicone to graphene, all in a bid to allow us to break free from our biological reality.

00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:53.168
OK then, Transhumanism and The Rise of The Superhumans.

00:00:54.314 --> 00:01:00.634
When I was growing up, I had a great-uncle called Douglas, or Uncle Doug as we called him.

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:06.554
He lived on a farm in the north of Scotland, and every time my cousins and I

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:11.704
went to visit him, which we would do every summer, he had a special trick for us.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:17.154
He would let us kick one of his legs, and depending on which leg we

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:22.554
kicked, he would either go “ow”, or there would be a hollow thud.

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:30.104
See, one of his legs was plastic, it was amputated below the knee, he had a prosthetic leg.

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:35.424
We knew that he had fought in the Second World War, so in our little

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:39.884
boy's imagination, this was some kind of glorious battle wound.

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:44.914
In fact, it was because he was a heavy smoker and this had

00:01:44.964 --> 00:01:48.854
caused a blood clot in his leg, but that’s beside the point.

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:55.974
Now, this game had to stop after we got a bit older and one summer someone

00:01:56.014 --> 00:02:01.094
kicked the “real” leg a little bit too hard, but it was fun while it lasted.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:07.864
And clearly for Uncle Doug, this prosthetic leg was life changing.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:15.334
His life was extended, because the leg and the blood clot were removed, and the fact that he

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:20.974
had a fake leg meant that he was able to continue to walk around without major difficulty.

00:02:22.314 --> 00:02:28.844
And Doug had an older brother too, Uncle Jock, who moved to the United States as a young man.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:35.765
Uncle Jock almost lived until his 100th birthday, and by the end of his life he

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:40.535
had had so many different transplants and surgeries that his relatives would joke

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:46.235
that he was 10% metal and a living example of the wonders of California hospitals.

00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:52.425
Now, the use of medical technology to resolve problems and prolong

00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:56.775
life, like in the case of these brothers, is something that is almost

00:02:56.815 --> 00:03:01.645
universally accepted, approved of and practised around the world.

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:10.385
But what happens when people try to use technology not just to solve routine problems that arise,

00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:19.605
but to enhance and elevate the human condition, to blur the lines between human and superhuman?

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.935
This is the subject of today’s episode, the philosophical,

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:28.896
intellectual and scientific movement called Transhumanism.

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:33.997
The movement can be traced back to the English biologist and

00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:39.487
philosopher Julian Huxley, who first wrote about the concept in 1957.

00:03:40.857 --> 00:03:46.667
Now, Huxley had a fascinating life and distinguished career, but it

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:51.297
was towards the end of both his career and his life that he proposed

00:03:51.307 --> 00:03:57.437
this revolutionary idea in an essay titled “New Bottles for New Wine”.

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:01.857
I’ll actually read you out the last two paragraphs from

00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:05.277
the essay, as it’s here that he introduces the subject:

00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:13.827
“The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself —not just sporadically, an individual

00:04:13.827 --> 00:04:19.937
here in one way, an individual there in another way, but in its entirety, as humanity.

00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:22.527
We need a name for this new belief.

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:28.817
Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man, but transcending

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:33.897
himself, by realising new possibilities of and for his human nature.

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:39.697
“I believe in transhumanism”: once there are enough people who can truly

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:44.487
say that, the human species will be on the threshold of a new kind of

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:49.561
existence, as different from ours as ours is from that of Peking man.

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:55.051
It will at last be consciously fulfilling its real destiny.”

00:04:55.881 --> 00:04:56.471
End quote.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.598
Peking Man, if you were not aware, was the remains of a homo erectus discovered in a cave in China.

00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:09.898
And homo erectus was an ancestor to homo sapiens, you and me.

00:05:11.318 --> 00:05:18.008
In other words, mankind has a duty to evolve, to transcend human

00:05:18.238 --> 00:05:23.258
and biological limitations, and move into a different state.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:29.308
It might sound like something out of a science fiction novel, and

00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:33.408
if you were wondering whether Julian Huxley was any relation of the

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:38.188
science fiction writer Aldous Huxley, yes he was his older brother.

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:45.298
But Julian Huxley was deadly serious with this proposition; it was no joke.

00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:54.288
In this essay, however, it was merely a theory, a call to arms, and it wouldn’t be until several

00:05:54.288 --> 00:06:00.314
decades later that there was the first serious work towards achieving what Huxley had called for.

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:05.594
But let’s step back for a moment and consider what transhumanism

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:09.364
really means in practice, as it is understood today.

00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:16.984
At its core, transhumanism is about enhancing the human condition through technology.

00:06:18.324 --> 00:06:21.904
This could be anything from extending our lifespans and improving

00:06:21.904 --> 00:06:25.724
our physical abilities to enhancing our cognitive capacities.

00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:30.034
It's about pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human.

00:06:31.144 --> 00:06:35.764
Now, you might be thinking, 'Hang on a minute, haven’t we always been doing this?

00:06:36.054 --> 00:06:42.814
Glasses, hearing aids, pacemakers, Uncle Doug’s prosthetic leg, and even the vaccines we

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:48.084
take, aren’t these all ways of extending our lifespans and enhancing our human abilities?'

00:06:48.924 --> 00:06:51.114
Well, yes, you’re right, of course.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:57.434
What sets transhumanism apart, though, is the scale and the intention behind these enhancements.

00:06:58.164 --> 00:07:01.674
It’s not just about fixing something that’s broken or missing; it’s

00:07:01.674 --> 00:07:05.644
about pushing our bodies and minds beyond their natural limits.

00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:11.054
One of the most talked-about aspects of transhumanism is the use

00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:15.784
of technology to extend human life, potentially indefinitely.

00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:21.294
This idea, which is often referred to as radical life

00:07:21.294 --> 00:07:25.524
extension, challenges our very understanding of life and death.

00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:32.484
Some transhumanists believe that through a combination of biotechnology, nanotechnology,

00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:38.724
and, possibly, AI, we could one day cure ageing like we would any disease.

00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:47.684
So, if all diseases are curable, and the ageing process is slowed, stopped, or even reversed,

00:07:48.154 --> 00:07:53.854
then as long as you don’t get hit by a bus, theoretically at least, you can live forever.

00:07:55.342 --> 00:08:01.432
But, as to the question of immortality, of beating death, even though humans are living

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:06.727
for longer than ever before, we are still a long way off even "radical" life extension.

00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:15.548
One area of transhumanism that is closer to being achieved, though, and by some definitions is

00:08:15.568 --> 00:08:22.768
already here, is related to the enhancement of cognitive abilities, being able to access knowledge

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:28.068
and information that you would never be able to process only with your biological, birth” brain.

00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:34.858
Imagine being able to download skills directly into your brain, Matrix-style, or

00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:40.398
connecting your brain to a computer interface to access the internet just by thinking.

00:08:41.928 --> 00:08:46.518
These ideas might sound far-fetched, but there have been some

00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:50.901
important discoveries in this field, in the field of neurotechnology.

00:08:52.248 --> 00:08:57.688
You might have heard about an Elon Musk backed company called Neuralink, which is developing

00:08:57.978 --> 00:09:05.298
implantable brain-computer interfaces, essentially linking your brain directly up to a computer.

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:11.288
And it works, or at least it is showing promising signs.

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:20.518
There’s an amazing video from 2021 of a monkey controlling a video game using only his

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:27.488
brain, showing that this technology has succeeded in recording and decoding electrical

00:09:27.498 --> 00:09:34.208
signals from the brain, essentially downloading thoughts and uploading them to a computer.

00:09:35.648 --> 00:09:42.168
Now, it is still very early days, but imagine a world where your brain had access to

00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:48.358
the internet, where instead of going to a computer and typing or saying what you wanted,

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:54.718
you simply thought it and the information was immediately available in your brain.

00:09:56.248 --> 00:10:02.100
Again, this might sound creepy and your immediate reaction might be “ that sounds like

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.350
a step too far”, but there are many cases in which this kind of cognitive enhancement

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.190
is more in the category of adding a prosthetic leg to someone who lost theirs in

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:18.580
a car accident than connecting the internet to a normal healthy human’s brain.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:25.670
Imagine someone suffering from motor neurone disease, whose body had deteriorated

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.320
to such an extent that they were unable to communicate with normal speech.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.840
A real-world example would be Stephen Hawking, who lost all

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.040
physical power and had to communicate by moving his eyes.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:47.580
But clearly, on a cognitive level, he was functioning perfectly, and made important

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.940
scientific discoveries and wrote several influential books without the use of his body.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.780
Now imagine for a moment that the technology existed that connected his brain to a

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:07.080
computer, so he was able to use a computer and communicate simply by thinking, rather than

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.270
the laborious process of having to move his eye to look at letters and spell out a word.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.650
Or imagine that you could restore the memory of someone

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.530
who had lost it after an accident, or during dementia.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:28.600
Ethically, it would be hard to argue that these were bad things, but they raise interesting

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.330
questions about where we draw the line between restoring human qualities and abilities to

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:41.680
someone who had lost them and enhancing the human condition for perfectly functioning humans.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.750
In other words, if we consider it not only morally and ethically acceptable, but

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:55.670
also a medical obligation, to help treat someone who is sick, can we use the same

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.500
technology to enhance someone’s physical condition if they are perfectly healthy?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.980
And this leads us on to some important ethical questions

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.420
about what a world of “transhumans” might look like.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.720
It would, almost by definition, increase inequality in a way

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.480
that humanity has never really had to contemplate before.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:26.230
Yes, at the moment there is great wealth inequality, inequality between rich and poor.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.890
And, clearly, someone living on a few dollars a day in a developing country does not

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:38.650
have access to the same medical treatments as a chief executive in New York or Paris

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.680
or London, so life expectancy is generally correlated with wealth; people in higher

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:50.380
income countries live longer and healthier lives than people in lower income countries.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:57.086
But a rich person’s body is not so drastically different from a poor person’s body.

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:04.356
Imagine a world where you could pay to “enhance” your body to such an extent that

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:11.686
you became a superhuman, essentially creating two different classes of humanity.

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:17.836
Of course, these kinds of treatments are likely to be very expensive, at least at the

00:13:17.836 --> 00:13:24.816
start, and they would further widen the gap between the rich and the poor, creating a world

00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:30.836
where the wealthy can afford to become 'superhuman' while everyone else is left behind.

00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:36.699
There are also concerns about identity – what does it mean

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:40.949
to be human if we can radically alter our bodies and minds?

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:48.679
If your mind is no longer only yours, but it’s augmented by all sorts of algorithms

00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:55.089
and sources of data, where do you draw the line between the human and the robot?

00:13:56.549 --> 00:14:01.209
Now, to take the other side of the argument for a minute, especially on the question of

00:14:01.209 --> 00:14:07.439
price and inequality, of course it would be expensive at the start and of course this could

00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:12.679
initially lead to the rich being able to afford these treatments that poorer people can not.

00:14:13.849 --> 00:14:19.289
But, some might say, isn’t this already the case, just to a slightly lesser degree?

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:22.529
Isn’t this just a natural progression from being

00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:25.909
able to pay for better healthcare and to live longer?

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:33.085
What’s more, the price of such technology always decreases over time, so it

00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:37.795
is these rich people that finance the research and development which then

00:14:37.865 --> 00:14:42.595
allows the technology to be mass produced and affordable for the less wealthy.

00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:49.165
Now, given the increased interest in transhumanism in the past 50 years

00:14:49.165 --> 00:14:54.185
or so, and the colossal shift that it would bring to humanity and life on

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:59.575
Earth, it has provided inspiration for all manner of science fiction series.

00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:07.805
A particularly good TV series, in my opinion at least, is the British series Black Mirror.

00:15:09.605 --> 00:15:15.215
Each episode in the series is a standalone story, set in a different world.

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:21.755
And these worlds usually have some dystopian technological element.

00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:28.615
In one, people rate each other after every social interaction using eye implants.

00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:34.845
In another, people have a chip behind their ear with which they can replay their memories.

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:41.285
And in another, relationships are formed by an algorithm matching

00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:44.565
people with other people for a predetermined period of time.

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:49.235
It's a great series, and one I’d definitely recommend you checking out.

00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:57.355
The first episodes came out in 2011, to which many critics sort of laughed and said “haha,

00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:04.135
that will never happen”, but just a decade later, it is looking much closer to reality.

00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:13.245
And on the subject of transhumanism in reality, transhumanism today, I want to finish by briefly

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:19.505
telling you about a man who is trying his utmost to push the boundaries of the human body.

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:25.775
His name is Brian Johnson, and a recent Vice article about

00:16:25.775 --> 00:16:30.025
him called him “The Most Measured Man in Human History”.

00:16:31.595 --> 00:16:35.665
He made his money creating a payments company called Braintree,

00:16:36.025 --> 00:16:39.585
which was later sold to PayPal for $800 million dollars.

00:16:40.775 --> 00:16:47.195
He was born in 1977, so he is still quite young, but over the past few

00:16:47.195 --> 00:16:53.155
years he has made it his mission to do everything he possibly can to enhance

00:16:53.165 --> 00:16:59.975
his body, to stop the ageing process, and, just perhaps, live forever.

00:17:01.546 --> 00:17:09.746
This includes measuring everything on a daily basis, eating exactly 1,977

00:17:09.756 --> 00:17:15.636
calories a day, the food he eats determined by what the measurements dictate.

00:17:16.756 --> 00:17:23.246
In other words, instead of thinking, oh, I’ll have a sandwich or pizza or even salad for

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:30.846
lunch today, Brian Johnson’s diet and meal plan is dictated by an algorithm that analyses

00:17:30.846 --> 00:17:36.126
the results of his body measurements and returns the exact food that he should consume.

00:17:37.726 --> 00:17:44.276
To quote Johnson, “ [the programme] runs my body for me, and it does a better job than I can”.

00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:49.756
The logic behind this is that we humans are not particularly good

00:17:49.806 --> 00:17:54.286
managers of our body, we’re not great custodians of our own bodies.

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:58.756
We eat fatty foods, we drink fizzy drinks or alcohol,

00:17:59.276 --> 00:18:02.676
we smoke, we don’t exercise, we don’t get enough sleep.

00:18:04.156 --> 00:18:10.166
Johnson’s view is that he completely removes himself from the decision-making process about

00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:16.846
how to manage his body, instead following the instructions dictated by a computer programme.

00:18:18.396 --> 00:18:21.006
It might not sound like a particularly enjoyable life

00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:25.076
to you or me, but it does sound like it’s working.

00:18:26.506 --> 00:18:31.456
By all measurements, Johnson says that he is in perfect physical condition.

00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:38.026
Not only has he slowed the ageing process, but according to his core

00:18:38.026 --> 00:18:43.196
measurements, he is a few years younger than a person should be at his age.

00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:49.531
His objective is to stop ageing completely, to live forever.

00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:54.081
If you’re wondering how much this all of this costs, he says

00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:58.071
that he spends around $2 million a year for all of this.

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:03.671
Now, you might hear this and think “this all sounds miserable - count

00:19:03.681 --> 00:19:05.778
me out if that’s what I need to do to live forever”.

00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:12.138
And reading the comments on his posts and YouTube videos, this does seem to be a

00:19:12.168 --> 00:19:18.548
common reaction when someone learns about him and the healthcare regime that he is on.

00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:24.308
But, to take Johnson’s side for a minute, is this just our natural

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:27.858
reaction because we don’t know if what he is doing will work?

00:19:28.948 --> 00:19:34.998
If he drops dead tomorrow, or even at the age of 85, no doubt his critics will

00:19:34.998 --> 00:19:40.358
write that it was all for nothing, that he sacrificed his humanity for nothing.

00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:50.698
But if he lives to 100, 150, or is still alive in 250 years time, and is living proof that

00:19:50.738 --> 00:19:57.048
anyone could do this if they change their behaviour, how would that change our opinions?

00:19:58.588 --> 00:20:04.398
Now, Brian Johnson is just one example of someone who is living and breathing transhumanism,

00:20:04.848 --> 00:20:10.358
and is prepared to put his money and his body on the line in the quest for superhumanity.

00:20:11.118 --> 00:20:17.598
But he gets us asking important questions about the ethics of transhumanism, the practicalities

00:20:17.888 --> 00:20:24.348
of what is involved, and how far we are prepared to go to conquer our physical beings.

00:20:25.418 --> 00:20:30.528
If you knew that you could take certain actions to fundamentally change your

00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:36.528
body and the nature of your life, and if cost was no object, would you take them?

00:20:38.148 --> 00:20:43.288
For all human existence, humans have been dealt the same pack of cards;

00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:50.548
we have experienced joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, strength and

00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.658
weakness, life and death, and we've been constrained by our human bodies.

00:20:57.698 --> 00:21:02.488
If, at some point in the future, this constraint no longer

00:21:02.488 --> 00:21:07.488
exists, one cannot but ask “what is left of humanity?”

00:21:09.888 --> 00:21:16.458
Ok then, that is it for this episode on Transhumanism & The Rise of The Superhumans.

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:19.478
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:20.258 --> 00:21:22.898
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:23.268 --> 00:21:26.328
If you could click your fingers and live forever, would you do it?

00:21:26.968 --> 00:21:32.728
And would you live a life like Brian Johnson’s if you knew that you could live to 500 years old?

00:21:34.038 --> 00:21:37.498
And by the way, if you liked this episode, I think you’ll like the

00:21:37.498 --> 00:21:42.218
previous one which was on cryonics, the process of freezing people

00:21:42.358 --> 00:21:45.758
in order to bring them back from the dead when the technology exists.

00:21:46.528 --> 00:21:51.218
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:51.948 --> 00:21:57.188
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

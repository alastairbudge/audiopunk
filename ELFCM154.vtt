00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:21.763
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:27.643
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Las Vegas.

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:33.473
It’s a place where fortunes are sometimes made and more frequently lost, and you

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:38.583
will no doubt have heard of the saying, “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas”.

00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:42.903
Las Vegas is, as I’m sure you will know, a strange place.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:48.503
In today’s episode we are going to tell the story of how Las Vegas went

00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:54.583
from nothing, from a tiny oasis in the middle one of the hottest deserts in

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:59.723
the world through to having a reputation of being the world’s “Sin City”.

00:01:00.223 --> 00:01:03.943
It is a super interesting story, and this episode has

00:01:03.943 --> 00:01:07.873
been a huge amount of fun to make, so I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:13.873

00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:03.932
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.752
Ok then, Las Vegas.

00:02:08.422 --> 00:02:12.712
The story of Las Vegas is, in many ways, unlikely.

00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:17.872
To remind you where the city is located, it’s in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:26.902
It’s about 400km north of the border with Mexico, and about 400km inland from the Pacific coast.

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:32.602
The nearest large city is Los Angeles, LA, which is around

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:38.842
350km away, and it’s around 650km away from San Francisco.

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:44.042
It’s in the middle of a desert, and only 100km away from

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:47.702
Death Valley, one of the hottest deserts in the world.

00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:51.622
It’s certainly not the kind of geography that one

00:02:51.622 --> 00:02:55.312
might think would be the ideal place to build a city.

00:02:55.962 --> 00:03:00.412
But, as the Spanish speakers will know, there is something about the

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:06.242
name of Las Vegas that suggests that it isn’t all arid, dry desert.

00:03:07.382 --> 00:03:13.662
Las Vegas means ‘the meadows’ in Spanish, a meadow is a kind of wet field.

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:20.542
And indeed, although Las Vegas is in the middle of this scalding hot desert, below

00:03:20.562 --> 00:03:25.752
the surface there is actually a lot of water, more than you would expect at least.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:31.662
This water meant that there were rivers, trees could grow, and there was some

00:03:31.662 --> 00:03:35.842
green grass - again, not what you would expect in the middle of the desert.

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:43.512
Although there is evidence of human life in the area that dates back over 10,000 years, it

00:03:43.512 --> 00:03:49.722
wasn’t until the 19th century that we really have any records of human history in the area.

00:03:50.632 --> 00:03:58.982
And our story, or rather, the story of Las Vegas, starts in 1821, 200 years ago, with a Spanish

00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:05.376
explorer who was traveling between New Mexico and California, through this treacherous desert.

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:12.043
Legend has it that as the explorers were traveling through the desert, they turned

00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:18.183
a corner and saw this lush oasis, this sea of green, in the middle of nothing.

00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:24.063
They stopped, marked it on a map, and named it Las Vegas, the meadows.

00:04:24.953 --> 00:04:31.243
In the early 20th century, in 1905, the railway went through the area.

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:37.033
The companies that built the railway sold a patch of land next to the

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:42.643
railway tracks and turned the area into a stopping point for their trains.

00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:48.703
It was originally just a stopping off point - a place to get water, and to rest,

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:55.762
but if we have to date the founding of the city of Las Vegas, it would be to 1905.

00:04:56.693 --> 00:05:02.513
For 25 years or so, it remained a small, stop off point for railway

00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:09.063
travellers, and it wasn’t until 1931 that things changed for Las Vegas.

00:05:09.763 --> 00:05:13.983
The reason for that change is again, linked to water.

00:05:15.093 --> 00:05:22.473
In 1931 construction started on the Hoover Dam, a dam built through the Colorado River to

00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:29.903
control flooding, to provide hydroelectric power, and to help irrigation, to help water farmland.

00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:35.913
The Hoover Dam was to be built just outside Las Vegas, and brought thousands

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:40.693
of young men to the town, in search of work on the construction of the dam.

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:47.478
And given that the town before had been quite sleepy, a peaceful stopping off

00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:52.538
point for railway passengers, there wasn’t a huge amount for these young men to do.

00:05:52.908 --> 00:06:00.098
Gambling had actually been outlawed, it had been illegal in the state of Nevada from 1910 to 1931.

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:06.478
When construction started on the dam, in 1931, drinking alcohol was still

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:12.377
illegal in the United States - prohibition wasn’t ended until December 1933.

00:06:13.168 --> 00:06:15.978
But of course, this didn’t stop people drinking.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:23.228
In Las Vegas, illegal bars sprung up, as well as the other kinds of entertainment

00:06:23.378 --> 00:06:28.838
that you might imagine would be demanded by the young, unattached, male workforce.

00:06:29.778 --> 00:06:36.718
The population of Las Vegas swelled, going from 5,000 to 25,000, and

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:41.408
the town’s journey towards the city of sin had certainly started.

00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:49.428
During the 1930s and early 1940s, businessmen started to add the first gambling resorts.

00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:56.508
Gambling was now legal in Nevada, and these businessmen wanted to create places where people could

00:06:56.518 --> 00:07:04.298
go to gamble for extended periods of time, not just for a few hours, but for days, for the weekend.

00:07:04.828 --> 00:07:10.728
The first of these was called El Rancho Vegas, or El Rancho Vegas I should say

00:07:11.008 --> 00:07:16.378
with an American accent, and was opened by a hotel owner called Thomas Hull.

00:07:17.118 --> 00:07:22.608
But Hull is not the name that most people associate with early Las Vegas.

00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:27.548
The name you will probably hear, when it comes to talking about

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:32.908
the people who built Las Vegas, will most probably be Bugsy Siegel.

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:37.556
Now Bugsy Siegel is a fascinating character and perhaps

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:41.486
we need an entire episode just devoted to this man's life.

00:07:41.854 --> 00:07:47.184
He was born in New York, in 1906, and by the age of just

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:51.214
14 years old he had started his first criminal gang.

00:07:51.724 --> 00:07:54.974
He would go up to people selling goods from a cart on the

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:58.814
street and tell them that they needed to pay him for protection.

00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:03.584
They would ask him who they needed protection against - it certainly seemed

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:09.654
unlikely that it was protection from him, as he was merely a 14 year-old-boy.

00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:15.284
But then he would come back with kerosene, with a very flammable

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:20.284
liquid, which he would pour all over their carts and set on fire.

00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:24.664
It turned out that they did need protection from Bugsby Siegel.

00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:32.034
Bugsy’s life of crime continued the way it had started, and he became a hitman, a contract

00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:39.114
killer, a gun for hire, for the Mafia, and formed a gang called Murder Incorporated.

00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:44.024
The gang’s business was, as the name suggests, murder.

00:08:44.784 --> 00:08:51.164
In 1937 he moved west, to Los Angeles, and became friendly with lots of Hollywood movie stars.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:57.404
It had become quite a common thing for film stars to go to Las Vegas for the

00:08:57.404 --> 00:09:03.064
weekend, and Bugsy Siegel thought there could be an opportunity to capitalise

00:09:03.094 --> 00:09:09.374
on this, to create luxury hotels and resorts that were available for the masses.

00:09:10.194 --> 00:09:16.424
In 1940 Siegel moved to Las Vegas, with the purpose of building hotels and

00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:22.514
casinos for the mafia, investing their illegal money into semi-legal businesses.

00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:29.069
Siegel had backers, financial supporters, in different Mafia families all over

00:09:29.284 --> 00:09:35.464
America, and he proposed to them that building casinos in this new and upcoming

00:09:35.464 --> 00:09:41.564
city would be a great way to diversify their business interests, and to have some

00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:47.654
legal companies through which they could conduct their illegal business activities.

00:09:48.564 --> 00:09:51.614
He found a property developer called William R.

00:09:51.614 --> 00:09:56.954
Wilkerson, who was building a casino called The Flamingo, but was running

00:09:56.974 --> 00:10:02.064
out of money, and didn’t have enough money left to complete the construction.

00:10:03.054 --> 00:10:05.794
Siegel proposed Wilkerson a deal.

00:10:06.761 --> 00:10:12.604
Siegel’s partners would invest in the project, and Siegel would manage the gambling,

00:10:12.734 --> 00:10:17.887
and the food and drink, and in return he would be made a partner in the project.

00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:24.237
Wilkerson accepted, but after getting his foot in the door, Siegel threatened

00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:31.177
Wilkerson and made him hand over his entire stake, his entire ownership in the hotel.

00:10:31.917 --> 00:10:35.697
Siegel, and the Mafia, now had control of what was to

00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:40.507
become one of Las Vegas’s first cult entertainment venues.

00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:46.857
The problem was, Siegel’s costs for the Flamingo were spiralling out of control,

00:10:47.337 --> 00:10:53.267
and his Mafia backers were having to inject more and more money into the project.

00:10:54.377 --> 00:11:02.387
Siegel had projected initial costs of 1.5 million dollars, about 20 million dollars in today’s

00:11:02.387 --> 00:11:09.497
money, but the project ended up costing 6 million dollars, 80 million dollars in today’s money.

00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:16.027
Now, it isn’t clear whether these increased costs were Siegel just badly

00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:20.647
managing the project, or whether it was him putting money into his own pocket.

00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:23.147
It was probably a bit of both.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:30.917
Whatever the reason, his Mafia backers weren’t happy, his investors were annoyed, and they

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:37.127
were even less happy when the casino opened, and it was a huge flop, it was a huge failure.

00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:43.587
The Flamingo Hotel opened in 1946, but the hotel itself was

00:11:43.597 --> 00:11:47.407
still under construction, so guests couldn’t stay the night.

00:11:48.047 --> 00:11:52.997
One thing that this meant was that guests could cash out their gambling

00:11:52.997 --> 00:11:57.087
chips, they could exchange their chips for money, at the end of the night.

00:11:57.597 --> 00:12:01.707
What the casino would have wanted, of course, would be for them to

00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:06.307
continue gambling, because the longer you gamble, the more you lose.

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:13.087
The end result was that the casino lost around $300,000 on

00:12:13.087 --> 00:12:17.557
its first night, that's about $4 million in today’s money.

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:23.517
Siegel may have been a lifelong member of the Mafia, but the one thing you don’t do

00:12:23.707 --> 00:12:29.587
to your Mafia bosses is lose their money, and Siegel was murdered just a year later.

00:12:30.547 --> 00:12:35.137
Although the opening night of The Flamingo may have been a flop, it may have been

00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:41.227
a failure, the post World War II years saw continued growth for Las Vegas, and

00:12:41.397 --> 00:12:46.997
the Mafia continued to finance and operate hotels and casinos throughout the city.

00:12:47.727 --> 00:12:53.267
Siegel had understood one thing, and that was that people wanted some of this

00:12:53.387 --> 00:12:59.487
luxury that they saw film stars enjoying, but at a price that they could afford.

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:06.697
Las Vegas had entered a phase of what you could call ‘cheap’, or ‘affordable’, ‘luxury’.

00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:12.697
Hotels were relatively cheap, there were all you can eat buffets, and it

00:13:12.697 --> 00:13:17.287
was a place where you could live a life of sin for a price you could afford.

00:13:17.911 --> 00:13:21.521
Plus, there was always the dream that you could win big.

00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:29.741
The casinos paid singers vast sums of money to perform for their guests, and the 1950s

00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:35.741
saw people such as Liberace, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley arriving in the city.

00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:43.051
Las Vegas was also very close to the atomic testing site, the testing site for atomic weapons.

00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:48.281
While today you might think that this would be a reason to not visit the city,

00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:54.461
because we are well aware of the damage that radiation can do, in the 1950s it was

00:13:54.491 --> 00:14:01.011
actually a huge draw for tourists, it was promoted as a reason to come to Las Vegas.

00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:10.301
Indeed, from 1951 to 1963 over 100 nuclear bombs were detonated at the Nevada Test Site,

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:16.651
and you could buy postcards with pictures of the large mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs.

00:14:17.461 --> 00:14:23.701
There was even a special suite at a casino called the Desert Inn called the Sky Room,

00:14:24.021 --> 00:14:29.411
which was the highest room in the hotel and offered the best views of the explosions.

00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:36.191
You could sit there during an explosion and drink one of their famous Atomic Cocktails.

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:45.001
This all ended with the partial test ban treaty in 1963, but it is fascinating to

00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:50.771
think that this was such an attraction for so many people less than 60 years ago.

00:14:51.811 --> 00:14:56.941
I imagine that, if you had no idea that it was dangerous for you, and you were

00:14:56.941 --> 00:15:02.471
safely in a hotel room several kilometres away sipping a delicious cocktail, then

00:15:02.521 --> 00:15:06.991
it probably would have been quite interesting to watch an atomic bomb explosion.

00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:12.091
The next famous landmark in our history of Las Vegas

00:15:12.181 --> 00:15:15.811
involves the American entrepreneur Howard Hughes.

00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:23.161
If you remember the 2004 film, The Aviator, with Leonardo Di Caprio, the main

00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:29.411
character is him, Di Caprio plays the eccentric genius businessman, Howard Hughes.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:34.301
The story goes that Howard Hughes was staying at the Desert Inn,

00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:38.401
the place where you could enjoy an Atomic Cocktail, in 1966.

00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:45.421
But he refused to leave his room, and instead, he bought the entire hotel.

00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:52.491
He then went on to buy a number of different hotels and casinos, including one small

00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:59.423
hotel called the Silver Slipper casino purely because he wanted to move a neon slipper,

00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:05.363
an illuminated slipper that was on the roof, because its flashing kept him up at night.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:11.693
What Hughes did do is to start pushing the Mafia out of Las Vegas.

00:16:12.403 --> 00:16:19.173
They had been there since the early days, and by the late 1960s it’s thought that 10 out of

00:16:19.173 --> 00:16:27.043
the 11 major casino hotels were financed with Mafia money, and therefore controlled by the mob.

00:16:28.093 --> 00:16:33.993
Hughes was keen to give Las Vegas a new reputation, a reputation for glamour,

00:16:34.313 --> 00:16:40.023
not for cheap luxury and hedonism, and to push the Mafia out of town.

00:16:40.723 --> 00:16:47.693
He invested around $300 million in different hotels and casinos, and with this,

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:53.033
attracted numerous other businessmen to start building their own hotels and casinos.

00:16:54.023 --> 00:16:58.853
The image of Las Vegas started to change, and by the late 1960s

00:16:59.093 --> 00:17:03.003
it was putting itself forward as a family-friendly destination.

00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:11.063
But being a family-friendly city wasn’t very exciting, and investment in the city slowed.

00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:17.013
There was the new, Atlantic City in New Jersey, and this was attracting

00:17:17.023 --> 00:17:21.963
the crowd that had previously loved Las Vegas for its hedonism.

00:17:22.703 --> 00:17:29.563
The 1970s and 80s saw many of the hotels and casinos of Las Vegas grow old and

00:17:29.563 --> 00:17:35.093
lose their attraction, and it became known for cheap, low quality entertainment.

00:17:35.983 --> 00:17:41.293
Entertainers did still come to perform at the hotels and casinos of Las Vegas,

00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:47.493
but instead of being the place you went to thousands of adoring fans, it became

00:17:47.493 --> 00:17:52.283
known as the place you’d go when your career ended and you needed the money.

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:57.233
Then, in the late 1980s, things started to take off again.

00:17:58.093 --> 00:18:04.035
Investors ploughed money into huge new projects, starting with the $630

00:18:04.035 --> 00:18:11.543
million Mirage hotel, complete with 5 waterfalls and a 15 metre volcano.

00:18:12.593 --> 00:18:18.283
And this takes us to the modern day, where Las Vegas seems to have reinvented

00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:25.603
itself again, with a strange mix of sin, of vice –it’s a city where you can gamble,

00:18:25.743 --> 00:18:31.063
drink, and do all sorts of things that you might not normally do–but it is also an

00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:37.226
entertainment venue for the family, with adventure parks, amazing shows, and more.

00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:42.733
It is a pretty amazing story, of a small railway town in the middle of the

00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:47.963
desert, one which started off as cheap entertainment centre for construction

00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:53.613
workers, was then controlled largely by the Mafia, became deeply uncool and

00:18:53.613 --> 00:18:59.553
unloved, and has now re-emerged as a strange mix of hedonism and family fun.

00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:04.293
It’s a city that is only just over 100 years old, and

00:19:04.406 --> 00:19:07.953
has already gone through a myriad of different phases.

00:19:08.613 --> 00:19:14.333
Who knows what the next 100 years will hold for the world’s most famous City of Sin.

00:19:18.053 --> 00:19:22.289

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.141
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:21.391
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:25.621
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.771
talking about Concorde, the supersonic passenger jet.

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:36.291
It was an aeroplane that could get you across the Atlantic Ocean, from London to New York, in

00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:43.471
a mere 3.5 hours — less than half the time it would take in a regular plane– and it captured

00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:49.725
the imaginations of much of the world during the just under thirty years it was in operation.

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:55.435
We’re going to learn about how the Concorde got built, what it was like to fly on

00:00:55.435 --> 00:01:01.895
it, who actually flew on it, and how it met its eventual — and tragic — downfall.

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:07.075
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:12.455
Now, we've spoken about the history of air travel in a previous episode,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:18.772
episode 213, where we talked about how the experience and mechanics

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:22.623
of air travel have changed since the first aeroplane was built.

00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:30.483
To briefly recap that episode, in the decades after commercial passenger flight got started

00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:36.245
in the 1920s — which was nearly two decades after the Wright Brothers flew the first

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:42.775
ever powered aeroplane — air travel was accessible only to the richest people in society.

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:49.545
Back then, the few airline carriers in existence — now known as ‘legacy

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:54.545
carriers’ — offered something of a luxury experience for travellers.

00:01:55.425 --> 00:02:01.985
In the 1920s and 30s, the privileged few who could afford a seat on one of

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:06.555
these flights were treated to the kind of service — the in-flight meals,

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:11.725
free-flowing alcohol — that one might expect in an upscale restaurant.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:20.645
Now, the experience wasn’t perfect, of course: these early planes flew at a much lower altitude than

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:27.275
today’s planes, and so the turbulence would have been considerably more noticeable to passengers.

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:32.209
Thankfully, planes — and the experience of flying

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.459
in general — improved vastly as technology improved.

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:41.919
Flight distances increased, and cabins became far more comfortable.

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:49.019
Eventually, the deregulation of air travel, as well as the launch of low-cost air

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.739
carriers, such as Ryanair, made air travel accessible to the average person: someone

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.459
like you or me, who can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars on a single trip.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.769
Air travel was changing rapidly.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.719
And yet, there was something else around the corner — something that

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:14.889
would, people hoped, revolutionise the world of air travel altogether.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.579
That something was, of course, the Concorde.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.149
It could travel across the entire Atlantic Ocean in an incredible 3.5 hours.

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:30.399
It accomplished such an impressive feat of speed using something called

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:36.372
supersonic technology, which allowed it to travel at twice the speed of sound.

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:40.912
The Concorde flew so fast that it broke the sound barrier.

00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:46.102
This miracle of aeronautical engineering had a maximum speed

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:52.382
of Mach 2.04, which is almost 2,500 kilometres an hour.

00:03:53.552 --> 00:04:00.362
Perhaps even more surprisingly, the Concorde could accommodate up to 128 passengers,

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:07.172
and not just comfortably; passengers were treated to multi-course meals, champagne,

00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:13.272
and all other luxuries, all of which really emphasised the fact that everything about

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:19.732
the Concorde — its speed, its design, and, of course, its cost — was exceptional.

00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:26.226
First, let’s back up to the moment the idea of the Concorde was conceived.

00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:32.926
The idea for a supersonic plane existed years before there was even a blueprint for

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:38.526
the Concorde, before, even, it was certain that such a thing was technically possible.

00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:47.666
British engineers had been discussing the idea for a supersonic aeroplane since the late 1940s.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:56.186
In 1947, the Americans became the first to achieve exactly the thing these British engineers

00:04:56.186 --> 00:05:02.756
were dreaming of: they became the first to design and successfully fly a supersonic aeroplane.

00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:08.426
However, this plane was never actually used in commercial flight.

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:14.476
It was actually the great enemy of the Americans, the USSR, which was the

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:19.576
first country to successfully launch a supersonic commercial flight, in

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:25.876
1968, with the launch of a supersonic plane called the Tupolev TU 144.

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:33.626
But this plane suffered from performance issues and only flew 103 flights in its lifetime.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:39.156
It was to be the British — together with the French — that actually

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:43.656
managed to accomplish the goal of building a highly functional,

00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:48.356
supersonic aeroplane that could be used for commercial passenger flight.

00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:55.016
There was a snag, however, a problem; the costs of actually

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:59.356
building such a plane were, as you might imagine, enormous.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:05.976
It would cost an estimated 100 million pounds — that's over five billion

00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:10.856
Euros in today’s money — although it actually ended up costing significantly

00:06:10.856 --> 00:06:17.046
more, at well over a billion pounds, fifty billion Euros in today’s money.

00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:25.666
At the time work started on this project, World War II had just ended, and Britain was

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:32.416
bankrupt; people were still buying food with ration books and the economy was struggling.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:40.156
As a result, the British would need to find a new way to finance this ambitious project.

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:47.076
At the same time that British engineers were drawing up the plans for this amazing

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:53.456
aircraft, France was working on a design for a plane that looked remarkably similar.

00:06:54.106 --> 00:07:01.306
So, instead of competing with each other, in a rare moment of collaboration, France

00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:06.086
and Britain realised that they would have more success if they worked together.

00:07:06.716 --> 00:07:13.176
They decided to put their designs together, and to share both the work and the costs.

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:21.976
In 1963, shortly after the French and the British revealed their plans, air carriers around the

00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:28.336
world rushed to place their orders for the Concorde — including several in the United States.

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:33.156
Infuriated by this news, President John F.

00:07:33.156 --> 00:07:40.186
Kennedy announced that America would build its own supersonic plane, which would rival the Concorde.

00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:46.466
But, due to a number of constraints— many of them financial — this

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:49.776
American supersonic aeroplane was never completed.

00:07:50.726 --> 00:07:56.576
Meanwhile, the French and British collaboration proved successful, save for

00:07:56.576 --> 00:08:03.576
a few minor disagreements, and the first prototype, Concorde 001, took its

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:10.286
maiden — its first — flight on March 2nd, 1969, from Toulouse in France.

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:18.666
It was piloted by former air force major André Turcat, and was a huge success.

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:27.326
It was then followed by an equally successful voyage by British pilot Brian Trubshaw, a former

00:08:27.326 --> 00:08:34.976
World War II bomber pilot, who flew Concorde 002 out of Filton Airport in Bristol, England.

00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:40.216
Now, in order to have a plane that travels at the speed of

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:45.916
sound, engineers couldn’t just use the same old aircraft designs.

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:50.366
They actually had to make some rather large innovations.

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:58.396
One of the most notable was the plane’s nose, the bit at the front of the plane.

00:08:59.836 --> 00:09:05.966
Whereas a regular, non-supersonic aeroplane has a straight nose, the

00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:14.348
Concorde boasts something called a "droop snoot", or "droop nose" design.

00:09:14.348 --> 00:09:18.378
If you think this nose, this front of the airplane, looks

00:09:18.378 --> 00:09:22.628
a bit odd, a bit strange, well, you probably aren’t alone.

00:09:23.568 --> 00:09:29.418
When it's lowered, it looks almost like a broken bird’s beak — not quite the

00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:34.408
smooth, rounded nose that you might think of when you imagine an aeroplane.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:41.521
However, the "droop snoot" was actually quite necessary to flying the Concorde.

00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:48.861
Because of its unique design, the Concorde flew at a steep angle during takeoff and

00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:55.821
landing, and so the pilot would adjust the plane’s nose so that it was tilting downward.

00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:02.563
This made it so that the nose of the plane, which was longer and more

00:10:02.713 --> 00:10:08.473
needle-like than that of a typical plane, was out of the pilot’s line of sight.

00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:13.843
Otherwise, it would be much harder for the pilot to see where they were going.

00:10:15.183 --> 00:10:20.473
The Concorde also had a triangle-shaped wing, called a Delta Wing,

00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:25.173
as opposed to the rectangular wing shape of a typical aeroplane.

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:32.053
It also had a narrower body than that of a typical aeroplane, it was much thinner.

00:10:33.053 --> 00:10:40.193
Both of these helped the Concorde lift off the ground during takeoff, and minimised the amount

00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:46.843
of drag — or the force that makes it harder for an aeroplane or other object to travel forward.

00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:52.593
Of course, the Concorde boasted incredibly powerful turbojet engines,

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:59.493
and this combination of slim design and absurd amounts of power allowed

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:06.643
it to sustain its incredible speed of Mach 2 — almost 2,500 km an hour.

00:11:07.993 --> 00:11:15.795
The Concorde also flew so high that passengers could look out the window and see the earth’s curve.

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:23.418
It flew this high because the higher you go up, the lower the air pressure becomes, so there

00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:30.583
would be less drag, less resistance, and the plane could go faster while using less fuel.

00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:36.323
This also reduced the amount of noise heard by people standing on the

00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:41.323
ground — this is something we’ll explore in depth a bit later on in the episode.

00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:47.083
But, you’re probably wondering: just who, exactly, had the privilege

00:11:47.263 --> 00:11:51.503
of getting to fly on board this miraculous piece of machinery?

00:11:52.393 --> 00:11:59.037
These days, you can buy plane tickets on low-cost airlines for 10 Euros or even less.

00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:05.567
People of almost every level of income can afford to fly in one way or another.

00:12:06.117 --> 00:12:11.067
The Concorde, however, was a different kind of flight experience entirely.

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:16.457
In 1977, flights from New York to London began.

00:12:16.877 --> 00:12:25.607
A one-way ticket cost 431 pounds — that's around three and a half thousand Euros in today's money.

00:12:26.377 --> 00:12:32.282
On board, passengers were treated to champagne before the flight had even taken off.

00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:36.582
They ordered from a menu of delicacies like lobster,

00:12:36.952 --> 00:12:41.422
fillet steak, and caviar, as well as a full wine list.

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:48.312
Flying the Concorde were people like corporate CEOs and movie stars, many

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:53.462
of whom could afford to fly on the Concorde multiple times in a single week.

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:59.572
If you managed to drum up the cash needed for a ticket, you may have found

00:12:59.572 --> 00:13:04.822
yourself brushing elbows with the likes of Mick Jagger and Sir Paul McCartney.

00:13:05.922 --> 00:13:12.392
But, you might wondering, what did it actually feel like to ride in one of these planes?

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:18.362
Despite the incredible drama of the Concorde taking off,

00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:22.152
passengers detected surprisingly little, apparently.

00:13:22.682 --> 00:13:27.132
There was the initial burst of speed when the plane took off — but

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:32.552
once they reached cruising altitude, the flight was as smooth as glass.

00:13:34.112 --> 00:13:39.522
One need only imagine sipping champagne and eating oyster, while watching the

00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:45.782
curve of the earth below, to understand just how exceptional the Concorde was.

00:13:47.462 --> 00:13:51.602
For all of the wonders of the Concorde — the intrigue, the

00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:55.732
glamour, the convenience— it was not without its drawbacks.

00:13:56.782 --> 00:14:00.502
For one, an object like the Concorde cannot break the

00:14:00.522 --> 00:14:03.972
sound barrier without creating quite a lot of noise.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:12.172
This noise is actually referred to as a sonic boom, and is so loud that it can be heard by people

00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:19.222
standing on the ground, even when the Concorde was flying almost 20km above the Earth’s surface.

00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:25.145
Considering the fact that most of the people subjected to this racket,

00:14:25.225 --> 00:14:29.985
to this loud noise, were those who would never be able to afford

00:14:30.195 --> 00:14:34.408
to fly on the Concorde, it was a bit like adding insult to injury.

00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:40.704
Many countries felt that the sonic boom was so disruptive that

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:44.364
they banned the Concorde from travelling over them entirely.

00:14:45.064 --> 00:14:50.374
The noise problem even inspired protests, with people showing up to

00:14:50.604 --> 00:14:57.424
takeoff and landing sites holding signs with slogans like “Ban the Boom.”

00:14:58.334 --> 00:15:03.796
Partly because of this, the Concorde mainly flew over the Atlantic Ocean, And

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:09.256
rarely over land, where it would be much too disturbing to people on the ground.

00:15:10.306 --> 00:15:14.826
Another problem was the possible environmental effects of The Concorde.

00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:21.026
Because it flew so much higher than other planes, scientists believed

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:25.761
that the Concordes exhaust would be far more damaging to the ozone layer.

00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:31.501
Although this fear was justified, there were so few Concordes

00:15:31.501 --> 00:15:34.931
ever built that this never made a significant impact.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:42.340
And because the Concorde could only successfully really fly two routes from either

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:49.259
London or Paris to New York and back, and because it could only seat 128 passengers,

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:55.239
the plane proved to be far from profitable, it simply didn't make much money.

00:15:56.499 --> 00:16:00.979
The luxury services provided, as well as the fact that the plane could

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:05.569
only be flown by the most elite crew, only worsened this problem.

00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:12.649
In fact, by 1981, after just five years in service, British Airways

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:17.799
and Air France had recorded losses in the tens of millions of pounds.

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:24.938
As wonderful as the Concorde might have been, it was still, of course, a commercial aeroplane.

00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:30.209
And in order to keep operating, it would need to start turning a profit.

00:16:31.359 --> 00:16:34.749
So, what did they think the solution was?

00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:39.919
Crank up prices even more, increase the prices even higher.

00:16:41.179 --> 00:16:45.189
British Airways put up the cost of tickets to nearly double

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:49.499
the cost of first class tickets on its other, regular flights.

00:16:49.929 --> 00:16:54.589
It also started allowing anyone who could afford it to charter

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:59.199
entire flights on a Concorde to any destination they pleased.

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:05.369
And in the mid-1980s, Concorde finally began to turn a profit.

00:17:06.469 --> 00:17:09.649
To much of the world, it seemed as though the Concorde

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.789
was just the beginning of a new age of supersonic travel.

00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:16.659
The possibilities seemed endless.

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:23.119
Yet the Concorde, as glorious as it was, would soon meet a devastating end.

00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:31.229
On July 25th, in the year 2000, Air France Flight 4590 took off from

00:17:31.229 --> 00:17:36.619
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, destined for JFK airport in New York.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:42.859
Upon landing, the passengers — mainly German tourists — would have boarded

00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:48.649
a cruise ship bound for South America, it was to be the trip of a lifetime.

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:53.839
That flight, of course, never made it to JFK.

00:17:54.969 --> 00:17:59.899
Shortly after taking off, the plane lost altitude, crashing to the

00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:03.859
ground just six kilometres from the airport where it had taken off.

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:14.449
The crash killed 113 people, including all 109 passengers on board and four people on the ground.

00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:19.839
The crash, which shocked and horrified the world, turned

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:24.149
out to be the result of a chain of small but fatal errors.

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:29.889
The first of these errors took place before the flight even took off.

00:18:31.429 --> 00:18:36.339
To start with, the plane was over its maximum structural weight.

00:18:36.969 --> 00:18:42.219
Not only had the plane been overfueled, there was too much fuel put in it,

00:18:42.219 --> 00:18:47.939
but more items of baggage were placed in the hold than were planned for.

00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:51.849
Put simply, the plane was too heavy.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:57.389
The next part sounds a little bit like a freak accident.

00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:04.499
Just after Flight 4590 had begun taxiing down the runway, a short strip of

00:19:04.499 --> 00:19:09.309
metal fell off of the engine of another plane travelling down the same runway.

00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:16.219
The strip hit one of the Concorde’s tyres, which burst, shooting off

00:19:16.219 --> 00:19:21.649
a piece of rubber that then broke, it ruptured the plane’s fuel tank.

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:28.339
The resulting fire caused two of the plane’s left-side engines to fail.

00:19:29.229 --> 00:19:35.609
In spite of the pilots’ best efforts, the plane — and all those on board — were doomed.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:42.429
Many people think — rightly think — that this was the event that put the nail in the coffin

00:19:42.439 --> 00:19:49.259
for the Concorde, but in fact, it would return to service, if only for a brief period of time.

00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:55.319
After the crash, France and Britain grounded their aircrafts in

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:59.559
order to make a number of — quite expensive — safety modifications.

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:07.559
The Concorde was finally relaunched in November 2001, returning to passenger

00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:13.819
service with stronger tyres and redesigned fuel tanks, among several other changes.

00:20:14.374 --> 00:20:18.863
2001, however, was not a great time for air travel.

00:20:19.873 --> 00:20:26.223
On September 11th, 2001 — just before the Concorde’s relaunch — two planes

00:20:26.413 --> 00:20:31.453
crashed into New York’s World Trade Centre, killing close to 3,000 people.

00:20:32.243 --> 00:20:37.283
As a result, air travel on the whole lost its appeal, and the

00:20:37.283 --> 00:20:41.763
number of people taking flights into New York dipped dramatically.

00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:46.483
The Concorde was flying with an almost completely empty

00:20:46.483 --> 00:20:50.253
cabin — not exactly the most sustainable business model.

00:20:51.613 --> 00:20:56.173
Concorde eventually announced its retirement in April of 2003,

00:20:56.593 --> 00:21:00.373
and the plane would officially retire six months out from then.

00:21:01.673 --> 00:21:08.393
With only six months left to fly on the mighty Concorde, there was a rush to buy up tickets.

00:21:08.773 --> 00:21:17.053
And, on October 24th, 2003, Concorde 002 left New York for the final time.

00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:20.303
It was truly the end of an era.

00:21:21.143 --> 00:21:23.613
So, where is the Concorde now?

00:21:24.193 --> 00:21:32.159
Well, you can still get on Concorde 002, though don’t expect it to be going very fast; the plane

00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:39.179
now sits in one of the exhibition halls in the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Somerset, in England.

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:44.659
For all those who weren’t quite lucky enough to fly the Concorde

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:48.689
before it was retired, this is, perhaps, the closest you will ever get.

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:54.939
And you might be wondering, will the world ever see anything like the Concorde again?

00:21:55.789 --> 00:22:01.599
When the Concorde retired, it had no obvious successor; it was, perhaps,

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:06.319
the first time in the history of aeronautical engineering that we have

00:22:06.329 --> 00:22:12.229
taken a step backwards, at least in terms of the speed of aeroplanes.

00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:19.259
The world would have to be content with subsonic, or non-supersonic, air travel.

00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:29.719
In 2021, however, United Airlines announced its plans to purchase 15 new supersonic jets from the

00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:37.369
aeroplane manufacturer Boom Supersonic, which are expected to be in operation by the year 2029.

00:22:38.289 --> 00:22:43.449
A number of smaller companies have proposed private supersonic jets for

00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:49.449
use by bankers, chief executives, and others who can afford the price tag.

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:55.969
And reintroducing supersonic travel to the world will, of course, be expensive.

00:22:56.369 --> 00:23:01.039
Companies will also have to find a way to solve the issue of supersonic

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:05.539
air travel’s environmental impact, which is something that companies

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:07.649
like Boom are trying to address, but there is no easy solution.

00:23:10.709 --> 00:23:13.994
While there are a number of unknowns, supersonic air

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:17.879
travel may very well return within our lifetimes.

00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:22.099
The final barrier, however, might be beyond the

00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:26.129
capabilities of even the smartest engineers in the world.

00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:31.279
And that’s how to get rid of that infernal boom.

00:23:34.255 --> 00:23:39.909
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Concorde supersonic jet.

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:43.949
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:48.599
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:52.889
I wonder, I just wonder, whether you might have been lucky

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:56.289
enough to fly on a Concorde at some stage in your life?

00:23:56.419 --> 00:24:00.119
Or perhaps you can remember hearing it flying overhead?

00:24:00.678 --> 00:24:03.319
If so, please do tell - I’d love to know.

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:10.139
And even if you are in the 99.9999999% of the world’s population who have never

00:24:10.139 --> 00:24:15.599
been on a Concorde, what do you think about the future of supersonic flight?

00:24:15.599 --> 00:24:17.539
Let’s get this discussion started.

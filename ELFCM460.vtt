Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.009
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.179
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:25.009
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about royalty.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.210
Specifically, we are going to talk about Andrew Albert

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.489
Christian Edward Windsor, otherwise known as Prince Andrew.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.849
He is the king’s brother, but he is a highly controversial figure, accused

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.780
of some terrible things, and the undisputed black sheep of the royal family.

00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:51.358
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk about Prince Andrew, The Duke Of York.

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:53.938
A lot can change in an hour.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:01:02.338
On the 16th of November, 2019, an interview was published between Prince Andrew, the

00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:08.993
then queen’s second son, and a well-respected BBC journalist called Emily Maitlis.

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:18.587
The interview was initially scheduled to be about Andrew’s charity work, but the focus had changed.

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:27.097
Andrew had been a friend of the American financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was awaiting sex trafficking

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:32.932
charges when he was found dead in his prison cell a couple of months before the interview.

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:36.807
As a quick side note, if you’d like to learn more about the

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:40.714
life of Jeffrey Epstein, you can listen to episode number 422.

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:44.877
Anyway, back to Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein.

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:52.317
Prince Andrew was in the spotlight for more than just being friends with Epstein; the prince

00:01:52.657 --> 00:02:00.587
had been accused of having sex with a then 17-year-old girl who had been trafficked by Epstein.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:08.897
These were some serious accusations, and the prince had reportedly decided to use this opportunity,

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:16.897
the opportunity of an interview with the BBC, to clear the air, to have his say on the matter.

00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:22.767
After all, up until then there had been plenty of accusations

00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:27.847
and reports in the media, but the prince had not spoken publicly.

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:32.737
If he was innocent of all charges, this would be

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:36.287
his chance to tell the British public and the world.

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:43.377
Now, the full interview is on YouTube, so you can watch it for yourself if you so choose.

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:49.297
One way of summarising the content of the interview, or perhaps the result

00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:53.667
of it, is by me reading you the most popular comment below the video.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.447
It reads: “Best thing about this is that the interviewer doesn't

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:03.457
interrupt him too much and just allows him to dig his own grave”

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.567
And it’s true.

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:11.477
The BBC interviewer, Emily Maitlis, allows the prince to talk,

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:17.027
and the result was what we call in English “car crash TV”.

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:24.567
Or, as one commentator put it, it was less a car crash than "a plane crashing

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:29.617
into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion."

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:37.257
If, before the interview was aired, some people might have thought, well, surely he didn’t,

00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:44.017
these must be groundless accusations, when the 60 minutes were up and Prince Andrew had

00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:49.837
been given the opportunity to give his side of the story, well it did not look good.

00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:55.477
When the prince was asked about having sex with this young girl, which

00:03:55.537 --> 00:04:01.327
reportedly took place on March 10th 2001, he vehemently denied it.

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:08.347
But he didn’t just say, no, it didn’t happen, he claimed that it couldn’t have happened

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:14.387
because he was at a restaurant called Pizza Express in a town called Woking at the time.

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:24.297
This seemed odd, given that it was 18 years before, and if I asked you exactly what

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:29.127
you were doing on a particular date 18 years ago, I imagine that you wouldn’t know.

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:36.277
Also, Pizza Express in Woking, a very mediocre chain restaurant in

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:40.937
an uninspiring British town, was an unlikely place for a prince.

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:45.267
But, Prince Andrew claimed to remember precisely.

00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:50.277
And this wasn’t the only unusual and somewhat

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:54.107
unbelievable response to why he was absolutely innocent.

00:04:55.287 --> 00:05:00.527
The woman who he was accused of having sex with had said that she remembered dancing

00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:06.417
with him at an exclusive London nightclub because he was particularly sweaty.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:11.547
But rather than saying “that’s incorrect”, or “I

00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:14.927
wasn't’ at that club”, the Prince went a step further.

00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:21.387
He said, and I’m quoting directly: "There’s a slight problem with the sweating

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:27.267
because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:33.107
sweat at the time and that was…was it…yes, I didn’t sweat at the time because I

00:05:33.107 --> 00:05:38.327
had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falkland’s

00:05:38.327 --> 00:05:44.067
War when I was shot at and I simply…it was almost impossible for me to sweat."

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.670
Now, this seemed…somewhat implausible, hard to believe.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.440
The prince claimed that he simply couldn’t have been at that place at that time

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.740
because he was at a Pizza Express restaurant, and he also certainly couldn’t have

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.530
been the person at the club because at that time he was medically unable to sweat.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.580
It seemed almost so unbelievable that it was comic, it was funny, and indeed

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.940
within minutes the Google Maps page of the real Pizza Express restaurant

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.060
in Woking was flooded with reviews from witty members of the public.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.570
For example, one read: Love this place.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.300
I had a cracking pizza here in 2001.

00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:35.820
I remember it was 2001 because it was very strange, the guy next to me had

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.810
an American Hot pizza with extra chillies...not a drop of sweat came off him.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.850
Very odd.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.390
Food was fit for a prince and the vitamin K in the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.570
chilli peppers did wonders for my long term memory.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.000
End quote.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.100
Now, since then things have gone from bad to worse for the prince.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.420
Shortly before her death in September of 2022, his mother Queen Elizabeth

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.700
stripped him of his military titles and his royal patronages, meaning

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.690
that he is no longer able to publicly represent the royal family.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.490
He was cast out, a black sheep, and has been told in no uncertain

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.890
terms that he was not allowed to speak to the media about the incident.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:31.760
Now, to understand how it got to this point, we should talk a bit about life before the scandal.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.240
In fact, there isn’t much of his life that is scandal free.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.010
He was the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.050
but was, reportedly, the Queen’s favourite child.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.837
He joined the navy after finishing school, and went on to fight in the Falklands War in 1982.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.080
After he returned home, he was something of a national

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.060
hero, or he at least enjoyed strong public support.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.130
He was a royal, and there he was, serving his country.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:19.280
His career as a navy officer lasted almost 20 years, but it was not all hard work; when he

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.150
was off duty he was known as a regular at London’s exclusive nightclubs, and was photographed

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:33.440
arm in arm with a wide variety of eligible young women, earning him the nickname “Randy Andy”.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:40.250
Randy means having a high sex drive, so I’ll let you be the judge

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.650
of whether that was a positive or negative nickname for him to have.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:51.640
What I will say, however, was that this was the 1980s, and for a young prince to

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.200
be rushing around town and engaged in a large number of nocturnal activities with

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.200
different women was sort of the done thing, it was expected behaviour for a prince.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.950
He did eventually get married to a lady called Sarah Ferguson

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.600
in 1986, and the pair had two children before divorcing in 1996.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.580
It was reportedly a happy marriage.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.000
The pair have stayed friends ever since, but Sarah Ferguson has continued

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.470
to be a thorn in the side of the royal family, much like her ex-husband.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:34.510
She was secretly filmed by a reporter for the News Of The World offering to

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.340
arrange access to Prince Andrew for the not insignificant sum of £500,000.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.590
In fact, we have an episode about the journalist behind that, “The Fake

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.160
Sheikh”, it’s episode number 374 if you haven’t listened to that one yet.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.110
But back to our story.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.200
Moving into the 2000s, even before the details of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes became public

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:07.120
knowledge, Prince Andrew started to see his popularity fade as the scandals started to mount.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.010
He left the navy in 2001, and was given the title of “Special

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.120
Representative for International Trade and Investment”.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.830
Now, this might sound like the kind of job that you or

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.280
I could get, but in fact, neither of us is qualified.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.420
It was a special “honourable” position for a member of the British royal

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:39.000
family, where the purpose was to represent British business interests abroad.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:45.680
In practice, it involved flying around the world, shaking people’s hands, cutting

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.930
ribbons and standing next to business people and politicians for photo opportunities.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.300
These were all things that Prince Andrew should have been uniquely qualified

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:02.310
to do, but it turned out that he wasn’t particularly good at this job.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.600
He had befriended corrupt dictators and people accused of human rights abuses,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.860
and back home he was accused of everything from being easy to trick with

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.170
fine wine and expensive gifts through to aiding and abetting corruption.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.110
The position itself was an unpaid one, but he was criticised

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.730
for the huge expense bills that he racked up everywhere he went.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:39.950
In 2010, he spent £620,000, which included £154,000 on hotels, food

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:47.220
and hospitality, and £465,00–over half a million Euros–on travel.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.640
Now, the prince would defend this as actually being an excellent use

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.260
of funds, as the value he was generating for British businesses was

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.730
many multiples of this, but the British public weren’t buying it.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.690
The newspapers started referring to him as “Airmiles Andy”, and would

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.570
report on stories of how he would insist on flying first class, sometimes

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.880
even in British military planes, instead of going by car or by train.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:26.450
In the 1980s the British public might have laughed at this young prince being photographed with

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:32.750
a different aristocratic girl every month, and falling out of fashionable nightclubs, and he

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:38.130
certainly still had some public goodwill stored up after serving in the navy in the Falklands War.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.230
But fast forward 30 years, he was a divorced 50-year-old man who was seen

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.560
to be a drain on the public purse and an embarrassment to British interests.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.600
And in 2010, he was photographed walking in Central Park with

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.680
Jeffrey Epstein, who had been released the previous year from prison.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:08.460
Now, at this point the true extent of Epstein’s crimes and depravity weren’t publicly

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:15.040
known, but he had been sent to prison for having sex with an underage girl, so he was

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.790
certainly not the sort of person that the queen’s son should be photographed chatting with.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:29.190
And things went from bad to worse a year later when his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, admitted

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:36.880
that Epstein had helped pay off her debts to the tune of £15,000, so around €20,000.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:43.570
Why was a convicted sex offender paying all of this money to the queen’s

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.780
former daughter in law, to the mother of the queen’s grandchildren?

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:56.750
Something smelled rotten, and in July of 2011 Prince Andrew was sacked, or forced to

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:03.300
give up his role as special trade envoy, and he reportedly cut off all ties with Epstein.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:11.930
And since that fateful BBC interview in November of 2019, Prince Andrew has been truly

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.760
cast out, not allowed to speak publicly out of a fear that he further incriminates himself.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:25.120
There is, of course, the very real possibility that he might face criminal charges.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.990
He is not just accused of having sex with an underage girl who was a victim of trafficking, but of

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:40.340
knowing full well what his friend Jeffrey Epstein was up to, and being a willing participant in it.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:49.345
If this is true, and his excuses don’t exactly inspire confidence that it isn’t, this is a

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:55.869
serious crime, one for which regular members of the public would face some serious jail time.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:59.599
So, what comes next?

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:05.559
According to most royal observers, it is unlikely that the charges against

00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:09.779
the king’s brother will ever come to anything, whether he will ever have

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:14.559
to face his accuser in court, much less spend a moment in a jail cell.

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:22.649
He is a man for whom much of his adult life has been mired by scandal, entirely of his own making.

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:29.599
Many foreign commentators like to get fixated on Prince Harry and his break from the

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:36.459
royals, or even the most recent conspiracy theories around Kate and William, but when it

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:42.239
comes to the real black sheep of the Royal Family, it seems like there is no competition.

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:50.019
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Prince Andrew, the black sheep of the royal family.

00:15:50.436 --> 00:15:53.446
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:59.816
This episode is scheduled to be released on April 5th, in fact the same day as a

00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:04.576
new bumper Netflix drama called “Scoop” about Prince Andrew’s car crash interview

00:16:04.576 --> 00:16:09.196
with the BBC, so if you are interested in learning more about the man and his

00:16:09.196 --> 00:16:13.576
downfall, then I imagine that the Netflix show should be a good place to start.

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:18.856
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:16:19.626 --> 00:16:25.046
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

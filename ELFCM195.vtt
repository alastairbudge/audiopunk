Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:16.586
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:21.196
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:26.546
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:32.226
non-fungible tokens, otherwise known as NFTs, and Digital Art.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:37.626
In late August someone sold a digital picture of a clip art rock,

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:42.956
a simple digital drawing of a rock, for $1.3 million dollars.

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:47.685
He had bought it only 19 days before for $5,000.

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:53.286
The rock was what is called a non-fungible token, an NFT, and this

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:58.136
sale was the latest example in this boom in this new technology.

00:00:58.532 --> 00:01:06.430
So, in this episode we are going to take a deep dive into the weird world of NFTs and digital art.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.700
We’re going to explain what an NFT actually is, how they work, why someone

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.648
might want a digital picture that anyone can download for free, why the

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:23.228
prices have been rising so fast, why some people think it is all a giant

00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:28.908
bubble, a house of cards, and what the future might hold for this technology.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.478
Let’s jump right into it.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:35.218
Let’s start by asking ourselves a few questions.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.559
Why is art worth anything?

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:45.181
What makes Salvator Mundi, a painting supposedly done by Leonardo Da Vinci, sell for

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:53.021
$450 million, while a painting my son might do probably wouldn't even sell for $1.

00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.581
It is, on one level, a stupid question.

00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.921
Leonardo Da Vinci is one of the most famous artists in the world,

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:05.341
Salvator Mundi is an interesting and enjoyable painting to look at.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:11.881
There will never be another Salvator Mundi by Leonardo Da Vinci, because he died over 500 years ago.

00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.481
And it will likely continue to be worth a lot of money,

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.921
perhaps it will even become more valuable with time.

00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.901
My son, on the other hand, isn’t even two years old.

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:28.071
Perhaps he might turn out to be a great artist, but his paintings at the

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:32.321
moment are not particularly impressive to anyone other than his parents.

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:38.191
He will, I hope, continue to do paintings for many years to come, paintings that

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:42.921
one would hope might be more visually pleasing to look at than the ones he does now.

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:48.881
But perhaps not, and there’s no guarantee that his paintings will go up in value with time.

00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:56.091
So, yes it is a silly comparison, but I use it to illustrate

00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:01.221
some of the factors that go into the value we place on art.

00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:03.581
The beauty of the artwork.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:05.931
The reputation of the artist.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:10.263
The scarcity of the piece, how rare it is.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:18.153
The consequent pride that the owner has in being able to say that they own that piece of art.

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:25.953
And the fact that some people think they can buy a piece of art and then sell it later for a profit.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:31.023
With the example of Salvator Mundi, it was bought by

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.483
Mohammed Bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:41.743
One can only hazard a guess at his motivations for buying it, but whatever they were, they were

00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:50.743
enough for him to part with $450 million dollars, the most anyone has ever paid for a piece of art.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:56.733
Buying Salvator Mundi, Bin Salman actually has physical ownership of it.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.793
He can take it anywhere he wants.

00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:02.733
Nobody can physically see it without his permission.

00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:06.833
He could choose to hang it in a gallery, or he could

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:09.973
choose to keep it in his bedroom, away from the world.

00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:15.893
When it comes to digital art, however, it is a completely different story.

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:23.958
With the example of this picture of a rock that sold for $1.3 million dollars, I can see it, you

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:30.478
can see it, anyone can see it on their screen, it’s freely available to view on the internet.

00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:35.718
In fact, the owner of the rock sees exactly what you or I see.

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:41.128
And it would be very hard to say that they are beautiful rocks.

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:46.768
They are very simple, and created using a very simple cartoon rock.

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:52.138
Why would anyone pay over a million dollars just to

00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:55.310
say that they are an owner of one of these rocks?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.958
The answer to this question is a combination of speculation, of

00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:05.118
thinking that the price will go up, and publicly displaying your wealth.

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:10.778
And this is all enabled by NFTs, non-fungible tokens.

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:16.420
So, what actually is a non-fungible token, and how do they work?

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.420
Let’s just start by defining what “fungible” means.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.610
It means interchangeable, that it can be equally changed for something else.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.490
A 10 euro note is fungible, it can be changed for

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.000
another 10 euro note, they have exactly the same value.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.190
A bitcoin is fungible.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.150
One bitcoin is the same as another bitcoin, they also have exactly the same value.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.710
A painting, on the other hand, is non-fungible.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.110
Each one is slightly different, and there are no two that are exactly the same.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.734
So, if something is a non-fungible token, it is a unique digital asset.

00:06:00.957 --> 00:06:06.690
It could be a picture of a rock, it could be a certificate, it could be linked

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.660
to something that actually exists in the physical world, like a house or a car.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.150
The idea is that it is a secure way of proving ownership of something, and

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.130
defining certain rules for what should happen to that thing in the future.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.000
It all works on something called the blockchain, which is a subject for

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.030
another day, but in essence creates a secure way for ownership of anything,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.880
both digital and non-digital, to be transferred from one party to another.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.100
This is called a smart contract.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:50.110
Now, this might sound overly technical, but let’s explain it in another way, which

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.220
I hope will help you understand some of the attraction of this new technology.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.230
Let’s say that you are a young artist.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.320
You have a growing following on social media.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.540
People are starting to buy your works.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.600
Perhaps you have even got a gallery to host an exhibition of your latest collection.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.430
Great, well done.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.930
Life is looking promising.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.160
There are, however, lots of people waiting to take a proportion of your sales.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.450
The art gallery will typically take around 50%, so if one of your

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.380
paintings is sold for €1,000, then you, the artist, will get €500.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.190
Let’s say that your fame continues to grow, and instead of selling

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:46.070
paintings for a thousand euros, you can now sell them for 50,000 euros.

00:07:46.977 --> 00:07:49.367
A gallery would still want its commission.

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:57.315
It might be a little bit less than 50% now, but let’s say you negotiated well you might get €30,000.

00:07:58.572 --> 00:08:02.237
Your early fans, people who believed in you from the

00:08:02.237 --> 00:08:06.777
beginning, can sell your early works for 50,000 euros.

00:08:07.527 --> 00:08:14.597
They make a profit of 49,000 euros and you make a profit of, well, nothing on the

00:08:14.597 --> 00:08:20.737
resale, only the original 500 euros you received when you first sold the painting.

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:23.772
You see the problem here.

00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:29.132
For artists they often get a raw deal, and don’t get

00:08:29.212 --> 00:08:33.252
much financial reward when their works are re-sold.

00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:37.552
And let’s take a look at it from the perspective of the buyer.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:43.802
They might have a beautiful piece of art that they can have in their living room, it might bring

00:08:43.802 --> 00:08:49.402
them great joy, and they might think that they can sell it for more money in a few years time.

00:08:50.372 --> 00:08:54.412
Their friends admire it when they come for dinner, and other people

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:58.912
might know that they have it, but most people probably don’t know.

00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:06.062
Then let’s imagine this situation in a world of NFTs, a digital world.

00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:11.079
You, the young artist, still have the same fans.

00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:16.779
They passionately believe in you, and think that you are going to go on to great things.

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:21.649
They want to support you, but they also think that you are a good investment.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:27.989
You decide to offer a limited edition of 100 digital copies of your favourite painting.

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:32.679
They are all slightly different, perhaps they use slightly different

00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:37.169
colours, or perhaps they are numbered, like limited edition prints.

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:41.189
You offer these for sale directly to your fans.

00:09:41.349 --> 00:09:43.699
There is no gallery taking 50%.

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:49.899
Perhaps you sell it through a marketplace, which might take 15% or

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:54.489
something like that, but you get to keep the majority of the sale price.

00:09:55.379 --> 00:10:01.089
What’s more, because each transaction is made with a smart contract, you can decide

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:08.009
beforehand that you, the artist, should receive, let's say, 10% of the future sale

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:13.619
price if it is sold, allowing you to also make money if it is resold for a profit.

00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:17.749
Again, let’s explain this with a working example.

00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:26.649
Instead of selling one painting for €1,000 and getting €500, you could sell 100 slightly different

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:35.909
digital versions of it for €500 each, meaning that you now get more like €50,000 instead of €500.

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:41.019
What’s more, if you continue to grow as an artist and be more in

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:45.749
demand, any time one of these digital prints is sold you would get

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:50.619
10%, because that is already programmed into the smart contract.

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:57.089
And even better, you now have 100 fans who also have a financial interest

00:10:57.189 --> 00:11:01.409
in the value of your works increasing, so they are more likely to promote

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:05.499
your work on social media, and encourage other people to invest in you.

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:13.169
As you can see, for many artists it can be a much more attractive economic proposition.

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:17.719
But I know what you might be thinking: “this is a ridiculous

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:22.479
example - surely there wouldn’t be 100 people who would be prepared to

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:27.899
pay €500 for a digital print, something they can see online for free?”

00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:32.619
Well, let’s take a look at it from the perspective of the buyer.

00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:38.509
They might only have a digital version of the artwork, but instead of putting

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:43.679
it on their living room wall, they use it as their profile picture in the online

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:48.971
world, it is their avatar, their public face on a social network like Twitter.

00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:54.901
Instead of their immediate family and friends seeing it, it can be seen by anyone on the internet.

00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:59.667
It sends a strong signal about who you are.

00:12:00.077 --> 00:12:04.947
Not just that you are the kind of person who can afford a certain work of

00:12:04.947 --> 00:12:10.217
art, but about your taste, about the kind of friends you have, the idea is

00:12:10.437 --> 00:12:16.077
that it is an effective way of telling people what kind of person you are.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:23.497
One of the most successful of these kinds of projects is called Bored Ape Yacht Club,

00:12:23.797 --> 00:12:30.807
and is a collection of 10,000 slightly different pictures of monkeys looking bored.

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:36.797
In certain circles of Twitter you will see people with these images as their

00:12:36.807 --> 00:12:42.017
profile pictures, and it’s a way of signalling that they are in this exclusive

00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:47.037
club, that they own assets that are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:12:47.947 --> 00:12:54.647
To go back to the example of Mohammed Bin Salman and the $450 million purchase of Leonardo

00:12:54.647 --> 00:13:00.527
Da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi, would he have bought it if nobody knew that he owned it?

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:03.047
In all likelihood, no.

00:13:03.517 --> 00:13:06.747
A large part of the value that anyone places on

00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:10.757
anything is being able to show it off to other people.

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:16.527
For people who buy an expensive watch or an expensive car, are they doing that because

00:13:16.817 --> 00:13:21.727
they are much better ways of keeping the time, or much better modes of transport?

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:28.031
No, they might look pretty, and be fun to drive, but a large part of the

00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:33.811
reason that someone pays hundreds of thousands of euros for a watch or a car is

00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:38.351
because they want other people to see them with it and know that they have it.

00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:43.651
If everyone knows that these digital artworks are worth a certain amount of money,

00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:49.181
then showing them to the world is like being able to show that you are part of a very

00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:54.781
expensive, and therefore exclusive club, and of displaying your wealth to others.

00:13:55.881 --> 00:14:02.141
Now, in 2021, and especially in the past few weeks before this episode, the

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:08.371
price for and interest in NFTs has exploded, it has gone through the roof.

00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:13.191
Companies have even got in on the action, and embraced this new trend.

00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:18.741
Christie’s, the auction house, sold an NFT of 10,000

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:24.431
individual works of art for $69 million in March of 2021.

00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:32.041
Visa, the payments company, paid $150,000 for an NFT in late August.

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:36.771
Naturally, people have seen prices rising and looked for an

00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:42.221
opportunity to jump in and make a quick buck, to make some money.

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:46.791
Some people have made a huge amount of money, such as the English

00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:52.251
guy who made $1.3 million in 19 days from selling the clip art rock.

00:14:52.961 --> 00:14:58.451
And the more money people make, the more likely they are to try to encourage others to

00:14:58.691 --> 00:15:03.901
participate, especially if the more people who buy them, the more the price increases.

00:15:04.441 --> 00:15:09.911
But the critics say surely the prices can’t keep on going up forever.

00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:14.991
Much like any bubble that has come before, there will be a top of

00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:19.581
the market, and no doubt lots of people will lose lots of money as

00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:24.491
they pay far too much for NFTs which will be worthless in the future.

00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:28.711
So, you might be thinking, what’s the point of it all?

00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:33.461
When there are so many more pressing problems in the world, isn’t it a bit

00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:38.761
ridiculous that people are diving into the world of selling digital cartoon monkeys?

00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:43.261
That’s a valid question, and perhaps we will look back on this

00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:48.131
time as truly bizarre, a craze that made absolutely no sense.

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:53.281
But to the proponents of NFTs, it is just the beginning.

00:15:53.641 --> 00:15:59.334
To your or my grandchildren owning a piece of digital art will be completely normal.

00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:05.454
Indeed, perhaps it would be even more desirable than owning a physical piece of art.

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:10.164
After all, physical pieces of art can also be copied, even

00:16:10.164 --> 00:16:13.894
if it’s a bit harder than just simply downloading an image.

00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:20.604
And with a physical work of art, it’s much harder to show them off, to display them to the world.

00:16:21.354 --> 00:16:28.364
In a digital world, whether that is a world of virtual or augmented reality, or if it is just the

00:16:28.364 --> 00:16:35.084
world of intense technology usage that we all already live in today, digital art will be the art

00:16:35.384 --> 00:16:41.914
of the future, a way of showing your taste and projecting your identity to anyone who sees you.

00:16:42.815 --> 00:16:50.265
And to people who believe that, the world of NFTs and digital art is only just getting started.

00:16:52.597 --> 00:16:57.485
OK then, that is it for today's episode on NFTs.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:02.645
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that if you have heard

00:17:02.665 --> 00:17:09.695
or read something about NFTs over the past few weeks, well this has been a useful new perspective.

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:13.745
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:14.035 --> 00:17:17.395
Would you ever consider buying a piece of digital art?

00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:19.779
If so, what would make you do it?

00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:21.919
And if not, why not?

00:17:22.529 --> 00:17:27.679

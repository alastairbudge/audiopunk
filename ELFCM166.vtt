Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:17.068
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:21.388
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:26.118
I'm Alastair Budge and today it is part two of our

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:30.628
three-part mini-series on great American business frauds.

00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:36.018
Part one was on Enron, and the next one, part three is

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:40.628
going to be on Bernie Madoff, the man who stole $65 billion.

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:46.748
Those are both member-only ones, so you can get those over on the website, leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:52.758
But in today’s episode we are going to be talking about The Theranos Scandal.

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:57.651
It is the story of a Silicon Valley company that was once worth $9

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:03.358
billion dollars, a company that promised to revolutionise blood testing,

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:08.888
preventing diseases, and allowing all of us to lead longer, happier lives.

00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:18.258
It is a nice idea in theory, but the entire company was a huge fraud, it was all one gigantic lie.

00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:24.988
It has gone down as one of the most spectacular failures in recent Silicon

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:30.298
Valley history, and today we are going to tell the story of how it all happened.

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:36.008
Before we get right into that though, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:41.118

Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:19.238
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:24.078
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:27.948
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:29.808 --> 00:02:33.698
OK, let’s get started, and talk about Theranos.

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:42.133
Our story starts at the University of Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, in 2003.

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:47.068
Elizabeth Holmes was a 19 year old chemical engineering

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:51.718
student, and was exceptionally bright, she was very clever.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:59.328
She came from a wealthy background - her father had been an executive at Enron, the company we

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:06.008
learned about in the last episode - but she had won a scholarship to study at Stanford on merit.

00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:09.918
There is no doubt that Elizabeth Holmes was very smart.

00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:16.968
It seems that she had always felt she was destined to change the world, and

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:20.938
she would later refer back to a letter that she had written to her father

00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:26.818
when she was nine years old, saying “What I really want out of life is to

00:03:26.818 --> 00:03:31.848
discover something new, something that mankind didn’t know was possible to do.”

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:35.128
Quite something for a nine-year-old, right?

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:40.768
This ambition only increased during her time at Stanford, and

00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:45.458
she became interested in the idea of making blood tests better.

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:50.678
There is a lot that an analysis of your blood can tell a doctor

00:03:50.838 --> 00:03:56.368
about your health, but actually doing this analysis has historically

00:03:56.368 --> 00:04:01.418
been time-consuming, quite difficult, expensive, and unpleasant.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:09.538
Actually getting the blood out of your body isn’t very nice - you have to have a syringe inside

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:15.878
a vein to take the blood out, which means it needs to be done by a trained medical professional.

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:21.328
And then it would be sent off to a laboratory, it would take time

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:25.098
for the results to come back, and it was all quite expensive.

00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:30.838
What if, thought Holmes, you didn’t need to use a syringe, and

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:34.708
instead it only took a tiny drop of blood from your finger?

00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:41.568
And what if, instead of being sent to a laboratory, the data was sent

00:04:41.598 --> 00:04:46.158
via the internet, and results were returned within a few minutes?

00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:51.428
And what if, instead of being something expensive that was dominated by

00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:55.928
medical professionals, it was cheap, and was something you could do yourself?

00:04:57.138 --> 00:05:01.148
It sounds like an excellent idea in theory, and Holmes

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:04.818
went to her professors at Stanford and proposed this idea.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:08.978
Nice idea, they said, but it won’t work.

00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:15.458
Such a small sample of blood won’t tell you very much, plus the blood from your

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:21.648
fingertip won’t give you the right data, and the technology simply doesn’t exist.

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:23.238
You can’t do it.

00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:29.048
But Elizabeth Holmes wasn’t the sort of person to give up lightly.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:36.828
She felt that she was destined for greatness, and Silicon Valley, the home of companies

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:42.568
such as Apple and Google, wasn’t the sort of place where people took no for an answer.

00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:50.768
Holmes dropped out of Stanford, she left university, and decided to work on this problem herself.

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:57.078
She started a company with the money that her parents had set aside for her university

00:05:57.088 --> 00:06:03.728
education, but that wouldn’t be enough to create this breakthrough device she dreamed of.

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:08.408
Revolutionising the world of blood testing was going to be

00:06:08.408 --> 00:06:12.368
expensive, and she needed to find some money from somewhere.

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.608
She needed to raise investment.

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:19.048
And when you are raising investment, you need people to buy

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:23.468
your dream, you need people to buy the story you are selling.

00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:29.028
Luckily, much like Adam Neumann in our story of WeWork, as well as

00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:34.378
the executives at Enron, Elizabeth Holmes was a brilliant storyteller.

00:06:35.148 --> 00:06:41.638
Her story was of a young woman who was afraid of needles, who dreamed of a world where

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:47.878
nobody had to say goodbye too soon, and just wanted to make the world a better place.

00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:55.108
It was a spellbinding story, from someone different to the norm in Silicon Valley.

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:58.028
For starters, she was a woman.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:03.298
She was working on a problem with a much greater impact than a lot

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.388
of the other companies that had been raising money from investors.

00:07:07.318 --> 00:07:12.118
While others were building websites to sell pets, or creating

00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:17.218
new social networks, Holmes promised to save millions of lives.

00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:22.888
If she could do it, it would clearly be a fantastic thing for humanity.

00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:30.728
She was also clearly incredibly intelligent, and had a firm belief that she was changing the world.

00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:39.208
Money started flowing towards her, and by the end of 2004 she had raised $6 million dollars in

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:46.288
investment, hired a small team, and started working on the prototype of her blood testing device.

00:07:47.308 --> 00:07:52.298
From the very beginnings of the company, the atmosphere was secretive.

00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:56.298
Departments weren’t allowed to know what other people were working on.

00:07:56.796 --> 00:07:59.588
There were fingerprint scanners on the doors.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:06.318
There was a culture of paranoia, which was fostered by Holmes herself.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:12.748
She believed, or at least seemed to believe, that the company was on the

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:18.448
cusp of inventing the most important development in healthcare ever, and

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:23.658
she was incredibly paranoid about employees stealing this technology.

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:30.696
But the reality was that there wasn’t really much technology being developed at all.

00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:36.818
Holmes had been busy selling investors and partners the idea that

00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:42.248
Theranos had been developing this revolutionary blood testing device , but

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:46.498
it actually hadn’t built anything that worked reliably at all.

00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:54.508
Its first product, called Theranos 1.0, was very unreliable, and the live

00:08:54.528 --> 00:08:59.778
demonstrations that the company did to its potential customers were often

00:09:00.048 --> 00:09:05.638
fake, they were pre-recorded, or the machines would show fake results.

00:09:06.618 --> 00:09:11.538
Of course, this only came to light, it was only discovered, years

00:09:11.578 --> 00:09:17.408
afterwards, and any employee who tried to complain about this procedure,

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:23.298
or point out that it was completely unethical, was fired from the company.

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:28.688
In Silicon Valley there is a culture of “fake it until you make it”,

00:09:29.098 --> 00:09:33.638
meaning that you can fake the technology until you have actually built it.

00:09:34.858 --> 00:09:39.358
This might work with apps that allow you to order food, or

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:43.608
book a taxi, but healthcare was something very different.

00:09:44.358 --> 00:09:48.888
Lives were literally at stake, and because the machines were so

00:09:49.128 --> 00:09:53.568
unreliable, the demonstrations would often show false results.

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:59.288
They would show false positives, scaring someone into believing that

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:04.028
they were suffering from a particular disease when they weren’t, or

00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:07.518
they wouldn’t pick up diseases or illnesses that they claimed to.

00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:11.278
But this didn’t deter Elizabeth Holmes.

00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:14.678
Her ambitions were growing bigger and bigger.

00:10:15.388 --> 00:10:21.498
She had managed to recruit some very influential people to be investors and board members,

00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:29.108
including two former US Secretaries of State, one being Henry Kissinger, a former and a future US

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:35.588
Secretary of Defence, as well as other grandees, other important people from corporate America.

00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:41.508
They were almost all old men with no medical background who were

00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:45.598
completely captivated by this young, brilliant, entrepreneur.

00:10:46.658 --> 00:10:51.028
In their mind, she could do no wrong, and they introduced her to people

00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:56.464
within the US military, as well as America’s largest pharmacy, Walgreens.

00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:02.788
Theranos started doing deals to put its machines into real American pharmacies,

00:11:02.998 --> 00:11:07.638
despite knowing that the technology in its machines didn’t actually work.

00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:15.608
Holmes didn’t seem to care, and put huge pressure on the scientists to get the invention to work.

00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:21.878
This pressure was too much for her head scientist, a well-liked British

00:11:21.878 --> 00:11:26.515
scientist with several degrees from Cambridge University called Ian Gibbons.

00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:32.408
He ended up taking his own life, killing himself the night before he was

00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:36.808
going to be required to testify in court about the company’s technology.

00:11:37.818 --> 00:11:41.818
Gibbons knew that Holmes had spent most of the previous 10 years

00:11:42.238 --> 00:11:47.378
outright lying to investors, and being deliberately tight-lipped,

00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:52.058
deliberately not revealing the truth, about what Theranos actually did.

00:11:52.788 --> 00:12:00.538
When she did try to explain what Theranos did, it was, as the New Yorker put it, comically vague.

00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:07.298
She said, and I’m quoting directly here, “a chemistry is performed so that a chemical

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:12.778
reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which

00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:17.998
is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel."

00:12:19.018 --> 00:12:25.428
Now, you don’t need to be a chemical engineer to realise that this isn’t a very helpful explanation.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:31.748
But it seemed that, apart from Holmes and a few senior executives at

00:12:31.748 --> 00:12:36.628
Theranos, not many other people knew that the technology didn’t work.

00:12:37.808 --> 00:12:43.018
Holmes had created an atmosphere of such paranoia and secrecy that

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:46.928
even the employees didn’t really know what was going on at the company.

00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:52.118
Blood samples would be taken from department to department, which

00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:56.618
would all operate in their own siloes, separate from one another.

00:12:57.448 --> 00:13:00.488
Nobody seemed to know what was really going on.

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:07.920
To keep the lie afloat, Holmes pressed on towards a big, public launch of the product.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:17.020
From its founding in 2003 until 2013 Theranos had operated in complete secrecy.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.450
Its employees were not allowed to say that they worked at Theranos on LinkedIn, nobody

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.870
was allowed into the company offices without signing a non-disclosure-agreement,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.650
and the company was in complete stealth mode, it was hidden to the outside world.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:41.030
By 2013, even though the technology still didn’t work, Holmes wanted to launch it to the world.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:47.120
She hired some of the most expensive marketing and PR agencies in the world,

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.480
and she ended up appearing on the cover of magazines such as Fortune magazine.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.740
At the same time, Theranos had continued to raise more and

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.750
more money in investment, valuing the company at $9 billion.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.050
Holmes owned half of the company, making her worth $4.5 billion.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:14.980
She had become the youngest self-made female billionaire in history, and

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:20.385
was made a US ambassador for global entrepreneurship by Barack Obama.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:27.000
She loved the fame and fortune that she was getting, and became even more self-obsessed.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.780
She redesigned her office to look like the Oval, the

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.050
president’s office, complete with bulletproof glass.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:43.070
She even had a security detail of 20, she had 20 private security guards with her at all times,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.840
By this time, she had also become completely obsessed with the late boss of Apple, Steve Jobs.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.240
She wore the same type of clothes as he did, she had

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.180
hired his top designers, and she copied his behaviour.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.140
Reportedly she even started holding her Marketing meetings on a

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.170
Wednesday, after finding out that this was the day that Jobs held his.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.820
It was clear that she wanted to be seen as the next Steve

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:16.400
Jobs, a female visionary that was about to change the world.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.970
She continued to do magazine and TV interviews, claiming that Theranos could do

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:28.170
200 different tests, and shortly was going to be able to do 1,000 different tests.

00:15:29.268 --> 00:15:39.606
She said that this was all possible only by taking a tiny pinprick

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:40.601
of blood from your finger, a tiny drop of blood from your finger.

00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:47.236
The reality was that the Theranos machines could reliably do a grand total of zero tests.

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:51.976
When the company did demonstration tests it would frequently do them on

00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:57.746
non-Theranos machines, on machines made by the German company, Siemens.

00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:04.766
The scientists would go to another room where the Theranos machine reportedly was, but

00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:09.706
they would use a completely different machine that Theranos had bought from Siemens.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:17.896
Plus, to get any kind of reliable data, they typically needed to take much more blood than from

00:16:17.916 --> 00:16:24.356
a finger pinprick, and often it would have to be taken via a syringe, from a patient’s vein.

00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:30.706
We know this now because of the fantastic brave reporting of a journalist

00:16:30.726 --> 00:16:34.776
called John Carreyrou, who was a reporter from the The Wall Street Journal.

00:16:35.856 --> 00:16:41.706
He had grown suspicious of Theranos’ claims, and had received information

00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:45.656
from several employees inside the company revealing the truth.

00:16:46.836 --> 00:16:53.596
After months of diligent research, and being threatened by Theranos’ aggressive lawyers, and

00:16:53.726 --> 00:16:59.206
even followed by private investigators, Carreyrou published his article in the Wall Street

00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:05.296
Journal with the title “Hot Startup Theranos Has Struggled With Its Blood-Test Technology”.

00:17:06.016 --> 00:17:11.156
Holmes was furious, and immediately went on TV to defend herself.

00:17:11.746 --> 00:17:17.666
Here’s a clip of her opening line, where she is on CNBC about to lie again.

00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:23.286
"This is what happens when you work to change things and, first they think you're

00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:26.656
crazy, and then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world.",

00:17:27.396 --> 00:17:32.536
Holmes seemed to think that the story would go away, that it would all blow over.

00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:38.486
She had influential friends who she thought could help Theranos weather this storm.

00:17:39.396 --> 00:17:44.486
Rupert Murdoch, whose company owned The Wall Street Journal, was an investor

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:49.486
in Theranos, and she had hoped he would be able to help stop the story.

00:17:50.626 --> 00:17:55.136
To his credit, he didn’t, saying that he trusted his editors.

00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:58.096
It was all too late for Theranos.

00:17:58.826 --> 00:18:03.426
The FDA, the government body dealing with drugs and medicines in

00:18:03.426 --> 00:18:09.166
the US, and the SEC, the body dealing with investments, started to

00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:13.466
look into the company, and the house of cards started to collapse.

00:18:14.086 --> 00:18:16.806
The technology simply didn’t work.

00:18:17.006 --> 00:18:23.176
It had never been peer reviewed, which is when something is evaluated by experts in the field.

00:18:23.596 --> 00:18:27.376
Whenever it had been tested, it had proved unreliable.

00:18:28.366 --> 00:18:33.656
What's more, Holmes had said that the company was making $100 million a year.

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:41.606
The reality was it had made $100,000, a thousand times less than what Holmes had claimed.

00:18:42.652 --> 00:18:45.984
Theranos, and Holmes, were in big trouble.

00:18:46.604 --> 00:18:52.304
Not only had the company violated drugs laws, by faking the tests and testing

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:58.054
on live patients, it had also violated financial laws by misleading investors.

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:01.954
You can’t say that something is true in order to raise

00:19:01.954 --> 00:19:05.694
money from investors if you clearly know that it is a lie.

00:19:06.904 --> 00:19:11.994
By June 2016, Holmes' personal net worth, how much money

00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:16.874
she was worth, had dropped from $4.5 billion to zero.

00:19:17.334 --> 00:19:24.024
She had owned 50% of Theranos, but given that the company was now worthless, so were her shares.

00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:32.664
She was banned from being an officer of a company for 10 years, and forced to pay a $500,000 fine.

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:37.874
But she is still not completely off the hook, she’s not completely safe.

00:19:38.404 --> 00:19:42.714
She is currently awaiting trial for fraud, which was

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:46.235
scheduled to start in July of this year, July 2021.

00:19:46.944 --> 00:19:51.214
But in March of 2021 she announced that she was 5 months

00:19:51.264 --> 00:19:55.334
pregnant, so the trial will end up taking place in August.

00:19:56.494 --> 00:19:59.704
Her sceptics have suggested that this might be yet

00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:03.614
another way for Holmes to manipulate those judging her.

00:20:04.694 --> 00:20:11.844
She is facing up to 20 years in prison, and no matter what crimes a person might have done, it is

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:17.804
hard to imagine forcing a new baby to be without its mother for the first 20 years of its life.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.450
In the aftermath of the Theranos collapse, as one might

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.610
expect, people started asking themselves questions.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:32.640
Why were so many smart people taken in by Holmes, why did they believe her?

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.770
Did nobody think it was a little strange that Holmes

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.560
couldn’t explain how her marvelous machines actually worked?

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.400
And why was everything so secretive?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.920
It seemed that Holmes’ charisma, her charm, and her

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.730
fantastic ability to tell a story was mainly to blame.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.960
She seemed so driven, so fantastically determined to achieve her goal,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:04.292
that betting against her, or disagreeing with her, seemed unwise.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.750
She told such a convincing story that Theranos was changing the world,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.560
and who wouldn’t like to believe that she was capable of doing it?

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.560
The question that nobody seems to have really figured out, and perhaps

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.540
even Elizabeth Holmes herself doesn’t know, is did she actually believe it?

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.280
When she was saying that Theranos was going to revolutionise healthcare

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.110
and save millions of lives, did she really think that this was true?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:39.090
Did she believe that she was just about to make the breakthrough that she had been hoping for?

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.700
Or was it a huge lie all along, that she knew she was

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.080
out of her depth, but didn’t know what else to do?

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.750
Was she left with no other option but to go along with the lie?

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.240
Who knows what the truth really is, but there is something that

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.300
tells me that the world hasn’t seen the last of Elizabeth Holmes.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.490
OK then, that is it for The Theranos Scandal, part two of

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.280
our three-part mini-series on great American business frauds.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.570
As a reminder, part one was on The Enron Scandal, the company that

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.190
spectacularly collapsed after trying to recreate an energy stock market,

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:27.330
and part three will be on Bernie Madoff, the man who stole $65 billion.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.080
Both of those are member-only episodes, so if you like the sound of those two, and you

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.900

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:16.407
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:20.937
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:27.407
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about vaccines.

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:33.917
You no doubt know what vaccines are, you have probably been vaccinated, and the word

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:39.257
‘vaccine’ has never been in the news more than it has been in the past few weeks.

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:45.737
But you might not know the history of vaccines, where they come from, how they have

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:52.897
developed, how cheap they actually are, and what has caused the rise of the anti-vax movement.

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:57.687
We have a lot to cover in today’s episode, so let’s get cracking.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:03.757
Vaccines have completely changed the way we deal with disease.

00:01:04.387 --> 00:01:10.347
It’s almost always easier and cheaper to prevent something from happening in the first

00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:16.857
place than to cure it when it does happen, and of course our health is no exception.

00:01:18.047 --> 00:01:23.727
In 2020, when there are vaccines for the majority of the diseases that

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:29.567
used to cause most premature deaths, it’s easy to take this for granted.

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:35.537
But stepping back one minute and thinking about the fact that we don’t have to

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:42.797
worry about things like smallpox, mumps, polio and tetanus, diseases that used

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:48.067
to kill millions of people every single year is a pretty amazing achievement.

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:52.577
So, firstly, how do vaccines work?

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:58.697
The principle is pretty similar, whatever disease the vaccine is trying to prevent.

00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:07.767
A small amount of the germ, often in a killed or weakened state, is put into your body.

00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:14.967
Most are injections, but occasionally there are some that you take orally, that you swallow.

00:02:15.477 --> 00:02:17.637
And then your body does the rest.

00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:22.877
Your immune system recognises the germ, it recognises the

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:27.527
virus or bacteria, and produces antibodies to fight it.

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:34.787
It then remembers how to produce these antibodies so that if it encounters this germ in the

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:41.657
future, it will be able to fight it naturally before it develops into a disease, and you don’t

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:47.227
have to worry about getting that disease again because your body has developed immunity to it.

00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:53.767
As you will know, vaccines differ - some need to be done again after a certain

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:58.097
number of years, while others are just done once and are good for life.

00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:02.627
So, this is the general principle - it’s relatively simple.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:08.517
But of course, behind everything that appears simple is a huge

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:13.807
amount of work and experimentation, and vaccines are no exception.

00:03:15.317 --> 00:03:21.297
Indeed, the first vaccine, or attempted vaccine, is believed to have been

00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:28.427
developed around 500 years ago, a long time before ‘modern medicine’ was invented.

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:34.717
Smallpox, otherwise known as variola, was a devastating

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:38.367
disease that had existed since the Ancient Egyptians.

00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:43.777
By the 15th century it had spread to large parts of the

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:50.167
globe, and was killing 300,000 people a year in Europe alone.

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:52.837
It was highly contagious.

00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:56.647
You could catch it either by breathing the same air

00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.707
as someone who was infected, or from direct contact.

00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:07.207
You’ve probably seen pictures of what happens to someone when they get smallpox.

00:04:07.587 --> 00:04:14.127
They are normally covered in horrible scabs, and suffer from fever and vomiting.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:20.627
And if you got smallpox you had a 30% chance of dying.

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:23.927
So, not good news at all.

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:31.967
The first records of attempted vaccination, or technically it was called variolation, but

00:04:32.407 --> 00:04:39.277
they are very similar things - the first record comes from China, in the 15th century.

00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:47.297
It was discovered that by taking some of the dried scabs, the dried skin of someone

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:54.537
who had smallpox and rubbing that on the skin of someone without smallpox, that person

00:04:54.717 --> 00:05:01.337
would normally develop only a mild infection, and they would recover after a few weeks.

00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:06.177
If they had this small infection then they were

00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:10.067
unlikely to get a full blown, dangerous and deadly one.

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:19.294
The process was still quite dangerous, and between 0.5% and and of people who had this

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:26.704
primitive vaccine died from it, because they did develop the full, bad, deadly smallpox.

00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:34.074
But still, 2% is a lot better than 30%, and I certainly think I’d like those odds.

00:05:35.424 --> 00:05:41.454
Knowledge of this method of preventing smallpox spread, and it was popularised

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:47.294
in Britain by an aristocratic lady named Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:53.334
She had not only lost her brother to smallpox, but she had also

00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:58.264
got it, recovered, and was left with terrible scars on her face.

00:05:59.474 --> 00:06:03.884
She heard about this process of variolation, she had it

00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:07.954
done on her children, and started promoting it in Britain.

00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:14.244
Early experiments with this process proved encouraging, and the

00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:18.174
Royal Family was impressed, trusting it with their own children.

00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:27.874
It hit a major roadblock though when a son of King George III, a boy called Prince Octavius, the

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:33.854
eighth son, as you might be able to guess from the name, died after being given this treatment.

00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:38.474
Despite the loss of the prince, this primitive

00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:42.144
version of vaccination went from strength to strength.

00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:50.194
It was quite easy to do, and doctors developed new and innovative ways of doing it.

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:56.094
The key thing they were trying to achieve was to reduce the strength of the

00:06:56.094 --> 00:07:01.304
smallpox virus that was given to the person, which they did through things

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:06.904
like drying it and burying it in the ground before giving it to the patient.

00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:15.364
By the 18th century, the practice was widespread throughout Europe, as well as the United States,

00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:22.664
although there was still a non-zero chance of you actually getting smallpox from it and dying.

00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:27.094
So, it was better than nothing, but still imperfect.

00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:33.164
Towards the end of the 18th century British doctors had noticed

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:38.084
something strange about dairy farmers, about cow farmers.

00:07:38.564 --> 00:07:43.864
They rarely got smallpox, but they did get something called

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:49.464
cowpox, which was similar but significantly less lethal.

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:59.024
A man named Edward Jenner hypothesised that if someone was given a small amount of the cowpox

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:06.994
virus, instead of smallpox, this might have the effect of immunising them against smallpox.

00:08:08.194 --> 00:08:16.954
On 14 May 1796 he tried out this theory on an eight year old boy, the son of Jenner’s gardener.

00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:24.024
The boy developed some very mild symptoms, but then recovered.

00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:31.094
And when they tried to infect him with smallpox a few weeks later, he didn’t get it.

00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:32.124
He was immune.

00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:39.634
Jenner had done it, he had found a way to safely vaccinate against smallpox.

00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:46.354
Of course, more tests needed to be done, but this was the basis of vaccination.

00:08:47.214 --> 00:08:53.854
Indeed the term ‘vaccination’ comes from Jenner’s invention - vacca is cow in Latin.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:59.434
Jenner has been called the father of immunology, and this discovery

00:08:59.624 --> 00:09:04.344
is thought to have saved more lives than the work of any other human.

00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:14.084
By the year 1840 the previous process of immunisation, variolation, which used the real smallpox

00:09:14.084 --> 00:09:20.924
virus, was banned, and Jenner’s method was the approved one promoted by the British government.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:26.804
There were philanthropic missions that travelled throughout the Americas and East

00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:33.044
Asia giving people this vaccine, inoculating them and saving them from the disease.

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:39.484
And even Napoleon, in the middle of a war with Britain, gave every one

00:09:39.514 --> 00:09:44.744
of his soldiers Jenner’s smallpox vaccine and awarded Jenner a medal.

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:52.504
By the start of the 20th century, smallpox had been virtually eradicated in the

00:09:52.504 --> 00:09:58.234
developed world, however it was spiralling out of control in the developing world.

00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:04.824
It’s estimated that it killed 300 million people in the 20th century.

00:10:06.074 --> 00:10:13.314
There was a huge, global effort to eradicate the disease, using a vaccine that was based on the

00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:22.564
one Jenner had discovered 150 years earlier, and on May 8, 1980 it was declared to be eradicated

00:10:22.614 --> 00:10:28.194
by the World Health Assembly, the decision making body of the World Health Organisation.

00:10:29.014 --> 00:10:35.094
After Jenner’s smallpox vaccine, vaccines for other diseases continued to be discovered.

00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:43.214
Louis Pasteur developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax, and we now have

00:10:43.224 --> 00:10:49.244
vaccines for dozens of diseases that used to kill millions of people every year.

00:10:50.414 --> 00:10:54.354
Vaccination is promoted by pretty much every government,

00:10:54.414 --> 00:10:59.334
and often subsidised to encourage people to get vaccinated.

00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:05.034
It’s much cheaper to vaccinate someone than to care for them if they

00:11:05.034 --> 00:11:10.544
get sick, and so governments don’t just do it for moral reasons - there

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:14.834
are some very good economic reasons for them to encourage it as well.

00:11:16.074 --> 00:11:21.544
But, for as long as vaccines have been around, there have been people who have been

00:11:21.544 --> 00:11:27.174
opposed to them, who do not want to take them for all sorts of reasons, from religious

00:11:27.194 --> 00:11:32.984
to moral to scientific to health to people just believing that they don’t work.

00:11:33.904 --> 00:11:39.534
And despite the billions of people around the world who have been vaccinated safely, and

00:11:39.544 --> 00:11:45.214
the hundreds of millions of deaths that have been prevented, as you'll no doubt know,

00:11:45.554 --> 00:11:51.374
the proportion of people who are sceptical about vaccinations has never been higher.

00:11:52.704 --> 00:12:02.314
Indeed, even in 2019, before COVID-19, vaccine scepticism, or anti vax, was listed as

00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:09.084
one of the top 10 global health threats by the WHO, by the World Health Organisation.

00:12:10.384 --> 00:12:16.284
The reason is that for a disease to be completely eradicated and for it to not have

00:12:16.284 --> 00:12:22.744
a chance to be transmitted again, as many people as possible need to be immune to it.

00:12:23.584 --> 00:12:28.734
The more people who aren’t immune to a particular disease, the more bodies, the

00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:35.104
more homes, that disease has, and the greater the probability is that it can return.

00:12:36.534 --> 00:12:39.604
You’ve probably heard a lot about this in the past

00:12:39.614 --> 00:12:43.354
few months, and have heard the term ‘herd immunity’.

00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:50.114
To recap, herd immunity is the idea that if enough people in the population

00:12:50.154 --> 00:12:56.834
are immune to a disease or virus this means it can’t spread as fast

00:12:56.984 --> 00:13:01.754
as it would if nobody was immune, and this protects the population.

00:13:03.064 --> 00:13:08.614
Modern anti vax ideas typically include anything from doubts about

00:13:08.624 --> 00:13:13.554
the effectiveness of vaccines through to a belief that they actively

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:18.434
cause you harm, and other, more wild and dangerous conspiracy theories.

00:13:19.504 --> 00:13:24.284
We’re not going to give these the benefit of any real consideration here today,

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:30.194
as they have all been debunked, proved wrong by pretty much every serious

00:13:30.204 --> 00:13:35.754
health professional, but there is one famous case that it is worth mentioning.

00:13:36.784 --> 00:13:40.744
And that is the belief that there is a link between the MMR

00:13:41.494 --> 00:13:46.274
vaccine, the Mumps, Measles and Rubella vaccine, and autism.

00:13:47.704 --> 00:13:53.334
Now, this theory has been completely debunked, it has been proved to not be true.

00:13:54.054 --> 00:14:00.724
The man who proposed it has been struck off the medical register, he is no longer allowed to

00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:07.364
practice medicine, and the journal in which the theory was originally published has removed it.

00:14:08.704 --> 00:14:13.034
So there is absolutely no proof that it’s true, but it has remained

00:14:13.044 --> 00:14:17.634
the most famous and dangerous conspiracy theory about vaccines.

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:27.854
In 1998 Andrew Wakefield, then a doctor and academic, published a paper in a reputable medical

00:14:27.864 --> 00:14:35.234
journal called The Lancet suggesting that there was a link between this vaccine and autism.

00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:41.054
Evidently, that would be a terrible thing, and it’s every parent’s worst

00:14:41.064 --> 00:14:46.164
nightmare that by trying to protect their child, they are actually harming them.

00:14:47.194 --> 00:14:54.094
The news of Wakefield’s discovery or proposal soon spread, he called a press

00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:59.814
conference and called for this vaccine to be stopped until more research was done.

00:15:01.084 --> 00:15:05.794
But, it turned out that these claims were completely false.

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:12.334
The laboratory in which the tests had been conducted, had made several

00:15:12.354 --> 00:15:17.864
mistakes, and there was absolutely no evidence that this vaccine caused autism.

00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:25.114
Whatsmore, Wakefield hadn’t revealed that he had a financial interest in

00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:29.524
attacking this particular vaccine, as he was developing a different one.

00:15:30.164 --> 00:15:34.754
So the entire thing was a fraud, but the damage was done.

00:15:35.954 --> 00:15:40.584
Just the mention of the possibility that this vaccine could cause

00:15:40.634 --> 00:15:45.984
autism was enough, even if it has proved to be a complete lie.

00:15:46.994 --> 00:15:52.564
Wakefield didn’t start the anti vax movement, but he was the highest

00:15:52.774 --> 00:15:58.244
profile person to be involved with it, and is now a frequent campaigner

00:15:58.284 --> 00:16:05.174
at antivax protests and is a sort of figurehead for the anti vax movement.

00:16:06.184 --> 00:16:08.964
And as you know, this movement is growing.

00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:18.654
There was a survey in 2019 that suggested that 40% of Americans doubt vaccine safety, and

00:16:18.914 --> 00:16:25.834
parents who have the means, who either live in countries where vaccines are free, or who have

00:16:25.844 --> 00:16:32.484
the financial ability to pay for them are increasingly refusing to vaccinate their children.

00:16:33.604 --> 00:16:38.134
The effect of this is, as expected, a return of some of

00:16:38.144 --> 00:16:41.774
the diseases that these vaccines were created to prevent.

00:16:43.094 --> 00:16:49.744
In the year 2000 the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the main body for infectious

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:56.624
diseases in the US declared that ‘measles’ had been eliminated throughout the United States.

00:16:57.484 --> 00:17:04.624
Eliminated in this case means that there had been no transmission for 12 consequent months.

00:17:05.814 --> 00:17:11.054
But with the rise of the anti vax movement, and more and more parents

00:17:11.104 --> 00:17:15.844
refusing to give their children vaccinations, measles came back.

00:17:17.184 --> 00:17:28.774
In 2010 there were 60 cases, then 220 the next year, and in 2019 there were 1282 cases.

00:17:29.454 --> 00:17:35.724
In 2020 the cases will drop dramatically, but that’s only due to COVID and people

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:41.004
being inside - if there had been no COVID, no doubt it would have increased.

00:17:42.404 --> 00:17:44.404
And it’s not just in the US.

00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:48.784
It’s growing the world over, as there is growing distrust in government

00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:55.654
institutions and information, or rather misinformation, spreads more easily and

00:17:55.654 --> 00:18:00.784
faster than ever, thanks to the internet, social networks and messaging apps.

00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:09.484
This has got governments scratching their heads, with no country really sure what to do about it.

00:18:10.854 --> 00:18:17.214
In some countries, especially less developed countries, it’s thought to be a question

00:18:17.234 --> 00:18:23.544
of education and providing the right information about the effectiveness of vaccines.

00:18:24.514 --> 00:18:30.094
The theory goes that if people just understand that vaccines are safe,

00:18:30.524 --> 00:18:36.004
cheap or free, and an effective way of preventing deadly disease,

00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:40.034
then they would be more likely to have their children vaccinated.

00:18:41.064 --> 00:18:46.244
But in developed countries the problem isn’t information, it’s trust.

00:18:47.444 --> 00:18:53.204
In a world where people have been conditioned to not believe anything that an official

00:18:53.234 --> 00:18:58.414
institution tells them, no amount of the World Health Organisation telling you

00:18:58.624 --> 00:19:03.654
that vaccines are effective is going to work, because you simply don’t trust them.

00:19:04.494 --> 00:19:08.364
Indeed, often this has the opposite effect.

00:19:09.054 --> 00:19:14.274
If you believe that there is some global conspiracy forcing children

00:19:14.364 --> 00:19:19.644
to have vaccines, then adverts from government bodies telling you that

00:19:19.824 --> 00:19:25.114
vaccines are safe are probably going to reinforce your pre-existing beliefs.

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:31.504
And of course, social media has made amplifying and spreading these kinds of

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:37.924
theories easier than ever, and anti-vax has become an ideological war ground.

00:19:39.204 --> 00:19:44.964
There was a report that found that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll

00:19:44.964 --> 00:19:50.524
farm, a group that systematically uses social media to interfere in political

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:58.404
opinions, this organisation had used Twitter bots to amplify prominent antivax tweets.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:03.474
And there are thousands of very active anti vax groups on

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:07.654
Facebook, which help fan the flames of the anti vax movement.

00:20:08.944 --> 00:20:12.584
And this brings us on to the one elephant in the

00:20:12.584 --> 00:20:15.744
room, the one thing that we haven’t yet talked about.

00:20:16.404 --> 00:20:18.524
A vaccine for COVID-19.

00:20:19.804 --> 00:20:27.464
Now, this episode will be released in December 2020, so obviously this subject is very much ongoing.

00:20:28.174 --> 00:20:31.544
Perhaps by the time you listen to it there will be a widely

00:20:31.544 --> 00:20:34.984
available vaccine, and this pandemic will be declared over.

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:40.474
For that to happen though, a large enough percentage of people need to

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:46.284
take it, and recent surveys suggest that this might not be that simple.

00:20:47.524 --> 00:20:54.134
The number of Americans who say that they’ll be happy to take a vaccine for COVID-19 at

00:20:54.144 --> 00:21:01.464
the last count was 58%, and the numbers for most European countries are broadly similar.

00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:08.624
Evidently, the more people are vaccinated the less opportunity there is for the virus to

00:21:08.624 --> 00:21:15.684
spread, so the next challenge will be to actually develop ways to encourage people to do this.

00:21:16.704 --> 00:21:22.394
A challenge that is, perhaps, a lot harder than developing the vaccine itself.

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:28.754
OK then, that is it for today's short history of vaccines.

00:21:29.174 --> 00:21:32.484
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:33.824 --> 00:21:37.114
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:40.364
Did you know about how vaccines were first invented?

00:21:40.944 --> 00:21:44.324
Have you had much experience with the anti-vax movement?

00:21:44.914 --> 00:21:49.414
I know it’s a bit of a hot potato of a topic, but I would love to know what you think.

00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:52.994

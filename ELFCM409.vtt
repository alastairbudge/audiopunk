Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.120
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.139
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.950
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the trial of O.J.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.440
Simpson.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.350
It has been called the trial of the century and the most solved unsolved murder mystery of all time.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:41.730
It was also played out on live TV, and, albeit indirectly, bears

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.991
some responsibility for the worldwide fame of the Kardashians.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.879
So, in this episode we’ll tell the story of what happened on one

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.940
fateful night in Beverly Hills, the evidence for and against O.J.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.630
Simpson, the outcome of the trial, and the legacy this left on America.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.660
I should add that this episode does contain references to violence and to a

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.509
murder scene, so if that isn’t your cup of tea, you should press pause now.

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.490
OK then, the trial of O.J.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.920
Simpson.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.320
If you ask an American what they were doing on June 17th, 1994, you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.909
might be surprised to find out that many people over a certain age will

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.770
be able to tell you exactly where they were and what they were doing.

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:40.036
To be precise, 95 million Americans, or 37% of the entire population,

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:46.986
tuned in to watch perhaps the most surreal piece of reality TV in history.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:54.316
Earlier that day, at 11am to be precise, a man called O.J.

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:59.246
Simpson had failed to hand himself in to the Los Angeles Police.

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:05.838
His ex-wife had been found brutally murdered, the police wanted to question him

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:10.308
about it, but he hadn’t turned up to the police station when he was supposed to.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:13.628
And nobody knew where he was.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:19.278
The police had gone to his home; he wasn’t there, nor was his car.

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:20.948
At 1.

00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:26.698
50pm he was officially declared a fugitive, on the run from the law.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:29.458
This man, O.J.

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:34.318
Simpson, wasn’t just any Joe Bloggs; he was a household

00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:37.758
name, a hugely popular American football player.

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:44.878
By 4.45pm, there was a warrant out for his arrest, and

00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:48.458
the District Attorney declared that anyone helping O.J.

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.588
Simpson would be prosecuted too.

00:02:52.102 --> 00:02:58.422
Just 15 minutes later, at 5pm, there was a news conference chaired by O.J.

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:02.772
Simpson’s close friend and lawyer, Robert Kardashian.

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:07.402
If you are wondering whether Robert Kardashian is any

00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:11.272
relative of The Kardashians, yes, he is their father.

00:03:12.182 --> 00:03:16.612
Anyway, Robert Kardashian read out a letter from O.J.

00:03:16.612 --> 00:03:17.132
Simpson.

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:22.252
It read: “I have nothing to do with Nicole's murder.

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:25.522
I loved her; always have and always will.

00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:29.502
If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much.

00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:33.832
Don’t feel sorry for me, I’ve had a great life, great friends.

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:38.542
Please think of the real O.J., not this lost person.

00:03:39.098 --> 00:03:40.987
Thanks for making my life special.

00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:42.647
I hope I helped yours.

00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:44.277
Peace and love.

00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:45.447
O.J.”

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:53.227
It sounded like a suicide note, the words of a man who was about to end his life.

00:03:54.237 --> 00:04:01.717
But less than an hour later, a police responder received a call, someone had dialled 911.

00:04:02.637 --> 00:04:03.457
It was O.J.

00:04:03.457 --> 00:04:03.897
Simpson.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:09.767
And he was calling from a payphone, so it was relatively simple to see where he was.

00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:14.107
The police headed to the area where the call had been

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:18.247
made, and then a member of the public spotted O.J.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:21.207
sitting in the passenger seat of a driving car.

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:27.027
A police car pulled up beside O.J.’s car, but the driver

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:30.297
of the car shouted to the police officer that O.J.

00:04:30.327 --> 00:04:34.877
was in the back seat and had a loaded gun pointed at his head.

00:04:35.247 --> 00:04:37.517
“Please, back off”, he told her.

00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:43.317
Back up was called for, 20 more police cars were in hot

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:48.397
pursuit, and a cable news helicopter was soon flying overhead.

00:04:49.827 --> 00:04:56.697
Now, when you think of police chases on TV or in films, you probably think of hugely

00:04:56.707 --> 00:05:03.067
dramatic scenes with the driver swerving to avoid oncoming traffic, crashing into

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:08.507
the side of the highway, and everything taking place at 150 kilometres an hour.

00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:13.807
This police chase, which has gone down as one of the most

00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:17.387
famous police chases in history, was nothing like that.

00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:21.967
It did take quite a long time, almost an hour in total.

00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:30.277
But the entire thing happened very slowly, with the “chase” all happening at 60 kilometres an hour.

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:37.057
It was so slow and so long that more than 9 different news helicopters were

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:42.917
hovering overhead, and one helicopter even ran out of fuel during the chase.

00:05:44.217 --> 00:05:50.557
This was all broadcast live, on national TV, with 95 million people

00:05:50.557 --> 00:05:54.847
watching, more people than had watched the Super Bowl that year.

00:05:56.197 --> 00:05:56.667
O.J.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:02.397
Simpson was eventually persuaded to surrender, and at 8 o'clock he arrived

00:06:02.397 --> 00:06:07.457
home, sat in the car for 45 minutes, and then surrendered to the police.

00:06:08.337 --> 00:06:15.557
One of the country’s most famous and loved athletes was in custody, accused of a brutal murder.

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:22.137
But that was only the start of a murder case that would take almost a year

00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:26.847
and a half to be resolved, and many would argue, was never really solved.

00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:30.607
So, what actually happened?

00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:35.477
Well, let me first present to you the evidence, what O.J.

00:06:35.477 --> 00:06:37.687
Simpson stood accused of doing.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:45.337
4 days before this, on June the 12th, at her house in a wealthy suburb

00:06:45.517 --> 00:06:50.917
of Los Angeles, O.J.’s ex-wife had been found brutally murdered.

00:06:52.207 --> 00:06:56.237
Neighbours had been led to the property by her barking dog.

00:06:57.816 --> 00:07:02.243
When they arrived outside, they were greeted by a gruesome sight.

00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:08.493
A woman in a small black dress lay lifeless at the bottom

00:07:08.673 --> 00:07:12.643
of a flight of stairs, her blood spilled all over the tiles.

00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:21.363
Nearby was a man in blue jeans, also lying lifeless, his white shirt covered in blood.

00:07:23.023 --> 00:07:28.263
The woman was Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J.’s ex-wife, and the

00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:32.343
man was Ronald Goldman, a waiter at a nearby restaurant.

00:07:33.823 --> 00:07:41.323
A woman was dead, and one of the country’s most famous athletes was soon declared the main suspect.

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:47.890
Just as the police chase was played out on national TV, so was the trial,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.360
which started in January the following year, 7 months after the murders.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:59.380
Now, rather than me giving you the detailed breakdown of exactly what happened during

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.000
the trial, let me present you the evidence for, the evidence that suggested that O.J.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.400
Simpson was guilty of murder and the evidence against,

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.470
the evidence that suggested that he was innocent.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.740
You may already know what the jury decided, but let me give you the

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.850
evidence again and you can decide whether you agree with them or not.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.700
So, what evidence was there to suggest that O.J.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.170
Simpson was the knife-wielding murderer?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.020
Well, let me first fill in a few gaps from the evening

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.770
of the murder, so you have a more complete picture.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.290
O.J.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.160
and Nicole had been married for seven years, from

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.800
1985 to 1992, and the pair had two children together.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.200
So, they had been separated for a couple of years before the murder

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.732
On the afternoon of the murder, they had both gone to one of their children’s dance rehearsals.

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:10.210
After the dance rehearsal, Nicole Brown and her family went to a nearby restaurant called Mezzaluna.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.710
They went without O.J.; he wasn’t invited.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.900
Working at this restaurant was a waiter called Ron Goldman, who had

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.610
apparently grown close to Nicole Brown in the previous few weeks.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.630
It’s not clear whether they were anything more than friends though.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:35.900
Anyway, the family had a meal, then went to Ben & Jerry’s for ice cream before returning home.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:44.730
At exactly 9.37pm, Nicole Brown’s mother phoned the restaurant to say that she had left her

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:51.660
glasses, the restaurant manager found them, put them in a white envelope and asked Ron Goldman

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.370
to take them to Nicole Brown’s house when he finished his shift, which was going to be at 9.50pm.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.230
While this was all happening, O.J.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.090
Simpson had gone to McDonald’s with a friend who was staying with him.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.370
The pair went to McDonald’s to get their food, then returned to O.J’s home to eat.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.560
They ate their dinner together, then O.J left his friend.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.280
This was at around 9:36 pm.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.270
O.J’s home, by the way, was just around the corner

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.470
from Nicole’s, it was about a 5 minute drive away.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:38.184
The next thing we know is that Nicole Brown’s dog started barking incessantly at around 10.15pm.

00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:46.440
At 10.55pm the dog was discovered by a dog walker, with its paws covered in blood.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.570
And shortly afterwards, after being led to the house by this dog, there

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.570
was the gruesome discovery of the bodies of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.270
There was no sign of a break in, which suggested that the person who had

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.780
committed the murder had a key, or had been let in by the owner of the house.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.880
So, where was O.J.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.860
Simpson while all this was happening?

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.760
What was his alibi?

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:22.760
Well, that evening he was scheduled to take a flight from Los Angeles to Chicago, the “red

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:29.730
eye”, which would leave Los Angeles at 11:45 pm and arrive in Chicago the following morning.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.830
A limousine driver arrived at O.J.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:39.657
Simpson’s house at around 1025pm, drove around the block to check which

00:11:39.697 --> 00:11:44.847
driveway to use, and then started ringing the doorbell at 10:40 pm.

00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:51.266
But, there was no answer, and it seemed like all the lights were out.

00:11:52.426 --> 00:11:56.407
The driver waited, and then started to get a little concerned.

00:11:57.407 --> 00:11:57.877
O.J.

00:11:57.887 --> 00:12:01.977
would miss his flight, and he would miss his meetings the following day.

00:12:03.637 --> 00:12:08.147
The driver called around to see if he could get a home number for O.J.

00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:12.727
He was looking for signs of activity in the house, and at one

00:12:12.727 --> 00:12:18.207
point he saw a tall shadowy figure going in through a side doorway.

00:12:19.747 --> 00:12:24.067
Eventually, the friend who was staying with O.J., called Kato

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:28.797
Kaelin, saw the limousine outside and he let the driver in.

00:12:30.277 --> 00:12:36.877
This friend, Kato Kaelin had also seen some suspicious activity around the house.

00:12:38.377 --> 00:12:44.667
At approximately 10:40 pm, he had heard three large thumps, three

00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:49.167
bangs, that were so loud that he thought there was an earthquake.

00:12:50.017 --> 00:12:53.497
He went outside to investigate, but didn’t see anything.

00:12:54.987 --> 00:12:57.807
It was then that he let in the limousine driver.

00:12:59.147 --> 00:13:01.077
Shortly afterwards, O.J.

00:13:01.087 --> 00:13:03.787
emerged, saying that he had overslept.

00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:10.767
He got into the limo and he and the driver headed off to the airport to catch his flight.

00:13:12.077 --> 00:13:13.487
Now, O.J.

00:13:13.777 --> 00:13:16.637
had four bags with him when he left his house.

00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:23.847
His driver had started to pick them up to put them in the boot of the limo, but when he

00:13:23.847 --> 00:13:30.277
tried to pick one of them up, O.J shouted at him and told him to leave that one; O.J.

00:13:30.397 --> 00:13:31.537
would handle it himself.

00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:35.817
And, interestingly enough, O.J.

00:13:36.037 --> 00:13:42.837
only checked in three bags for his flight; this mystery fourth bag never made it to Chicago.

00:13:44.447 --> 00:13:50.197
Both the limousine driver and Kato Kaelin would later testify that O.J.

00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:53.887
seemed nervous, tense, when he emerged from the house.

00:13:55.007 --> 00:13:57.357
And the driver would add that O.J.

00:13:57.357 --> 00:14:03.027
continually complained about how hot it was in the limousine; he seemed flustered.

00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:11.725
So, to conclude, the murders happened between 10pm and 10:30pm.

00:14:12.877 --> 00:14:17.877
O.J had no witnesses for where he was from between 9:36

00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:21.607
pm and 10:54 pm, when he came out of the house again.

00:14:22.877 --> 00:14:26.517
He told the court that he was at home at that time, sleeping.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.557
His house was only a five minute drive away from Nicole Brown’s, the

00:14:32.807 --> 00:14:37.287
site of the murder, so there was plenty of time for him to be at the

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:43.197
house at the time of the murders and then return to his house by 10:45pm.

00:14:44.557 --> 00:14:49.967
But, to state the obvious, the fact that he could have done it from a timing perspective

00:14:50.207 --> 00:14:55.607
does not mean that he did it, it is, as his defence would put it, circumstantial.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.730
Unfortunately for O.J.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.690
Simpson, there was plenty of evidence that was harder to explain.

00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:06.687
Firstly, there was the physical evidence.

00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:13.150
At the murder scene, police found  a blue hat and a leather glove.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.410
They also found footprints in the blood that did not match either of the victims.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.760
When these pieces of evidence were examined, well, they did find a match.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.110
The blue hat contained O.J.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.000
Simpson’s hair.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.530
When police searched O.J.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.580
Simpson’s home, they found a single glove that completed

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.330
the pair of bloody gloves found at the murder scene.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:47.680
And on that glove they found DNA matches for both murder victims and the dog.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.840
And it gets worse.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.900
They found blue fibres on both murder victims.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.090
O.J.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.100
Simpson had been wearing a blue shirt at the dance recital

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.160
that afternoon, but had removed it to go on the flight.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.460
And it was never found again.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.660
And fibres from a Ford Bronco, O.J.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.390
Simpson’s car, were found on both murder victims.

00:16:16.974 --> 00:16:20.764
And the bloody footprint at the murder scene was a match

00:16:20.774 --> 00:16:24.844
for a very expensive and rare pair of shoes that O.J.

00:16:24.854 --> 00:16:27.894
had been pictured wearing 9 months before the murders.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:35.410
Now, all of this evidence came out at the trial, but I must give you some more

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.780
information about the events of that evening, as this also doesn’t scream “innocent”.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:42.800
O.J.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.160
Simpson made his flight, just in time.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:51.260
An airport employee would later testify that he saw Simpson throwing a bag

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:56.054
into a rubbish bin, which would explain where the mystery “fourth bag” got to.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.560
The flight time from LA to Chicago is just over four hours.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.660
During this time, the time that O.J.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.780
was on the plane, the police had been called to the crime scene, they had gone to O.J.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.850
Simpson’s house to notify him and ask him to collect his children,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.950
who had been asleep at their mother’s house while she was murdered.

00:17:19.114 --> 00:17:21.140
But, of course, O.J.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.390
was nowhere to be found.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:29.217
O.J.’s friend, Kato Kaeilin, told the police about the three thumps he had

00:17:29.217 --> 00:17:35.300
heard, and when a police officer went to look, he found a bloodied glove,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.660
the one that was a match of the other bloody glove found at the murder scene.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.716
When O.J.'s flight touched down, the police called him to notify him.

00:17:47.576 --> 00:17:53.946
The officer who spoke to him would later testify that O.J did sound agitated,

00:17:54.356 --> 00:18:00.106
but he didn’t ask any questions about the circumstances of the murder: when,

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:06.006
who did it, how, really, the typical questions that people usually ask if

00:18:06.006 --> 00:18:09.726
they are presented with the news that someone close to them has been murdered.

00:18:11.176 --> 00:18:11.556
O.J.

00:18:11.586 --> 00:18:17.746
returned to Los Angeles that day, gave a blood sample to the police, and was released.

00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:26.266
And this brings us to June 17th, the day of the car chase, the suicide note read

00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:30.956
out by Kim Kardashian’s father, Rob, and his eventual surrender to the police.

00:18:32.206 --> 00:18:37.976
Again, as the prosecution would point out, not the typical behaviour of an innocent

00:18:37.976 --> 00:18:43.573
man, and certainly not the behaviour of someone who knew nothing about the murders.

00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:48.656
What’s more, at the trial the jury learned that O.J.

00:18:48.656 --> 00:18:53.396
Simpson had a history of violent behaviour towards his wife, and

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:58.246
she had called 911 multiple times saying “he’s going to kill me”.

00:18:59.636 --> 00:19:06.376
So, to wrap up the prosecution’s argument, O.J didn’t have a viable alibi for

00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:10.626
what he was doing at the time of the murder, there was plenty of evidence linking

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:16.266
him to the murder scene, and he had a history of violence towards his wife.

00:19:17.696 --> 00:19:18.956
It wasn’t looking good.

00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:24.166
But, Simpson retained a so-called “Dream Team” of

00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:27.796
lawyers, the best lawyers in the country, to his defence.

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:34.126
His defence rested not on the fact that there was other evidence that he was somewhere else at

00:19:34.126 --> 00:19:40.756
the time of the murder or that there was another clear suspect, but on the fact that the forensic

00:19:40.816 --> 00:19:47.456
evidence that was found at the scene was either contaminated or had been planted by the police.

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:53.116
For almost every piece of evidence, the defence claimed that it had been

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:58.916
planted at a later stage by corrupt police officers in a bid to frame O.J.

00:19:58.916 --> 00:19:59.306
Simpson.

00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:05.876
And why would the police officers have done that, why would they have tried to frame O.J?

00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:09.126
In a word, racism.

00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:12.716
And in two words, racism and corruption.

00:20:14.204 --> 00:20:19.884
One of the lead detectives on the case, a man called Mark Furhman, was accused of

00:20:19.894 --> 00:20:26.054
being a racist, and having deliberately falsified evidence to make it look like O.J.

00:20:26.054 --> 00:20:30.894
Simpson, an African American, had killed his white ex-wife.

00:20:32.444 --> 00:20:38.314
Furhman denied this, but during the trial there was a tape played where Furhman

00:20:38.344 --> 00:20:44.321
could clearly be heard using racist slurs 41 times in a single recording.

00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:53.271
Now, we haven’t properly addressed this yet, but the entire case was permeated by racial tensions.

00:20:54.661 --> 00:20:55.061
O.J.

00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:56.581
Simpson was black.

00:20:57.171 --> 00:21:02.631
The murder victims, his ex-wife Nicole and the waiter, Ron, were both white.

00:21:04.215 --> 00:21:11.205
What’s more, the early 1990s was a period of particularly high racial tensions in the US.

00:21:12.395 --> 00:21:18.262
In 1992 there had been riots in Los Angeles after four police officers

00:21:18.522 --> 00:21:23.068
had been found not guilty of the beating of an African American man

00:21:23.188 --> 00:21:27.192
called Rodney King despite clear evidence that they had done it.

00:21:28.762 --> 00:21:34.182
By many, especially in the African American community, the police were seen as

00:21:34.212 --> 00:21:39.582
corrupt and racist, which was exactly the argument that O.J.’s defence put forward.

00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:47.072
So, this was the background to the trial, which took place at the start of 1995.

00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:53.502
Now, as you may know, the way in which criminal trials work in the United

00:21:53.502 --> 00:21:58.892
States is that the prosecution and the defence seek to fill the jury

00:21:59.122 --> 00:22:03.512
with members who they believe will be sympathetic to their arguments.

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:08.642
Of course, members of the jury are meant to be completely

00:22:08.742 --> 00:22:13.432
impartial and unbiased, but they are human after all.

00:22:13.812 --> 00:22:18.002
We all have inherent biases that we may or may not be aware of.

00:22:19.512 --> 00:22:24.182
From an initial pool of over 300 potential jurors,

00:22:24.502 --> 00:22:28.302
the final jury was made up of ten women and two men.

00:22:29.772 --> 00:22:37.642
And in terms of the racial makeup, there were 9 black jurors, two white, and one Hispanic.

00:22:38.892 --> 00:22:47.692
In the afternoon of October 2nd, 1995, an estimated 100 million people tuned in to hear the verdict.

00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:54.322
After eight months of listening to the evidence, the jury had decided.

00:22:55.732 --> 00:22:56.332
O.J.

00:22:56.332 --> 00:23:04.092
Simpson was declared not guilty of murder, and he would walk free that very afternoon.

00:23:05.602 --> 00:23:11.552
It was a hugely divisive event in US race relations, and there was a clear

00:23:11.552 --> 00:23:16.532
split between white and black Americans in terms of whether they felt O.J.

00:23:16.622 --> 00:23:17.572
was guilty or not.

00:23:19.182 --> 00:23:25.322
At the time of the trial, approximately 75% of white Americans thought O.J.

00:23:25.322 --> 00:23:30.612
Simpson was guilty while 70% of black Americans thought he was innocent.

00:23:31.962 --> 00:23:37.742
These were people who had heard exactly the same evidence, as it had all been broadcast on national

00:23:37.752 --> 00:23:43.822
television and written up in the newspaper, but had come to radically different conclusions.

00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:52.952
Now, this balance has shifted slightly, which was not helped by a bizarre event in 2007 when O.J.

00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:57.252
Simpson was involved in an armed robbery in a hotel in Las Vegas.

00:23:58.432 --> 00:24:02.822
In this trial he was found guilty and sentenced to 33 years in prison.

00:24:04.312 --> 00:24:07.102
The number of people who now believe that O.J.

00:24:07.102 --> 00:24:12.912
was the knife-wielding murderer of his ex-wife has increased, with 83% of

00:24:12.912 --> 00:24:18.092
white Americans and 57% of black Americans believing that he was guilty.

00:24:19.612 --> 00:24:21.172
And indeed, O.J.

00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:26.262
was found guilty in a civil case of something called “wrongful death”.

00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:32.019
This was a civil case not a criminal one, so it meant that he wasn’t faced with

00:24:32.019 --> 00:24:38.934
any jail time, but he was ordered to pay 33.5 million dollars in damages to the

00:24:38.934 --> 00:24:43.984
families of Nicole Brown and Ron Goodman, which he has apparently still not done.

00:24:45.154 --> 00:24:47.284
So, was justice done?

00:24:48.324 --> 00:24:51.664
You have heard the evidence, and perhaps you have come

00:24:51.664 --> 00:24:54.904
to your own conclusions about his innocence or guilt.

00:24:55.974 --> 00:24:57.704
If you believe that O.J.

00:24:57.704 --> 00:25:02.014
Simpson was innocent all along, then his good name has been

00:25:02.024 --> 00:25:06.134
dragged through the mud and the real killer is still walking free.

00:25:07.664 --> 00:25:09.024
If you believe that O.J.

00:25:09.024 --> 00:25:13.584
Simpson was guilty, then the real killer is still walking free.

00:25:14.694 --> 00:25:19.274
Indeed, O.J Simpson was released from his 33-year prison sentence

00:25:19.304 --> 00:25:24.654
for armed robbery in 2017, and he is now a completely free man.

00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:30.934
Whatever side you come down on, the trial of O.J Simpson will go down in

00:25:30.934 --> 00:25:36.094
history as not just a captivating legal drama but a complex story that

00:25:36.104 --> 00:25:41.264
involves race relations, the cult of celebrity, the media and the police.

00:25:42.694 --> 00:25:47.084
And ultimately, it leaves us with plenty of interesting questions about the

00:25:47.084 --> 00:25:52.454
judicial system and the inherently human biases that might make two people

00:25:52.744 --> 00:25:57.294
who hear exactly the same thing come to completely different conclusions.

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:03.939
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Trial of O.J.

00:26:03.939 --> 00:26:04.269
Simpson.

00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:07.969
I know it was quite a long one, but there was a lot to go through.

00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:10.789
After all, the trial did take 8 months!

00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:14.509
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:26:14.959 --> 00:26:17.769
The most obvious question is…did he or didn’t he?

00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:20.649
And if he didn’t, who did?

00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:25.139
This is actually an interesting question and there are some fascinating

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:29.169
theories about this, which unfortunately we didn’t have time to go into today.

00:26:29.499 --> 00:26:31.669
So, let’s get this discussion started.

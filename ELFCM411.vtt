Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.100
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.970
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.689
perhaps the most famous canal in the world, the Panama Canal.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.040
It’s an amazing feat of engineering, but it is much more than that.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.129
Its story is one of failure, corruption, ingenuity,

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:44.189
cooperation, and ultimately, mankind versus mother nature.

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.839
OK then, The Panama Canal.

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.049
Around three million years ago, the bodies of water we now know as

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.549
the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean were one, single ocean.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.779
But under the Earth’s surface, two plates were on a collision path.

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:11.169
The Pacific Plate was moving towards the Caribbean plate.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.219
When the two met, the Pacific Plate slid under the Caribbean, pushing the Earth’s crust upwards.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.459
First, small islands were created.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.689
And gradually, these islands became greater in number and in size, then greater

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.849
still, eventually forming a small piece of land that joined North and South America.

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:41.309
The technical term for this, you might know, is an isthmus.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:51.638
And in 1513, a Spanish explorer by the name  of Vasco Núñez de Balboa had made

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:58.438
his way across this isthmus, becoming the first European to set eyes on what he

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:04.758
called “the South Sea”, the vast ocean that we know today as the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:10.928
This discovery was important because it provided clear evidence that the

00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:17.038
so-called “New World” was indeed a separate landmass, distinct from Asia.

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:26.538
And it also planted the seed for the idea of a passageway, a body of water that would allow people,

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:34.088
or rather, ships, to cross this continent rather than have to go all the way around the bottom.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:39.898
It would, however, be over 400 years until this dream

00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:43.838
was actually realised in the form of The Panama Canal.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.138
So, first, a little geography.

00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:54.478
As you will know, Panama is the small Central American country where our story takes place.

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.911
It's relatively small by global standards, but it’s

00:02:58.941 --> 00:03:02.381
actually not so small by Central American standards.

00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:07.101
In fact, it is slap bang in the middle: of the seven Central

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:11.671
American countries, three are smaller, and three are larger.

00:03:12.861 --> 00:03:17.361
But the one thing Panama certainly is is thin.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:23.591
At its narrowest point, Panama is a mere 61 kilometres wide.

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:30.481
And if Panama weren’t there, or if there was an easy way of getting a ship to pass

00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:36.351
from one side of Panama to the other, this would be the most tremendous shortcut.

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:43.781
For a ship to get from Europe to Asia, it would have to sail all the way around

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:49.321
Cape Horn, at the bottom of South America, then travel up through the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:56.061
But if it could somehow get over that tiny 60 kilometre slither

00:03:56.071 --> 00:04:00.961
of Panama, it could save around 20,000 kilometres of sailing.

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:04.061
It would be quicker, safer, and cheaper.

00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:10.411
Even all the way back in the 16th century, shortly after de Balboa had

00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:15.411
clapped eyes on the Pacific, the Spanish investigated the possibility of

00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:20.161
digging a canal that would link the two oceans and allow ships to pass.

00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:26.571
A survey was conducted, but it came back with a resounding no.

00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:35.721
Panama might be a very thin country, but it is mountainous and difficult to cross in many parts.

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:42.561
The mountains rise to three and a half thousand metres, and the part of

00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:47.401
the country that borders Colombia has terrain so treacherous and difficult

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:53.001
to cross that, to this day, there still isn’t any way of crossing by road.

00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:58.351
It is in many parts a thick, mountainous jungle.

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:05.748
Fast forward to the 19th century and it wasn’t just the Spanish that were interested .The

00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:11.808
French, the British, the Americans and the Colombians were all jostling for position,

00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:18.888
hoping to devise a plan to finally carve out a viable path through the Isthmus of Panama.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:24.568
Even the Germans got involved, with one German geographer called

00:05:24.648 --> 00:05:28.858
Alexander Humboldt proposing nine different routes across Panama.

00:05:30.098 --> 00:05:33.908
It’s important to note that, at the time that all of this was going

00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:38.908
on, the country we now know as Panama was going through great changes.

00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:45.008
In 1821 it went from being part of the Spanish empire to being

00:05:45.008 --> 00:05:50.028
part of Colombia, and then in 1903 it gained its independence.

00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:58.158
Ultimately, after careful consideration, in 1878, a 99-year concession was

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:03.988
granted to a French company to build and operate a canal on the Isthmus of Panama.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:09.718
And if you’re wondering, the reason that a French company was granted the rights

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:15.688
was because the French had successfully built the Suez canal in Egypt in 1869.

00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:23.288
The Suez Canal is about three times the length of the Panama Canal, and it certainly was an

00:06:23.288 --> 00:06:28.598
impressive piece of work that revolutionised trade and shipping in another part of the world.

00:06:29.218 --> 00:06:33.478
But, compared to the Panama Canal, building the Suez

00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:36.768
Canal was a piece of cake, it was incredibly easy.

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:42.688
The Suez canal is essentially a long trench across the desert.

00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:47.808
The Panama Canal needed to go through mountains and jungle.

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:53.768
The climate in Egypt is hot and dry, but predictable.

00:06:54.598 --> 00:06:59.318
The climate in Panama is hot and humid, and very unpredictable.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.878
Heavy rain can come at any time, causing landslides.

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:12.718
What’s more, Panama’s tropical climate can quickly lead to diseases like malaria and yellow fever.

00:07:13.488 --> 00:07:17.808
These were not problems the French had to deal with when building the Suez Canal.

00:07:18.998 --> 00:07:23.828
Nevertheless, the French got started on January the 1st, 1880.

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:28.518
It was a huge project, both in scale and ambition.

00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:34.578
Over 17,000 workers were shipped in, mainly from the Caribbean.

00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:40.778
And, attracted by the glamour and money-making potential of the project, and

00:07:41.058 --> 00:07:45.508
having seen the success of Suez, hundreds of thousands of ordinary French

00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:49.868
people invested their life savings into the company behind the project.

00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:58.498
The French plan was, in layman’s terms, to dig a trench from one side of the country to the other.

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:04.618
It was more or less a replica of what had worked in Egypt a few decades before.

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:10.018
It didn’t take long for the French engineers to realise that this plan wouldn’t work.

00:08:10.908 --> 00:08:14.838
For starters, whenever there were heavy rains there would be

00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:18.528
landslides, filling up the holes that the French workers had dug.

00:08:19.868 --> 00:08:23.608
They would work for months, and then in the space of 30

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:27.838
minutes of torrential rain, all of this work would be undone.

00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:35.468
It must have been hugely demoralising to the workers, but that was far from the only problem.

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:40.738
The tropical diseases were killing men in their thousands.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:50.098
By 1888, a combination of accident and disease had cost the lives of 20,000 workers.

00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:55.438
You might have thought that the loss of life would have been enough to deter

00:08:55.458 --> 00:09:01.148
the French, but the grim reality is that most of the workers were not French;

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:07.088
they were from the Caribbean, places like Antigua and Jamaica, so, to put it

00:09:07.258 --> 00:09:13.498
candidly, it was seen not as a human tragedy but as the cost of doing business.

00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:18.768
Still, if the loss of life wasn’t enough to deter the

00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:22.168
French, the impossibility of making money would be.

00:09:23.398 --> 00:09:27.858
In 1889, after the money ran out, the French company

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:31.308
building the canal was forced to declare bankruptcy.

00:09:32.508 --> 00:09:39.118
The French effort had lost something like €2 billion in today’s money, erasing the investments

00:09:39.368 --> 00:09:45.458
of some 800,000 small French investors who had been drawn by the ambition of the project.

00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:52.158
The chief developer of the project, Ferdinand de Lesseps was prosecuted for

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:57.528
corruption and misappropriation of company funds, as was the architect of the

00:09:57.548 --> 00:10:03.088
Eiffel Tower, Gustave Eiffel, who had also been involved in the design of the canal.

00:10:04.158 --> 00:10:09.468
And, far more tragically, there were the graves of 20,000 workers

00:10:09.828 --> 00:10:14.138
who had lost their lives in what would be a completely futile effort.

00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:18.608
We need to fast forward now to the start of the 20th

00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:22.518
century, ten years after the failure of the French attempt.

00:10:23.888 --> 00:10:28.528
The Americans were sensing their opportunity, and had come to an

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:32.718
agreement to pay the French for the rights to construct the canal.

00:10:33.618 --> 00:10:38.308
Remember, the French had been granted a 99 year concession, so, there

00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:41.608
was still plenty of time for them to try again if they wanted to.

00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:49.128
The added complication here was that Panama was still part of Colombia, and the Colombian

00:10:49.128 --> 00:10:55.528
senate did not accept this agreement, the agreement to sell the concession to the Americans.

00:10:56.558 --> 00:11:04.638
So, the US tried a different tack; it pushed for Panamanian independence, and was quick to support

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:11.015
and protect the newly independent nation when it declared independence in November of 1903.

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:16.715
The deal could now be signed, and the freshly independent Panama

00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:21.405
granted the United States the licence to build and administer the canal.

00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:28.195
This, as you might have gathered, is a very superficial summary of a complicated

00:11:28.195 --> 00:11:32.785
period in the political history of the region, but I hope you will forgive me

00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:37.305
as we need to move on the business of the actual construction of the canal.

00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:45.785
When American workers arrived in 1904, they found the construction site in complete disarray.

00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:50.725
It was a mess, full of falling down buildings and broken equipment.

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:54.335
They would have to start from a clean slate.

00:11:55.765 --> 00:12:00.065
Importantly, the Americans took a different approach to the French.

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:06.415
While the French tried to use brute force to dig a trench through the

00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:10.805
country, the Americans realised that they would have to change strategy.

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:16.185
Instead of trying to dig a sea-level canal through the mountains in

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:20.845
the middle of the country, the US engineers decided to create a large

00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:24.955
lake in this mountainous region through which the ships could pass.

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:32.435
They would do this by building what at the time was the world’s largest dam, the Gatun dam.

00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:38.465
This dam would then flood the jungly mountainous area in the middle

00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:43.815
of the country, creating an artificial lake 26 metres above sea level.

00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:51.255
But, you are probably wondering, how does a ship get up to the lake and then down the other side.

00:12:51.885 --> 00:12:53.405
Well, here’s the clever bit.

00:12:54.255 --> 00:13:00.455
The engineers created a system of locks, chambers that allow boats to go up and down.

00:13:01.685 --> 00:13:07.185
A boat would go into a lock, the giant doors would close behind it, then the chamber would

00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:13.325
fill with water, the boat would rise and go into the next chamber, and the process would

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:18.945
be repeated until that boat had climbed the almost 30 metres to the lake in the middle.

00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:23.815
Then the same thing would happen in reverse on the other side.

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.685
And because you only need gravity to do the work of moving

00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:32.435
water from high to low, there are no pumps required.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:38.435
Now, locks were certainly no modern American invention, and in

00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:42.385
fact were first used in Song Dynasty China, in the 10th century.

00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:49.495
But the genius of the American engineers with the Panama Canal was to create this huge

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:54.465
artificial lake which would then provide both a solution to the problem of how a boat

00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:59.885
can cross the mountains and also how to supply large amounts of water to the locks.

00:14:01.085 --> 00:14:07.515
Long story short, it worked, and the Panama Canal that’s in use today is more

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:11.955
or less the same one that the Americans finished construction of in 1914.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:16.075
And its influence is hard to overstate.

00:14:16.715 --> 00:14:21.915
It operates 24 hours a day, with 14,000 ships passing through

00:14:21.915 --> 00:14:26.435
it each year carrying almost 300 million tonnes of cargo.

00:14:27.295 --> 00:14:32.335
This is huge, it’s 40% of the world’s cargo ship traffic.

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:36.765
Using it, as you might imagine, is not cheap.

00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:42.355
The cost to use the canal depends on factors like the size and

00:14:42.355 --> 00:14:48.095
weight of the ship, and the average cost in 2022 was $211,000.

00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:56.925
It is expensive, but the alternative is taking a lot more time and spending a lot

00:14:56.925 --> 00:15:01.985
of money on fuel by going “the long way round”, around the bottom of South America.

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:09.245
And this canal is also an amazing example of global cooperation - it

00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:14.465
is neutral, open to any ship, it is not used as a political tool.

00:15:15.655 --> 00:15:19.490
Now, as to the “future” of the Panama Canal, there

00:15:19.845 --> 00:15:24.035
is one large threat to its existence: climate change.

00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:28.085
And specifically, drought, the lack of rain.

00:15:29.285 --> 00:15:34.555
The Panama Canal uses a lot of water, as every time a ship goes

00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:38.225
through, the water from the lock is let out into the ocean.

00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:46.955
Specifically, anywhere from 200 to 500 million litres are required for every ship.

00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:53.835
Historically this wasn’t a problem, as the artificial lake that forms the middle of the canal

00:15:54.135 --> 00:16:00.135
would be constantly refreshed by rivers and heavy rain that brought more than enough water into it.

00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:06.265
But recently the region has had a particularly dry patch.

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:13.175
At the start of September this year, September 2023, it was reported that

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:18.025
the water level of the lake was down 2 and a half metres from normal levels.

00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:24.265
Ships have had to reduce their weight, and crossings have had to be limited.

00:16:25.505 --> 00:16:30.325
For some types of ships, waiting times have doubled, and there

00:16:30.335 --> 00:16:33.935
have been reports of ships opting for the long way round.

00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:38.582
After all, if you might actually get there more quickly, and save

00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:42.712
yourself a quarter of a million dollars in fees, you can understand why.

00:16:43.932 --> 00:16:48.822
So, to conclude, the story of the Panama Canal is one of politics,

00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:54.482
engineering, and mankind’s desire to bend Mother Earth to our will.

00:16:55.582 --> 00:17:01.822
The French found the task too great, their efforts foiled by climate and disease.

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:05.272
The Americans learned from their predecessors' mistakes,

00:17:05.752 --> 00:17:09.492
almost literally moving mountains to overcome the challenge.

00:17:10.302 --> 00:17:17.702
But if the dry spells of the past few years are anything to go by, this battle of mankind vs.

00:17:17.742 --> 00:17:20.782
Mother Earth might not be over just yet.

00:17:22.732 --> 00:17:27.192
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Panama Canal.

As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:38.242
What can we learn from the construction of the Panama Canal?

00:17:38.752 --> 00:17:40.442
What lies ahead for the future?

00:17:41.012 --> 00:17:44.552
We have lots of curious minds in Central and Latin America,

00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:47.872
so I’d be particularly interested to hear your opinion.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.980
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.079
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.140
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Turkey.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.610
Not the kind that British people like to eat at Christmas, but the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.489
country of Turkey, or the Republic of Türkiye to give it its proper name.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.580
Specifically, today we will be talking about what went wrong with Turkey’s economy.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.030
It went from economic darling to a nation plagued by sky-high inflation,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.569
resulting in a drastic drop in disposable income and living standards.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.750
So, let’s not waste a minute, and talk about why.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.360
We are going to start this episode, uncharacteristically, in a kebab shop.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.300
Not because we are talking about Turkey, and therefore we need to start by talking about kebabs,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.629
but because it is a useful starting point for addressing the question of the Turkish economy.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.660
In July this year, I spent 10 days in Turkey.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.910
My sister got married to a man from Istanbul, and we had a wonderful time celebrating, visiting

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.499
the sights of Istanbul, and we even got the chance to visit the islands outside the city.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.660
It was great, and anyone who is fortunate enough to have been to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.950
Istanbul will know that it is one of the great cities of the world.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.380
But it was also an eye-opening experience into the reality that many

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.320
people in Turkey have been living over the past few years, are still

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.850
living today, and if you are from Turkey, well, this is your reality.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.400
So, where do kebabs fit in?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.589
Well, after a wonderful trip, we arrived at the airport, ready to get a flight home.

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:16.190
It had been a long trip to the airport, involving ferries, taxis and buses, and by the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.570
time we arrived everyone - myself, my wife and our two kids - we were all quite hungry.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.369
I suggested, for the adults in our party at least,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.839
to cap things off, that we might have a doner kebab.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.370
Sure enough, we were led by our noses to a restaurant, where a man with a very sharp

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.659
knife was standing in front of a rotating spit, from which he was carving doner kebabs.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.220
Bingo.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.433
But, fortunately before placing an order, I looked up at the menu, or the price list, to be precise.

00:02:54.553 --> 00:03:00.583
A doner kebab cost €40, which is almost $50 US dollars.

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:03.943
And this was no special kebab.

00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:09.732
It seemed like a perfectly decent but utterly normal doner kebab, one that

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:14.792
might cost less than a quarter of that in most major Western European capitals.

00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:22.952
Now, of course, this was at an airport, and prices are often inflated significantly at airports.

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:31.012
But even in Istanbul itself, and we were mainly out in a suburb far out from the

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:36.758
touristy centre, the price for a kebab was probably somewhere between €10 and

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:44.586
€15, so still the same if not higher than you would pay in London or Stockholm

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:49.812
The difference, however, is that the median salary in a

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:54.602
country like Sweden is more than six times that in Turkey.

00:03:55.742 --> 00:04:00.072
Economic theory would suggest that the price of something, especially

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:04.472
something that is considered a staple good, should broadly reflect the

00:04:04.482 --> 00:04:09.672
salaries of the residents of that area, because that’s basic economics.

00:04:10.392 --> 00:04:14.522
If prices are too low, businesses will raise their prices

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.902
without customers complaining or it affecting sales.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:23.432
If prices are too high, then customers won’t buy as much or as often.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:29.162
The price of anything is typically the cost of the raw ingredients, the cost of

00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:33.832
everything else that goes into delivering it, plus a little bit on top as profit.

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:42.242
So, how is it that a kebab in Istanbul can cost the same, or even more, than one in

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:49.002
Stockholm, when the average salary in Istanbul is only a fraction of that in Sweden?

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:51.848
Something doesn’t quite add up.

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:59.190
Hidden inside this expensive kebab, is at least part of the story of Turkey’s economic woes.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.800
Now, to understand how we got here, we need to go back—not just

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.083
to this kebab shop, and  not just a decade or two, but centuries.

00:05:10.128 --> 00:05:14.672
Turkey, or as it was known for hundreds of years, the Ottoman Empire,

00:05:14.932 --> 00:05:19.132
was once one of the most powerful and influential empires in the world.

00:05:19.632 --> 00:05:25.022
It spanned three continents—Europe, Asia, and Africa—and its capital,

00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:29.682
Constantinople, was the beating heart of global trade and politics.

00:05:30.702 --> 00:05:35.092
The Ottoman Empire was famously a bridge between East and

00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:39.412
West, connecting the riches of Asia with the markets of Europe.

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:44.052
This geographic advantage is something modern Turkey still

00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:48.252
benefits from, sitting literally at the crossroads of continents.

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:53.628
Istanbul, or Constantinople as it was formerly known, is the only

00:05:53.628 --> 00:05:58.858
major city in the world that spans two continents, Europe and Asia.

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:05.208
If you go to Istanbul, you’ll hear people talking about whether something is on the European

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:11.768
side or the Asian side, referring to whether something is to the east of the Bosphorus Strait,

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:18.269
and is therefore in Asia, or to the west of the Bosphorus Strait, and is therefore in Europe.

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:25.819
It was and still is an incredibly advantageous location, connecting East and West.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.779
But by the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was in

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.339
decline, earning it the nickname “the sick man of Europe.”

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.149
And after its defeat in World War I, the empire collapsed entirely.

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.911
Out of its ashes rose the Republic of Turkey in 1923, led

00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:51.741
by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the father of modern Turkey.

00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:57.841
Now, Atatürk deserves his own episode, but in brief, he

00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:02.201
transformed Turkey into a modern, secular nation-state.

00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:06.556
He introduced sweeping reforms—changing the alphabet,

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:10.551
granting women more rights, and pushing for industrialisation.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:18.339
His vision was for Turkey to become a modern European nation, firmly grounded in the West.

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:24.329
Fast-forward to the early 2000s, and after struggling for

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:30.049
much of the 1980s and 1990s, Turkey was in a new golden era.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:35.259
After a financial crisis in 2001, the country had

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.439
introduced a series of reforms to stabilise its economy.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.983
Inflation, which had been a huge problem throughout

00:07:43.983 --> 00:07:47.433
the 1990s in particular, was brought under control.

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:54.645
Foreign investors poured money into the country, and the economy grew at an impressive rate.

00:07:55.593 --> 00:08:01.103
For over a decade, Turkey was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:03.183
It seemed unstoppable.

00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:07.653
The government invested in huge infrastructure projects—bridges,

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:11.773
airports, and roads—and the middle class expanded.

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:18.143
People were optimistic about the future, and Turkey’s ambition to become one of the

00:08:18.143 --> 00:08:23.998
world’s top 10 economies by 2023 didn’t seem so beyond the realms of possibility.

00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:30.248
But, this growth had a somewhat unstable foundation.

00:08:31.668 --> 00:08:36.428
Turkey has historically had a pretty low savings rate, meaning that

00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:40.828
Turkish people do not tend to save a high proportion of their salary.

00:08:41.578 --> 00:08:46.508
Now, this isn’t just a feature of how wealthy a country is; there are rich

00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:51.668
countries with very low savings rates and poor countries with high savings rates.

00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:57.228
And Turkey, well, it has historically been a place with a low savings rate.

00:08:58.468 --> 00:09:02.878
Why this is important is that it means that banks do not have

00:09:02.878 --> 00:09:07.888
large reserves of cash, so it is harder for them to give out loans.

00:09:08.668 --> 00:09:13.338
But to invest in stuff like infrastructure, real estate, and so on, you

00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:18.288
need lots of capital, you need lots of money, you need cold, hard, cash.

00:09:19.348 --> 00:09:25.708
So, where did Turkey turn to to get loans for these ambitious projects it was embarking on?

00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:32.878
Well, both the Turkish government and private companies took out loans from abroad,

00:09:33.298 --> 00:09:38.608
which were denominated in foreign currencies like the US dollar or the euro.

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:45.018
In other words, a company that wanted to build a new tower block might need, let’s say,

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:52.448
350 million Turkish Lira, which was equivalent to around 100 million US dollars in 2017.

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:57.948
The company would borrow the money in US dollars, convert it to Lira to

00:09:57.948 --> 00:10:03.638
pay local costs in Lira, but they would have to pay it back in US dollars.

00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:10.238
Now, this is no problem at all when the exchange rate between dollars and Lira is

00:10:10.238 --> 00:10:18.048
stable, but if the exchange rate fluctuates, if it moves, then it can spell trouble.

00:10:19.398 --> 00:10:23.932
And this was unfortunately what happened in 2018.

00:10:25.278 --> 00:10:29.318
The Turkish lira had been losing value gradually for many years,

00:10:29.618 --> 00:10:34.823
but in the summer of 2018, things took a turn for the worse.

00:10:35.808 --> 00:10:40.468
There were tensions with the United States over a detained American pastor, a

00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:46.748
mini diplomatic crisis ensued, and Turkey was sanctioned by the United States.

00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:54.298
This spooked investors, and caused the Turkish Lira to fall 30% against the

00:10:54.298 --> 00:11:00.388
dollar, suddenly making those dollar-denominated loans 43% more expensive.

00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:08.528
That Turkish company that took out the loan for 100 million dollars in 2017, well in just the

00:11:08.528 --> 00:11:16.278
course of a few months, it cost them an extra 43% in Lira to repay their dollar-denominated loan.

00:11:17.648 --> 00:11:19.488
And it got worse.

00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:26.008
In June of 2018, 1 US dollar was worth 4.5 Turkish Lira.

00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:31.098
By August in the same year it had shot up to 6 Lira.

00:11:31.414 --> 00:11:38.636
It kept going up and up, and in 2022 the rate at which it devalued started to accelerate.

00:11:39.386 --> 00:11:46.716
As of last summer, 1 US dollar was worth 33 Turkish Lira, meaning that in just

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:53.416
6 years, the Turkish currency lost almost 90% of its value against the dollar.

00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:57.166
This was part of a vicious cycle.

00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:02.146
Businesses defaulted on loans, meaning that investors started to pull

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:07.056
out, investment dried up, jobs were lost, faith in the Turkish Lira

00:12:07.246 --> 00:12:11.726
as a currency continued to reduce, and the vicious cycle continued.

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:16.556
Paying off foreign debt became much more expensive, meaning that the prices

00:12:16.556 --> 00:12:21.986
for everything increased, costs went up, inflation rose, people were even less

00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:26.256
likely to save, given that they knew that their money would be worth less in the

00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:31.896
future, so banks had even fewer reserves to make loans for people to invest in

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:37.126
businesses or buy houses or do all of the sorts of things that banks normally did.

00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:43.626
It is not easy for a country to break this cycle, but there are some pretty well

00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:50.226
agreed-upon tools that a government or central bank can use to break a cycle of inflation.

00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:54.936
Specifically, they can raise interest rates.

00:12:56.186 --> 00:13:02.096
Now, to explain this very simply, the central bank interest rate is the rate at which

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:07.806
the central bank lends money to other banks, and is the main driver of the rate at

00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:13.086
which banks lend money to customers or pay customers in interest on their savings.

00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:17.846
When this rate goes up, it makes borrowing money more

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:21.566
expensive—for banks, businesses, and regular people.

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:25.366
It also makes saving more appealing.

00:13:26.398 --> 00:13:32.708
To give you a working example, if the interest rate is, let’s say, 1% but

00:13:32.748 --> 00:13:39.428
inflation is 10%, every year a bank might give you 1% of your savings in

00:13:39.438 --> 00:13:45.258
interest but the value of your money is eroded by 10% through inflation.

00:13:46.508 --> 00:13:51.518
It means there is little incentive to save money, as you may as well spend it.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.778
Every year it is worth less and less.

00:13:55.739 --> 00:14:04.541
But if you get paid a 10% interest rate by your bank and inflation is 1%, then the opposite is true.

00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:11.851
There is a much greater incentive to save your money instead of spending it, and if people save

00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:18.169
not spend, then businesses are more likely to reduce prices, and this helps reduce inflation.

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:25.459
What’s more, increasing the interest rate means that a country’s currency becomes

00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:30.279
more attractive to foreign investors, which helps inject money into the economy.

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:38.701
If a foreign financial institution thinks it can get a 20% or 30% or even a 50% return on its

00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:45.231
investment by buying a foreign currency, then suddenly that becomes a pretty attractive thing.

00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:53.651
Using interest rates as a way to control inflation and either heat or cool an economy is

00:14:53.651 --> 00:14:58.971
something that almost all economists agree upon, it’s something that has been tried and tested

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:05.481
multiple times, with great success, and is a major tool in the central banker’s armoury.

00:15:06.884 --> 00:15:12.124
But there was one man who didn’t subscribe to this economic philosophy.

00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:16.144
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:21.182
Now, as a quick recap to Erdoğan, he has been the dominant

00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:24.652
figure in Turkish politics for over two decades now.

00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:33.217
He first rose to power in 2003 as prime minister and later became president in 2014.

00:15:34.471 --> 00:15:40.348
Under his leadership, Turkey’s economy initially thrived, and he was credited

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:45.808
with bringing stability and growth to the country after the 2001 financial crisis.

00:15:47.168 --> 00:15:53.588
Part of this was by keeping interest rates at record lows, at least by Turkish standards.

00:15:54.448 --> 00:16:02.022
So, he believed that low interest rates were a key part of Turkey’s economic plan; he didn’t

00:16:02.022 --> 00:16:07.692
want to raise them in the face of high inflation, and–contrary to the view of most mainstream

00:16:07.692 --> 00:16:15.592
economists–he actually stated that high interest rates cause inflation, not that they reduce it.

00:16:17.262 --> 00:16:23.202
So, while inflation in Turkey hit double digits, and then 85% in

00:16:23.202 --> 00:16:27.622
late 2022, with some suggesting that the true figure was even higher,

00:16:28.531 --> 00:16:33.892
Erdoğan stuck to his guns and refused to increase the interest rate.

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:39.662
Or rather, it shouldn’t have been his decision, it should have been the decision of

00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:44.852
the Turkish Central Bank, but whenever the bank looked like it wanted to increase

00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:50.932
interest rates, Erdoğan fired the governor, making it clear who was really in charge.

00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:59.395
And of course, without a truly independent central bank, this shook investor confidence even more

00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:07.235
And while this probably all sounds theoretical, central bank governors, interest rates, inflation

00:17:07.245 --> 00:17:14.515
and investor confidence, it was felt acutely by tens of millions of people living in Turkey, who

00:17:14.515 --> 00:17:21.015
saw the price of everyday goods double, triple, quadruple, while their salaries barely moved.

00:17:22.365 --> 00:17:27.275
Suddenly those in the Turkish middle class, people with what had previously

00:17:27.275 --> 00:17:32.875
been good, well-paid jobs, found themselves struggling to make ends meet.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.822
Incidentally, this show is particularly popular in Turkey,

00:17:38.212 --> 00:17:41.722
I think it’s about the 6th or 7th most popular country.

00:17:42.602 --> 00:17:48.162
And a couple of years ago I started to receive pretty regular messages from listeners and

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:53.479
members in Turkey, talking about the difficulties they faced in their day-to-day lives.

00:17:54.703 --> 00:18:00.733
This was all happening against the backdrop of increasing global inflation, after

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:07.163
COVID-19, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the cost of everything worldwide going up.

00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:11.899
But Turkey was in a particularly difficult situation.

00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:18.419
There were already high levels of inflation and Turkish people were then hit with even higher

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:24.309
prices, especially for anything imported, because it was denominated in dollars or Euros.

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:30.419
And even for non-imported goods, prices increased significantly.

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:37.129
The uncertainty of a volatile currency meant that businesses would charge more for the same

00:18:37.129 --> 00:18:43.799
goods to compensate for a devaluation in the Lira or some unforeseen tax or government charge.

00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:49.819
Businesses and investors like things to be calm, they like to know what the price

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:54.519
for something is and be sure that it isn’t going to be vastly different in 1 month’s

00:18:54.519 --> 00:19:01.049
time, and any kind of uncertainty or volatility only makes things more expensive.

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:06.305
Fortunately, there has been some stabilisation.

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:13.859
After years of holding fast and refusing to increase interest rates, Erdoğan did do a slight

00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:20.349
u-turn, and increased them in 2023, after being re-elected in the Turkish Presidential election.

00:19:21.639 --> 00:19:27.859
The interest rate went from 8% to 15%, a sizable jump but

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:31.429
not nearly high enough to solve Turkey’s problems for good.

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:39.879
Since then it has been pushed up to 50%, a huge number but one the investors believe is

00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:45.719
necessary to stabilise the situation and start to restore faith in the Turkish economy.

00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:51.469
So, the question is, can Turkey turn things around?

00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:54.369
There are some signs of hope.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:20:00.229
Interest rates are now very high, inflation has come down significantly,

00:20:00.689 --> 00:20:04.609
meaning that prices are not increasing as fast as they were before.

00:20:05.629 --> 00:20:10.049
But there is still the problem that prices for everyday goods are

00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:14.898
at historic highs, and salaries have not kept up with inflation.

00:20:16.438 --> 00:20:20.288
And so, we come back to that €40 kebab at the airport.

00:20:20.968 --> 00:20:22.418
Why was it so expensive?

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:27.028
Well, it’s not just about inflation or airport markups.

00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:30.518
It’s also about the very airport where the kebab was sold.

00:20:31.288 --> 00:20:34.908
This sparkling, modern terminal—one of the largest in the

00:20:34.908 --> 00:20:39.228
world—was built with billions of dollars in foreign loans.

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:43.198
Loans that now, thanks to the collapse of the Turkish lira,

00:20:43.538 --> 00:20:48.118
are far more expensive to pay back, but paid back they must be.

00:20:49.318 --> 00:20:55.148
The cost of the loan, and the complete crash of the Turkish currency, is trickling down

00:20:55.438 --> 00:21:00.948
into things like the price a kebab shop at the airport needs to charge to cover its costs.

00:21:01.998 --> 00:21:07.226
Now, there is so much going for Turkey, its strategic location between Europe

00:21:07.226 --> 00:21:12.629
and Asia, its large, skilled population, and its relatively low cost of labour.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:17.359
Economists agree that Turkey still has many structural problems,

00:21:17.729 --> 00:21:21.549
from its high trade deficit to its reliance on foreign investment.

00:21:22.264 --> 00:21:27.602
But there are plenty of economists who are suggesting that the stars are finally

00:21:27.602 --> 00:21:33.092
starting to align for Turkey to bounce back, with inflation almost under control,

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:38.302
foreign investment coming back in and a solid base upon which to rebuild,

00:21:38.692 --> 00:21:43.722
the next 10 years offer real opportunities for Turkey and the Turkish people.

00:21:44.782 --> 00:21:47.042
I certainly hope that is the case.

00:21:47.412 --> 00:21:53.302
But for now, the only suggestion I have is that if you are flying out of Istanbul

00:21:53.302 --> 00:21:58.092
International Airport, and you don’t want to feel like you have been the victim

00:21:58.262 --> 00:22:03.222
of daylight robbery, then I would recommend that you bring a packed lunch.

00:22:05.153 --> 00:22:10.040
OK then, that is it for today's episode on what went wrong with the Turkish economy.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.560
To state the obvious, it is a hugely complex subject that even professional economists are

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.690
still arguing about, so there is a lot more to it than we have had time to talk about today.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.490
But at least, to those who didn’t know much about the Turkish economy beforehand, I hope

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:31.360
that it has piqued your interest and you can do some more research into it, and to the

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.390
amazing Turkish listeners among you, I hope that you feel that we’ve done the subject

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.300
justice, and we have shone some light into what’s going on in your wonderful country.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.280
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.110
this episode, especially from anyone from Turkey.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.080
What else should we have mentioned?

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.090
How has day-to-day life changed for you in Turkey?

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.070
And what hope do you have for the future?

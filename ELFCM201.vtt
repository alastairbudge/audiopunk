Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:16.708
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.968
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:28.928
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part series on Art Theft.

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:36.828
In part one we heard about five of the most famous art thefts of all time, from the theft of the

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:44.278
Mona Lisa by an Italian handyman to the time when two university dropouts successfully managed to

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:50.418
relieve Mexico’s National Museum of Anthropology and History of a billion dollars worth of art.

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:56.938
Then, in part two we learned about a Frenchman called Stéphane Breitwieser, who

00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:03.008
by many people’s standards was, and still is, the greatest art thief of all time.

00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:08.208
So in today’s episode we have saved the best for last, the

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:12.438
robbery of The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:18.768
It is a story that has puzzled detectives for over 30 years now, and will

00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:26.338
involve the Irish and Italian mob, the FBI, a hippy, a 19th century socialite

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:32.748
art collector, the IRA, fake police officers, dodgy art dealers, and more.

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:36.978
It is quite the story, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:43.028
For tourists to Boston, Massachusetts, The Isabella Stewart

00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:47.088
Gardner Museum is one of the most popular attractions.

00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:55.508
It was built in 1899, the brainchild of a wealthy American lady called Isabella Stewart Gardner.

00:01:56.648 --> 00:02:02.838
From the outside, it might look like nothing special, a large brick building.

00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:09.788
But upon entering it, visitors are amazed by the interior - it looks like

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:14.988
a Venetian palace, complete with a large courtyard and monumental arches.

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:22.358
It is filled with the private collection of this wealthy lady, Isabella Stewart Gardner,

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:29.498
who wanted what was her house to be turned into a museum open to the public after her death.

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:36.488
It contains beautiful works of art: Rembrandt, Bellinis, Titians, and more.

00:02:37.278 --> 00:02:40.618
As you stroll through the rooms, admiring the beautiful

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:44.858
works of art, you will notice something even more surprising.

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:52.988
There are 13 frames that are completely empty, the paintings inside them gone.

00:02:54.168 --> 00:03:00.004
They have been left there as a reminder of the events of March 18th

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:06.648
1990, and what was until recently the largest art robbery of all time.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:13.297
March the 17th, as you may know, is St Patrick’s Day, an important

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:18.812
day of celebration in Ireland, and for people with Irish ancestry.

00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:24.662
Boston is one of the cities in the United States with the largest Irish

00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:29.902
population, and therefore on the evening of the 17th of March there

00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:34.992
were plenty of revellers, plenty of partygoers, out on the streets.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:41.315
At 1.20am on March 18th, one of the security guards on duty

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:46.185
at the museum, a man called Rich Abath, heard the buzzer.

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:48.055
He went to answer it.

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.785
It’s the police, the voices said.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:56.935
We’ve had reports of a disturbance at the museum, and we have come to investigate.

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:00.135
OK then, thought the security guard.

00:04:00.475 --> 00:04:04.825
It’s St Patrick’s Day after all, so perhaps someone

00:04:04.935 --> 00:04:08.725
has had too much to drink and climbed over the walls.

00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:13.775
Anything could have happened, so Abath buzzed open the door.

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:19.305
Sure enough, two men in police uniform came through the door.

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:24.565
At this time Abath was sitting behind the security desk,

00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:28.365
the only place where there was a panic alarm button.

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:33.745
The two men asked Abath if anyone else was in the museum.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:38.495
Abath responded that his colleague was upstairs, and the men

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:43.735
asked Abath to use his radio to call his colleague down to them.

00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:49.305
At this point one of the policemen said that Abath looked

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:53.535
familiar, and that there was a warrant out for his arrest.

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:59.285
He asked Abath to come out from behind the desk and to show him his ID.

00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:05.155
Abath had noticed that one of the policemen had a moustache, but

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:11.346
it was hanging at a strange angle, almost as if it were fake.

00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:18.352
In any case, Abath came out from behind the desk, approached the men, one of whom

00:05:18.562 --> 00:05:24.102
pushed him against the wall and put handcuffs on him, as if he was being arrested.

00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:30.032
Shortly after, the other guard, a man called Hestand, entered the

00:05:30.032 --> 00:05:34.322
room, and was immediately pushed against the wall and handcuffed.

00:05:34.922 --> 00:05:41.882
Then, one of the police officers announced calmly, “Gentlemen, this is a robbery.”

00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:49.992
They covered the two guards in duct-tape, that very strong sellotape, so that they couldn’t speak

00:05:50.172 --> 00:05:57.019
or see what was happening, and secured them to a downstairs radiator, so they couldn't move.

00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:04.135
Over the course of the next 81 minutes the thieves stole thirteen different

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:10.015
pieces of art, which experts estimate would be worth up to $600 million.

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:16.745
Until the robbery of royal jewels at the Dresden Green Vault in 2019,

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:22.655
it was the largest museum theft in terms of value of the stolen items.

00:06:23.355 --> 00:06:31.525
So, who did it, why, how did they get away with it, and what happened to these stolen works of art?

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:35.635
Well, this is where it gets really interesting.

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:42.945
The short answer is, apart from people who were directly involved, nobody knows for sure.

00:06:43.885 --> 00:06:48.875
The plot thickens, it becomes even more mysterious, when you realise that

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:54.055
a large proportion of the people who have been accused of being involved

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:58.515
with the theft, and knowing where the paintings were taken, are now dead.

00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:03.965
So, let’s go through some of the evidence, and you can decide

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.045
for yourself who you think might have been responsible for it.

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:15.675
One of the first things that the police look at after any art theft is what was actually stolen.

00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:24.085
And with this particular theft, what was stolen, and how it was stolen was confusing.

00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:27.595
The thieves were evidently well prepared.

00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:32.375
They knew what they were doing, this wasn’t an opportunist crime.

00:07:32.845 --> 00:07:38.115
They immediately went to a room in the museum called The Dutch Room, where

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:42.995
some of the museum’s most valuable, and most famous paintings were kept.

00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:48.295
The most valuable painting they took was a Vermeer called The

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:54.405
Concert, which experts value at around $250 million dollars.

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:59.775
It’s one of only 34 Vermeer paintings, and is thought to

00:07:59.775 --> 00:08:03.845
be the most expensive stolen piece of art in the world.

00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:10.135
They also took a Rembrandt painting called The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, which was

00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:17.335
his only seascape, his only painting of a sea scene, and worth around $100 million.

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:25.415
Alongside these two incredibly valuable paintings, they took some other significantly less

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:32.915
valuable works, including a Chinese bronze vase estimated to be worth only a few thousand dollars.

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:38.315
They also left behind some of the museum’s most valuable items,

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:42.245
including works by Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Boticelli.

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:49.285
It was strange because, on the one hand, they knew exactly where the Dutch Room was

00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:55.355
and went straight to it, but they left behind some of the museum’s most valuable works.

00:08:56.525 --> 00:09:01.725
The robbery lasted 81 minutes, so they certainly weren’t in a rush.

00:09:02.165 --> 00:09:05.495
Did they just not know the value of the other works,

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:09.335
or was there some other reason for leaving them behind?

00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:14.055
What’s more, when taking the paintings, they cut them

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:17.535
out of their frames, damaging and devaluing them.

00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:24.455
A more sophisticated thief would have known how to remove the painting causing

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:31.015
minimal damage, and whether your intention is to sell them yourself, or deliver them

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:36.795
to a private collector, you want them to remain in as good a condition as possible.

00:09:37.515 --> 00:09:40.355
So, this was slightly confusing.

00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:45.405
The next confusing, and perhaps suspicious, element of

00:09:45.405 --> 00:09:48.625
the case was the behaviour of the guards on the night.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:55.925
Both of the security guards on watch that night were young, inexperienced, students.

00:09:56.395 --> 00:10:03.425
The museum was short of money, and it would try to cut corners, to save costs, wherever it could.

00:10:04.195 --> 00:10:08.895
This included employing security guards who were inexperienced

00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:12.865
and, to put it bluntly, not very good at their jobs.

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:19.065
Suspicion immediately fell on one of the guards, Rich Abath, the one who

00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:23.575
had initially buzzed the thieves in after they had said they were policemen.

00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:28.005
For starters, he shouldn’t have let them into the museum.

00:10:28.275 --> 00:10:33.065
Neither he nor his colleague had called the police, so the first reaction

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:37.205
when they arrived should have been to call the police station to check

00:10:37.415 --> 00:10:41.575
that the officers were legitimate, that they were real police officers.

00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:48.315
Secondly, his behaviour on the night shortly before the robbery was suspicious.

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:52.405
After walking around the gallery he went to a side

00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:56.645
door, a door to the street, and opened and closed it.

00:10:57.795 --> 00:10:58.335
Why?

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:02.225
Was he signalling to the thieves who were waiting nearby?

00:11:03.015 --> 00:11:08.455
When Abath was questioned about this he said that this was something he did every

00:11:08.455 --> 00:11:14.845
night to make sure the alarm was working, but firstly this was against protocol, he

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:20.255
shouldn’t have done it, and secondly there are no records of him having done this before.

00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:28.235
And thirdly, there was one work of art, a Manet, that went missing from a room called The Blue Room.

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:35.515
The motion sensors in the room don’t have any record of the two thieves entering that

00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:41.315
room; the only person who entered that room on the night of the robbery was...Abath.

00:11:42.255 --> 00:11:48.065
Most museum or gallery robberies have a person on the inside, an employee

00:11:48.205 --> 00:11:52.925
who helps with the theft, and the police thought this must have been Abath.

00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:56.065
But he was never actually arrested.

00:11:56.705 --> 00:12:01.535
To this day he maintains his innocence, he lives a quiet life with his

00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:06.305
wife and kids, and just says he was targeted because he was a hippy.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:11.375
So, who actually were the thieves, and why did they do it?

00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:18.695
Fingers were immediately pointed at Boston’s organised crime families, both Italian and Irish.

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:24.345
They would have had the resources to pull a crime like this off, and

00:12:24.355 --> 00:12:29.265
the underground network to move the stolen works of art afterwards.

00:12:30.175 --> 00:12:33.925
They had plenty of reasons to commit this sort of crime.

00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:39.255
They could have simply wanted to sell it, for a quick infusion

00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:43.345
of money to buy drugs, weapons, or something like that.

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:49.115
They might have wanted to use the works of art as a sort of get-out-of-jail-free

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:54.505
card, so that when a boss was charged with other crimes he could use

00:12:54.515 --> 00:12:59.705
these stolen works of art as a bargaining chip in exchange for immunity.

00:13:00.585 --> 00:13:07.695
However the fact that nobody has ever used this get-out-of-jail-free card, despite plenty

00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:14.135
of suspects in the crime being put in jail, it suggests that this wasn’t the motive.

00:13:15.355 --> 00:13:21.815
It might even have been a “to order” job by an art-loving senior member of an organised

00:13:21.845 --> 00:13:28.865
crime family, but the clumsy nature of the theft, and the fact that the paintings would

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:34.425
have been damaged when they were stolen, suggests this probably wasn’t the motive either.

00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:41.445
So, the FBI believes the motive was financial in some shape or form.

00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:46.375
But to this date, none of the paintings have been recovered.

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:53.875
Immediately after the theft there was a large reward for any information that led to their recovery.

00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:59.015
It started as a million dollars, then was increased to 5

00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:04.785
million in 1997, and it currently stands at 10 million dollars.

00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:07.465
A pretty tempting reward.

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:13.075
Plus, the Statute of Limitations law means that the crime

00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:17.095
happened too long ago for the thieves to be prosecuted.

00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:24.485
So someone could come forward today, tell the FBI what happened and where the

00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:29.825
paintings are, and assuming that they were able to be recovered, they would collect

00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:35.135
$10 million dollars as a reward, and they might not have to spend a day in jail.

00:14:36.265 --> 00:14:38.125
But nobody has.

00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:45.395
Over the years there have been hundreds of leads, clues as to the whereabouts

00:14:45.415 --> 00:14:49.965
of the paintings and the identity of the people behind the robbery.

00:14:50.045 --> 00:14:57.245
In 1994, four years after the robbery, the director of the museum received an

00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:02.935
anonymous message from someone wanting to negotiate the return of the artwork.

00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:08.415
In this letter they provided information that only the museum and the

00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:14.485
FBI knew about: that the uniforms the thieves had worn as disguises had

00:15:14.485 --> 00:15:19.855
not actually been those of police officers but rather of security guards.

00:15:20.675 --> 00:15:23.705
It seemed credible, it seemed believable.

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:27.055
The author of the letter said that they were not

00:15:27.055 --> 00:15:30.575
the thief, and they didn’t know who actually did it.

00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:38.825
All they wanted was a resolution to the problem, and to be paid $2.6 million dollars as a reward.

00:15:39.665 --> 00:15:43.555
As a condition of cooperation, they wanted investigators to

00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:47.398
stop looking into it while negotiations were taking place.

00:15:48.068 --> 00:15:54.728
If the museum accepted these terms, it needed to send a coded message

00:15:54.918 --> 00:15:59.328
to the author of the letter via the Boston Globe, a newspaper.

00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:06.598
The author gave specific instructions about how to do this: the number “1” needed

00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:13.118
to be inserted into the box with currency exchanges, the box specifying how many

00:16:13.428 --> 00:16:18.848
British pounds, Japanese yen, and Italian lira you would get for a US dollar.

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:25.698
The museum decided to cooperate, and federal agents stood down while this

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:29.908
was all taking place, they said they would pause their investigations.

00:16:30.718 --> 00:16:36.838
The editor of The Boston Globe agreed to help, and sure enough, it published this

00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:42.908
number “1” in the currency box, indicating that the museum was willing to negotiate.

00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:47.388
The author of the letter saw the secret message in

00:16:47.388 --> 00:16:50.368
the newspaper, and sent another letter to the gallery.

00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:57.558
They were encouraged that the museum wanted to cooperate, but said that investigators

00:16:57.638 --> 00:17:03.568
hadn’t actually stepped down, they were in fact looking into the case more intently.

00:17:04.278 --> 00:17:09.068
The author would need more time to think, and would contact the museum again.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:13.228
But that was the last the museum ever heard from them.

00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:18.578
In another hot lead, a journalist from the Boston Herald was

00:17:18.578 --> 00:17:23.388
called up in the middle of the night by a man called William P.

00:17:23.398 --> 00:17:28.188
Youngworth, an antiques dealer with links to organised criminals.

00:17:29.008 --> 00:17:34.828
Youngworth told the journalist that he knew where the paintings were, and could prove it to him.

00:17:35.818 --> 00:17:38.598
In the middle of the night they went to a storage

00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:43.268
unit, and he pulled out a canvas from inside a tube.

00:17:44.278 --> 00:17:49.958
It was dark, and the journalist didn’t get a proper look at it, but it seemed

00:17:50.018 --> 00:17:55.418
to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, the Rembrandt valued at $100 million.

00:17:56.798 --> 00:18:01.128
The edges of the painting were frayed, as if it had

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:04.438
been cut from a frame, and the paint was cracking.

00:18:05.188 --> 00:18:08.998
It certainly seemed like it could be one of the stolen paintings.

00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:14.348
Youngworth also provided chips of paint to analyse,

00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:18.788
chips that he said would prove this was the Rembrant.

00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:22.182
The chips were taken to the lab.

00:18:22.372 --> 00:18:26.072
They were indeed from the 17th century when the painting was

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:30.422
done, but they weren't from The Storm on the Sea of Galilee.

00:18:30.951 --> 00:18:32.061
It wasn't a match.

00:18:32.291 --> 00:18:37.671
But, they could have been from The Concert, the Vermeer painting valued

00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:43.671
at $250 million, the colours were consistent with part of that painting.

00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:49.501
Youngworth said he would only cooperate with the authorities if he was offered

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:55.611
full immunity for himself, and the release from jail of another art thief.

00:18:56.701 --> 00:19:01.281
The FBI wouldn’t accept this, and negotiations stalled.

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:05.841
They managed to find the location of the storage unit a few

00:19:05.841 --> 00:19:10.201
months after, but after it was raided nothing was found.

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:14.861
Youngworth has now completely stopped cooperating with the police.

00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:19.131
In 2013 though, there seemed to be a breakthrough.

00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:25.651
The FBI announced that they believed they knew the identities of the people who had

00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:31.301
robbed the museum, but they had both died shortly after the theft, and they were

00:19:31.311 --> 00:19:36.871
relatively low level thieves, they would have been acting on the orders of someone else.

00:19:37.238 --> 00:19:42.378
And, most importantly, that the paintings were still nowhere to be found.

00:19:43.288 --> 00:19:49.428
Another factor that has complicated the inquiry was corruption within the Boston police.

00:19:50.248 --> 00:19:55.278
It was revealed in the late 1990s that one of Boston’s most infamous

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:59.648
crime bosses, a man called Whitey Bulger, had been providing

00:19:59.668 --> 00:20:05.768
information to the FBI about his rival crime bosses since the mid 1970s.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:10.978
He was both an FBI informant and a major crime boss.

00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:18.258
He had also managed to corrupt several FBI officers, meaning that he was being provided with

00:20:18.278 --> 00:20:24.418
information about ongoing investigations, including the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Robbery.

00:20:25.328 --> 00:20:29.658
If he was involved in the robbery, and he is believed to have been

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:34.718
involved by multiple investigators, he would always have been one step

00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:38.758
ahead of the authorities, he would have known what the police were doing.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:45.698
One theory has it that he either organised the entire robbery or bought the paintings

00:20:45.698 --> 00:20:51.338
from the thieves for a reduced price, and then arranged for the paintings to be sent

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:58.168
to western Ireland, perhaps even to be guarded by the IRA, the Irish Republican Army.

00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:03.748
He might have intended for them to be used as a bargaining chip, as something to

00:21:03.748 --> 00:21:10.548
use in negotiations with the police, or even it might have been a present to the IRA

00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:16.668
after a weapons shipment he had sent them was intercepted by the Irish army in 1994.

00:21:17.223 --> 00:21:21.713
If Bulger was involved, he took his secret to the grave with him.

00:21:22.303 --> 00:21:30.663
He had been in prison since 2011, and then in 2019, hours after being transferred to another

00:21:30.673 --> 00:21:38.393
prison, and aged 89 he was violently murdered by inmates linked to an Italian crime family.

00:21:39.523 --> 00:21:45.393
Indeed, almost all of the people who have been implicated in the crime have

00:21:45.393 --> 00:21:50.613
now died, most of them of unnatural causes, they have all been murdered.

00:21:51.473 --> 00:21:53.663
One, however, remains.

00:21:53.953 --> 00:21:58.503
A man called Robert Gentile, another Boston crime boss, was accused

00:21:58.523 --> 00:22:03.003
of having been given the paintings for safekeeping, to look after.

00:22:03.913 --> 00:22:08.743
He was questioned by police, but has always denied their existence.

00:22:09.403 --> 00:22:13.103
The police didn’t believe him, and raided his house.

00:22:13.563 --> 00:22:18.643
They dug up his garden, looked everywhere, but the only sign they found was

00:22:18.643 --> 00:22:23.443
a list of the paintings, complete with their estimated value next to them.

00:22:24.573 --> 00:22:29.483
Obviously, this did nothing to help persuade investigators of his innocence.

00:22:30.343 --> 00:22:34.903
Gentile is now 84 years old, and his health is failing.

00:22:35.633 --> 00:22:41.383
He still denies any involvement, and investigators are fearful that he will take

00:22:41.383 --> 00:22:46.223
the secret of The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Robbery to the grave with him.

00:22:47.143 --> 00:22:52.943
That being said, the investigations are still open, the reward is still $10 million,

00:22:53.853 --> 00:22:59.893
and investigators are hopeful that this will be enough to attract someone, somewhere,

00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:05.723
to come forward and spill the beans, to reveal the location of the stolen artwork.

00:23:06.573 --> 00:23:11.583
If and when they do, the good news is that the frames at the museum

00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:15.353
are still there, in exactly the same position as the night of the

00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:20.263
robbery, almost as if they were waiting for the paintings to return.

00:23:22.785 --> 00:23:27.453
Ok then, there we have it, the mystery of The Isabella Stewart

00:23:27.453 --> 00:23:32.033
Gardner Museum Robbery, one of the greatest art thefts of all time.

00:23:32.443 --> 00:23:36.703
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and perhaps

00:23:36.803 --> 00:23:40.893
you’ve listened to this and decided you might know who is behind this robbery.

00:23:41.563 --> 00:23:47.023
Who knows, by the time you listen to this episode, perhaps the case might even be solved.

00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:51.173
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:51.523 --> 00:23:53.323
Who do you think was behind it?

00:23:53.383 --> 00:23:55.983
Do you think the pieces will ever be returned?

00:23:56.273 --> 00:24:00.033
And what did you think of this mini-series on Art Theft?

00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:04.063
I would love to know, so let’s get the discussion started.

00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:09.243

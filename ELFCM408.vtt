Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:15.905
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.895
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:25.585
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of this three-part mini-series

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.225
about British Social Class, and more specifically, high society.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:35.495
As a reminder, in case you missed them, in part one we talked about the British

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:40.825
nobility, how you become a Lord or Lady, and what that actually means in practice.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:46.965
In part two, we looked at the most exclusive school in Britain, Eton College.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.985
We learned about its history, the countless famous people who have been

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:55.475
there, and how it is evolving to the kind of elite that it caters to.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.955
And in today’s episode, part three, we are going to be talking about

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:04.835
a different part of society altogether, but one without which the

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:09.035
British aristocracy could not have survived: the servant class.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:15.865
We’ll look at the size of the servant class, what life was like as a servant, the hierarchy

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:21.395
of different types of servants, and what caused the decline of household service in Britain.

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:27.632
OK then, Upstairs, Downstairs: The Lives of British Servants

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:33.352
If I was to ask you, what do you think the most popular job

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:37.342
in Britain was just over 100 years ago, what would you say?

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:45.892
Perhaps you might think “factory worker” or “coal miner”, maybe you'd say “soldier” or “farmer”.

00:01:47.182 --> 00:01:52.372
It might surprise you to find out that the most popular job in terms of the number

00:01:52.372 --> 00:01:59.632
of people involved in this profession was none of these; in the year 1901 it

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:05.942
was household service, it was working in the house of someone else as a servant.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:12.662
Now, wealthy people paying less wealthy people to do things for them has been

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:17.782
going on for as long as time, and it is far from being unique to Britain.

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:24.382
But the scale at which this kind of “household service” existed in Britain

00:02:24.702 --> 00:02:29.522
in the late 19th century and early 20th century is quite staggering.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:37.102
In 1901, the population of the UK was just under 37,000,000.

00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:47.862
Of this, a whopping 1.5 million so 4% of the total population, worked as domestic servants.

00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:53.112
And if we dig deeper still, and look at young women

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:57.292
in particular, the numbers are even more astonishing.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:06.702
In 1891, more than one million women aged between 15 and 20 were domestic servants.

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:11.692
That means that one out of every three young women at

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.922
the time was living and working as a domestic servant.

00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:21.832
It is astounding to think about, and in this episode we are going to break down

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:27.912
exactly who these people were, what they did, and what life was like as a servant.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:33.872
So, first, why were there so many people working as domestic servants?

00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:38.402
Well, there were a few factors, both on the supply

00:03:38.432 --> 00:03:41.422
and the demand side, as an economist might put it.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:46.902
On the supply side, there had been wide scale migration from the

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:51.092
countryside to the towns and cities during the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:56.802
There was an abundance of labour, people who could work as servants.

00:03:57.762 --> 00:04:02.472
And a lack of other employment opportunities meant that working

00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:06.232
as a domestic servant was more attractive than you might think.

00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:13.962
This was particularly true for women, for whom other employment opportunities were very limited.

00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:20.992
As a woman, you could work in a factory or in some kind of cottage industry if you were lucky,

00:04:21.542 --> 00:04:27.812
and if you came from a wealthier family perhaps you could secure yourself a job as a governess

00:04:27.812 --> 00:04:35.342
or a teacher, but there were really very few respectable careers a young woman could follow.

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:43.632
Going into household service was seen as a good “stopgap” choice for a young woman with few other

00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:49.634
prospects, it was something you could do before you got married and started a family of your own.

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:57.492
Another reason was that housing was expensive, fewer than 10% of people in the UK

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:03.852
owned their own home, so the prospect of being a live-in servant and being provided

00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:08.692
with free accommodation along with your job, well you can understand the appeal.

00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:16.062
And in terms of reasons on the demand side, just as the industrial revolution and

00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:21.162
economic development had brought people from the fields into the cities, it had created

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:27.222
a new professional class, people with a disposable income, people with money to spend.

00:05:28.402 --> 00:05:34.092
These people didn’t want to deal with the boredom and drudgery of doing things like

00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:38.922
cooking, cleaning and making the bed, so they would hire people to do it for them.

00:05:40.022 --> 00:05:45.812
This is an important point to emphasise, and goes against what many people think.

00:05:46.282 --> 00:05:50.682
See, when you imagine “household servants”, you might think of a

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:56.242
house like the one in the TV series Downton Abbey, a huge stately home

00:05:56.412 --> 00:06:00.272
with a fleet of servants polishing the silver and mopping the floors.

00:06:01.092 --> 00:06:06.702
Of course, some servants did find themselves in this kind of a situation, but many

00:06:06.702 --> 00:06:12.972
more found themselves waiting not on Lords and Ladies in vast country manors, but

00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:18.842
on comparatively modest middle or upper middle class British households, households

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:25.332
supported by a doctor or teacher’s income, not the income from a huge countryside estate.

00:06:26.632 --> 00:06:29.722
You can see this from the percentage of households in

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:33.412
the country that employed some form of domestic servant.

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:40.432
It is staggering, and goes from less than 10% at the start of the 19th century

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:48.272
right up to an estimated 25-30% of all households by the start of the 20th century.

00:06:49.522 --> 00:06:55.402
In some areas of the country, it was even higher, with 40-50% of

00:06:55.402 --> 00:07:00.832
wealthier areas of the country employing at least one household servant.

00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:05.462
It really was a lot more common than many people realise.

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:10.362
Now, let’s move on to talk about the lives of these servants.

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:15.642
Of course, given the sheer number of people employed in domestic service

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:19.912
and the large variety of households in which they worked, there was

00:07:19.912 --> 00:07:24.292
a smorgasbord of different experiences, and it is easy to generalise.

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:29.872
The one generalisation that we can confidently make is

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:33.892
that life was worse for female servants than for male.

00:07:34.992 --> 00:07:41.452
The pay was lower, job security was lower, there was the constant threat of your male employer

00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:47.882
making unwelcome advances towards you, you falling pregnant and being cast out on the street.

00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:56.447
And the actual day-to-day of the job was, in most cases, much harder for women than for men.

00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:01.862
Especially in smaller households where there was only one servant,

00:08:02.432 --> 00:08:08.282
this woman, or in fact girl in most cases, she would be expected to do

00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:14.152
absolutely everything from dawn to dusk and be paid a pittance in return.

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:20.312
Cleaning, cooking, washing the dishes, washing clothes, mending clothes,

00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:25.082
shopping, making the beds, polishing the glasses, making fires, setting the

00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:30.632
table, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, it was a never-ending cycle of

00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:35.032
domestic tasks that would need to be repeated as soon as they were completed.

00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:43.072
This kind of domestic servant would typically have worked 7 days a week, starting work at

00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:48.952
something like 5 o’ clock in the morning and not finishing until 10 or 11 in the evening.

00:08:50.222 --> 00:08:54.512
And the pay varied, but was extremely low.

00:08:55.942 --> 00:09:03.192
The official British government census put it at £16 a year in 1901 for

00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:09.732
a general housemaid, which is around €1,900 a year in today’s money.

00:09:11.392 --> 00:09:17.572
As a point of comparison, a typical salary for a “professional” man at the time

00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:24.582
could have been anywhere from £200 to £1,000, so you can see how comparatively

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:30.152
affordable it was to hire someone as a full-time servant for £16 a year.

00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:38.372
Now, where the lives of servants gets a little more interesting, and a little

00:09:38.372 --> 00:09:43.802
more uniquely British, is in the great stately homes of British aristocrats.

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:48.422
Think Downton Abbey or Brideshead Revisited, with all kinds

00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:52.142
of servants to attend to their master’s every whim and wish.

00:09:53.732 --> 00:09:59.952
There was, of course, the same hard work, monotonous back-breaking labour as in smaller

00:09:59.952 --> 00:10:06.592
houses, but there was an additional element to it: the hierarchy of the servant class.

00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:12.672
Much like the master of the house was above the servant, there

00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:16.952
was a very clear pecking order between domestic servants.

00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:24.852
At the top was the butler, who was always male, and the housekeeper, who who was always female.

00:10:26.322 --> 00:10:32.592
The butler’s job was to organise the male servants, footmen, drivers, and so on.

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:38.272
He was also responsible for the general quality of service, making sure that the

00:10:38.312 --> 00:10:43.352
silver was polished, the cutlery was set in the right way, the correct wines had

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:49.112
been ordered, and he would also be constantly available if his master had a request.

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:55.912
The housekeeper, on the other hand, was in charge of all of the female staff, the maids and cooking

00:10:55.912 --> 00:11:01.602
staff, making sure the beds were made, the corridors were swept, fires were made, and so on.

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:08.312
Becoming a butler or housekeeper was not easy, and would

00:11:08.312 --> 00:11:12.042
require decades of hard work to move up the ladder.

00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:19.002
Even if you got there, you still had to work long hours for only slightly better pay.

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:25.932
And if you became a butler or a housekeeper, it was your duty to make sure that

00:11:25.992 --> 00:11:32.022
everyone below you knew their place, they knew where they sat in the pecking order.

00:11:33.822 --> 00:11:38.662
There were several ways in which this hierarchy was constantly reinforced.

00:11:39.682 --> 00:11:44.172
For starters, at mealtimes, the servants would always eat together.

00:11:44.832 --> 00:11:50.162
The butler would be seated at one end of the table and the housekeeper at the other.

00:11:51.392 --> 00:11:56.042
Servants would sit in order of seniority, with the most senior male servant sat

00:11:56.042 --> 00:12:01.752
next to the butler, so everyone knew where he or she stood in the pecking order.

00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:07.862
Nobody would be able to start eating until the butler had sat down,

00:12:08.442 --> 00:12:12.802
and there are even stories of some households where all the servants

00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:16.412
would have to stop eating if the butler put down his knife and fork.

00:12:17.722 --> 00:12:19.602
And this is only one example.

00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:24.272
You might remember from part one that there are different ways

00:12:24.272 --> 00:12:28.032
to refer to a Duke, an Earl, and different types of nobles.

00:12:28.532 --> 00:12:32.962
Well, the same differences existed between the domestic servants

00:12:34.382 --> 00:12:38.682
Both the butler and the housekeeper would be called Mr or

00:12:38.722 --> 00:12:43.112
Mrs Last Name, both by their employer and other servants.

00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:48.182
So, my name is Alastair Budge, if I was a butler I

00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:52.322
would be called Mr Budge by my employer and by a maid.

00:12:53.702 --> 00:12:58.302
A valet, the male servant responsible for getting the master of the house

00:12:58.302 --> 00:13:03.988
changed, would be referred to by his employer simply by his surname, “Budge”.

00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:09.235
Lower servants, on the other hand, would typically be called by

00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:13.282
their first name, “Alastair”, no surname, just the first name.

00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:21.045
But in larger kind of Downton Abbey style houses it would be rare for these lower

00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:26.425
servants to ever have any real interaction with their employers; all communication

00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:30.845
would go through the butler or the housekeeper, so they wouldn’t really be

00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:35.615
“called” anything, and often their employers wouldn’t even know their names.

00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:40.885
There are even some stories of servants who would be forced to

00:13:40.885 --> 00:13:45.015
turn around and face the wall when their employer came into a room.

00:13:46.715 --> 00:13:52.655
Now, we heard at the start that working as a servant was the most common job in Britain at the turn

00:13:52.655 --> 00:14:01.235
of the last century, but this is now no longer the case, there are around 65,000 at the last count.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:03.045
What happened?

00:14:03.705 --> 00:14:05.225
Well, a few things.

00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:11.615
Firstly, much like both supply and demand contributed to the boom in domestic

00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:16.365
service, there were both supply and demand factors that caused it to plummet.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:22.375
On the supply side, better employment opportunities meant

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:26.955
that people, especially young women, finally had alternatives.

00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:34.315
Starting during the First World War, as women took over jobs that men had traditionally

00:14:34.315 --> 00:14:40.495
done in places like factories, it started to become abundantly clear that women were just

00:14:40.495 --> 00:14:46.475
as capable as men, and did not need to be restricted to a life as a domestic servant.

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:53.799
Secondly, millions more homes were built and home ownership became more affordable.

00:14:55.369 --> 00:14:59.039
If you remember, one of the major attractions of going

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:02.609
into service was because you got a roof over your head.

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:09.519
Between the First and the Second World War, home ownership in the UK increased by

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:16.149
400%, so fewer people needed to work as a servant to have a stable place to live.

00:15:17.609 --> 00:15:22.709
And on the demand side, well, in the post-war period, people could

00:15:22.719 --> 00:15:27.219
now buy machines to do many of the jobs that servants used to do.

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:32.139
Washing the dishes, cutting the grass, washing your clothes,

00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:36.119
there were machines that did this simply by pressing a button.

00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:43.889
What’s more, the tax rate increased considerably, reaching 90% in the post-war

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:49.139
period, meaning that household budgets for things like servants were limited.

00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:57.999
So, while in 1901 a doctor or an accountant might have employed one or two household servants

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:04.279
without it really having any impact on their disposable income, a person doing the same job 50

00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:10.559
years later would have considerably less disposable income because they paid a lot more in tax.

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:16.149
What's more, the amount that they would have to pay for a live-in servant

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:20.219
would be considerably higher because of the alternative career options.

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:27.029
And, as a nail in the coffin for domestic service, there were now plenty of machines that could

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:32.609
do the majority of the tasks that a servant would have done anyway at a fraction of the cost.

00:16:34.049 --> 00:16:38.879
The result is the situation that exists today, and that you could argue

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:45.639
existed 300 but not 100 years ago: yes, there still are live-in domestic

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:50.459
servants, but they are restricted to the very wealthiest in society.

00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:56.699
For most people, the existence of a live-in servant is something that

00:16:56.709 --> 00:17:01.849
they will experience only in books and on TV, so I want to finish

00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:06.859
this episode and this mini-series with a few personal recommendations.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:13.309
The most obvious one is one I’ve mentioned already and that you have probably seen: Downton

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:19.604
Abbey, which is a TV series that follows the life of an aristocratic British family and their

00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:25.549
servants, but significantly glorifies the servant life and makes it look not so bad at all.

00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:32.404
There’s also Gosford Park, which is a great murder mystery comedy film from 2001.

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:40.719
But my absolute favourite, which goes a lot deeper into the master-servant relationship and deals

00:17:40.719 --> 00:17:46.729
with the thorny problem of this complicated hierarchy, both between master-servant and within the

00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:53.009
servant ranks, as well as the decline of the domestic servant, is called The Remains of the Day.

00:17:54.129 --> 00:18:01.809
It is a book by Kazuo Ishiguro, and was made into a brilliant film starring Anthony Hopkins, so I’d

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:07.199
definitely recommend that one if you are looking for something a little more meaty and interesting.

00:18:08.009 --> 00:18:13.389
Again, the name, both of the book and the film, is The Remains of the Day.

00:18:14.479 --> 00:18:20.319
So, there we have it, the life of British servants, a hundred-or-so year period

00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:25.489
in British history when literally millions of people, mostly young women,

00:18:25.989 --> 00:18:30.359
spent their formative teenage years living with a family that was not their

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:35.999
own, attending to their every wish, and being paid almost nothing in return.

00:18:37.369 --> 00:18:41.079
When thought about this way, it’s no bad thing that this life

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:44.799
is something that most people will only experience on screen.

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:52.589
OK then, that is it for today's episode on British servants, and with

00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:57.199
that comes the end of this mini-series exploring British social class.

00:18:57.799 --> 00:19:04.559
As a reminder, in part one we talked about the British nobility and how you become a lord or lady.

00:19:05.449 --> 00:19:11.139
And in part two, we talked about Eton College, the most exclusive school in the country.

00:19:12.179 --> 00:19:14.809
As always, I would love to know what you thought about

00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:17.709
this episode, and about this mini-series in general.

00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:21.179
What do you think about the British class system?

00:19:21.689 --> 00:19:24.929
How is it different from the system in your country?

00:19:25.399 --> 00:19:29.869
Was having domestic servants as widespread in your country as it was in Britain?

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.699
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

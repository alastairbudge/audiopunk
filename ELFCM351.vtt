Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.650
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.729
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.450
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.859
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.979
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.000
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.490
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.960
we are going to be talking

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.680
about a man called John Snow.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.889
If you are a fan of the book

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.130
or TV series “Game of Thrones”,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.619
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.169
We’re not talking about that John Snow.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.390
We are, instead, going to talk about the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.557
English doctor and leading epidemiologist,

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:44.249
a man who would forever go down in history

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.769
for being the first person to understand

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.190
how cholera was transmitted, and in so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.540
doing, by some standards he would be

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.730
responsible for saving millions of lives.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.099
It’s a wonderful story, so

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.470
let’s get right into it.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.859
To start off our story, I must transport

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.103
you to London in the year 1854.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.210
And specifically, to an

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.649
area of London called Soho.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.740
You may have visited Soho,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.200
if you’ve been to London.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.920
It’s now full of bars, pubs, and shops,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.046
advertising and marketing companies,

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:23.522
and even English language schools.

00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:27.082
But 150 years ago it was

00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:29.002
a very different place.

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:31.492
Some streets did contain

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:33.702
beautiful townhouses where wealthy

00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:35.692
Londoners lived and worked.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.472
Others did not.

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:40.882
One such street is now called

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:43.322
Broadwick Street, but back then

00:01:43.452 --> 00:01:45.202
it was called “Broad Street”.

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:48.422
It was a slum, it was full of

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.902
very poor, low quality housing.

00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:54.422
If you visited it back then you would

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:58.112
be struck by the smell: rotting food and

00:01:58.112 --> 00:02:01.342
rubbish, human and animal waste and the

00:02:01.342 --> 00:02:04.182
refuse from butchers, slaughterhouses,

00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:06.092
and industry operating in the area.

00:02:07.302 --> 00:02:08.932
If you’ve listened to the episode

00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.142
on The Great Stink, episode number

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:13.662
233, well, you get the picture.

00:02:14.782 --> 00:02:16.772
Buildings were hugely overcrowded

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:18.762
with large numbers of people who had

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.222
relocated from the countryside, drawn

00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:23.622
to the city in the hope of finding work.

00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:27.032
Whole families might share

00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:29.122
one squalid room, living in

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.062
horribly unhygienic conditions.

00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:34.022
Most buildings did not have running

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.112
water or toilet facilities and the

00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:38.042
revolutionary London sewer system

00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:39.832
designed by the engineer Joseph

00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:41.912
Bazalgette had not yet been built.

00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:46.282
As a result, the streets ran with

00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:48.652
human sewage, human excrement.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.172
Cesspits - basically huge holes full

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.212
of poo - lay beneath the cellars of

00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:55.762
buildings throughout the city and

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.682
relied on being emptied by the so-called

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.052
‘night soil’ collectors who dumped

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:03.072
the contents into the city’s rivers,

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:05.532
primarily into the river Thames.

00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:08.762
Wealthy residents sent their waste

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:11.072
via private sewers straight into

00:03:11.072 --> 00:03:12.762
the river - despite the fact the

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:14.592
Thames served as a major source

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:17.127
of water for drinking and washing.

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:20.952
The result of all this was that all

00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:23.552
of the city’s water sources were full,

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:26.732
literally, of animal and human waste.

00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:30.152
And this wasn’t just unpleasant to

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:33.462
see or smell, or nasty to drink.

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:36.732
People were dying of a strange illness

00:03:36.872 --> 00:03:38.962
which was given the name “cholera”.

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:42.472
Now, this wasn’t consigned to this

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:45.202
area of London, or even the country.

00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:47.732
There are references to cholera that date

00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:51.438
back to 1642, and doctors had observed

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:54.118
similar illnesses all over the world,

00:03:54.148 --> 00:03:57.438
from India to China, Germany to Egypt.

00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:02.598
In 1831 two English doctors wrote about

00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:04.398
their experience of the illness in

00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:06.918
Russia, describing it in some detail

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:08.588
in The London Gazette newspaper.

00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:11.278
Now, this is slightly graphic,

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:13.448
but he is a passage from it.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.548
Read out by a special guest.

00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:19.902
Giddiness, sick stomach, nervous

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:23.302
agitation, intermittent, slow, or small

00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:26.542
pulse, cramps beginning at the tops of the

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:29.322
fingers and toes, and rapidly approaching

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:31.352
the trunk, give the first warning.

00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:35.032
Vomiting or purging, or both these

00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:38.392
evacuations of a liquid like rice-water

00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:40.962
or whey, or barley-water, come

00:04:40.962 --> 00:04:43.632
on; the features become sharp and

00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:46.852
contracted, the eye sinks, the look

00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:49.782
is expressive of terror and wildness;

00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:53.372
The lips, face, neck, hands, and feet,

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:56.642
and soon after the thighs, arms, and whole

00:04:56.642 --> 00:05:00.362
surface assume a leaden, blue, purple,

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:03.562
black, or deep brown tint according to the

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:06.342
complexion of the individual, varying in

00:05:06.342 --> 00:05:08.722
shade with the intensity of the attack.

00:05:09.332 --> 00:05:12.152
The fingers and toes are reduced in size,

00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:15.302
the skin and soft parts covering them

00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:17.732
are wrinkled, shrivelled and folded.

00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:20.752
The nails put on a bluish pearly

00:05:20.752 --> 00:05:24.032
white; the larger superficial veins

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.912
are marked by flat lines of a deeper

00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:29.792
black; the pulse becomes either

00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:32.492
small as a thread, and scarcely

00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:35.302
vibrating, or else totally extinct…”

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.199
Grim stuff indeed, and London too had

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.229
experienced a number of cholera epidemics

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.879
that killed thousands of people.

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.679
And in 1854  the area around

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:50.369
Broad Street was the centre of

00:05:50.661 --> 00:05:53.029
a particularly severe outbreak.

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.689
In three days over 100 people died

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:59.159
and in the following week most

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.899
of the residents fled the area.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:05.589
By September, over 500 people had died.

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.399
But the local authorities, the scientists

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:12.979
and the medical practitioners could not

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:16.109
agree on how cholera was being spread

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.649
from person to person and they spent

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:20.999
their time arguing over the relative

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.179
merits of their different theories.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.209
One of the most popular was something

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:29.559
called ‘the miasma theory’ which held

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.269
that cholera was caused by particles of

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:34.889
‘miasma tar’ given off by decomposing

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:37.159
rubbish and other organic matter.

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:41.639
It was believed that miasma rose from

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.629
the ground around the Thames like a

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:46.679
mist and travelled through the air

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:49.319
in London to be inhaled by citizens,

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.849
essentially, that it was breathed in.

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:55.249
This theory, combined with the

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:57.499
popular belief that night air was

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:00.019
‘bad air’ and that ventilation after

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.539
dark should be avoided, this actually

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.339
contributed to the unsanitary conditions

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:07.009
in which most Londoners lived.

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.569
It might seem bizarre to us now,

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.239
but back then the prevailing medical

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:16.719
advice was to stay inside, in cramped

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:19.229
and poorly ventilated housing so as

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:21.509
to avoid breathing this “night air”

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:23.919
or this cholera-contaminated air.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.489
But there was one man who did not

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.619
believe this was the case, one

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.569
man who had a different theory.

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.799
His observation of the way cholera

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:38.009
spread in certain areas convinced

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:40.629
him that it was not airborne at

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:42.659
all, but spread through water.

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.439
His name was John Snow.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.419
And before we get into how he actually

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:51.309
figured this out, I should tell you

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:53.329
a little bit about the man himself,

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:55.179
because his pioneering work and

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:58.549
impact is, in many respects, unlikely.

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.679
First of all, Snow was

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:03.359
not originally a Londoner.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:06.069
Like so many others, he came to the

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.339
city, perhaps not to seek his fortune,

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:10.509
but certainly to find his destiny.

00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:13.079
He was born in the city of

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.499
York in northern England

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.989
on the 15th of March 1813.

00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:20.469
His parents, William and Frances Snow,

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:23.309
were humble working-class people - his

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:25.599
father, William was a manual labourer

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:28.559
and farmer, and his mother, Frances,

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.609
managed the house, looking after

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.849
John and his 8 brothers and sisters.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.959
But although this might not sound

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:38.659
like the classic breeding ground for a

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.109
world-class epidemiologist, Snow’s early

00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:44.789
life was instrumental in shaping his

00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:47.399
understanding of how diseases are spread.

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:50.189
The neighbourhood in which the Snow

00:08:50.189 --> 00:08:52.749
family lived was in one of the poorer

00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:55.669
areas of York and, significantly, it was

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.969
subject to flooding from the local river.

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.659
This flooding caused unsanitary,

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:04.039
unhygienic, conditions in the houses

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:06.349
of the local residents by contaminating

00:09:06.349 --> 00:09:09.219
water with waste from animals, sewers,

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:11.739
industry and even from cemeteries.

00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:13.329
Nasty stuff indeed.

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:17.249
Now, John was a very intelligent child

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:20.269
with a great aptitude for mathematics,

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:22.479
a skill that would play an important

00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:24.719
role in his work later on in life.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.069
He might not have been thinking about

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:28.929
the spread of disease as a young

00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:31.229
boy in York, but his intelligence

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:32.829
meant that he was able to get an

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:34.799
apprenticeship with an apothecary

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:37.569
surgeon, essentially a pharmacist that

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:39.699
also did some basic surgical work.

00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:42.329
It was during his time working as

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:44.119
an apprentice that the young John

00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:46.019
Snow first encountered cholera in

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:47.399
the nearby village of Killingworth,

00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:49.539
where there was a bad outbreak.

00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:52.179
There, he helped to treat many

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:53.879
people who were suffering from

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:56.079
cholera, and he became familiar with

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:58.239
its symptoms and deadly effects.

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:01.069
Now, you probably know a

00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:02.789
bit about cholera already.

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:05.626
Fortunately, for most of the developed

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:07.279
world it is no longer something

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:09.779
that concerns us, but let me quickly

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:12.089
remind you about what exactly it is

00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:14.559
and what it does, in slightly less

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:16.429
graphic terms than the account from

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:17.769
the newspaper you heard earlier.

00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:20.779
Cholera is an infection of the

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.079
small intestine by a bacteria called

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:25.569
vibrio-cholera and is one of the most

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:27.659
serious diseases that affects humans.

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:31.169
Its symptoms are wide-ranging but one

00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:33.279
of the most significant is extreme

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:35.699
diarrhoea that can last for days.

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.829
This can be so severe as to cause

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:40.609
dangerous levels of dehydration

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.629
through the huge loss of body fluids

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:43.869
in a very short period of time.

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:46.039
And if not treated

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:47.749
properly, it will kill you.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.449
Over the last 200 years there have

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:53.929
been seven major cholera pandemics

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:56.249
and millions of consequent deaths.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:10:59.099
The epidemic that John Snow encountered

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:02.209
in Killingworth in the 1830s was part of

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:05.279
the second major pandemic, one that began

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:08.649
around 1826 in India and spread across

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:11.659
China, Japan and Western Asia then to

00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:14.029
Europe, the Americas and Great Britain.

00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:17.499
Hundreds of thousands of people died.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.969
And this brings us back to Soho in 1854.

00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:25.989
On one side we have physicians debating

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:28.679
exactly how this bad air is spreading

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.059
cholera, but with no viable solution,

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:34.089
no idea about how to stop transmission.

00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:37.969
On the other we have John Snow, who

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:40.129
by this time has his own private

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:42.759
practice in Frith Street, a few

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:44.209
streets away from Broad Street,

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.529
the centre of the cholera outbreak.

00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:50.139
As a reminder, he thought cholera

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:52.239
was transmitted through infected

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:54.349
water, not through bad air.

00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:58.699
So, how had he come to this hypothesis?

00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:01.559
Well, his studies showed that

00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:03.329
the transmission of the disease

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:05.469
depended on where the water in a

00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:07.019
particular neighbourhood came from.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.769
Two of the main companies that

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:11.509
provided water to central London

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:14.429
drew it from polluted places, others

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:16.409
got it from cleaner sources and

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:18.889
filtered it to remove contaminants.

00:12:20.249 --> 00:12:22.959
The areas the latter served had

00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:24.839
measurably fewer deaths, no matter

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:26.769
whether the inhabitants were rich

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:29.569
or poor, male or female, young

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:31.659
or old, or what job they did.

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:36.029
After the Broad Street outbreak, John Snow

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:39.639
decided to chart, to map, the incidents of

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:42.059
cholera by interviewing local residents.

00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:45.109
He plotted the incidents of cholera

00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:48.019
on a map, and in so doing he was

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:50.259
able to establish a pattern for

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:52.089
the spread of the disease and he

00:12:52.089 --> 00:12:54.306
noticed something highly significant.

00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:58.349
“Within 250 yards of the spot where

00:12:58.349 --> 00:13:00.779
Cambridge Street joins Broad Street

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:04.049
there were upwards of 500 fatal attacks

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:07.219
of cholera in 10 days… As soon as I

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.189
became acquainted with the situation

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:12.169
and extent of this eruption of cholera,

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:14.639
I suspected some contamination of

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.849
the water of the much-frequented

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:18.669
street-pump in Broad Street.”

00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:20.329
Thank you John.

00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:24.179
Significantly, there were only 10 deaths

00:13:24.319 --> 00:13:27.169
in houses nearer to a different pump, and

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:30.279
in five of those cases, the families of

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.375
the deceased, the dead people, told Snow

00:13:33.518 --> 00:13:35.849
that they always used the pump in Broad

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:38.109
Street, as they preferred its water.

00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:41.789
They preferred it despite the fact it was

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:43.839
later discovered that the well beneath

00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:46.129
the pump had been dug near to an old

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:48.589
cesspit that was leaking human waste!

00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:50.089
Tasty stuff indeed.

00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:54.239
In three other cases, the victims were

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:55.879
children who went to school near the

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:58.749
pump in Broad Street, so Snow presumed

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:00.979
that they stopped off at that pump for

00:14:00.979 --> 00:14:03.279
a drink on their way to or from school.

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:06.599
He went on to map the locations of

00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:08.839
cholera incidents near various other

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:10.909
pumps and used his mathematical

00:14:10.909 --> 00:14:12.929
knowledge to illustrate the connection

00:14:13.099 --> 00:14:14.689
between the quality of the water

00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:16.579
source and the number of cases.

00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:19.679
Areas supplied with water from a

00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:21.559
sewage-polluted stretch of the Thames

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:24.529
had a cholera rate fourteen times higher

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:27.149
than that supplied from a cleaner area.

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:30.489
Now, this might sound blindingly

00:14:30.499 --> 00:14:32.579
obvious to us now, “don’t drink

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:34.879
polluted water”, but I need to stress

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:37.019
that it wasn’t obvious at the time.

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:40.659
After showing his calculations to

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:42.629
the local authorities, he managed to

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:45.339
convince them to test his theory and

00:14:45.349 --> 00:14:47.879
stop the use of the Broad Street pump by

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:50.678
removing its handle, making it unusable.

00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:53.609
He didn’t win many friends for this,

00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:55.939
it wasn’t a popular move, as it meant

00:14:55.939 --> 00:14:58.279
that everyone around Broad Street needed

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:00.519
to walk to the next pump to get water.

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:03.699
But it seemed to work.

00:15:04.359 --> 00:15:06.869
Cholera deaths reduced, the outbreak

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.769
ended, although Snow would himself later

00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:11.849
write that deaths had already peaked.

00:15:12.809 --> 00:15:15.229
And although today we know that cholera

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:17.789
is indeed carried in contaminated

00:15:17.789 --> 00:15:19.819
water, and you might have thought that

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:22.169
this was definitive proof, it would

00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:24.579
take several years for Snow’s theory

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:27.229
to actually be definitely proved.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:31.009
This wouldn’t be until 1861,

00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:33.269
when the Frenchman Louis Pasteur

00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:35.879
developed his ‘germ theory’ for the

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:38.189
transmission of diseases, and with

00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:41.239
this the miasma theory was dismissed.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:45.429
And indeed Snow’s theory wasn’t fully

00:15:45.429 --> 00:15:48.119
accepted until five years after this,

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:51.359
in 1866, when one of his original

00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:53.779
opponents, who was investigating another

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:56.479
cholera outbreak in East London, realised

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.249
its truth and issued orders that all

00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:01.559
drinking water must be boiled first.

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:06.889
Sadly by that time, Snow was dead.

00:16:07.489 --> 00:16:09.989
He suffered a stroke whilst at work on

00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:13.019
the 10th of June 1858 at the tragically

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:16.649
young age of 45 and he never recovered.

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:19.789
If you go to London today, you can

00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:21.909
visit all of the places I’ve mentioned:

00:16:22.289 --> 00:16:24.419
Frith Street, where he had his private

00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:26.309
practice, and Broadwick Street,

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.389
where there was the cholera outbreak.

00:16:29.126 --> 00:16:31.666
And if you go to Broadwick Street you

00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:34.226
will see two signs of this great man.

00:16:34.996 --> 00:16:36.736
The first is obvious, it’s

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:38.256
a pub called the John Snow.

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:41.016
Although I’m not sure what John Snow

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.806
would have thought about a pub being

00:16:42.806 --> 00:16:45.886
named after him as he was teetotal, he

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:48.406
didn’t drink alcohol, and drank pure

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:50.796
boiled water for his entire adult life.

00:16:52.066 --> 00:16:54.996
And the second is less obvious, it’s

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:57.936
a replica pump, a pump made to look

00:16:58.006 --> 00:17:00.086
like the very pump John Snow figured

00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:02.086
was the source of the cholera outbreak.

00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:05.656
So, if you do find yourself in this

00:17:05.676 --> 00:17:08.106
area of London, go to Broadwick

00:17:08.246 --> 00:17:10.896
Street, take a look at the pump, and

00:17:11.026 --> 00:17:13.116
remember the story of this great man.

00:17:14.226 --> 00:17:15.886
You can even pop into the pub

00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:17.486
and have a pint in his memory.

00:17:18.146 --> 00:17:20.206
Or, if you want to really honour him,

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:22.406
I’d recommend ordering his favourite

00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:26.206
drink: a glass of pure boiled water.

00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:31.546
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:34.796
on John Snow, the famous epidemiologist.

00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:36.506
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:38.106
that you've learnt something new, and

00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:39.976
that this gives you yet another place of

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:41.956
interest to visit if you go to London.

00:17:42.696 --> 00:17:44.366
As always, I would love to know

00:17:44.366 --> 00:17:45.796
what you thought about this episode.

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:47.766
Did you know anything about this story?

00:17:48.106 --> 00:17:49.786
Have you been to Soho, have

00:17:49.786 --> 00:17:51.176
you even stopped off for a

00:17:51.186 --> 00:17:52.826
drink in The John Snow pub?

00:17:53.326 --> 00:17:54.866
What other interesting stories are

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.036
there of how diseases were discovered?

00:17:57.546 --> 00:17:59.476
I would love to know, so let’s

00:17:59.476 --> 00:18:00.866
get this discussion started.

00:18:01.186 --> 00:18:02.226
You can head right into our

00:18:02.226 --> 00:18:03.756
community forum, which is at

00:18:03.756 --> 00:18:06.266
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:18:06.266 --> 00:18:08.296
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:18:09.346 --> 00:18:11.066
You've been listening to English Learning

00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:16.766
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:18:16.766 --> 00:18:18.746
I'll catch you in the next episode.

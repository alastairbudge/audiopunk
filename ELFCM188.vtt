Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:16.721
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:20.921
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:28.260
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part three of our three-part series on Scottish Heroes.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.190
In Part One we learned about the Scottish freedom fighter, William

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.220
Wallace, who fought bravely against the English but was brutally executed.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.230
Then, in part two, which was one of our member-only episodes, we learned about the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.250
tragic life of Mary Queen of Scots, the woman who inherited the Scottish throne when she

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.420
was just 6 days old, and whose life was filled with betrayal, suspicion, and evil men.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.350
And to cap it all off, to finish this mini-series, we are going to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.600
talk about Charles Stuart, otherwise known as Bonnie Prince Charlie.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.370
To some, he is a Scottish legend, a romantic hero

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.300
who fought bravely to take back what was rightly his.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.820
To others, he was a coward and a fool, who was

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.070
responsible for the deaths of thousands of honest men.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.120
So, in today’s episode, we will explore a fascinating range of themes

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.740
relating to the life of Bonnie Prince Charlie: rebellion, religion,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.010
courage, nationalism, romance, imperialism, the power of myth and defeat.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.760
Before we get right into all that though, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.980
a member of Leonardo English and follow along with the subtitles, the transcript

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.010
and its key vocabulary over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.470

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.260
awesome private community where we do live events, challenges, and much, much more.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.910
So, if that's of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.610
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.460
OK then, Bonnie Prince Charlie.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.621
This episode will follow a similar structure to the others in this mini-series: a setting

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:51.171
of the scene in Scotland and England at the time; an account of the protagonist‘s life;

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:57.271
a section on the conflict with England and finally something on how these historical

00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:02.721
events have influenced Scottish nationalism and the whole mythology of Scotland.

00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.971
And of course, a few strange facts to end with.

00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:12.881
Now, in order for you to connect a little bit more fully with the

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:17.741
situation that Bonnie Prince Charlie found himself in as a 24 year old

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:23.871
in the summer of 1745, I want you to try to put yourself in his place.

00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.521
Bonnie Prince Charlie’s real name was Charles Edward Stuart.

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:36.451
He was born in Rome, in 1720, and was the heir to the exiled Stuart family.

00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:40.801
Now, if you have listened to the episode on Mary Queen of

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.081
Scots, you will remember that her name was also Stuart.

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:48.611
Bonnie Prince Charlie was the great, great, great

00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:53.451
grand-nephew of Mary Queen of Scots, she was his ancestor.

00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:59.963
But while the bloodline had passed to Bonnie Prince Charlie , the throne had not.

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:05.906
The Catholic Stuart family had lost the throne of England, Scotland

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:11.776
and Ireland in 1688, and ever since they had been living in exile.

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:15.576
On the throne of the Kingdom of England, Scotland

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:19.726
and Ireland was George II, of the Hanoverian dynasty.

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:25.406
Crucially, the Hanovers were Protestants, the Stuarts were Catholics.

00:04:26.376 --> 00:04:32.456
This backstory is all the more important because from a young age, Bonnie

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:37.776
Prince Charlie had been brought up to believe that he was the rightful king.

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:43.226
The Protestants had stolen the throne from his family, executed

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:48.783
several of his family members, and installed one of their own as King.

00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:56.783
As a result, the Stuarts had been living in exile, split between France and what’s now Italy.

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:04.233
Bonnie Prince Charlie, also known as the Young Pretender, was the idealistic, stylish,

00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:13.223
energetic and brave inheritor or heir of all this history of rejection, execution and exile.

00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:19.783
I should explain that in this context the title “Pretender” does not mean

00:05:19.783 --> 00:05:24.933
someone who acts or says that they are something that they are not, but it

00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:30.623
means someone who says that they have a right to a throne or crown – in other

00:05:30.623 --> 00:05:35.083
words, they feel that they are the legitimate monarch who should be the ruler.

00:05:35.653 --> 00:05:41.383
For the French, Italian, or Spanish speakers, “pretend” in English is normally a

00:05:41.413 --> 00:05:46.643
false friend, but in this case it means what the similar word in your language means.

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:54.233
So, Bonnie Prince Charlie has spent the first 24 years of his life in France and Italy.

00:05:54.523 --> 00:06:00.513
He has never even set foot on British soil, he has never been to the British isles.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:08.423
Yet there is this burning desire to return, to take what he believes to be rightfully his.

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:15.203
As well as being made aware of his legal right to the British throne, Charles was

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:22.253
told of the divine basis for this right: known as the Divine Right of Kings, this was

00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:28.053
a key element of the Stuarts’ belief that they should be rulers with absolute power.

00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:34.363
He is remembered as a bit of a dreamer, as a romantic, and you can

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:39.313
imagine that for someone with this character it must be very easy to

00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:45.453
romanticise this land that you believe God has destined you to rule over.

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:52.285
So, in July 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, our idealistic

00:06:52.303 --> 00:06:57.023
prince, sailed in a French ship to North West Scotland.

00:06:57.723 --> 00:07:01.743
He had been hoping that the French would support him in his fight,

00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:07.363
but he arrived in Scotland with no real support, without an army.

00:07:08.353 --> 00:07:12.743
In order to take back the throne, he would need to raise an army in Britain.

00:07:13.403 --> 00:07:20.873
There was still support for the Stuart cause in Britain, especially among the Catholic population.

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:25.911
But, support for the Stuarts, otherwise known as Jacobitism,

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:29.901
was punishable by death, it was completely illegal.

00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:34.791
There had been previous small uprisings against the

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:38.431
Hanoverians, all of which had been brutally crushed.

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:44.681
And while the Hanoverians might have been considered heretical German invaders

00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:49.221
when they first took the throne, people in Britain had been living under their

00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:56.071
rule since 1714, and they hadn’t lived under a Catholic Stuart since 1688.

00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:01.841
Life wasn’t that different for most people, and given the fact that there was

00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:07.081
a lot to lose by pledging support for Bonnie Prince Charlie, it was certainly

00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:12.521
not a given, it wasn’t definite, that he would find the support that he needed.

00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:17.691
Whether Bonnie Prince Charlie didn’t know this, or whether he was

00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:22.441
just a real optimist, or a combination of the two, we cannot be sure.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.971
He assumed that he would arrive in Scotland and be welcomed with open

00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:32.511
arms, he would raise a large army, be supported by the French King

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:37.461
Louis XV, and he would march down to London and take back the throne.

00:08:38.281 --> 00:08:43.641
Unfortunately it didn’t pan out quite like that, that’s not exactly what happened.

00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:50.761
So, let’s follow our adventurous and and dashing young prince, who, having landed in

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:57.421
the Scottish Hebridian island of Eriskay far off the Northwest coast, raises his flag

00:08:57.581 --> 00:09:04.401
at the West Coast village of Arisaig and calls on the Highland clan chiefs to bring

00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:10.331
their warriors from their respective clans to support him and the Jacobite cause.

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:16.471
Although these clan chiefs had a powerful hold on their members,

00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:20.851
they couldn’t force them to join Charles and his Jacobite army.

00:09:21.491 --> 00:09:26.561
After all, this young foreigner was young, inexperienced and,

00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:32.081
disappointingly, had brought with him no army of professional French soldiers.

00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:39.721
He had no land to lose, whereas for the Highland chiefs, rebellion against the

00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:45.781
British Crown could be a disaster: if they were unsuccessful in their revolt

00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:51.091
it would mean at best being thrown in prison and their lands taken away.

00:09:51.551 --> 00:09:55.541
At worst, they would suffer public execution as traitors.

00:09:56.311 --> 00:10:04.071
However, Charles did just manage to raise enough of an army – but only around 3000 men – it

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:10.631
was enough to march on Edinburgh and for Scotland’s capital city to fall under his command.

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:19.181
He did meet with early success when in September 1745, just east of Edinburgh, in fact

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:25.631
very close to where I used to live, on a misty September morning his Highland warriors

00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:32.401
surprised and massacred the poorly prepared Government army at a town called Prestonpans.

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:37.801
This was a terrible humiliation for the Government forces

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:41.491
and a massive boost for Bonnie Prince Charlie’s army.

00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:48.121
The stories that went ahead of this Highland army, with their tartan clothes,

00:10:48.171 --> 00:10:55.701
their bagpipes and often their long, red hair and scary beards, became the stuff

00:10:55.751 --> 00:11:02.011
of folklore: these soldiers, so people said, were invincible and terrifying.

00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:07.361
The next phase of the military campaign involved a quick march

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:12.761
south when the Jacobite army met with no significant resistance.

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:19.451
They moved through the country going through areas where support for the Jacobite cause was

00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:28.241
strongest, eventually reaching the English town of Derby, which is only about 200km north of London.

00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:32.911
At Derby, there was a discussion between Charles and his

00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.861
senior commanders as to whether they should proceed to London.

00:11:37.671 --> 00:11:40.931
For Charles, London was the big prize.

00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:48.081
He didn’t only believe he was the rightful king of Scotland, he believed he was the King of Britain.

00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:55.698
And you couldn’t be King of Britain without taking its capital and largest and most important city.

00:11:56.298 --> 00:12:02.328
Charles was all for gambling everything and carrying on, pushing south to the capital.

00:12:03.018 --> 00:12:09.938
However, his commanders, above all the experienced general Lord George Murray, were

00:12:10.238 --> 00:12:16.678
unwilling and felt that, with no guaranteed French military aid, they were likely to fail.

00:12:17.878 --> 00:12:23.678
So, the army of around 5,000 men turned around and went back up north.

00:12:24.318 --> 00:12:28.578
Charles was reportedly someone who did not like it when he did not

00:12:28.588 --> 00:12:34.218
get his own way; he had, after all, lived his life as a prince, and

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:38.698
was presumably not used to being told that something wasn’t possible.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:44.028
As the army marched north he was in a terrible mood, and his

00:12:44.028 --> 00:12:47.858
relationship with the experienced general Murray never recovered.

00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:52.948
It wasn’t only Bonnie Prince Charlie that was in low spirits.

00:12:53.328 --> 00:12:59.008
Most of the soldiers in the army weren’t professional soldiers, they were farmers, essentially.

00:12:59.588 --> 00:13:03.808
They were not expecting to go on a long military campaign,

00:13:04.098 --> 00:13:07.108
and they needed to get back home for the harvest.

00:13:07.718 --> 00:13:12.838
The soldiers also knew that the Government forces were determined to seek revenge

00:13:12.848 --> 00:13:18.428
for the humiliating defeat at Prestonpans, and to crush the Jacobite cause for good.

00:13:19.178 --> 00:13:24.148
As a consequence, there was mass desertion as the army retraced

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:28.708
its path back up north, many soldiers simply left the army.

00:13:29.548 --> 00:13:35.018
In the same way that it is interesting to speculate on what might have happened

00:13:35.188 --> 00:13:40.832
had William Wallace triumphed at Falkirk, or if Mary Queen of Scots hadn’t

00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:46.052
been executed by her cousin, so it is interesting to wonder what might have

00:13:46.052 --> 00:13:50.622
happened if Charles had continued and the Jacobite army had marched on London.

00:13:51.342 --> 00:13:57.602
Ironically, there is some evidence to suggest that the French would have sent troops to support

00:13:57.812 --> 00:14:03.402
once Charles's army was close to London, and who knows what might have happened if they had.

00:14:04.382 --> 00:14:05.502
But, they didn’t.

00:14:05.872 --> 00:14:11.602
Charles’ troops marched north, and headed to the north east of Scotland, where they

00:14:11.782 --> 00:14:16.772
had heard there was a growing group of soldiers supportive of the Jacobite cause.

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:21.662
He thought that they could retreat to Scotland, join with this

00:14:21.682 --> 00:14:25.662
other army, and they would be in a better position from there.

00:14:26.952 --> 00:14:33.452
Before we move on to the decisive, tragic and historic events of the last battle on British

00:14:33.452 --> 00:14:40.051
soil, Culloden, it’s worth spending a minute reflecting on who was actually in these armies.

00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:47.111
It is very easy to simplify things and say that this was a story of Scotland vs.

00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:49.071
England, or Catholics vs.

00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:52.961
Protestants, it really isn’t as clear cut as this.

00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:59.041
The Jacobite army were mainly Catholics from the Highlands of Scotland,

00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:04.551
but also some Scottish Protestants and a small number of English and Irish.

00:15:05.381 --> 00:15:08.761
And the Jacobite cause was supported by the French.

00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:13.671
The British government wasn’t just English, and it wasn’t

00:15:13.681 --> 00:15:16.391
just Protestant, although the majority would have been.

00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:24.451
The British Government forces also included many Scots, mainly from the Lowlands of Scotland, the

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:29.811
southern part of Scotland, but there were also some soldiers from the Highlands, from the North.

00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:37.341
So, the armies were both mixed, and you would have had situations where men from nearby

00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:43.061
villages, perhaps even the same village, might have been fighting on different sides.

00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:49.471
Ironically perhaps and going against the myth of this being an imperialist

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:54.451
battle between England and Scotland, it is thought that there were almost as

00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:59.971
many Scottish soldiers on the Government side as there were on the Jacobite side.

00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:07.531
Turning to the numbers and make-up of the two armies now, Bonnie Prince Charlie‘s forces

00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:15.261
were virtually all foot soldiers, armed with some rifles, and around 7,000 in number.

00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:19.451
They had lost some men on the return north, but they had

00:16:19.471 --> 00:16:22.601
also gained some new men when they returned to Scotland.

00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:26.811
Crucially, they were not really professional soldiers.

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:32.081
On the Government side, King George II’s youngest son,

00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:36.251
William Augustus, the Duke of Cumberland, was in charge.

00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:40.331
He had some 8000 soldiers under his command.

00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:44.721
But his advantage wasn’t just in numbers.

00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:53.111
He had both artillery – so that’s cannons – and cavalry, so that's soldiers on horses.

00:16:53.791 --> 00:16:57.921
His army was also made up of well trained professionals.

00:16:58.781 --> 00:17:03.461
So, as you can see, it was an unequal contest.

00:17:04.421 --> 00:17:09.321
The disparity in the two armies‘ strength was all the greater

00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:13.551
because of what happened in the 24 hours before the battle.

00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:18.801
Charles attempted a surprise night attack on the Government forces.

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:24.971
The government forces had been celebrating their commander's 25th birthday on that

00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:31.611
evening, 15th April, and each regiment had been given large amounts of brandy.

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:35.971
Bonnie Prince Charlie thought that the government soldiers would

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:40.701
be drunk, and so planned a surprise attack during the night.

00:17:41.611 --> 00:17:45.761
But, it was a long march to where the government camp was,

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:50.711
about 13 kilometres, and the ground was muddy and wet.

00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:57.971
The Jacobite army set off when the sun had gone down, and marched throughout the night.

00:17:58.961 --> 00:18:05.791
But by the time that the sun was coming up they still hadn’t arrived, and so turned back.

00:18:06.531 --> 00:18:10.431
By the time they arrived back at their camp, they were exhausted,

00:18:10.431 --> 00:18:14.141
they had been marching all night and many went to sleep.

00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:18.631
Remember, most of them had also been marching around Great

00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:22.871
Britain for most of the past 9 months, so they were tired anyway.

00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:29.761
It was later that day at around noon, around midday when the Jacobites were trying

00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:35.561
to sleep and gather some strength, that the Government forces arrived at an empty

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:42.341
and muddy piece of ground, about 6km outside Inverness, in North East Scotland

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:50.491
It was 16 April 1746 – a day best described by the atmospheric

00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:56.761
Scottish word as dreich, which means cold, wet and generally miserable.

00:18:57.911 --> 00:19:01.301
It was on this day that the Battle of Culloden was fought,

00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:05.301
which was to be the last battle fought on British soil.

00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:15.121
The battle had a bizarre formality to it, with each side lining up, a mere 183 metres apart.

00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:20.058
Each side stretched for about 300 meters.

00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:24.501
The entire battle would all be over in about 45 minutes.

00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:28.011
It was a complete massacre.

00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:33.931
The government forces started firing on the Jacobite army, and hundreds

00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:37.751
were killed before they could get anywhere near the government forces.

00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:45.751
After 10 or 15 minutes of being fired on, they charged at the government army, but

00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:51.311
the muddy nature of the ground and the fact that they had no protection from the

00:19:51.321 --> 00:19:56.451
bullets of the government soldiers, who could fire two bullets every minute, meant

00:19:56.591 --> 00:20:02.511
that many of them were slaughtered as they advanced across the bare ground; the

00:20:02.731 --> 00:20:09.321
few who arrived at the enemy lines were pushed back by bayonets and then cavalry.

00:20:10.131 --> 00:20:15.511
At least 1250 Jacobites were killed and an equal number wounded.

00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:19.971
It was clear that there was no way for the army to progress

00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:23.691
against the significantly superior government forces.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:31.271
Bonnie Prince Charlie did manage to escape, as did around 5,000 of his 7,000 men.

00:20:32.201 --> 00:20:36.501
In total the British government forces only had around 300

00:20:36.901 --> 00:20:41.041
soldiers killed or wounded, 8 times less than the Jacobites.

00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:48.831
In the aftermath of this historic battle, which was so tragic for the doomed Jacobite

00:20:48.871 --> 00:20:54.891
cause, Charles would be blamed, both for putting his tired, hungry and demoralised

00:20:54.901 --> 00:21:01.211
soldiers into battle and for fighting on a battlefield which would work to the advantage

00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:07.661
or benefit of the Government forces and against the few advantages that the Jacobites had.

00:21:08.611 --> 00:21:13.811
He would also be criticised for the way in which he directed his soldiers.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:20.511
After all, it was the first battle that he had actually directed himself - he was not a

00:21:20.511 --> 00:21:26.981
soldier, he was a prince who had grown up in the luxurious ballrooms of Paris and Rome.

00:21:28.111 --> 00:21:33.671
Indeed, as Bonnie Prince Charlie ran away from the battle one of his generals,

00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:39.261
Lord Elcho, reportedly shouted after him “Run, you cowardly Italian”.

00:21:40.671 --> 00:21:45.551
After this very brief and one-sided battle, the Government commander, the

00:21:45.561 --> 00:21:50.801
Duke of Cumberland, was determined to teach the Jacobite rebels a lesson.

00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:57.341
They advanced to the Jacobite side and killed every wounded soldier they could find.

00:21:58.101 --> 00:22:02.121
For days afterwards the defeated soldiers and their families

00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:06.041
were hunted down and killed by the Government troops.

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:13.371
This would now be classified as ethnic cleansing, and was a permanent stain on the

00:22:13.371 --> 00:22:19.161
reputation of the Duke of Cumberland, earning him the title of “Butcher Cumberland”.

00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:27.091
And as for Bonnie Prince Charlie, he slipped off into the darkness, eventually escaping to

00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:33.921
France, and living the rest of his life in Paris, consumed by melancholy and alcoholism.

00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:41.571
We actually know relatively little about his later life, and, like a rock star who dies in

00:22:41.571 --> 00:22:47.941
their twenties, he remains in the popular imagination as an ever-youthful, romantic hero.

00:22:48.871 --> 00:22:54.951
Now, to the legacy of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and his impact on Scottish nationalism.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:23:02.481
The events of the Jacobite rebellion are remembered by many as a battle of Scotland vs.

00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:09.731
England, but as I hope will now be clear, this is a great simplification of the truth.

00:23:10.761 --> 00:23:16.951
For several years after Culloden, Highlandism, so that’s doing things like wearing tartan and

00:23:16.951 --> 00:23:24.801
kilts, the Scottish skirts, was forbidden, and there was suppression of all things Scottish.

00:23:25.681 --> 00:23:31.821
But towards the end of the 18th century, as it was clear that there was no hope for a

00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:39.461
restoration of the Stuarts, this was repealed, it was removed and it quickly became fashionable.

00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:45.561
The prolific Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott, featured the Jacobite rebellion

00:23:45.761 --> 00:23:51.561
and Bonnie Prince Charlie himself in a highly romanticised version in his novels.

00:23:52.321 --> 00:23:58.561
When King George IV visited Edinburgh in 1822, Scott having organised

00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:03.041
the festivities, the King was fully dressed in Highland Dress.

00:24:03.731 --> 00:24:09.981
Given his and his ancestors’ history with the highlanders, this was somewhat ironic.

00:24:11.081 --> 00:24:18.021
And Queen Victoria was also so taken by the romanticism of the Scottish Highlands that she

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:24.511
bought the Highland castle, Balmoral, which is now where the Royal Family spend their summers.

00:24:25.411 --> 00:24:31.381
Highlandism is a powerful force now – especially in the USA and in Northern Europe.

00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:37.841
Culloden provides a powerful, emotive myth: the image of a brave,

00:24:37.961 --> 00:24:42.721
noble Celtic people having their final heroic stand against the forces

00:24:42.821 --> 00:24:47.221
of English industrial imperialism catches the popular imagination.

00:24:48.311 --> 00:24:53.901
And Highlandism has come into fashion again thanks to the popular TV series,

00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:58.361
Outlander, which has the Jacobite rebellion at the centre of its story.

00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:01.381
The myth is certainly powerful.

00:25:02.051 --> 00:25:08.830
So, finally, as has become customary, here are some weird and wonderful facts about this story.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:18.670
Against all advice in 1750, Charles did finally reach London, but in disguise or incognito;

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.460
during that visit, in order to try to convince his potential supporters that he could

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:30.110
be trusted with the British throne, he became a Protestant, converting to Anglicanism.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.290
Secondly, Charles‘s body is buried in two different places.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.690
His heart is buried in Frascati Cathedral, just outside Rome.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.290
The rest of his remains are in Saint Peter‘s Basilica, also in Rome.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:51.580
Thirdly, Jacobite clubs, so groups of people which supported the restoration of the

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.540
Stuarts, would meet in secret, and toast what they called “The King over the Water“.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:04.640
They would do this by passing the wine over a bowl of water in order to toast the health

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:10.330
of the exiled Stuarts, who were over the water, over the English channel, in Europe.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.160
And finally, a fact that might be of particular interest to the Spanish

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:21.330
listeners, is that the Stuart family line is not extinct, it is not dead.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:28.050
Indeed, the senior heir of the Royal Stuarts is a man called Carlos

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:33.870
Fritz-James Stuart y Martínez de Irujo, who is one of the most prominent

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.630
of the Spanish nobility and one of the wealthiest people in Spain.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.535
So, there you go, Bonnie Prince Charlie.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:48.540
To some, he is a foolish pretender, a coward who ran away after his men were slaughtered.

00:26:49.106 --> 00:26:54.840
But to others he is a symbol of bravery, a man who devoted his life to a

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.940
cause he believed in, and one who was struck down by an evil government.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:05.840
Whatever side you come down on, it is hard to deny that there is something almost

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:12.040
Shakespearean about Bonnie Prince Charlie, the story of the prince who returns to

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.630
take what he believes to be rightfully his, and is able to raise an army to support

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:23.390
him, but, as with all of the other characters in this mini-series, discovers that

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:29.020
trying your luck against the English army is a bold, but often disastrous move.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.060
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Bonnie Prince Charlie,

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:40.410
and with it comes the end of this mini-series on Scottish Heroes.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.710
As a reminder, part one was on William Wallace, the original revolutionary

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.100
who fought for Scottish independence and was executed as a reward.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.030
And in part two we learned about Mary Queen of Scots, a woman who

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:59.920
was also killed more for what she was rather than what she did.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.880
I hope you enjoyed this mini-series, and that you found these stories of these

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:11.100
three very different characters interesting, and it helped you understand a

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.140
little bit more about the complicated relationship between Scotland and England.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.860
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.930

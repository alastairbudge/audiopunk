Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:09.191
English.

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:10.901
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:18.901
Today we are on to part three of our mini-series about British food, the penultimate part.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:28.356
In part one, we heard about how London used to be fueled by cheap oysters and how a dodgy batch of

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:33.336
them caused the entire industry to collapse almost overnight.

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:42.026
Then in part two, we talked about fish and chips, the true story behind them and why people think

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:46.196
they helped Britain win the first and second world war.

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:53.276
And today it's part three, so we'll be talking about the English breakfast.

00:00:54.146 --> 00:01:01.526
If you don't know much about the English breakfast, it's quite heavy, it's quite a large meal, so

00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:07.046
this podcast might be one to listen to on a relatively empty stomach.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:13.682
Before we get right into the podcast though, this is just a quick reminder that you can find the

00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:21.917
transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast on the website, which is www.leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.680
The transcript is really helpful if you want to follow along, and the key vocabulary is great for

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.180
picking up new words and meaning you don't have to stop and look things up in the dictionary.

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:35.002
Okay then, let's get cracking.

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:39.922
The English breakfast is truly a British institution.

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:44.942
You might have heard it being called a full English or a fry-up.

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:51.832
I should point out that there are also slight deviations on the 'English' part.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:02:02.152
You can have a full Irish, a full Scottish, a full Welsh, a full Cornish and an Ulster fry, which is

00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:04.792
popular in parts of Ireland and Scotland.

00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:13.342
When you think of a full English breakfast, perhaps you imagine a huge plate bursting at the seams

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:19.702
with sausages, bacon, beans, toast, all manner of fried, greasy, fatty things.

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:26.605
If you come from a country where breakfast is a bit less important or where people eat less for

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:33.265
breakfast, and actually that's pretty much every country then this might seem mad to you.

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:41.935
My wife for example, is Italian, and in case you don't know, Italians eat pretty small breakfasts.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:49.480
When she first came to the UK she was mortified when she saw the size of what was served on her

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.830
plate for breakfast.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.120
So where does the fry-up come from?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.980
Where does the English breakfast come from?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.440
Why are people in Britain stuffing their faces with sausages and bacon when a lot of Europe seems to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.400
make do with some sort of pastry and a little coffee?

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:17.905
Well, the full English breakfast actually dates back as far as the thirteen hundreds making it one

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:21.475
of the longest standing traditional dishes in English history.

00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:25.935
It's changed quite a bit since then, as we'll discover.

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:35.235
Back in the thirteen hundreds a breakfast of this sort was a luxury and therefore was reserved for

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:40.875
only the richest in society, the gentry, the nobles who owned the land.

00:03:41.115 --> 00:03:42.645
Nobody else could afford it.

00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:50.055
The gentry considered breakfast the most important meal of the day, a message which is still

00:03:50.055 --> 00:03:51.675
prevalent now.

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:58.335
You might have heard the phrase "breakfast like a King, lunch like a Prince and dine like a pauper".

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:01.155
There may even be variants in your language.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:11.294
Remember, gentry here means nobles, lords, ladies, landowners, people who are rich because of blood

00:04:11.294 --> 00:04:15.674
and social status, not through success in business or enterprise.

00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:21.464
So more like Game of Thrones than Wolf of Wall Street, if you follow that.

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:29.384
While the gentry were busy enjoying lavish breakfasts, for the rest of the population, life wasn't

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.004
quite so interesting.

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:39.192
For the most part, breakfast consisted of a thick porridge or ale or bread.

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:48.496
Those who were slightly better off might stretch to adding cheese or cold meat or dripping, so

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:55.238
dripping is the fat that has fallen off roasted meat, they would add that to their ale and bread For

00:04:55.238 --> 00:05:01.388
most people, this would be all that they might eat until the evening as they would be out toiling,

00:05:01.388 --> 00:05:02.738
working, in the fields.

00:05:03.188 --> 00:05:10.028
Lunch generally wasn't really an option and besides, they would have what we are calling breakfast

00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:13.748
typically around mid-morning, so they'd only really have two meals.

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:23.655
By the time Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1819 the gentry as a social class were in decline

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:31.635
and there was a new wealthy class emerging made up of merchants, industrialists, and businessmen.

00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:39.695
People who had become rich through success in business rather than just inheriting titles from their

00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:40.235
parents.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.764
The industrial revolution and the British empire at its height were huge creators of wealth in

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:54.127
Britain and the newly rich saw the idea of the gentry as the social model to aspire to.

00:05:55.055 --> 00:06:02.109
Those seeking to advance themselves socially studied the habits of the gentry, the traditions of

00:06:02.109 --> 00:06:10.014
their country houses, and they enthusiastically adopted this notion of the English breakfast as an

00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:11.844
important social event.

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:21.090
It might sound strange to you or me, but hosting a huge breakfast for your guests was one of the

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.820
main ways in which Victorians would show off their riches, show off their wealth.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:37.320
The breakfast table became an opportunity to flaunt your wealth and they would go to huge lengths to

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.610
secure impressive ingredients and have them prepared in the right way.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:50.970
As well as eggs and bacon, which was first cured in the early 18th century, the breakfast feast

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.880
might also include offal, which is the insides of animals, things like kidneys.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:05.355
They would also serve cold meats, things like tongue as well as fish dishes, so things like kippers,

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:07.725
which are cured or smoked fish.

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:14.325
And there's more, a typical lavish Victorian breakfast table would also include something called

00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:23.175
kedgeree, which is a lightly spiced dish from colonial India of rice, smoked fish and boiled eggs.

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:25.455
Quite a sumptuous breakfast, right?

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:32.068
These breakfast banquets could go on for hours, and the amazing thing was that they were just the

00:07:32.068 --> 00:07:37.168
first of several large meals that wealthy Victorians would eat during the day.

00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:44.467
These wealthy Victorians often had precious little to do and they would flaunt their wealth just

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:50.287
through serving and eating copious amounts, starting with breakfast.

00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:58.347
Guests would be invited to spend the evening, and then this huge lavish breakfast would be served in

00:07:58.347 --> 00:07:58.917
the mid-morning.

00:07:59.527 --> 00:08:06.697
Newspapers would also be provided, allowing guests to catch up on the latest developments across the

00:08:06.697 --> 00:08:07.177
empire.

00:08:08.532 --> 00:08:16.050
Although it might seem rude today, it was socially acceptable to read a newspaper at the breakfast

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.350
table.

00:08:17.173 --> 00:08:22.851
Only at breakfast though, reading it at any other meal was certainly not acceptable to Victorians.

00:08:23.356 --> 00:08:28.618
This kind of breakfast was still expensive, though, as you might have guessed, and only accessible

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:30.868
by the wealthiest in society.

00:08:31.768 --> 00:08:40.698
The thing that many people forget, or just don't know is quite how expensive food used to be as a

00:08:40.698 --> 00:08:42.528
percentage of income.

00:08:43.848 --> 00:08:50.808
Now we take for granted in the Western world that food is comparatively cheap, at least as a

00:08:51.078 --> 00:08:53.088
percentage of income.

00:08:54.198 --> 00:09:01.248
A hundred years ago, this really wasn't the case, and even tinned beans would have been too

00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:03.228
expensive for most working people.

00:09:04.504 --> 00:09:11.379
Leading up to the First World War, things started to change and it was during this period that we

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:19.969
first saw what we would recognise now as an English breakfast starting to emerge and being served as

00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:27.499
a standard breakfast in hotels, bed and breakfasts, on trains and at business meetings across the

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:27.919
country.

00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:36.242
Standard ingredients made it easier and cheaper to prepare, and so the common English breakfast

00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:38.852
rapidly spread across the country.

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:48.662
By this time, its ingredients had standardised to a certain extent, so you would recognise a lot of

00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:50.612
what they were eating then, today.

00:09:51.222 --> 00:09:59.682
So that's bacon, eggs, sausage, black pudding, baked beans, grilled tomato, fried bread, toast

00:09:59.712 --> 00:10:04.752
served with jams, marmalades, tea, coffee, and orange juice if you were lucky.

00:10:06.352 --> 00:10:10.702
The English breakfast was not just a meal for the wealthy at this point.

00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:18.522
The middle-classes began to eat a full English breakfast on a regular basis and began seeing it as a

00:10:18.522 --> 00:10:20.412
traditional family meal.

00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:27.621
They also thought it sensible to eat a full breakfast before starting the day, one that provided

00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:32.661
people with the energy that they needed to see them through a full day's work.

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:40.296
The English breakfast tradition spread from the middle to the working classes and reached its peak

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:48.006
in the early 1950s when as much as half of the British population began their day by eating the same

00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:54.696
English breakfast we would eat today, collectively turning what was once a meal for the wealthy

00:10:54.726 --> 00:11:02.376
upper and aspiring middle classes into a truly national breakfast dish and a working class staple.

00:11:03.707 --> 00:11:11.027
The English breakfast was famously served in what's called greasy spoon cafes located on industrial

00:11:11.027 --> 00:11:18.227
estates and close to ports, commercial, manufacturing and industrial centres where all the workers

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:18.557
were.

00:11:19.607 --> 00:11:25.967
For a long time, these were the best places to get a real English breakfast, one cooked and served

00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:32.477
by real English working class people, but over the last few decades, they have fallen into decline,

00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:39.472
along with British industry and real greasy spoon cafes are now quite rare.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:46.813
Without the workers who needed a big meal to start the day, these greasy spoon cafes started to go

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:47.593
out of business.

00:11:48.613 --> 00:11:54.433
Although even now, there are still quite a few around, and if you want to find a real authentic

00:11:54.433 --> 00:12:00.403
greasy spoon, then you should go somewhere like near a port or near a manufacturing or industrial

00:12:00.403 --> 00:12:03.853
area to find the most authentic kind of greasy spoon.

00:12:04.813 --> 00:12:12.883
A full English breakfast, even now, pretty much wherever you go is a pretty affordable meal, a cheap

00:12:12.883 --> 00:12:13.993
way to start the day.

00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:20.592
Depending on where you are in the UK, you can probably still get a full English for under five

00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:23.232
pounds, so that's under seven US dollars.

00:12:23.982 --> 00:12:30.162
However, if you're going to a fancy hipster place in somewhere like London, you could easily pay

00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:31.392
three times this.

00:12:32.497 --> 00:12:38.497
For those of you thinking that every person in Britain is still waking up every day and having a

00:12:38.497 --> 00:12:41.707
full English for breakfast, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:49.597
A survey was done a few years back and it came out that only 5% of people have a full English every

00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:49.897
day.

00:12:50.782 --> 00:12:53.692
That might seem like a lot to you, maybe it seems like not a lot.

00:12:53.782 --> 00:12:56.062
It's certainly a lot less than it used to be.

00:12:57.202 --> 00:13:00.412
You might say that this is also a natural selection thing.

00:13:00.952 --> 00:13:07.702
If you eat a full English breakfast every morning, it's not going to be great for your longevity.

00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:17.182
A full English breakfast can easily be 1,500 calories, which is 60% of a man's recommended daily

00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:19.612
intake, or 75% of a woman's.

00:13:20.212 --> 00:13:25.522
So if you eat that every day, well, your doctor probably won't be very happy with you.

00:13:26.962 --> 00:13:34.462
It's now mainly something that's popular with tourists as a treat and definitely as an age-old

00:13:34.582 --> 00:13:35.512
hangover cure.

00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:42.762
And of course the 5% of the population that refuses to give up and continues to start every day with

00:13:42.762 --> 00:13:43.602
an English breakfast.

00:13:45.087 --> 00:13:49.767
I just want to finish on two final points about the English breakfast.

00:13:50.907 --> 00:13:58.173
Firstly, even though, yes, it is called a breakfast, and you do normally eat it at the start of the

00:13:58.173 --> 00:14:02.727
day, you don't necessarily need to eat it right at the start of the day.

00:14:03.117 --> 00:14:09.687
It can be eaten mid-morning, for lunch or even late evening if you're feeling really crazy.

00:14:11.442 --> 00:14:17.952
Secondly, and this is something that always confuses people, if you're invited to British wedding,

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:23.232
you might see an invitation for the wedding breakfast.

00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:28.949
Don't worry, you won't be served a full English, although that could be quite fun.

00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:32.369
This is the traditional term for the wedding meal.

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:39.625
The term comes from the pre-Reformation times when the bride and groom wouldn't have been able to

00:14:39.655 --> 00:14:46.765
eat before their wedding, as they would have fasted to take communion, hence the first meal being

00:14:46.765 --> 00:14:48.085
called breakfast.

00:14:49.735 --> 00:14:50.305
Okay.

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:53.515
I hope you have learned something interesting today.

00:14:54.055 --> 00:14:57.385
The English breakfast is full of fascinating history.

00:14:57.805 --> 00:15:03.625
And so the next time you are sitting down at a greasy spoon or deciding whether you can really

00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:09.985
stomach that third sausage, you'll know a little bit more about the history behind the meal.

00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:17.421
Today's episode is our penultimate episode of our mini-series about British food and in the next

00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:23.641
one, the final one, we'll be talking about one of my favourite subjects and also one of my favourite

00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:24.621
comfort foods.

00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:26.301
The sandwich.

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:33.636
Simple, delicious, sometimes nutritious and with a weird and wonderful story behind it.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.936
That's all to come in the next episode.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:43.566
As always, if you have enjoyed this podcast, then I would really appreciate it if you could spread

00:15:43.566 --> 00:15:45.216
the word in any way, you can.

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:51.336
Maybe that's telling a friend or family member, or maybe it's taking 20 seconds out of your day and

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:55.576
leaving a review in the app store, or if you're feeling particularly kind, it could be both.

00:15:56.616 --> 00:16:01.746
In case you're wondering where the transcript and key vocabulary are, you can find them on

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:03.386
leonardoenglish.com.

00:16:03.726 --> 00:16:08.436
It's really worth checking these out as they can be a very helpful resource for following along.

00:16:09.486 --> 00:16:11.676
I'll also put the links in the show notes.

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.976
Thanks again for listening and I hope you enjoyed the show.

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:20.676

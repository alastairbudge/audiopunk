Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:09.813
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:11.903
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:13.943
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:16.373
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.733
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.023
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:24.043
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:26.303
is the start of another three-part

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:29.303
mini-series on European dictators.

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:32.283
In part one, today’s episode, it’s

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:35.033
Joseph Stalin, the Soviet ruler

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:37.613
once described as The Grey Blur.

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:40.547
Next up, in part two, it's going to be

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.307
the father of fascism, Benito Mussolini.

00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:46.367
And in part three, well you can

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:48.347
probably guess, it will be the leader

00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:50.857
of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler.

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:54.127
To state the obvious, in the case of

00:00:54.177 --> 00:00:56.338
all three men, it would be impossible

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:58.618
to give a thorough, blow-by-blow

00:00:58.668 --> 00:01:00.598
account of their lives and historical

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.078
impact in the space of one episode.

00:01:03.378 --> 00:01:06.198
So, instead, what we will try to do is

00:01:06.228 --> 00:01:08.818
give an overview of their lives and place

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.598
in history, give you a sense of the men

00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:14.278
they were, some of the events that shaped

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:17.318
them, and the dark shadow that they left

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.278
over their countries and the wider world.

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:22.858
OK then, let’s get right into

00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:25.418
it and talk about Joseph Stalin.

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:30.668
On the 16th of July 1941, advancing

00:01:30.668 --> 00:01:33.258
German troops captured a Soviet tank

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:35.978
division during the Battle of Smolensk,

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.108
about 400 kilometres west of Moscow.

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:43.398
A 33-year-old artillery lieutenant,

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:46.278
Yakov Dzughashvili, was taken prisoner.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:50.698
He had first removed the officer insignia,

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:53.948
or symbols, from his uniform and tried to

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:56.248
blend in with the rest of the soldiers.

00:01:57.248 --> 00:02:00.018
Eventually, however, the man was

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:02.548
recognised for who he really was.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:06.318
This was no ordinary Soviet

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:09.298
soldier: this was the oldest son

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:11.698
of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:14.868
What a propaganda coup, what a

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.058
win, this was for the Germans.

00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:20.528
Not only was their Operation Barbarossa

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:23.158
tearing through the Soviet Union, but

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:25.956
they had now captured Stalin’s son.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:30.556
On the 19th of July, the Germans announced

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.666
their celebrity capture to the world.

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:35.569
And they made use of Yakov in

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.086
their war propaganda, even dropping

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:40.366
leaflets with photos of him, shown

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.716
smiling with Germans, over Moscow.

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:47.646
A couple of years later, in 1943, when the

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:50.246
Germans suffered some significant defeats,

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:54.966
Hitler offered Stalin a prisoner swap: in

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.596
exchange for a famous German field marshal

00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:59.716
who had been captured at the Battle of

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:03.256
Stalingrad, Stalin could save his son.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:06.906
So, what did the Soviet leader do?

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:10.096
Well, most parents, I think it’s

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.176
fair to say, would do absolutely

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:14.116
anything to get their child back.

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:18.056
But Stalin was no ordinary

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:20.106
parent, no ordinary man.

00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:24.266
He refused the swap - and any chance of

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.616
saving his son - telling the Germans:

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:29.646
"You have in your hands not only my

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.506
son Yakov but millions of my sons.

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:35.466
Either you free them all or

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:37.966
my son will share their fate."

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:42.296
According to Yakov’s cellmate, it was

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:44.536
the news that his father rejected the

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.056
swap that triggered his attempt to escape

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.906
from Sachsenhausen concentration camp, an

00:03:49.936 --> 00:03:52.546
attempt that would prove to be suicidal.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:57.926
On the evening of April 14th, 1943, Yakov

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:00.686
made a run for the camp fence, calling

00:04:00.686 --> 00:04:03.536
out to the SS guards: "Don't be a coward.

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:04.966
Shoot, shoot."

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.026
When Yakov reached the outer

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:09.936
fence, he was shot dead.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:13.646
This story is just one of many that

00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:15.656
underlines Stalin’s ruthlessness

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:18.866
and inhumanity, an inhumanity

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:21.006
that he would excuse and explain

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.956
as being only in the interests

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.106
of his country, of Mother Russia.

00:04:25.886 --> 00:04:27.816
So, where did it all start?

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:30.686
Well, as Stalin’s name carries

00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:32.906
such historical weight, it might

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:35.016
surprise you to find out that it

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:37.126
wasn’t actually his real name.

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:41.173
Joseph Stalin was actually born Joseph

00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:43.466
Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili on the

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:47.216
18th of December 1878 in Georgia, which

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:49.426
was then part of the Russian empire.

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.846
I’ll call him Stalin from now on, not

00:04:52.846 --> 00:04:54.526
just because it’s easier for me to

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.766
say than Dzhugashvili, but because

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:58.526
it’s how most of the world knows him.

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:01.606
And by the way, don’t worry, we’ll find

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:03.366
out where he got that name from shortly.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.546
Now, the young Stalin grew up in poverty.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.456
His mother was a washerwoman,

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:11.846
and his father a cobbler,

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:14.516
someone who repairs shoes, and a

00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:16.406
violent alcoholic who beat him.

00:05:17.406 --> 00:05:19.446
When he was seven years old, Stalin

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:21.586
caught smallpox and was left with

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.947
acne scarring and a deformed left arm.

00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:27.696
He was bullied at school, and in

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:30.816
1894 Stalin’s mother sent him to

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.606
Tiflis, modern Tbilisi, the Georgian

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:35.766
capital, to train as a priest.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.646
During his time there, however,

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:41.586
Stalin began reading not the religious

00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:43.246
scriptures that he was supposed to

00:05:43.256 --> 00:05:45.666
be studying, but the writings of the

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:48.216
grandfather of communism, Karl Marx.

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:52.176
He joined a local socialist group, and

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:54.296
spent most of his time getting involved

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:57.156
in revolutionary, anti-monarchy politics.

00:05:57.686 --> 00:06:00.339
He turned his back on religion, becoming

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.019
an atheist, and by 1899 he had been

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.029
thrown out of the seminary because

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:08.029
he didn’t show up for his exams.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.659
And in December of 1899, when he

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.339
was 21, Stalin took his first and

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.899
only non-political job, working as

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.289
a clerk in the Tiflis Observatory.

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:23.779
The job wasn’t particularly demanding,

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.259
which allowed him to be active in

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.459
revolutionary politics, organising

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.176
strikes and protests, and becoming

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:33.506
well-known to the Tsarist secret police.

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:37.196
And he was no stranger to being

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.606
caught, arrested, by the authorities.

00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:43.876
Between April 1902 and March 1913,

00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:46.186
Stalin was arrested seven times.

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:49.376
He would join the Bolshevik party

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:52.516
in 1903, and first met Lenin,

00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.706
the Bolshevik leader, at a party

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:57.586
conference held in Finland in 1905.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.476
Lenin was immediately impressed by

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:03.766
the young Stalin, who he saw to be

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:06.166
a 'ruthless underground operator.’

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:10.186
And it turned out that Lenin was right.

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:13.856
Ruthless, meaning “showing no pity or

00:07:13.856 --> 00:07:16.139
compassion for others”, is certainly a

00:07:16.327 --> 00:07:19.206
word we can use to describe Joseph Stalin.

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:22.646
During this period, he developed a

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:25.806
reputation as a dependable, hardworking

00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:28.046
man skilled in the ‘day to day’

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:29.976
work of revolutionary politics.

00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:33.325
He was never a great public speaker,

00:07:33.515 --> 00:07:35.605
nor a man of great ideas like the

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.670
Russian Revolution's two intellectual

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.870
leaders, Lenin and Trotsky, but Stalin

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.260
was willing to risk arrest every single

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.060
day by organising workers, printing

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.470
and circulating illegal literature, and

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.860
robbing trains to support the cause.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.800
While Lenin and other more ideological

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.590
revolutionaries lived abroad and

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.310
wrote books about class and Soviet

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.104
society, Stalin was on the ground

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.304
at the forefront of the difficult,

00:08:04.524 --> 00:08:07.054
dangerous, and less glorious work

00:08:07.084 --> 00:08:09.304
that built the basis of revolution.

00:08:10.544 --> 00:08:13.474
For example, in 1907, he robbed a

00:08:13.474 --> 00:08:16.864
bank in Tiflis, stealing 250,000

00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:19.354
rubles [which is around three and a

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.374
half million Euros in today’s money].

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.250
But the money wasn’t for him, it was to

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.200
help fund the fledgling socialist cause.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.550
After the bank robbery, Stalin

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.063
escaped to Baku, in Azerbaijan,

00:08:33.343 --> 00:08:35.453
and it was around this time that he

00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:37.583
adopted the name he would be known

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.013
as for the rest of his life: Stalin

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:42.753
- the Russian for “man of steel”.

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:46.523
Some say he chose it for its meaning,

00:08:46.863 --> 00:08:48.723
and others because he also wanted

00:08:48.723 --> 00:08:51.353
a memorable pseudonym like Lenin,

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:53.603
whose real name, just in case

00:08:53.603 --> 00:08:55.398
you weren’t aware, was Vladimir

00:08:55.526 --> 00:08:58.033
Ilyich Ulyanov, not Vladimir Lenin.

00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:01.903
Interestingly, Stalin had previously

00:09:01.903 --> 00:09:03.993
gone by another pseudonym in the

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.833
past: Koba, believed to be named

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:09.013
after a Robin Hood type character

00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:11.293
in a 19th century Georgian novel.

00:09:12.043 --> 00:09:14.333
With his bank robbing history, this

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.173
certainly seems fitting, appropiate,

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:19.843
but it was to be Stalin that stuck.

00:09:21.063 --> 00:09:23.473
After developing his reputation as a

00:09:23.473 --> 00:09:26.813
ruthless operator, in 1912 he got his

00:09:26.813 --> 00:09:29.343
first big political job when Lenin

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:31.593
asked him to serve on the first Central

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:33.293
Committee of the Bolshevik Party.

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:37.303
The next few years saw him continue his

00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:39.883
rise in the Bolshevik party, but the one

00:09:39.903 --> 00:09:42.453
episode I want to highlight is a brief

00:09:42.493 --> 00:09:46.093
period in 1913 when he lived in Vienna.

00:09:47.043 --> 00:09:49.108
Amazingly, during his time there

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:50.973
he lived in the same part of

00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:53.503
the city, at the same time, as

00:09:53.633 --> 00:09:56.523
Hitler, Trotsky, and Sigmund Freud.

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:59.743
It’s not completely beyond the realms

00:09:59.743 --> 00:10:02.213
of possibility to imagine that all

00:10:02.263 --> 00:10:04.463
these four men might have even been

00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:06.563
in the same cafe at the same time,

00:10:06.843 --> 00:10:08.983
completely unknown to each other.

00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:12.033
Shortly after returning from Vienna,

00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:14.613
he was arrested and sent to Siberia,

00:10:14.773 --> 00:10:16.983
where he was exiled for four years.

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:19.893
When he eventually got out, in

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:23.293
1917, he returned to St Petersburg

00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:25.903
and found a revolutionary energy

00:10:26.113 --> 00:10:27.483
rippling across the country.

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:31.123
The events of the next few years not

00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:33.453
only altered Russian history forever,

00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:35.763
but the political fortunes of Stalin

00:10:35.763 --> 00:10:38.813
himself, as he went from a respected and

00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:41.553
committed political operator on the ground

00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:44.403
to the inner circle of Bolshevik power.

00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:48.143
When the Russian Revolution began in

00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:51.693
November 1917, Stalin was active as

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.003
both a political and military leader.

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.673
He fought in the Russian Civil War,

00:10:56.903 --> 00:10:59.103
and took up important ministerial

00:10:59.103 --> 00:11:01.333
posts in the new Bolshevik government.

00:11:02.573 --> 00:11:05.293
His reputation continued to grow after

00:11:05.293 --> 00:11:06.943
he helped Lenin to escape from the

00:11:06.943 --> 00:11:09.703
Tsar’s army into Finland, and as a

00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:11.903
reward he was brought into the inner

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:13.893
circle of Bolshevik party power.

00:11:15.273 --> 00:11:17.963
Yet, despite his important role in the

00:11:18.163 --> 00:11:20.933
revolution, Stalin hadn’t established

00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:23.463
himself as a charismatic speaker, or

00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:25.633
someone with leadership potential.

00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:28.963
In his memoirs of the revolution,

00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:31.683
the historian Nikolai Sukhanov,

00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:34.633
described Stalin as "a grey blur,

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:37.283
emitting a dim light every now and

00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:39.973
then and not leaving any trace."

00:11:41.043 --> 00:11:43.643
Despite his lack of charisma, his

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:46.403
dullness, at the 11th Party Congress

00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:50.303
in 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the

00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:53.163
party's new General Secretary, and this

00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:55.303
gave him the chance to appoint his own

00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:57.993
staff - and those loyal to him - through

00:11:57.993 --> 00:12:00.683
the party and build up his own power base.

00:12:01.873 --> 00:12:04.783
Stalin loyalists were generally newer

00:12:04.993 --> 00:12:07.103
Communist Party members, often from

00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:09.583
working-class or peasant backgrounds

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:12.123
like he was, as opposed to the "Old

00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:14.523
Bolsheviks" who were generally more

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.863
middle class and university educated.

00:12:17.993 --> 00:12:22.063
Then, in January 1924, Vladimir Lenin, the

00:12:22.063 --> 00:12:24.773
father of the Russian Revolution, died.

00:12:25.673 --> 00:12:27.913
He failed to nominate a successor,

00:12:28.303 --> 00:12:30.563
and as a result his death set

00:12:30.573 --> 00:12:32.353
in motion a prolonged period of

00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:34.377
ruthless political manoeuvring.

00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:38.103
Stalin tried desperately to position

00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:40.263
himself, but there was another,

00:12:40.483 --> 00:12:42.726
more charismatic candidate, the

00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:45.286
leader of the Red Army and Stalin’s

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.656
long time rival, Leon Trotsky.

00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:51.086
Now, there have been entire books written

00:12:51.226 --> 00:12:53.766
on why Stalin beat Trotsky to the top

00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:56.896
job, but suffice it to say that it was a

00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:59.916
combination of trickery, Trotsky’s over

00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:02.616
confidence, and Stalin’s ruthlessness.

00:13:03.796 --> 00:13:07.286
By 1926, Stalin’s supporters had

00:13:07.296 --> 00:13:09.866
voted Trotsky out of the Politburo,

00:13:10.366 --> 00:13:13.566
then the Communist Party in 1927, and

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:16.848
then from the entire country in 1929.

00:13:17.836 --> 00:13:20.296
But Stalin wasn’t content to let

00:13:20.296 --> 00:13:22.396
his enemies and rivals simply

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:24.476
“leave” the country and live out

00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:26.006
the rest of their lives in peace.

00:13:26.896 --> 00:13:30.146
In 1936, Trotsky was granted political

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:33.046
asylum in Mexico but was found guilty

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:35.316
of treason in a Soviet court during

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:37.656
Stalin’s purge of his political opponents.

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:41.096
And he certainly wasn’t safe in Mexico.

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:44.606
On the 20th of August, 1940, he was

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.256
murdered on Stalin’s orders, with an

00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:50.056
ice-pick no less, making clear that you

00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:52.326
could never escape from Joseph Stalin.

00:13:53.606 --> 00:13:56.806
After seeing off, or dealing with, several

00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:58.956
challenges to his power from factional

00:13:58.976 --> 00:14:01.606
groups within the party and arresting,

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.556
exiling or murdering any remaining

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:08.566
rivals, by 1929 Stalin had established

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:11.126
himself as the supreme leader of the

00:14:11.126 --> 00:14:14.426
party, dictator of the Soviet Union, and

00:14:14.516 --> 00:14:17.566
a man with a violent sense of revenge.

00:14:18.986 --> 00:14:21.066
With the political infighting behind

00:14:21.066 --> 00:14:23.926
him and his power firmly established,

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:27.006
Stalin began to focus on domestic policy.

00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:28.826
What would come of the

00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:31.126
revolution, and Lenin’s legacy?

00:14:31.616 --> 00:14:33.026
What would Stalin do with all

00:14:33.026 --> 00:14:34.666
that revolutionary energy?

00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:37.986
Well, in the late-1920s, the

00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:39.926
Soviet Union was still an

00:14:39.926 --> 00:14:42.676
incredibly poor, agrarian society.

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:46.206
If the Soviet Union did not grow and

00:14:46.396 --> 00:14:48.846
modernise, Stalin feared, communism

00:14:48.986 --> 00:14:50.716
would collapse and the country

00:14:50.866 --> 00:14:53.096
would be overrun by capitalists.

00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:56.486
He put into place a series of

00:14:56.496 --> 00:15:00.266
5-year-plans, huge national initiatives

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.506
to grow and modernise the economy,

00:15:02.796 --> 00:15:04.656
with the objective of turning it

00:15:04.826 --> 00:15:07.406
into a modern industrial powerhouse.

00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:11.176
After a promising start, including

00:15:11.306 --> 00:15:13.986
huge increases in coal, oil, and

00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:16.286
steel production, it became clear

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:19.506
that these plans were terribly flawed.

00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:22.456
The “central planning” and

00:15:22.656 --> 00:15:24.296
“collectivisation” of this period

00:15:24.546 --> 00:15:27.006
caused food shortages and famines,

00:15:27.236 --> 00:15:29.736
and there was a massive human

00:15:29.736 --> 00:15:31.636
cost to Stalin’s initiatives.

00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:34.416
In the first five-year-plan

00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:36.496
alone, it’s estimated that

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:38.886
up to 8 million people died.

00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:42.706
Stalin was aware of this, of course,

00:15:42.896 --> 00:15:45.566
but appears to have concluded that this

00:15:45.596 --> 00:15:48.806
was the acceptable human cost to pay for

00:15:48.806 --> 00:15:50.986
the modernisation of the Soviet Union.

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.776
There’s a quote that is often attributed

00:15:54.776 --> 00:15:58.166
to Josef Stalin, of “one death is a

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:00.976
tragedy, a million is a statistic”.

00:16:01.736 --> 00:16:03.886
Now, there is actually no historical

00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:06.236
evidence that he said this, but his

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:08.586
actions certainly suggest that he

00:16:08.596 --> 00:16:09.886
wouldn’t have disagreed with it.

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:13.576
And although he was the supreme

00:16:13.586 --> 00:16:15.977
leader of the country and had already

00:16:15.977 --> 00:16:18.237
dispatched anyone who dared to oppose

00:16:18.237 --> 00:16:22.117
him, during the mid-to-late-1930s,

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:24.947
Stalin grew increasingly insecure

00:16:24.947 --> 00:16:27.037
and paranoid in his position.

00:16:28.477 --> 00:16:30.497
He feared that factions of the

00:16:30.497 --> 00:16:32.497
Communist Party and Army were

00:16:32.697 --> 00:16:35.022
conspiring, or plotting, against him,

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:37.797
and he began a ruthless political

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.847
purge that made his behaviour in

00:16:39.847 --> 00:16:43.467
the late-1920s seem tame, or soft.

00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:50.047
From 1936 to 1939, 93 of the Communist

00:16:50.057 --> 00:16:53.177
Party’s 139 Central Committee members

00:16:53.267 --> 00:16:57.287
were killed, and 81 of Stalin’s 103

00:16:57.287 --> 00:17:00.027
generals and admirals were executed.

00:17:01.337 --> 00:17:05.537
Stalin’s secret police, the NKVD, ruled

00:17:05.697 --> 00:17:09.137
with an iron first and encouraged Soviets

00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:12.427
to inform on one another, accusing as many

00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:15.337
as 3 million people of opposing Communism.

00:17:16.607 --> 00:17:19.567
There were extensive show trials,

00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:21.967
theoretically “free” trials of

00:17:22.147 --> 00:17:24.107
political opponents, but they were

00:17:24.117 --> 00:17:26.387
essentially predetermined public

00:17:26.397 --> 00:17:28.767
trials of anyone who opposed Stalin,

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.167
which would almost always result in

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:33.097
the execution of the guilty party.

00:17:34.327 --> 00:17:37.757
And for those simply sent away, most were

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:40.867
sent to the gulag, a collection of labour

00:17:40.867 --> 00:17:42.927
camps in Siberia, where it’s thought

00:17:42.977 --> 00:17:46.657
that around 750,000 people were killed.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.317
Now we should move from Stalin’s domestic

00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:53.027
policy to his foreign, and perhaps

00:17:53.027 --> 00:17:55.127
the thing - besides the famines and

00:17:55.127 --> 00:17:56.957
purges - that he is most remembered

00:17:56.957 --> 00:17:59.837
for, the Second World War, and the

00:17:59.837 --> 00:18:02.627
Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazism.

00:18:03.537 --> 00:18:06.227
Now, as you’ll know, Hitler and

00:18:06.237 --> 00:18:08.817
Stalin were initially allies,

00:18:08.847 --> 00:18:10.487
or at least, not enemies.

00:18:11.627 --> 00:18:14.177
On the 24th of August, 1939,

00:18:14.475 --> 00:18:16.974
shortly before the Nazis marched

00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:19.984
into Poland, Hitler and Stalin made

00:18:19.984 --> 00:18:22.404
a non-aggression agreement, known

00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:24.204
as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

00:18:24.964 --> 00:18:27.944
Put simply, this meant that the Soviets

00:18:28.124 --> 00:18:30.974
and Germans agreed not to attack one

00:18:30.974 --> 00:18:33.224
another and that they would divide the

00:18:33.224 --> 00:18:36.194
countries between them, carving up Poland.

00:18:37.424 --> 00:18:39.954
This “non-aggression” would last

00:18:39.984 --> 00:18:41.974
almost two years, before Hitler

00:18:42.124 --> 00:18:44.334
decided to go back on the pact,

00:18:44.554 --> 00:18:46.834
launching the invasion of Russia with

00:18:46.974 --> 00:18:50.847
Operation Barbarossa in June of 1941.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.994
And he caught the Soviets by

00:18:53.994 --> 00:18:56.365
surprise, completely unprepared.

00:18:57.004 --> 00:18:59.334
Stalin had reportedly been advised

00:18:59.484 --> 00:19:02.124
as early as 1940 that the Nazis

00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:04.254
had been planning to invade, but

00:19:04.404 --> 00:19:06.714
had shrugged off these warnings.

00:19:07.504 --> 00:19:09.434
He was furious at Hitler's

00:19:09.434 --> 00:19:12.544
betrayal but did nothing, or very

00:19:12.544 --> 00:19:14.414
little at least, for a few days.

00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:19.394
As Stalin hid away and thought about what

00:19:19.394 --> 00:19:22.242
to do next, the Soviet Union waited as

00:19:22.242 --> 00:19:25.023
the Nazi army advanced towards Moscow.

00:19:26.343 --> 00:19:29.103
Now, as you may know, this turning

00:19:29.133 --> 00:19:31.653
on the Soviet Union was to be a grave

00:19:31.863 --> 00:19:33.783
error of judgement on Hitler’s part,

00:19:34.203 --> 00:19:36.303
a decision that changed the course of

00:19:36.303 --> 00:19:39.123
World War II, and with it, world history.

00:19:40.353 --> 00:19:42.943
Suffice it to say that it was hugely

00:19:43.023 --> 00:19:45.243
bloody, with the Battle of Stalingrad

00:19:45.473 --> 00:19:48.233
killing a staggering 19,000 people

00:19:48.263 --> 00:19:51.863
a day, a total of 1.2 million people

00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:55.713
Eventually, as you will know, it proved

00:19:55.853 --> 00:19:57.743
to be too much, and the Soviets were

00:19:57.753 --> 00:20:00.353
able to push the Nazi forces all the way

00:20:00.363 --> 00:20:04.113
back to Berlin in 1945, resulting in the

00:20:04.123 --> 00:20:06.223
eventual surrender of the German army.

00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:09.883
OK, that is a whistle stop tour of

00:20:09.883 --> 00:20:12.013
the Second World War, but we must

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:14.763
leave time for the postwar era, the

00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:17.773
era where Stalin went from ally of

00:20:17.773 --> 00:20:20.243
the West to public enemy number one.

00:20:21.403 --> 00:20:22.814
It’s important to remember

00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:25.123
Stalin’s early years, and his

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:27.213
dedication to the socialist cause.

00:20:27.813 --> 00:20:30.823
Yes, he had allied with the Allied

00:20:30.823 --> 00:20:32.863
forces, including Britain and the

00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:35.403
United States, but he believed in a

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:38.033
vastly different ideological system.

00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:42.323
They were allies in name only, and

00:20:42.473 --> 00:20:44.673
with their mutual enemy Adolf Hitler

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.423
out of the picture, there was the

00:20:46.423 --> 00:20:49.113
question of how to rebuild, and how

00:20:49.113 --> 00:20:51.383
to divide, the remains of Europe.

00:20:52.573 --> 00:20:54.633
Stalin sensed his opportunity.

00:20:55.353 --> 00:20:57.523
He demanded that the countries surrounding

00:20:57.523 --> 00:21:00.103
the Soviet Union should become socialist

00:21:00.113 --> 00:21:02.363
satellite states, swallowing up much

00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:05.193
of Eastern Europe into the USSR, and

00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:07.333
putting up what Winston Churchill

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:10.003
would call an “iron curtain” between

00:21:10.003 --> 00:21:12.263
the USSR and the rest of Europe.

00:21:13.733 --> 00:21:16.373
After all of this territorial expansion,

00:21:16.763 --> 00:21:19.343
Stalin found himself ruling over almost

00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:22.493
200 million people living in the USSR.

00:21:23.343 --> 00:21:24.793
He was more popular than ever,

00:21:25.163 --> 00:21:27.283
after having defeated the Nazis,

00:21:27.363 --> 00:21:29.733
but he was still deeply nervous

00:21:29.773 --> 00:21:31.883
and paranoid about his position.

00:21:32.853 --> 00:21:34.833
Literally millions of people were

00:21:35.023 --> 00:21:38.253
imprisoned or executed, and by one

00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:42.663
estimate, by 1953 three percent of the

00:21:42.663 --> 00:21:45.903
entire USSR population was imprisoned.

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:49.783
1953 would be an important year for

00:21:49.783 --> 00:21:51.733
Stalin for another reason, though.

00:21:53.013 --> 00:21:55.593
Stalin had always enjoyed a drink, he had

00:21:55.703 --> 00:21:58.433
been a heavy drinker, and had reportedly

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:02.163
stayed up until 3am in 1942 with Winston

00:22:02.163 --> 00:22:04.083
Churchill, the British Prime Minister.

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:08.893
But on the 5th of March, 1953, at the

00:22:08.893 --> 00:22:12.073
age of 74, it seemed he couldn’t keep up.

00:22:12.893 --> 00:22:14.793
He had been drinking heavily,

00:22:15.113 --> 00:22:17.093
and the following day, when his

00:22:17.093 --> 00:22:19.293
attendants came into his room, they

00:22:19.293 --> 00:22:21.763
found him sprawled out on the floor.

00:22:22.823 --> 00:22:24.453
Initially, they thought he was

00:22:24.453 --> 00:22:26.993
just in a bad way after drinking

00:22:26.993 --> 00:22:29.143
lots of alcohol, but it turned

00:22:29.143 --> 00:22:32.113
out that he had had a huge stroke.

00:22:33.563 --> 00:22:37.423
On 6 March 1953, the announcement went

00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:39.823
out to the people of the Soviet Union.

00:22:40.733 --> 00:22:42.753
Josef Stalin was dead.

00:22:44.173 --> 00:22:45.703
It was, to state the

00:22:45.703 --> 00:22:47.953
obvious, a monumental event.

00:22:48.603 --> 00:22:50.373
He had held an iron grip on the

00:22:50.373 --> 00:22:52.753
country for almost 30 years,

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:55.603
enacting huge changes on the country.

00:22:56.423 --> 00:22:57.793
And now he was gone.

00:22:59.213 --> 00:23:00.833
In the aftermath of his

00:23:00.833 --> 00:23:02.903
death, his successor, Nikita

00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:04.493
Khrushchev, denounced him.

00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:07.763
He criticised the cult of personality that

00:23:07.763 --> 00:23:10.833
Stalin had created, his totalitarianism,

00:23:11.043 --> 00:23:14.123
the gulags, the executions, imprisonment

00:23:14.153 --> 00:23:16.433
and torture of political opponents,

00:23:16.693 --> 00:23:19.063
blaming Stalin for the millions of young

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.583
Soviets who had died at war, and the

00:23:21.583 --> 00:23:23.593
millions that had starved because of

00:23:23.593 --> 00:23:26.233
his disastrous agricultural policies.

00:23:27.103 --> 00:23:28.593
And he pledged to start the

00:23:28.853 --> 00:23:30.863
"de-stalinization" of the country,

00:23:31.183 --> 00:23:33.183
a process that some might argue

00:23:33.183 --> 00:23:34.943
has never really finished.

00:23:35.943 --> 00:23:38.573
Indeed, Vladimir Putin has, in recent

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:41.443
years, gone on a campaign to rehabilitate

00:23:41.443 --> 00:23:44.333
Stalin, and clearly his invasion of

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:47.323
Ukraine at the start of 2022 shows

00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:50.343
Stalin-like expansionist tendencies.

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:54.193
Now, when it comes to any assessment

00:23:54.193 --> 00:23:57.463
of the legacy of Joseph Stalin, on

00:23:57.513 --> 00:23:59.673
one level, it's a complicated one.

00:24:00.493 --> 00:24:02.913
Especially in the immediate aftermath

00:24:02.923 --> 00:24:05.403
of his death, to many within the Soviet

00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:07.773
Union he was remembered as a great

00:24:07.803 --> 00:24:09.993
leader who modernised the country,

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:12.883
taking it from a backward, feudal

00:24:12.913 --> 00:24:16.043
economy into an industrial and military

00:24:16.053 --> 00:24:18.303
power capable of defeating Hitler.

00:24:19.403 --> 00:24:21.473
To much of the rest of the world,

00:24:21.473 --> 00:24:24.137
however, he is remembered as a ruthless

00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:27.257
dictator, a man who some historians

00:24:27.357 --> 00:24:29.967
have said bears personal responsibility

00:24:30.207 --> 00:24:33.157
for the deaths of 20 million people.

00:24:34.177 --> 00:24:36.677
He is a man who, with his favourite

00:24:36.787 --> 00:24:39.117
little blue pencil, would stay up late

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:41.687
into the night and then write “execute

00:24:41.727 --> 00:24:44.447
them all” on an official document, with

00:24:44.507 --> 00:24:47.377
one stroke of his pencil committing tens

00:24:47.587 --> 00:24:49.657
of thousands of people to their deaths.

00:24:50.797 --> 00:24:53.287
No matter what his intentions might

00:24:53.287 --> 00:24:55.807
have been, it’s clear that he was a man

00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:58.597
who was prepared to murder, torture and

00:24:58.607 --> 00:25:01.517
sacrifice millions of Soviets - whether it

00:25:01.547 --> 00:25:03.987
be people starving to death in famine, or

00:25:04.157 --> 00:25:07.147
even his own son - to get what he wanted.

00:25:10.017 --> 00:25:12.177
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:14.077
episode on Joseph Stalin, one

00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:15.687
of the twentieth-century’s most

00:25:15.687 --> 00:25:17.807
ruthless leaders and part one

00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:19.907
on our mini-series on dictators.

00:25:20.367 --> 00:25:21.697
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:23.477
and whether you knew a lot about

00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:25.707
Stalin, or this was the first time

00:25:25.707 --> 00:25:27.837
you’d really got into his story, well

00:25:27.977 --> 00:25:29.287
I hope you learned something new.

00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:32.157
As always, I would love to know

00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:33.557
what you thought about this episode.

00:25:34.257 --> 00:25:37.147
If you live in the former USSR, how

00:25:37.147 --> 00:25:39.327
did you learn about Stalin in school?

00:25:39.777 --> 00:25:41.577
How do you think the legacy of

00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:43.537
Joseph Stalin is still felt today?

00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:46.267
I would love to know, so let’s

00:25:46.267 --> 00:25:47.657
get this discussion started.

00:25:48.007 --> 00:25:49.037

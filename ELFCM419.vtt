Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.890
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.935
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:26.285
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Messiah, the promised one.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:30.635
But, don’t worry, this is not going to be a religious episode.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:34.225
In fact, we’re not really going to talk about the Messiah at all.

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:39.122
Instead, we will explore the stories of various people throughout history

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:44.506
who have claimed to be the messiah, anointed by God to save mankind.

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:48.736
And as we’ll see, it doesn’t tend to end very well.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:52.026
Ok then, let’s get right into it.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:59.376
In the classic 1979 Monty Python film, The Life of Brian, there is a

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:04.786
famous scene where the main character, Brian, is hiding in his house.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:13.646
Outside the window is a crowd chanting his name, saying “there he is, the chosen one has spoken”.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:20.656
Brian’s mother is furious, and she asks her son what on Earth is going on.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:26.086
She then sticks her head out of the window to the crowd chanting

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:31.696
“messiah” and shouts “he’s not the messiah, he’s a very naughty boy.

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.036
Now go away!”

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:39.706
It is one of the classic lines in British comedy, and if you haven’t

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:43.626
ever watched The Life of Brian, perhaps you should pause this episode

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:47.486
right now and go and watch it, because it is just a brilliant film.

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:53.746
Now, in the film the character Brian wasn’t the Messiah, he was

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:58.356
a normal man who people had mistakenly identified as the messiah.

00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:04.646
But throughout history there are plenty of people who have claimed to actually

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:10.016
have been the Messiah, to have been sent by some form of God to save mankind.

00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:16.976
Before we get into their individual stories, we should start with a brief definition

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:22.386
of what “the messiah” means, as it might be slightly different to what you think.

00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:27.686
In most dictionaries you’ll find two definitions.

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:33.886
One will be something like “Jesus Christ”, and the other will be something

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:38.816
along the lines of “the promised and expected deliverer of the Jewish people”.

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:45.586
And to remind you of an important distinction, Jesus was Jewish but he is not

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:51.286
considered to be “The Messiah” in Judaism, although he is the Messiah in Christianity.

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:57.996
Right, that is the first and last bit of theology we’ll cover in this episode, but the

00:02:57.996 --> 00:03:03.876
reason to mention it is to remind you that “the Messiah” does not always refer to Jesus.

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:11.576
Much more interesting than a theological discussion, or at least much more weird and unusual, is

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:17.296
to talk about some of the more controversial recent figures who have claimed that they are either

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:24.606
a reincarnation of Jesus Christ himself, some kind of relation, or a general Messiah-type figure.

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:30.556
This little Messiah expedition will take us from Manchester

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:35.396
to the United States, China to Korea and even to Siberia.

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:38.866
And it is full of eccentric characters.

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:45.896
Our first messiah-like figure is slightly unusual in that it is a woman.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:51.046
For reasons that psychologists and sociologists would no doubt have

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:55.806
plenty of explanations for, deciding that you are Christ reincarnated

00:03:56.176 --> 00:03:59.856
seems to be something that is more common in men than women.

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:05.366
But a woman called Ann Lee was an exception to this rule.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:12.426
She was born in Manchester, in England, in 1736, and at the age of

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:18.146
22, she joined a Protestant Christian sect called the Shaking Quakers.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:26.536
The Shaking Quakers were similar to The Quakers, but they were called “Shaking” Quakers

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:32.956
because they believed that you could purify yourself by doing a kind of shaking dance.

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:40.983
One of their core beliefs was that God would return to Earth in the form of a woman.

00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:48.333
And this woman, they soon started to believe, was none other than Ann Lee.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:54.113
It seems that she started to believe this herself, as she started

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:58.243
to preach that she had been sent by God, she was the Messiah.

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:04.543
Her core belief, and the message that was most prominent in her teachings,

00:05:04.883 --> 00:05:10.633
was to abstain from, to not engage in, all forms of sexual relations.

00:05:11.553 --> 00:05:16.643
She believed that sexual contact was the original sin that Adam and Eve had

00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:22.463
committed, and by avoiding all forms of sex, one could attain salvation.

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:27.823
Ann Lee had learned this the hard way, or at least she

00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:31.073
had come to this conclusion through personal experience.

00:05:32.213 --> 00:05:38.393
She had got married, and had fallen pregnant four times, but each one had resulted in

00:05:38.393 --> 00:05:44.123
a miscarriage, which one imagines would explain her view that sex was evil and sinful.

00:05:45.418 --> 00:05:50.003
As her followers grew, she found herself coming up against the law

00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:54.983
multiple times, and was arrested and sent to prison on numerous occasions.

00:05:56.443 --> 00:06:03.033
To try to escape what she saw as religious persecution, she set sail for the land of

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:08.808
the free, America, basing herself in New York State and recruiting new members to her

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:13.503
updated version of the “Shaking Quakers”, who were now simply called the “Shakers”.

00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:21.663
The group did grow, peaking at around 6,000 members, but it struggled to grow much past this.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:27.333
For a cult to grow its members need to multiply, to have children,

00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:31.493
but the problem was that sex was prohibited for the Shakers.

00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:38.583
Members had to adopt children, and the fact that you had to give up all sexual relations if you

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:43.823
wanted to join the group, well, it can’t have been a huge attraction to potential new members.

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:51.243
And Lee, like several of the other characters we’ll hear about today, found herself not

00:06:51.303 --> 00:06:56.333
only on the wrong side of the law but also coming up against some members of the public

00:06:56.553 --> 00:07:01.583
who were not so sympathetic to her message, and her claim that she was the Messiah.

00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:08.853
Not only did The Shakers face abuse and intimidation from members of the public, but Lee was

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:16.633
physically attacked multiple times, and ended up dying from her injuries in 1784, at the age of 48.

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:21.763
Now, moving on, we need to cross the Pacific for our next

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:25.863
Messiah figure, and we also need to skip forward a few decades.

00:07:27.273 --> 00:07:34.533
Hong Xiuquan was a man born in 1814 to a poor farming family in Guangdong, in Southern China.

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:40.813
He was very intelligent, and had grand ambitions of becoming a civil servant,

00:07:41.123 --> 00:07:45.743
a job which would have brought great honour not only to him but to his family.

00:07:47.053 --> 00:07:51.623
The problem was, becoming a bureaucrat was notoriously difficult.

00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:59.003
You needed to sit a government exam, and only around 1% of aspiring bureaucrats passed.

00:08:00.003 --> 00:08:03.513
Hong took the exam twice, but both times he failed.

00:08:04.043 --> 00:08:09.173
He tried again, and after the third time he was completely distraught, and

00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:14.183
had a nervous breakdown, which sent him into a mad, psychotic kind of state.

00:08:15.513 --> 00:08:19.483
When he finally recovered, he revealed that he had gone to heaven

00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:23.883
and discovered that he had an entirely different, heavenly family.

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:30.753
His heavenly father told him that people on Earth were worshipping demons, not him,

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:36.013
and Hong took this to mean that people were following the teachings of Confucius.

00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:40.789
This was in 1837, when Hong was 23.

00:08:41.683 --> 00:08:46.003
But he didn’t immediately pack everything in and decide that he was the Messiah.

00:08:46.653 --> 00:08:51.273
He actually took the civil service examinations one more time, six years

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:56.033
later, but after failing again, he decided that the heavenly father he had

00:08:56.033 --> 00:09:01.633
seen six years prior was God, and the heavenly brother was Jesus Christ.

00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:07.693
In other words, Hong Xiuquan was the brother of Christ, and he was

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:12.683
charged by his father, by God, with obliterating demon worship.

00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:18.023
Now, Hong was clearly a charismatic individual, handsome,

00:09:18.393 --> 00:09:21.958
eloquent and more than capable of attracting a crowd.

00:09:22.808 --> 00:09:28.638
He began preaching, he translated the Bible, and he developed his own twist on Christianity.

00:09:29.888 --> 00:09:35.238
He was initially thought of as something of a quack, an eccentric, by the authorities,

00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:41.688
but his message and his delivery were powerful enough to attract a significant following.

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:47.068
By 1850 his followers had swelled to somewhere between

00:09:47.068 --> 00:09:51.118
10 and 30 thousand, and he was deemed to be a threat.

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:57.258
Government forces raided his headquarters, the settlement where he and his followers were living,

00:09:57.468 --> 00:10:03.618
but Hong fought back, defeating the government forces and even beheading the commander of the army.

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:08.958
This was the start of a rebellion that would be called The Taiping Rebellion.

00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:14.238
It is such a good story that it certainly deserves its own full episode, but

00:10:14.478 --> 00:10:19.508
long story short, Hong came up against the full force of the Chinese government.

00:10:20.498 --> 00:10:26.718
This rebellion lasted for 14 years, resulted in anywhere from 20 to 30 million

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:31.778
deaths, and was a large factor in the eventual decline of the Qing Dynasty.

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:38.251
And in those 20 to 30 million deaths, as you might imagine, came Hong’s.

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:45.478
Hong and his followers were under siege in the city of Tianjing, or modern day Nanjing.

00:10:46.918 --> 00:10:52.618
With government forces approaching and supplies running low, he had been forced to eat weeds,

00:10:52.698 --> 00:10:58.378
which most probably killed him, although some historians have suggested that he killed himself.

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:04.598
In any case, he died, but the Chinese state wanted to punish him even

00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:10.678
in death, so his body was dug up from the grave, beheaded and burned, so

00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:14.808
that there was literally no trace of him for his followers to worship at.

00:11:16.378 --> 00:11:21.028
Now, our next messiah-like figure is also located in Asia, but

00:11:21.178 --> 00:11:25.248
this time we have to go a bit further north and east, to Korea.

00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:32.018
Our messiah-like figure here was called Sun Myung Moon, and he was born in

00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:37.288
1920 in modern day North Korea, which was under Japanese rule at the time.

00:11:38.758 --> 00:11:44.738
His family converted to Christianity when Moon was still a boy, and on Easter Sunday

00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:51.728
1936, when Moon was 16 years old, he claimed that he was visited by Jesus Christ.

00:11:52.848 --> 00:11:56.618
Jesus told Moon that Moon needed to continue the work

00:11:56.728 --> 00:11:59.938
that Jesus was unable to finish, because he was crucified.

00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:04.838
Jesus continued to come to Moon over a period of 9 years,

00:12:05.118 --> 00:12:08.468
revealing more about the mission that Moon was to be charged with.

00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:14.328
And in 1945, Moon published his manifesto, his beliefs

00:12:14.378 --> 00:12:17.388
one could say, in a text called “Divine Principle”.

00:12:18.298 --> 00:12:24.958
The added complication was that by 1945 Korea had been divided into two, North

00:12:25.068 --> 00:12:30.808
and South Korea, and by 1948 two completely separate countries had been formed.

00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:35.818
Moon was in what was then North Korea, and his religious

00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:39.808
teachings resulted in him being incarcerated in a labour camp.

00:12:40.548 --> 00:12:44.608
But in 1950 he was liberated by United Nations forces

00:12:44.838 --> 00:12:48.318
during the Korean war and he made his way to South Korea.

00:12:49.528 --> 00:12:54.598
It would be four years later, in 1954, that he founded his own religious

00:12:54.598 --> 00:12:59.838
movement, the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, or the

00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:04.958
Unification Church, or informally “The Moonies”, after the name of its founder.

00:13:06.108 --> 00:13:10.978
Now, the Unification Church is still around today, and estimates for

00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:15.558
membership are anywhere from a few hundred thousand to over 10 million.

00:13:16.768 --> 00:13:21.308
It is perhaps most famous for its mass wedding ceremonies, where

00:13:21.518 --> 00:13:25.948
thousands of couples are either married or blessed at the same time.

00:13:27.178 --> 00:13:32.338
See, one of the core tenets of the church, and of Moon’s teaching, was that

00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:37.648
marriage and the creation of a holy family are a fundamental part of redemption.

00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:44.198
Jesus Christ was unable to get married, as his life was cut short, so this

00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:49.938
job was left to Moon and his wife, who were the so-called “True Parents”.

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:55.538
And if you, like me, were a big fan of the Guinness Book of World Records,

00:13:55.818 --> 00:13:59.968
you might remember one record for the most people married at the same time.

00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:07.188
This was 35,000 couples, so 70,000 people, and this took place

00:14:07.328 --> 00:14:11.148
at one of these mass wedding ceremonies presided over by Moon.

00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:17.358
And unlike the previous two messiah-like figures, Moon went on to

00:14:17.358 --> 00:14:23.558
live a long and apparently happy life, dying in 2012 at the age of 92.

00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:29.618
Yes, as one might expect with the leader of what has been described as a cult by many,

00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:35.698
there were accusations of everything from sexual misconduct to tax evasion, but he was

00:14:35.698 --> 00:14:41.578
not beaten by an angry mob or his corpse dug up and beheaded like Ann Lee or Hong Xiuquan.

00:14:42.618 --> 00:14:48.468
Right, moving on to our last Messiah claimant, this is someone who is unusual because

00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:53.108
he is still alive, or at least was still alive at the time of making this episode.

00:14:53.648 --> 00:14:57.578
So, if you listen to this and think, hey, he does sound a bit like

00:14:57.578 --> 00:15:00.958
the Messiah, the good news is that he is still alive and well.

00:15:01.888 --> 00:15:07.008
The bad news is that he is being kept in a prison in Siberia, so you might

00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:11.968
rightly question whether he is well, or if he is indeed actually alive.

00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:18.158
His name is Sergei Anatolyevitch Torop, and he was born in 1961,

00:15:18.378 --> 00:15:22.510
in Krasnodar, in the Soviet Union, just north of the Black Sea.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.320
Just as the Soviet Union was about to have its big awakening, or at

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.830
least big transformation from communism to capitalism, so was Torop.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:39.270
In 1990, when he was 29, he declared that he had a spiritual

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.470
awakening, and that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:49.070
He formed his own church a year later, in 1991, and

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.380
rebranded himself as “Vissarion”, he who gives new life.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.800
He started to amass followers, who were attracted to his unique blend of the Russian

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:05.280
Orthodox Church, Buddhism, with some collectivism and veganism thrown in for good measure.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:12.790
As a follower of Vissarion, you give up meat, smoking, swearing, alcohol, and money.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:19.450
Said like this it sounds somewhat harmless, and peaceful, but there are some signs

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.390
that it is just as much about worshipping Vissarion himself as what he preaches.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.760
There is no Christmas, but you do celebrate Vissarion’s

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.720
birthday, which comes on January 14th by the way.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.360
Vissarion also claims that the end of the world is

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.660
coming, and that only his followers would be saved.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.110
He has been saying this since 1991 though, 30 years and counting,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.250
so there is probably not all that much to worry about on that count.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.930
And he also married a girl who has lived with him since she was seven years old, although

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.990
he did at least have the decency to wait until she was 19 until the pair got married.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:08.540
In any case, the Russian state certainly isn’t a big fan, declaring him to be a cult leader and

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.370
of having created, I quote, "a religious group whose activities may impose violence on citizens”.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.820
He was arrested in a raid on his compound in September

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.610
of 2020, and has been held in a prison ever since.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.740
So, there you have it, a quick whistle stop tour through four

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.570
very different people who have claimed to be the Messiah.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:38.570
We had Ann Lee, the lady from Manchester who claimed to be sent by God and instructed

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.610
her followers to abstain from all sexual activities, as they were the root of all evil.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:50.700
We had Hong Xiuquan, the Chinese peasant who failed his civil service exams and decided to launch

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:56.090
a full-scale rebellion against the Qing rulers instead of trying to pass on take number five.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.900
We had Sun Myung Moon, the Korean leader who claimed to be completing the work of Jesus

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.550
Christ, conducting marriage ceremonies of literally tens of thousands of couples, and a

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:13.050
man who sounds like he had very different views to Ann Lee when it came to sexual activity.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.800
And then we had Sergei Anatolyevitch Torop, or should I say Vissarion, the

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.790
Russian vegan who abolished Christmas and replaced it with his own birthday.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.170
Were they really the messiah, or were they simply charismatic

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.000
individuals who told a convincing tale to their gullible followers?

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.660
Well, to millions of people in the case of Hong and Moon, and a few thousand in

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.330
the case of Lee and Torop, yes, in fact, they most certainly were the messiah.

00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:46.080
But to everyone else, well, perhaps we can finish with the quote

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.090
we started off: “He’s not the messiah, he’s a very naughty boy”

00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:55.761
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration

00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:58.471
of four people who have claimed to be the messiah.

00:18:58.901 --> 00:19:02.511
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that

00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:06.361
it might have inspired you to learn more about all four of those individuals.

00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:10.231
We could have done standalone episodes on all four of them, so I

00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:13.321
hope you will forgive me if we glossed over some of the details.

00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:16.981
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:20.341
What other messiah-type figures have you heard about?

00:19:20.841 --> 00:19:23.221
How many of these four had you heard about before,

00:19:23.571 --> 00:19:26.241
and what do people think about them in your country?

00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:29.541
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:32.551

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:15.693
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:19.833
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:23.953
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:28.743
about a man called Harry Houdini, The Master of Escape.

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:33.113
He was, by many people’s standards, the most daring

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:37.003
magician in the world, and invented modern magic.

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.833
And his story is fascinating.

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:45.673
It involves magic, underwater escapes, elephants, locks, a keen

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:50.873
eye for publicity, a crusade against spiritualism and more.

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:58.443
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into the story of Harry Houdini.

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:05.633
On January 7th, 1918, at the Hippodrome theatre in

00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:09.663
New York City, the audience waited with bated breath.

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:16.513
On stage stood a short, stocky man wearing a formal black suit.

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:22.163
Behind him was a wooden box, a box that he had told his

00:01:22.163 --> 00:01:27.023
audience was eight feet square, less than one metre squared.

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:32.863
The box was raised off the ground, with a ramp leading up to it,

00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:36.643
so the audience could see that there were no hidden doors below.

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:40.443
And next to him was Jennie.

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:44.793
Jennie was not his petite assistant.

00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:50.883
She was a five-tonne elephant almost two and a half metres tall.

00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:56.113
The man had proudly declared that he could make the

00:01:56.163 --> 00:02:00.403
elephant disappear into thin air, vanish from sight.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.610
The man reached into a bag, taking out blocks of sugar and feeding

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.510
them to the elephant, leading her up the ramp into the box.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.080
After several minutes, he had succeeded at coaxing the elephant inside the box.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.310
The man slammed the door behind him, and a group of 30

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.840
strong men spun the box around, turning it on itself.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.670
Several minutes went by, and then the door was opened.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.410
The anxious audience looked inside.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.760
The elephant was gone, it had vanished into thin air.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.060
And to this very day, nobody knows for sure what happened, but keep listening until

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.640
the very end of the episode and I’ll tell you some of the theories about how he did it.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.360
The man’s name was, of course, Harry Houdini, the father of modern magic, the Master

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.820
of Escape, and by many people’s standards the most impressive magician in the world.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.260
But Houdini, as you’ll learn, was much more than just a magician.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.620
He was born in modern day Hungary, in 1874, but his parents

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.420
came to America when the young Harry was only four years old.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.570
I should say his real name wasn’t actually “Harry”, it wasn’t even “Houdini” - this

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.300
was a stage name, a name that he gave himself after the famous French magician,

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:41.210
Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin, someone who Houdini would model himself on.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.640
I’ll continue to call him Houdini or Harry, for sake of ease, but he

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.230
was born Erich Weisz, with his parents changing his name to the more

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.230
American-sounding “Erik Weiss” shortly after arriving in the United States.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.060
When he was growing up, his family was very poor, and the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.690
young Houdini was forced to work to help put food on the table.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.430
And from an early age, he showed an interest and talent for performing

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.710
- first circus tricks and acrobatics, and then basic magic tricks.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.940
He was also incredibly athletic, and excelled at sports.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.710
Given the physical nature of many of his tricks, and the strength that was required

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.690
to complete them, this would be something that would come in very useful later on.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.400
His career as a performer started when he was a mere nine years old, when he did trapeze

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.170
tricks, circus tricks, and when he was a teenager he would go on to perform magic tricks

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.050
with playing cards, teaming up with his brother Theodore to form “The Brothers Houdini”.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.500
By all accounts, he was a half-decent card magician, and could

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.100
do some quite impressive magic tricks, but he was far from great.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.580
What’s more, these jobs paid terribly, and he would hardly make enough money to survive.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.030
While he was working as a magician with his brother, the pair met a young woman called Bess.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.240
It was Theodore who initially showed interest in Bess, and the pair were romantically involved for

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.680
a while, but it didn’t take long for Bess’s attentions to switch to Erik, or rather, Harry Houdini.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.010
Not only did she fall in love with Houdini, with the pair marrying

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.450
in 1894, but she also replaced his brother as Houdini’s assistant.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.940
“The Brothers Houdini” were no longer; they were replaced by simply “The

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.350
Houdinis”, an act consisting of Harry Houdini and his new wife, Bess.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.520
The pair would continue their tour of low-budget shows, and it wouldn’t

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.260
be until five years later, in 1899, that they got their big break.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.360
A theatre manager had heard about one of Houdini’s new tricks, where he escaped from

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.950
handcuffs, and told him that he could offer him a long and reasonably well-paid contract.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.920
Houdini took the job, and before long he was one of the most in-demand magicians in the country.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.070
So, what tricks did he actually do, and why was he so successful?

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.480
At this point, his signature trick involved handcuffs, the metal lockable rings that are

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.220
placed around the wrists of suspected criminals to prevent them from moving their arms

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.030
.
Someone would place handcuffs on Houdini, and he would magically escape from the handcuffs.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.330
This is at a very basic level, and was not in itself unique.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.330
There were other magicians who could do this, normally by using fake or adapted handcuffs

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.820
that made removing them easy, or by not properly locking them, or all manner of tricks.

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:22.860
Houdini’s genius was to turn the entire escape into a spectacle,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.040
a public performance that really involved the audience.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.330
Instead of coming on stage and escaping from a pair of handcuffs that

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.800
he had brought with him, he would encourage the audience to bring their

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.400
own handcuffs and their own locks, which he would then escape from.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.760
Not only did this make the tricks, the stunts, all the more real, but it encouraged

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.560
people to come to the shows because they would want to test him with their own locks.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:01.870
When his tour arrived at a new town he would proudly challenge the local police, saying that he

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:09.260
would give $100 to anyone who could produce a pair of handcuffs that Houdini could not escape from.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.705
His fame continued to grow, with people flocking to his

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.170
shows to see how he could escape from…seemingly anything.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.950
His first big public test would come in 1904, when the British newspaper The Daily

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.690
Mirror had arranged a special series of shows for him in London’s Hippodrome.

00:08:33.104 --> 00:08:37.325
As per usual, people had brought their own locks and handcuffs to the

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:42.335
shows, and Houdini had escaped from all of them without major problems.

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:46.735
But then it came time for the main event.

00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:51.755
In preparation for the event, the newspaper had commissioned

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:55.095
a special pair of handcuffs to be made by a lockmaker.

00:08:56.415 --> 00:09:00.635
These handcuffs, so The Daily Mirror reported, had taken

00:09:00.655 --> 00:09:04.445
five years to make, and would be impossible to escape from.

00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:11.555
Or to quote the maker of the handcuffs, no mortal man could escape from them.

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:16.925
But was Harry Houdini a normal “mortal” man?

00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:18.355
That was the question…

00:09:19.415 --> 00:09:22.905
Houdini was led on stage and shown the handcuffs.

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:27.865
Ever the showman, he refused to attempt the trick not

00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:32.635
once, not twice, but three times, saying it was impossible.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:37.965
On the fourth time he agreed to try, telling the audience

00:09:38.405 --> 00:09:40.645
“I do not know whether I am going to get out or not.

00:09:40.855 --> 00:09:43.955
But I can assure you I am going to try my best.”

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:51.725
He was put in the handcuffs, the lock fastened and the 15 centimetre key removed.

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:59.315
He retreated into a small box, which he called his “ghost house”, to try to escape from the cuffs.

00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:04.075
The band started playing, the clock ticking.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:07.855
Minutes went by, with no sign of Houdini.

00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:14.487
Twenty two minutes later his face popped out, but the cuffs were still on.

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:19.585
He needed to take a better look at them, he said, so he held them up to the light.

00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:27.675
After thirty five minutes he emerged again, covered in sweat and visibly in distress,

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:33.325
but only to complain that his knees were sore, and could he have a cushion to kneel on.

00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:38.375
Shortly after he called out again to ask for the cuffs

00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:41.675
to be removed so that Houdini could take off his jacket.

00:10:42.335 --> 00:10:47.525
He was getting hot and uncomfortable, and he was wearing a large formal jacket.

00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:52.145
The organisers refused, saying that removing the

00:10:52.145 --> 00:10:55.755
cuffs might give Houdini an idea about how to escape.

00:10:57.065 --> 00:11:04.085
Houdini then theatrically whipped out a knife from his pocket and proceeded to cut the jacket off.

00:11:05.445 --> 00:11:13.845
The crowd went wild, and Houdini went back into the box, only to emerge a few minutes later, free.

00:11:15.335 --> 00:11:19.785
He burst into tears, telling the crowd “I must say it was one of the

00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:24.285
hardest, but at the same time one of the fairest, tests I ever had.”

00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:27.605
How did he do it, you might ask?

00:11:28.095 --> 00:11:31.695
Well, to this day, again, nobody knows for sure.

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:38.045
There is the theory that somebody slipped him the key, but it was custom

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:43.175
made, a reported 15 centimetres long, so it’s not exactly the kind

00:11:43.175 --> 00:11:47.085
of thing that he could have kept hidden in his hair or in his mouth.

00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:54.795
There’s also a theory that the entire stunt was pre-arranged, it was a fake stunt, organised

00:11:54.955 --> 00:12:00.375
and orchestrated by Houdini in conjunction with The Daily Mirror, so either it was a

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:06.595
set-up from the start or when it became clear that Houdini was struggling, someone from the

00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:11.975
newspaper slipped him the key, as it would have been embarrassing had he failed to escape.

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:18.945
It’s a secret to this day, but this was a one-off, a major spectacle.

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:22.495
How did he escape during the “normal” shows?

00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:28.715
As you heard earlier, Houdini’s genius was to allow anyone to present

00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:33.235
him with a lock or handcuffs and he would be able to escape from them.

00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:38.255
He couldn’t collude, pre-arrange, with everyone he met,

00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:42.595
so how did he escape from all of these different locks?

00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:48.565
Well, according to Houdini experts and fellow magicians, Houdini

00:12:48.675 --> 00:12:52.955
had an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of different types of locks.

00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:57.045
He had done an apprenticeship with a locksmith when

00:12:57.065 --> 00:13:00.955
he was a boy, and had been studying locks ever since.

00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:06.785
He knew how they worked, how to manipulate them, and how to get out of them.

00:13:08.365 --> 00:13:14.585
For some locks, simply knowing how to knock them in the right place or move or shake

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:20.655
them in the right way was sufficient to dislodge the internal mechanisms and break free.

00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:28.075
For others, Houdini would use a tiny piece of string to move the mechanism inside the lock.

00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:35.365
When this wasn’t possible, Houdini was able to recognise what kind of key would fit

00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:41.835
almost any kind of lock, so he could instruct his faithful wife and assistant, Bess, to

00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:48.375
go backstage, find the appropriate key in his large collection, and smuggle it to him

00:13:48.415 --> 00:13:55.255
in a glass of water, via a kiss, or in some secret way without the audience’s knowledge.

00:13:56.385 --> 00:14:01.315
This is, of course, what is believed; Houdini never revealed any of this.

00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:04.835
If he had, the illusion would have been broken.

00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:11.305
And he was incredibly protective of his tricks, his escapes, and went to

00:14:11.335 --> 00:14:16.255
extraordinary lengths to make sure that he was the only one who could do them.

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:21.695
On a practical level, this meant copyrighting them, meaning

00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:24.565
that he was legally the only person who could do them.

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:28.846
Importantly, this is different to a patent.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.765
A patent, in case you didn’t know, requires you to produce public

00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:38.315
information about how something is made or done, whereas copyright doesn’t.

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:43.875
Clearly, if your entire attraction is by disguising how something is

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:47.925
done, patenting your invention is not the sort of thing you want to do.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:52.965
A quick aside, by the way, a side note, is that we

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:56.155
have an entire episode on patents, and how they work.

00:14:56.535 --> 00:15:01.325
It’s number 159, and is quite an obscure but a fun one.

00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:04.105
Right, back to Houdini.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.495
After this amazing escape in London, his fame continued to grow.

00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:15.865
By this time, he was the most famous magician in the world, and

00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:19.815
was on a semi-permanent tour of Europe and the United States.

00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:22.675
And his tricks got even bigger.

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:29.655
Making an elephant disappear, escaping from straitjackets, those jackets that are used

00:15:29.675 --> 00:15:36.105
to restrain prisoners, doing this upside down, underwater, and a combination of the two.

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:43.345
He was not only an excellent magician, but he was also a talented self-publicist.

00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:50.105
He would stage escapes outside the windows of newspaper offices, so that he ensured journalists

00:15:50.175 --> 00:15:55.185
would write about him and their photographers wouldn’t have to travel to snap a picture of him.

00:15:56.155 --> 00:16:01.755
He was also ruthless about competitors, and anyone who tried to copy or

00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:06.485
recreate his tricks would receive a heavy-handed letter from his lawyers.

00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:13.315
One other interesting fact about Houdini, which is perhaps surprising and isn’t as

00:16:13.315 --> 00:16:19.815
well known as his magic tricks, is his later crusade against “spiritualism”, the idea

00:16:19.975 --> 00:16:24.335
that you can communicate with the dead through things like Ouija boards and mediums.

00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:32.555
Houdini’s fame coincided with World War I, and in the immediate aftermath of this

00:16:32.565 --> 00:16:38.605
period there was an understandable interest from grieving parents, wives, brothers and

00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:44.025
sisters who wanted to communicate with loved ones killed on the battlefields of Europe.

00:16:45.235 --> 00:16:47.575
Spiritualism offered this possibility.

00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:52.415
Apart from, according to Houdini at least, it was a huge

00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:57.455
lie, a massive scam preying on the weak and vulnerable.

00:16:59.135 --> 00:17:05.705
Houdini went on something of a public crusade against spiritualism; he was a magician himself,

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:13.375
he knew a trick when he saw one, and he accused spiritualists of profiting from misery.

00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:18.805
He would go to séances in disguise and expose spiritualist

00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:21.315
leaders when he saw them tricking their audience.

00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:26.045
He even wrote a book about it, and made it his mission

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:29.460
to shine a light on this unscrupulous industry.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:37.727
And throughout the 1920s, he continued to perform, escaping from handcuffs, straightjackets,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.650
underwater boxes, and any kind of lock that his audience would present him with.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.560
This audience interaction would be the backbone of his career, it was a

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:54.990
huge part of his appeal and popularity, but it would also be his undoing.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.927
One of the things that he had always boasted to his fans was that he had

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:06.710
an iron stomach and could withstand a punch to the stomach from anyone.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:13.000
Indeed, he would pose with famous boxers of the day, and allow

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.470
anyone to hit him without seemingly causing any kind of real pain.

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:24.363
In terms of how he did this, firstly, he was very strong and muscly, which

00:18:24.463 --> 00:18:30.763
was important, but he could also prepare himself by tensing his muscles and

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:36.213
bending down slightly, thereby protecting himself and cushioning the blow.

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:43.043
One day, however, when he was giving a lecture at McGill University in Montreal,

00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:48.593
a student came in and wanted to test Houdini’s “iron stomach” for himself.

00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:54.163
He drew his hand back and hit Houdini as hard as he

00:18:54.163 --> 00:18:58.043
could, apart from Houdini didn’t have time to prepare.

00:18:59.623 --> 00:19:07.523
The blow landed, Houdini fell to the ground in agony, allegedly mumbling "That will do".

00:19:08.393 --> 00:19:13.513
He struggled on through the lecture, and then fell terribly ill on the train home.

00:19:14.763 --> 00:19:20.993
When he was eventually examined by doctors, they realised that the punch had ruptured his

00:19:21.033 --> 00:19:29.563
abdomen, and he died, perhaps appropriately for a magician, on Halloween, October 31st, of 1926.

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:36.973
In terms of his legacy, practically all stage magicians since owe a debt to Houdini.

00:19:38.023 --> 00:19:44.063
Grand escapologists like David Blaine and David Copperfield, or even people

00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:49.263
like Penn and Teller are continuing a tradition started by Harry Houdini.

00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:56.363
Everything about him was magical and theatrical, from the instantly memorable name

00:19:56.673 --> 00:20:02.273
to the showmanship of every performance, from to the nature of his death to the fact

00:20:02.283 --> 00:20:07.203
that he was buried in a bronze coffin that had once been used in one of his tricks.

00:20:08.453 --> 00:20:14.253
Now, to conclude this episode, I promised that I’d tell you how he made that elephant disappear.

00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:20.533
Well, nobody actually knows for sure, and Houdini took the secret to the grave with

00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:26.633
him, but most modern magicians believe that the elephant never actually left the box.

00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:31.685
The box was a lot bigger than Houdini said it was, it just

00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:35.015
looked smaller given the fact that it was on a massive stage.

00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:41.181
There was a secret compartment in the box, small but large enough to hide an

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:46.271
elephant, and because the lights were kept relatively low in the Hippodrome, and

00:20:46.481 --> 00:20:51.391
the angle was such that no audience member could see the entire way through the box,

00:20:51.651 --> 00:20:57.081
nobody could see that the elephant was still there, hidden away in a dark corner.

00:20:58.321 --> 00:21:03.881
Houdini is once reported to have said “Anyone who believes in magic is a fool.”

00:21:05.071 --> 00:21:08.681
Who knows whether anyone in the audience really believed that

00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:13.281
Houdini had made the five-tonne elephant vanish by magic, but one

00:21:13.281 --> 00:21:18.051
thing is for certain: it must have been the most amazing spectacle.

00:21:20.811 --> 00:21:26.721
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Harry Houdini, The Master of Escape.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:32.041
I hope it's been an interesting one, and whether you’re a magic connoisseur or you’ve

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:36.151

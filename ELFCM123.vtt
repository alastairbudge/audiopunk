Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:17.491
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:22.051
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:28.661
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Genghis Khan,

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:34.221
the ruler of the Mongol empire, the largest empire in the history of the world.

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:40.291
Now, the story of Genghis Khan is fascinating, and it is a lot more

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:45.321
complicated and nuanced than it is often presented in the west.

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:51.071
Genghis Khan may well have been a ruthless conqueror, responsible

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:54.561
for the deaths of millions of people all over the world.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:59.741
But he was also a skilled leader, an excellent politician,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:04.151
and appears to have had a deep understanding of humanity.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:10.301
The story of Genghis Khan, apart from anything else, is unlikely.

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:16.691
He grew up dirt poor, scrounging for food, and before his fiftieth

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:20.911
birthday he was the most powerful man in the entire world.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.439
So, let’s jump right in, and learn about the life and times of Genghis Khan.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.899
We are going to start off with two administrative points.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.389
Firstly, Genghis Khan wasn’t actually his name, it was his title.

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:39.689
His name was Temuchin.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.759
He is thought to have been born in the year 1162, on the Mongolian grasslands.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.239
A recurrent theme in this episode, and a problem for historians, is that there aren't a

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:00.879
huge amount of records about his life, and only a handful exist from the Mongol perspective.

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:05.799
A large part of our understanding about Genghis Khan and the

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.749
Mongols comes from the writings of the people that he conquered.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.557
And, naturally, if you are conquered by a foreign invading

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:18.727
army you are not very likely to have positive memories of them.

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:23.367
The other practical point, before we get into the heart

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:26.897
of the story, is the pronunciation of Genghis Khan.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:33.007
You might have heard it pronounced as Jenghiz Khan, or even Chinghis Khan.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.797
We’ll stick to the English pronunciation, Genghis,

00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:40.837
but in Mongolian it is pronounced more like Chinghiss.

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:47.507
So, with those administrative points out of the way, let’s get into the more exciting stuff.

00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:53.387
Temuchin was born to a nomadic family on the Mongolian

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:58.817
steppe, the expansive, harsh grassland of modern Mongolia.

00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:05.857
The people that lived on the steppe were nomadic tribespeople, they migrated over

00:03:05.857 --> 00:03:12.437
huge swathes of grassland with their animals to make sure that they had fresh grass.

00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:18.307
These nomadic peoples would normally fight amongst themselves, between

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:23.047
tribes, and there would be rivalries that would continue for years.

00:03:23.877 --> 00:03:29.417
Someone would be killed, or animals would be stolen then revenge would be taken.

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:35.367
Revenge would be taken for the revenge, and this would go on and on.

00:03:36.647 --> 00:03:42.707
The young Temuchin’s life was dominated by this warring of tribes, and

00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:48.607
when Temuchin was only nine years old it affected him personally - his

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:55.757
father, a tribe leader, was poisoned by the Tatars, a rival tribe, and died.

00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:03.497
The young Temuchin tried to claim his father’s position as leader of the tribe, but the

00:04:03.497 --> 00:04:09.837
other powerful men in the tribe took this opportunity to throw Temuchin, his mother and his

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:17.127
brothers out of the tribe, leaving them on their own and having to forage and hunt for food.

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:22.647
This was a huge embarrassment for a nomad, as they

00:04:22.647 --> 00:04:26.447
were used to having a pretty good diet, with their

00:04:26.457 --> 00:04:28.397
large herds producing

00:04:28.397 --> 00:04:33.657
more than enough meat, cheese and milk products for them to not go hungry.

00:04:34.627 --> 00:04:41.087
So, at the age of nine Temuchin was without a father, and cast out of the tribe.

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:43.347
He was a nobody.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:49.427
No reputation, no name, no father, and he was living in poverty.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:56.337
There isn’t a huge amount of additional information about Temuchin’s early life

00:04:56.427 --> 00:05:02.487
after his father was murdered, but it was very clear that from an early age that he

00:05:02.487 --> 00:05:09.297
was resourceful, charismatic, with natural leadership skills and a sense of bravery.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:15.397
He started to attract a following - people were naturally drawn to

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:21.727
him, and he seemed to understand how to persuade and attract others.

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:30.117
He was also very calculating, not someone to rush into a decision without considering his options.

00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:37.357
There’s a story that demonstrates this very well from when one of his wives was captured.

00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:43.497
Now, in nomadic tribe culture it was often the case that a marriage

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:46.957
between two people would be arranged when they were very young.

00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:53.067
In Temuchin’s case, when he was just 9 years old, before his father was

00:05:53.077 --> 00:05:57.677
murdered, his marriage was arranged to a young girl from another tribe.

00:05:58.927 --> 00:06:03.377
He didn’t marry her until years later, but after they were

00:06:03.377 --> 00:06:07.247
married she was stolen and taken away by a rival tribe.

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:14.477
Temuchin’s natural instinct was to attack the other tribe and retrieve his wife,

00:06:14.877 --> 00:06:20.547
but he realised that this was going to be impossible, it would be a fool’s errand.

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:27.827
The other tribe had superior forces, and Temuchin would almost certainly have been killed.

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:30.427
So what did he do?

00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:31.887
Nothing.

00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:36.467
He waited, and waited, for 8 months until he was able to

00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:40.577
forge an alliance with another tribe and get his wife back.

00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:45.597
When he finally was able to get her back, she was pregnant.

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:51.367
It’s not clear whether this child was Temuchin’s or not, but he treated it

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:56.907
as his own, and the boy was later to become a commander in Temuchin’s army.

00:06:58.087 --> 00:07:04.727
Of course, not all men at the time would have behaved in the same way, and the fact that

00:07:05.117 --> 00:07:11.697
Temuchin kept his cool when she was kidnapped, then treated the son as his own gives you

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:18.277
an early indication of the fact that he wasn’t merely a cold-blooded, barbarian murderer.

00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:23.237
These calculating qualities, and evident intelligence

00:07:23.437 --> 00:07:26.477
continued to draw more and more people to Temuchin.

00:07:27.457 --> 00:07:34.757
He seemed to have a sort of magnetic quality, and he treated those that followed him well.

00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:42.057
He formed powerful allegiances with other tribes, and was ruthless with his enemies.

00:07:43.127 --> 00:07:49.687
Slowly but surely, he eliminated rival tribes, often killing all of the elder leaders,

00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:56.767
leaving only the children, who wouldn’t remember what had happened, and thus not seek revenge.

00:07:57.957 --> 00:08:04.487
His power grew and grew, and in 1206 he was proclaimed Genghis Khan,

00:08:04.637 --> 00:08:09.337
the Ultimate Khan, the leader of all of the nomadic Mongol tribes.

00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:17.417
Before Genghis Khan, there was no ultimate leader, the tribes had never been successfully united.

00:08:18.677 --> 00:08:24.517
Now was the opportunity to take things to the next level, and coming together

00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:30.027
as a united people, of course, meant that they were a lot stronger than as a

00:08:30.057 --> 00:08:35.257
collection of smaller tribes that spent their lives fighting among one another.

00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:40.957
These different tribes weren’t just different groups of people, they

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:45.027
had different cultures, different languages, and belief systems.

00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:50.727
Genghis Khan recognised this, and had some unique strategies

00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:54.397
for bringing these tribes together, for uniting them.

00:08:55.607 --> 00:09:01.447
One of the things he did was that, in his army, he mixed up all the different tribes.

00:09:02.387 --> 00:09:09.967
His army was a slick military operation, and each unit was formed of people from different tribes.

00:09:10.557 --> 00:09:15.587
There was no way of swapping, you were assigned a unit and that was it.

00:09:16.917 --> 00:09:22.377
While you might think that this was a quick way for conflict to arise between

00:09:22.377 --> 00:09:26.707
the different people within the unit, it actually worked extremely well.

00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:32.807
With the different tribes forced together, their identities and rivalries

00:09:32.997 --> 00:09:37.817
were reduced, and they presumably saw that the other tribes that they

00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:42.097
had been fighting against for years weren’t actually that bad at all.

00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:50.367
The other thing that he did was to not try to enforce any particular belief system on the tribes.

00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:55.237
He recognised that they were unique, and didn’t try to

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:59.967
impose his own set of rules or cultural norms on them.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.667
He was also, reportedly, incredibly loyal to those that

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.367
were loyal to him, and ruthless to those that weren’t.

00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:16.127
He rewarded loyalty and performance with gifts and high positions in the army.

00:10:16.807 --> 00:10:21.947
His army was meritocratic - it didn't matter whether you were born at

00:10:21.947 --> 00:10:26.997
the top or bottom of your tribe - in Genghis Khan’s army your rank,

00:10:27.007 --> 00:10:31.377
your position, was determined by your loyalty and your performance.

00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:38.697
When he became Genghis Khan, in 1206, he may have been the most powerful of

00:10:38.697 --> 00:10:43.917
the nomads, but he was far from the world’s most powerful military commander.

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:50.056
Indeed, initially he didn’t show a huge amount of interest in world

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:55.406
conquest, and he didn’t set out right away on huge military campaigns.

00:10:56.226 --> 00:11:02.506
He had an immediate advantage though, in that life on the Mongolian grasslands was very

00:11:02.506 --> 00:11:08.336
helpful for training future soldiers, and preparing them for the battles that they would fight.

00:11:09.516 --> 00:11:13.736
Firstly, the method by which Mongolian riders hunted

00:11:14.066 --> 00:11:17.346
prepared them very well for military encounters.

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:25.316
They would often form huge circles across the grasslands, tens of kilometres in circumference.

00:11:25.316 --> 00:11:28.256
All the men would be on horseback.

00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:32.716
They would then come together, towards the centre

00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:35.896
of the circle, driving the animals into the middle.

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:44.146
This required huge amounts of coordination, which is evidently difficult when you are on the

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:50.766
windy, Mongolian grassland, and the radio wasn’t going to be invented for another 700 years.

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:59.053
A tactic they developed was to use particular types of arrows that would make different noises as

00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:06.103
they travelled through the air, and this would direct the horsemen to move in certain directions.

00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:13.953
This meant that the commanders could give orders to their men just by firing an arrow, and

00:12:14.203 --> 00:12:21.013
this was a huge advantage when it came to fighting a more dangerous enemy than wolves or deer.

00:12:22.193 --> 00:12:28.023
Secondly, the entire Mongol army was on horseback, there was no infantry,

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:32.933
no foot soldiers, and of course this meant that they were able to

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:37.923
travel incredibly fast, and launch lightning attacks on their enemy.

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:44.613
As Genghis Khan’s forces moved off the steppe, away from the grassland and

00:12:44.793 --> 00:12:51.403
towards settled populations, towards non-nomadic people, it found great riches.

00:12:52.523 --> 00:12:58.123
One of the problems about being a nomad is that it was hard to build up wealth.

00:12:58.493 --> 00:13:04.033
Your wealth was in your sheep and goats, it didn’t really last - sheep

00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:08.263
and goats don’t live for very long, and you have to keep replacing them.

00:13:09.293 --> 00:13:14.593
When Genghis Khan’s forces reached places like modern-day China and Persia

00:13:14.893 --> 00:13:21.523
they found abundant riches - spices, silk, gold, and other precious goods.

00:13:22.613 --> 00:13:27.923
Naturally, this was very enticing to the well-trained Mongolian army.

00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:33.743
The deal that the Mongol forces usually proposed to cities that they

00:13:33.743 --> 00:13:39.573
were attacking was simple: if you surrender, we will spare your lives.

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:43.773
Fight and we will kill every last one of you.

00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:48.163
And the Mongols had a reputation for keeping their word.

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:51.923
If they said they’d kill you, they weren’t messing around.

00:13:52.563 --> 00:13:58.403
It was simple, but incredibly effective, and although they did slaughter entire

00:13:58.443 --> 00:14:04.363
populations, there isn’t much evidence that they did this because of some perverse

00:14:04.383 --> 00:14:10.793
enjoyment, but rather because if they developed a reputation for slaughtering entire

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:17.303
towns and cities if they didn’t surrender, then the word would get out and cities were

00:14:17.303 --> 00:14:22.343
more likely to surrender in advance, meaning that the Mongols didn’t need to fight them.

00:14:23.353 --> 00:14:29.933
Indeed, the Mongol army was effective, but it wasn’t actually as large as you might think it was.

00:14:30.673 --> 00:14:35.893
The entire Mongol army was around 2 million strong, but it was

00:14:35.893 --> 00:14:40.793
split over multiple different fronts, over multiple different areas.

00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:50.333
There wasn’t one, individual Mongol horde that rampaged all over Asia, but a collection of diverse

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:57.503
ones, all ultimately controlled by Genghis Khan, but each being controlled by a regional commander.

00:14:58.383 --> 00:15:03.443
These armies had traveled very far from home, and wanted to avoid losing any

00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:08.853
men if at all possible, so they would almost always offer the opportunity

00:15:08.853 --> 00:15:13.813
for their enemies to surrender, so that they didn’t actually have to fight.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:21.363
But, you might still be wondering, what were they actually doing by going on these huge conquests?

00:15:21.733 --> 00:15:23.263
Why were they invading?

00:15:23.663 --> 00:15:28.143
Why did they leave their grassy homelands and conquer a third of Asia?

00:15:29.253 --> 00:15:35.453
There are some popular misconceptions about this, and the main one is that they ran

00:15:35.483 --> 00:15:40.983
out of grassland in Mongolia, which meant they came off the plains in order to survive.

00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:44.993
There’s very little evidence that this is actually true.

00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:51.663
Most historians now believe that the real reason that the Mongols continued their global

00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:57.243
quest was because they had started it, the soldiers had tasted the spoils of war, the

00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:03.163
goods they had managed to seize from these towns and cities, and to keep the soldiers

00:16:03.193 --> 00:16:10.143
united and happy, Genghis Khan needed to continue to ransack new towns and cities.

00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:18.163
Remember, the Mongols were a nomadic population, they moved their animals around,

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:24.093
and they didn’t really have any other way to produce wealth other than taking it.

00:16:25.053 --> 00:16:31.073
When they arrived in places like China and Persia, they found huge treasures, silk,

00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:37.433
spices, precious metals, things that can only really be created by static societies.

00:16:38.863 --> 00:16:43.403
Although Genghis Khan may have been a fearsome conqueror to those that

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:47.793
he conquered, he was a loyal, generous leader to those that followed him.

00:16:48.143 --> 00:16:53.053
He would reward his soldiers with the spoils of war, and when these

00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:57.363
spoils were exhausted, they needed to go out and look for more.

00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:04.753
Another factor that motivated Genghis Khan’s armies to head south, to what is now

00:17:04.783 --> 00:17:11.143
Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, was related to loyalty to his men.

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:16.573
This area was at the time part of the Khwarezmid Empire,

00:17:16.823 --> 00:17:20.613
and was ruled by a man called Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad.

00:17:21.843 --> 00:17:28.733
Genghis Khan had tried to make a trade agreement with him, but when Khan sent a Mongol

00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:34.363
trade mission to meet with the Shah, they were all killed and their goods were stolen.

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:42.533
To try to resolve the situation peacefully, Genghis Khan sent three diplomats to

00:17:42.733 --> 00:17:48.623
negotiate with the Shah, but they were decapitated, their heads were chopped off.

00:17:49.813 --> 00:17:52.013
The Shah was trying his luck.

00:17:53.283 --> 00:17:57.433
But if there was one person that you really didn’t

00:17:57.433 --> 00:18:00.253
want to get on the wrong side of, it was Genghis Khan.

00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:07.253
The cutting off of his diplomats’ heads was a gross insult, and

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:12.623
within two years Genghis Khan had destroyed the entire Khwarezmid

00:18:12.643 --> 00:18:18.143
Empire, killed the Shah, and chased his son all the way down to India.

00:18:19.443 --> 00:18:23.843
So, the primary reason for venturing all the way south to that

00:18:23.843 --> 00:18:28.003
part of Asia was, really, out of loyalty to his murdered men.

00:18:29.053 --> 00:18:32.723
What is often misunderstood about the Mongol empire is that

00:18:32.723 --> 00:18:37.243
its peak was actually after Genghis Khan’s death, in 1227.

00:18:38.693 --> 00:18:44.633
The Khanate was passed to his son, and the systems that Genghis Khan had

00:18:44.633 --> 00:18:49.103
put in place were strong enough for the empire to continue expanding.

00:18:50.323 --> 00:18:55.183
At its largest point it covered everything from modern day Hungary

00:18:55.373 --> 00:19:00.183
right through to the Pacific Ocean, an area the size of Africa.

00:19:01.613 --> 00:19:07.983
The empire wasn’t to last though, or at least it wasn’t to last in its original form.

00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:13.043
The Mongols essentially became emperors of China, and

00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:19.313
formed the Yuan dynasty, which went on from 1271 to 1368.

00:19:20.433 --> 00:19:26.243
In terms of the legacy that Genghis Khan left, he is by far the most famous person

00:19:26.503 --> 00:19:32.083
to have ever come out of Mongolia, and Mongolians today are fiercely proud of him.

00:19:33.293 --> 00:19:38.433
He is on the banknotes, the airport of Mongolia’s capital city, Ulan Bator

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:43.623
is called Genghis Khan International, and there’s even a Genghis Khan vodka.

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:51.873
Far from being considered a brutal dictator, he is a national hero, a sign of Mongolian

00:19:51.873 --> 00:19:58.193
strength and power in the world, even if that strength and power ended almost 800 years ago.

00:19:59.493 --> 00:20:05.113
In the West, historians have a complicated time figuring out Genghis Khan.

00:20:06.543 --> 00:20:12.673
There are some who blame him even for things like the treatment of the Aztecs and the

00:20:12.693 --> 00:20:19.703
Incas by the Spanish, saying that Genghis Khan was ruthlessly brutal towards muslims in

00:20:19.703 --> 00:20:24.723
central Asia and the middle east, who were in turn ruthless towards the crusaders, who

00:20:24.943 --> 00:20:30.773
brought this back to Spain and they therefore were ruthless when they went to the new world.

00:20:30.773 --> 00:20:37.900
It seems like a little bit of a stretch and there seems to not be that much evidence that Genghis

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:45.930
Khan was any more or less ruthless than any other great military ruler, and by considering his

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:53.850
actions with our 21st century lens we’re really failing to understand the norms at the time.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:01.030
No, of course we shouldn’t condone the murder of entire populations, but if we are

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:07.070
going to say that Genghis Khan was a terrible barbarian, the theory goes, we should

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.000
judge people like Alexander the Great, and Julius Ceasar with the same standards.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:18.960
One of the main differences, really, was that the Mongols were different, they

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:25.040
came from the East on lightning fast horses, they didn’t leave a great written

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.710
culture or history behind, and they left great destruction in their midst.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.210
Perhaps if they had left behind great poems, songs, or books, then we

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.890
would think about the legacy of Genghis Khan in a slightly different way.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.530
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Genghis Khan.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.990
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.070
We do actually have quite a few listeners from Mongolia, so if you are

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.410
from Mongolia, I would absolutely love to hear your perspective on this.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.960
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.149
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:26.450
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the third part in our three-part philosophical mini-series.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.669
In case you missed them, in part one we learned about the philosopher

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.573
king, or perhaps more aptly the philosopher emperor, Marcus Aurelius.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:41.280
In part two, which was one of our member-only episodes, we learned about one of the grumpiest and

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.884
most pessimistic men to walk the earth, the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:51.430
And in our final episode, part three, we are going to talk about

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.850
the controversial 20th century author and philosopher, Ayn Rand.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
To some, she is a voice of reason, the only person prepared

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.699
to articulate the truth of how people really see the world.

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.439
To others, she offers a misguided and foolish interpretation of humanity, one

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.839
in which there is no love, compassion or charity, only selfish self-interest.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:22.790
So, let’s get right into it, and learn about the queen of capitalism, Ayn Rand.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.220
What is the meaning of life?

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:31.260
We’ve talked about this a lot in this mini-series, and of course it is a question

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.580
that thinkers and philosophers have grappled with for centuries, are still

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.480
grappling with today, and will continue to grapple with until the end of time.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.590
If you asked Marcus Aurelius, he would probably have said something

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.590
like “to live a virtuous life in accordance with the rules of nature”.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.740
If you asked Arthur Schopenhauer, if he hadn’t simply walked away or looked down at you like you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.649
were wasting his time, he might respond by telling you that “life has no meaning, only death”.

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.490
If you asked Karl Marx, he would probably say something like solidarity

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.840
between men, class struggle, and self-realisation through labour.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.340
If you asked Ayn Rand, however, you would get a very different answer.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.630
The meaning of life, according to Rand, was rational self-interest, doing

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.640
whatever was best for you as an individual, free of interference from others.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.460
You might think, “oh, well that doesn’t sound so controversial, doing what

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.140
is best for me doesn’t sound like such a terrible way to live my life.”

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.830
But the controversy and radicalism in Rand’s philosophy was

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.800
the extent to which she took this to its logical extreme.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.700
For Rand, the individual came at the centre of everything.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.780
This meant that any external requests on the individual were wrong.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.780
Nobody should tell anybody else how to live their life or force them to do anything

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.430
that they didn’t want, because the individual needed to put their own interests first.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.270
Now, we’ll get to the intricacies of this philosophy in a minute, and what it means

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.020
from a practical basis, but let me first give you some background to Ayn Rand.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.610
Like Marcus Aurelius and certainly like Arthur Schopenhauer, it is not

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.950
difficult to see how their life experience shaped their view of the world.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.980
Ayn Rand, as you might have guessed, wasn’t her real name.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.750
It was Alice O'Connor.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.979
And even that wasn’t her birth name, it was Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.750
She was born in Russia, in 1905, to a bourgeois Jewish family.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.440
Now, Russia at the start of the 20th century wasn’t a great place to

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.290
be, it was a particularly bad place to be a Jew, and it was an even

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.220
worse place to be a Jew from a bourgeois family, as Ayn Rand was.

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:17.940
There was a new wave anti-Semitic pogroms, riots against Jewish people, which went on

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.420
from 1903 to 1906, and then in 1917 the Rosenbaum family’s life was turned upside down

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.900
after the Russian Revolution, which did not turn out well for the Russian bourgeoisie.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:38.299
Her family's pharmacy was nationalised, her family had to flee, and–like tens

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.180
of millions of other Russians at the time–she endured terrible hardship, poverty

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.150
and starvation as Communist Russia started its experiment with collectivism.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.010
And in 1926 she arrived in America.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.860
She had been given a visa to visit relatives, but she had no intention of returning

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.290
to her country of birth; her real plan was to escape and become a screenwriter.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.709
This was the early days of Hollywood, and Ayn Rand was intent on hitting it big.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.510
The first problem was one I imagine you might be familiar with: she needed to work on her English.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.610
She took an English course, and made her way out west, to Hollywood,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.090
where after a few years of rejection, she found some success.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:36.010
In 1935, after managing to sell a script to Broadway, she started work on what

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.790
would become her first major commercial success, and outline her philosophy.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.340
It was called The Fountainhead, and was rejected by 12 different

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.760
publishing houses before eventually being published in 1943.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.999
The novel follows the story of a heroic architect, Howard Roark,

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.650
and explores his struggles between conformity and independence.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.200
It isn’t a philosophical treatise, a manifesto, but a novel through which Rand presents

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.666
her philosophy, a way of viewing the world which would come to be called “Objectivism”.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.099
It was an immediate success, a cult hit, but soon after she got to work on her new book, the

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:30.165
even more successful and controversial Atlas Shrugged, which was eventually published in 1957.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.369
Atlas Shrugged was even longer, 1,200 pages, and further

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.540
developed the themes that she had touched on in The Fountainhead.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.240
Principally, individualism, property rights, the role of government, libertarianism, and capitalism.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.540
It was to be her magnum opus, her greatest work, but it was not universally well-received.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.860
One critic described it as “1,000 pages of ideological fabulism”,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.900
while another called it “unpleasant, daft and deeply flawed”.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.849
But it was a great success commercially, selling millions of

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:15.169
copies and turning Rand into a rich and successful author.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.840
After its publication she focussed on developing her philosophy rather than writing more

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.090
fiction, dedicating her life, selfishly she would probably say, to furthering her ideas.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.859
So, what did Rand believe, what were some of the core

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.590
ideas of Objectivism, and where did these come from?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.300
The first point is that reality exists independently of consciousness,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.719
that there is an objective reality external to the mind.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.630
The world is not how we think it is, with everyone experiencing a slightly different reality.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.450
There is an objective reality, a way the world is that

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.760
doesn’t require anyone to take anything for granted.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:10.119
Secondly, the way we should understand this world is through reason.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.860
Man needs to think and act rationally, according to the reality that is in front of him.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.680
And what does this mean in practice?

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.353
It means rational self-interest, acting according to your best interests.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:33.950
Sacrificing your interests for others or the collective is considered immoral, wrong.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:40.210
At the centre of everything should come the individual, the single human being.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:46.170
No group should have any claim over the rights of any individual, nobody should

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.230
be able to force anyone else to do anything that is not in their best interest.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.310
Now, this has all been quite theoretical, so what would this mean in practice?

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.010
What would a world look like in which Objectivism reigned supreme?

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:08.950
It would be the most extreme form of laissez-faire capitalism, a

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.449
society in which economics and state are separated, and where there

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.180
is zero government interference in the affairs of the individual.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.000
Taxation is a form of theft, according to Rand, because it forces the individual

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:30.209
to give up something that is theirs–their money–in order to benefit other people.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.530
Taxation is by default not in the best interest of the individual,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.799
and therefore tax is morally wrong, according to Rand at least.

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:46.209
Now, if there is no taxation, who pays for the things that

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.580
governments typically provide for their citizens, you might be asking?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.900
Well, the individual, because that person will act in their own best interest.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.760
If you drive a car on a road, you pay a toll, if you want to borrow a

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.450
book from a library, you pay a fee, if you get ill, you pay the doctor.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:11.730
You would only pay for what was in your best interest, not a penny more and not a penny less.

00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:18.599
Rand did agree that there needed to be some form of government, but in Objectivism

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.439
its function was reduced to purely law and order: enforcing property rights,

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.669
protecting citizens from crime, and protecting the nation from foreign invaders.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.430
What an ideal society looked like, in Rand’s eyes, was one with

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.040
practically zero state interference, and unbridled free-market capitalism.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.780
After all, capitalism by default rewards self-interest.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.100
People buy products and services because they have a selfish desire for them.

00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:56.210
You buy bread because you are hungry and you want to eat it.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.030
You buy an English course because you want to improve your English.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.749
You buy a family holiday because you want to sit on a beach or

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.879
visit a new country or do whatever it is that you want to do.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.530
Capitalism encourages people to produce things that people want to buy.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.810
You might think that some of these things are morally questionable, whether that’s gambling,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:28.550
alcohol, cigarettes, or even heroin, but there is a clear demand for it, people are acting in

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:34.110
their own self-interest, and therefore they should be allowed to do whatever it is they want.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.442
Capitalism is not just the superior economic system, it is morally right, according to Objectivism.

00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:49.630
Now, for someone to propose this position with such conviction and integrity

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.120
was something of a novelty, and as you might expect, it was controversial.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:03.140
In a 1959 interview, Ayn Rand was introduced as an intellectual who was involved in a

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.030
“new and unusual philosophy which would seem to strike at the very roots of our society”.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.079
And clearly, it did.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:18.450
Most societies around the world, regardless of religion or culture, tend to include some kind of

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:25.339
expectation that people with more support those with less, which typically happens through taxation.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.500
Rand rejected this, dismissing it as altruistic and morally wrong,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.870
because it was not in the rational self-interest of the individuals.

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:42.200
She also, as you might imagine, completely dismissed faith and religion.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.099
There was none, Rand said, the world is objectively as it is, and

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.580
to pretend that there is some divine being, a God, that controls

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.650
everything is not simply misguided, it is not backed up by any evidence.

00:12:58.859 --> 00:13:02.680
Now, in terms of her impact, it has been vast.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:09.416
Atlas Shrugged has sold 10 million copies, and as of 2022, more

00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:13.823
than 37 million copies of her writings have been sold worldwide.

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:20.810
Her critics disparagingly suggest that she is most popular with teenage boys, who read Atlas

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:27.140
Shrugged and avidly adopt her worldview, only to realise its impracticality as they grow up.

00:13:28.469 --> 00:13:32.920
Or, to tell you a popular wisecrack, a joke about Ayn Rand:

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.320
There are two books a lot of boys discover when they are in their early teens.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.940
Atlas Shrugged and The Lord Of The Rings.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:46.749
One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes,

00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:52.390
leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.630
The other is Lord Of The Rings.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.900
The idea is that Ayn Rand presents a view of the world

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.860
that just seems to just click for certain people.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:08.709
It is a simple and utterly rational explanation, breaking everything down to first principles,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.130
and it doesn’t require anyone to believe anything that they cannot see with their own eyes.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:22.050
But, the morality and worldview that Rand presents is simply unworkable in a world in which altruism

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.940
and compassion are considered to be virtues, regardless of religious or cultural background.

00:14:28.719 --> 00:14:33.430
We have had tens of thousands of years of human society in which communities have

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.759
independently converged around the idea that it is a “good” thing to care for

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:44.310
others, and–to Rand’s critics at least–even if she has a rational explanation

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.720
for why self-interest should always come first, most people reject this idea.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.180
Nevertheless, she has plenty of fans who are not teenage boys.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:01.459
Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, was a close friend of Rand’s.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.810
The tax-cutting former president, Ronald Reagan, wrote to a friend that he was a

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.820
fan of Rand’s ideas, and she continues to be cited by many US Republicans today.

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:20.229
Her ideas have never been fully embraced to the extent that she advocated for, but they

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.780
have certainly had an impact on business people and policymakers all over the world.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.870
On the flip side, to her critics, who are primarily found on the political

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.090
left, but can also be found on the right, she is a pariah, a dangerous and

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:41.410
compassionless individual who presents the antithesis of a happy, healthy society.

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:47.240
What kind of world would it be, her critics argue, if there is no sense of society

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.680
as a whole, just of a collection of individuals acting in their own self-interest?

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.909
There would be no public health system, no public education,

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.349
no public infrastructure, no government regulation.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.610
Not only would it be a morally bankrupt society, but it would lead to

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:11.099
the collapse of society, a dystopia where the rich and powerful grow more

00:16:11.099 --> 00:16:14.880
rich and powerful, and those without money or power are left with nothing.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.829
The social contract we all implicitly engage in by paying

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.660
taxes and obeying government laws keeps society afloat.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.220
Taxpayer money goes towards supporting those who are less able to

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.700
support themselves, and government legislation exists to protect

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.560
individuals from the worst excesses of capitalism, so the argument goes.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:44.490
Both to her critics and her greatest supporters, there seems to be little middle ground.

00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:52.609
Rand’s most ardent supporters tend to reject any criticism of her ideals, arguing that Objectivism

00:16:52.879 --> 00:17:00.010
is a worldview that you embrace in totality or not at all, which, to be fair, is Rand’s position.

00:17:00.832 --> 00:17:04.959
Objectivism provides a framework for seeing the world and making decisions,

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.810
and if you use a framework, you can’t pick and choose, that isn’t rational.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:16.630
On a personal level, Ayn Rand was able to find the occasional compromise, or

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.530
at least, find reasons for what other people would claim was a compromise.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:27.739
She was a heavy smoker her entire life, and in her late 60s she was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.370
Her treatment was expensive, and although she had made a lot

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.899
of money through book sales, it all went on healthcare bills.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.080
She was practically broke, and she needed help from the state.

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:46.519
She initially rejected social security benefits and medicare, the state-provided

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.530
pension and healthcare, as this went against everything she believed in.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.919
But she then changed her mind, as she had been paying in her entire life

00:17:56.929 --> 00:18:01.150
through government-mandated taxes, so now was her time to take something out.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.970
It wasn’t charity, it was rational.

00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:09.465
Ayn Rand died in 1982, at the age of 77.

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:14.930
42 years have passed, but she has just as many followers

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.150
and is just as controversial in 2024 as when she was alive.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.709
One thing is for sure.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.230
She was a visionary, she presented a completely different way of

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.129
seeing the world, an utterly new blueprint for the meaning of life.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.399
And whether you agree with it or not, on that basis

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.440
alone, she deserves to be discussed and remembered.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.949
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Ayn Rand, the unashamed

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.121
champion of free-market capitalism, and the founder of Objectivism.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.810
And with that comes the end of this philosophical mini-series.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.230
In case you missed them, part one was on Marcus Aurelius and part two,

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.333
which was one of our member-only ones, was on Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.020
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.790
Have you read any Ayn Rand?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.360
What do you think of her work?

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.590
Would you like to live in the kind of society she championed?

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.219
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.310

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:16.223
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.323
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:25.843
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about cannibalism.

00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:32.463
Now, you might think that it’s a bit of a horrible topic for an episode, and you would be right.

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:37.903
But it is an interesting one, and–as we’ll see–for as long as there

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:41.513
have been people, there have been people who have eaten other people.

00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:44.833
Now, I should probably give you a little warning.

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:50.263
To reiterate, the topic of this episode is humans eating other humans.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.813
If you’re about to eat your lunch, I would suggest that you

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:57.613
either stop listening to this episode or stop eating your lunch.

00:00:58.138 --> 00:01:01.368
I’ll try to avoid the very graphic descriptions,

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:04.468
but the subject matter will be…difficult to stomach.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:11.558
So, with that in mind, let’s get into the meat, if you’ll pardon the pun, of today’s episode.

00:01:13.278 --> 00:01:19.298
If you know much about English cheeses, you’ll know that there’s a famous one called Cheddar.

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:23.718
The cheese is named after the village of Cheddar, in

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:26.888
the county of Somerset, in the south-west of England.

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:33.838
And in the late 19th century, sometime in the 1890s, a retired

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:38.518
sea captain by the name of Richard Cox Gough had a hobby.

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:44.128
He would explore the caves under and around the village of Cheddar.

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:49.558
He was exploring one of these caves one day, a long cave that is

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:53.958
115 metres deep and nearly three and a half kilometres in length.

00:01:55.358 --> 00:01:59.508
As he explored, he found old bones, bones that

00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:04.278
archaeologists now believe come from around 15,000 years ago.

00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:10.868
Deep within the cave, Gough found broken bones belonging to at least five people.

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:16.108
Now, there’s nothing particularly strange about finding human

00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:21.038
remains, but there was something unusual about these remains.

00:02:22.578 --> 00:02:27.788
All of them had significant cuts and teeth marks, suggesting that

00:02:27.788 --> 00:02:33.328
they had been de-fleshed, their skin removed, and chewed by…something.

00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:39.108
The skulls also appear to have been made into drinking cups.

00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:45.098
Gough had discovered that the past residents of Cheddar had a taste

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:49.148
for something a little more unusual than the eponymous cheese the

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:53.488
village went on to become famous for: they had a taste for other people.

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:59.458
Yes, 15,000 years ago, in sleepy Somerset, if you

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.988
were unlucky you might become someone else’s lunch.

00:03:04.138 --> 00:03:07.798
Now, you most likely think this is horrible and disgusting.

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:11.458
For most people it is, of course, but eating your own

00:03:11.498 --> 00:03:16.528
species, being a cannibal, is not so uncommon among animals.

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:23.748
Piranhas, those fish with sharp teeth, will nip and bite at each other’s tails until one

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:30.568
becomes unable to swim properly, which allows the others to consume it in a frenzied mob attack.

00:03:31.668 --> 00:03:36.258
And unless he is particularly alert, the females of many

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:39.968
spider species will eat the male after they have mated.

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:44.408
But human cannibalism is something more taboo.

00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:49.378
Whilst other animals may eat each other, it is only humans who are

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:54.248
described as inhuman as a result of their cannibalistic activities.

00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:59.408
A fish cannot become infish, or a spider inspider.

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:04.198
But that is not to say that people don’t eat other people.

00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:09.737
There are many instances of recorded cannibalism throughout human history and prehistory.

00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:15.088
Sometimes we know exactly why people choose to eat other people.

00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:19.368
In some cases it was simply because they decided that

00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:22.708
humans are a tasty food, worth putting into the pot.

00:04:23.898 --> 00:04:28.728
In other instances people believed that consuming human flesh and blood

00:04:28.898 --> 00:04:34.918
would bring health benefits, be they physical or spiritual, or cure illness.

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:39.858
Sometimes people have consumed each other as a tactic used

00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:44.288
in war, as a way to embarrass and shame those who are eaten.

00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:48.868
And it has also been the case that people believed the consumption

00:04:48.878 --> 00:04:53.308
of human flesh might fulfil some ritual or religious purpose.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:56.358
Or it could be out of sheer desperation.

00:04:57.318 --> 00:05:03.938
But in many cases, like with those unfortunate residents of Cheddar, we simply don’t know for sure.

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:10.308
Historians like to put forward ideas and theories, and it is fun,

00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:15.498
albeit gory and grisly, a bit horrible, to try to think for yourself.

00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:21.808
So, in this episode we’ll take a look at these different categories of cannibalisation,

00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:28.335
known and unknown, and explore this gory world of humans eating humans.

00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:31.575
Let’s go back to Cheddar for a minute.

00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:37.835
The remains in the cave in Cheddar date from around 14,700 years ago.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:43.735
At this time, roaming the British Isles and Northern Europe would have been people

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:49.215
historians refer to as Magdalenian, as being part of The Magdalenian cultures.

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:55.935
These Magdalenian cultures are named after a site called La Madeleine in southwestern France.

00:05:57.205 --> 00:06:04.395
And it turns out that, although France might now be known as the home of fine dining, back in The

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:11.075
Magdalenian epoch there’s plenty of evidence of humans being the plat du jour, the dish of the day.

00:06:12.195 --> 00:06:17.175
Indeed, archaeological evidence has been found in many places, including in

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:22.825
France, Belgium and Germany, of people engaging in cannibalistic activities.

00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:30.545
What is interesting, however, about many of these remains is that the cut marks on them suggest that

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:36.545
the human bones were much more thoroughly cleaned of flesh than the animal bones they were found

00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:43.155
alongside, implying that it wasn’t just about having a square meal, about having something to eat.

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:48.515
This has led some people to speculate that the eating of human

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:53.815
flesh was associated with a ritual, a spiritual or holy tradition.

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:58.255
We know that they did it, but we simply don’t know why.

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:03.163
And cannibalism wasn’t restricted to homo sapiens.

00:07:03.822 --> 00:07:06.675
In another cave at Moula-Guercy in France,

00:07:07.006 --> 00:07:11.525
palaeontologists found bones belonging to six Neanderthals.

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:16.075
They would have been alive about 100,000 years ago.

00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:22.525
The markings on these skeletal remains suggest that these people had had

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:27.982
their tongues and thigh muscles removed, and that their bones and skulls had

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:33.882
been broken to extract the marrow, the bit inside the bone, and their brains.

00:07:35.252 --> 00:07:39.012
Another instance of Neanderthal cannibalism from 50,000 years

00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:43.472
later has also been found in a cave in El Sidrón in Spain.

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:49.282
Here a group of 12 people had been dismembered and eaten, with their

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:54.272
bones found mixed in with a pile of deer bones and other animal bones.

00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:58.982
It seems, historians believe, that these poor Neanderthals

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:02.400
might just have been considered a good source of food.

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:07.319
They might have already been dead, and the Neanderthals simply didn’t want to

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.339
let their bodies go to waste, or they might have been killed for their meat.

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:12.719
We simply don’t know.

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:20.019
And of course, not all Neanderthals were cannibals, but Neanderthals were skilled hunters of

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:26.209
animals, and there is evidence of them using the same skill as butchers on their own species.

00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:32.089
Now, to move onto our next instance of cannibalism, there is a more modern

00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:37.099
and better understood form of cannibalism called mortuary cannibalism,

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:42.857
which involves the consumption, the eating of the dead as part of a funeral.

00:08:44.547 --> 00:08:50.707
The Fore people, who live in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, engaged in this

00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:56.257
kind of cannibalism until the 1950s when it was banned by the Australian government.

00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:03.567
As part of their funeral the body of a dead person would be eaten by their relatives.

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:06.801
Another word for this is endocannibalism.

00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:12.991
I wouldn’t blame you if you didn't like the idea of eating one of your relatives, it certainly

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:19.241
sounds pretty gross to me, but there is also a very good medical reason not to do it.

00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:26.431
And this is because it can cause a rare, incurable and fatal disease called “kuru”.

00:09:27.981 --> 00:09:32.336
This terrible disease was first discovered in Papua New Guinea, in the

00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:37.911
Fore people, in 1957, among the people who ate their own dead relatives.

00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:43.031
The word “kuru” means “to shake” in the Fore language,

00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:45.691
the language of this Papua New Guinean people.

00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:55.211
And although a “shaking” disease might, at first, sound relatively harmless, kuru is anything but.

00:09:56.451 --> 00:10:01.031
It is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes people to lose control

00:10:01.061 --> 00:10:04.831
over their muscles and coordination, ultimately leading to death.

00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:11.631
The effects of this illness have led some to compare those who contract it to zombies.

00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:17.821
It’s all thought to have started after one Fore person spontaneously

00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:22.471
developed a rare neurodegenerative disorder, a disorder of the brain.

00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:27.891
This disorder, called Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, affects

00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:32.411
about 1 in a million people, but normally it’s not contagious.

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:37.471
With the Fore people, however, for reasons you may now be

00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:41.181
able to guess, it was transmitted from person to person.

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.751
That’s right, it was passed from person to person after

00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:49.831
an infected person died and was eaten by their relatives.

00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:56.671
Because this disease had such a long incubation period, up to 10 years with no

00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:02.721
symptoms, many Fore people would have it without knowing, then they would die, then

00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:07.641
after they were eaten at their funeral, it would be passed to the people who ate them.

00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.711
The disease was most common amongst women and children, with

00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:17.722
women actually eight times more likely than men to contract it.

00:11:19.001 --> 00:11:24.591
While the link between cannibalism and kuru was not proven until 1967,

00:11:24.921 --> 00:11:29.471
we now know why women and children suffered more, and I’m sorry but

00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:32.671
I’m going to have to give you some slightly disgusting detail here.

00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:38.521
The reason women and children got it more was because whilst men would normally

00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:43.761
eat the muscles of the dead person, women and children would eat the brain

00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:48.971
tissue, which was more likely to contain the abnormal protein that caused kuru.

00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:50.891
Seriously nasty stuff.

00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:57.661
It's actually these same abnormal, technically “misfolded” proteins which

00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:02.801
caused the outbreak of mad cow disease in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.

00:12:03.691 --> 00:12:09.491
In this instance, the cows’ diet was being supplemented with protein derived from beef.

00:12:10.131 --> 00:12:13.301
The cows were essentially being fed other cows.

00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.411
And it was the outbreak of this disease that meant that beef

00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:22.791
exports from the UK to the European Union were banned until 2006.

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:30.911
Now, although intra-species consumption, be it human or cow, has caused serious

00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:36.851
illness, cannibalism has also been used for its supposed medical properties.

00:12:37.921 --> 00:12:41.681
This practice is something described as corpse medicine

00:12:41.931 --> 00:12:45.361
and was still happening until surprisingly recently.

00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:52.821
Eating bits of human body parts to cure ailments was at its height in Europe in the 17th century.

00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:59.431
And until the 19th century human fat was sold in Germany as a healing

00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:04.811
ointment for all sorts of things, including broken bones and arthritis.

00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:11.631
Grinding up skulls or other bones was also sometimes sold as a treatment for epilepsy.

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:17.681
And even as recently as 1910 a German pharmaceutical catalogue was

00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:23.511
advertising mumia, which is a powder made from Ancient Egyptian mummies.

00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:29.471
The idea of human body parts, and especially blood, being a

00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:33.421
revitalising substance is another classic element of cannibalism.

00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:38.161
Think of vampires – immortal and forever the same age,

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:42.351
nourished by the sanguineous sacrifice of their human victims.

00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:50.431
Whilst accounts of vampires and zombies may seem bizarre, in many cases they have their roots

00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:56.931
in some rumour or other, that gets told again and again, each time becoming more fantastical.

00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:03.521
One such story began in the early 17th century in the village of Trenčin,

00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:07.951
which is in present day Slovakia, but was then part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

00:14:09.051 --> 00:14:14.021
People in this village began to notice that a lot of young women were going missing.

00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:19.671
All of these women had gone to a castle, the Csejte Castle

00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:24.151
to work as servants for a countess called Elizabeth Báthory.

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:29.051
An investigation was launched by the villagers and it was discovered

00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:33.391
that the countess had been torturing and then killing the young women.

00:14:33.961 --> 00:14:36.701
She is believed to have murdered more that 600 in total.

00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:42.571
During the investigation the Countess was accused of being a vampire.

00:14:42.961 --> 00:14:47.801
She was also charged with bathing in the blood of these young women in an attempt

00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:53.041
to retain her youth and beauty and she has become known as the “Blood Countess”.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:59.471
Now, turning to the word “cannibal”, there is also an interesting history behind it.

00:15:00.431 --> 00:15:06.071
Although, as we’ve seen, people have been eating people for tens of thousands of years, the

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:12.161
word “cannibal” entered the English language in the 17th century and comes from the Spanish word

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:20.147
"Cannibales" which was itself a mispronunciation of the word ‘Carib’ by Spanish conquistadors.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.480
The Island Carib people, who are also known as the Kalinago, were resident on

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.010
the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean at the time that the Spanish made contact.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.870
They were known as warriors, and in the early colonial period the

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.010
Spanish conquistadors accused the Caribs of eating their own enemies.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.940
Although it is possible that they took human body parts as war trophies,

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.020
the rumour that they ate them is generally thought to be untrue.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.080
Despite this, the term stuck.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.990
The word “cannibal” came to be used to describe those that ate

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.020
human flesh and more generally the people of the New World.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.570
This amalgamation of meaning allowed the arriving colonial forces from Europe to

00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:13.310
dehumanise the people they encountered, and so assert their control from what they

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.820
believed was a morally superior standpoint, rather than just through military force.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:25.213
Although the Caribs, after whom cannibalism is named, may not have ever actually

00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:30.643
eaten anyone, there are a number of other early European colonial accounts of New

00:16:30.643 --> 00:16:35.863
World cannibalism which may have more foundation, which may have more truth to them.

00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:40.414
Perhaps the most notorious group were the Aztecs.

00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:45.802
There is an account given by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés of

00:16:45.802 --> 00:16:51.972
when he and his men arrived at the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán in 1521.

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:57.938
They described seeing Aztec priests cut the hearts out of living

00:16:57.938 --> 00:17:02.408
victims and hold them high up in the sky as an offering to their gods.

00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:08.898
The reason that the Aztecs cut the heart out of their victims’ chest is believed to be

00:17:09.048 --> 00:17:14.358
because they thought that the heart was also the soul, as well as being a fragment of the sun.

00:17:15.378 --> 00:17:18.588
They would hold it up to the sun as an offering, to

00:17:18.588 --> 00:17:21.508
ensure that it would continue to rise each morning.

00:17:22.788 --> 00:17:26.908
Cortés’ account also describes how these heartless bodies would

00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:31.458
be beheaded and then taken to the houses of nobles to be eaten.

00:17:32.788 --> 00:17:36.608
There is some archaeological evidence to support this in the

00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:40.608
form of human bones with cut marks around sites in Mexico City.

00:17:41.448 --> 00:17:46.218
There are also some very grisly illustrations drawn by Europeans in the 16th

00:17:46.228 --> 00:17:52.548
century of Aztec people cooking humans in large cauldrons, in large pans.

00:17:53.868 --> 00:17:59.338
These drawings show the kind of fascination that European society at the time had

00:17:59.368 --> 00:18:05.098
with cannibalism and what they considered to be New World barbarism, and nowhere

00:18:05.238 --> 00:18:09.098
is this more evident than in the work of the Renaissance French philosopher,

00:18:09.389 --> 00:18:14.888
Montaigne, who actually wrote an essay called “Des Cannibales”, or “of Cannibals”.

00:18:16.368 --> 00:18:20.808
At first glance, the essay is about cannibalism, as Montaigne

00:18:20.818 --> 00:18:25.528
describes the cannibalistic practices of the Tupinambá in Brazil.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:32.668
But it’s actually a veiled critique of the idea of European superiority, and in

00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:38.618
it he asks the reader to use reason and critical thinking before dismissing any

00:18:38.628 --> 00:18:44.068
non-Europeans as barbarians, just because they have different cultures and habits.

00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:51.418
Obviously, Montaigne uses cannibalism as an extreme to make his point, but you get the idea.

00:18:52.688 --> 00:18:57.898
Now, while it’s certainly true that many Europeans portrayed peoples from the

00:18:57.898 --> 00:19:02.881
New World as having cannibalistic tendencies, and therefore being barbarous,

00:19:03.148 --> 00:19:08.668
in some cases the evidence is so overwhelming that there is some truth to it.

00:19:09.718 --> 00:19:14.648
And perhaps nowhere is this more true than in Fiji, in the south Pacific.

00:19:15.578 --> 00:19:19.598
In Fiji the eating of people was so prolific that for

00:19:19.598 --> 00:19:23.198
a while the country was known as the Cannibal Isles.

00:19:24.348 --> 00:19:29.748
Here it is thought that the history of cannibalism extends back 2,500 years,

00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:35.098
with bones found all over the islands with the tell-tale signs of butchery.

00:19:36.534 --> 00:19:40.438
Fijian chiefs would eat the flesh of their captured enemies as a way of

00:19:40.658 --> 00:19:45.628
asserting their power, and as a final insult to the person being eaten.

00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:50.248
They even had specially designed wooden forks to eat them with.

00:19:51.548 --> 00:19:55.238
The most prolific cannibal in the world comes from Fiji.

00:19:55.578 --> 00:20:01.338
His name was Ratu Udre Udre and he was a chief in the late 1700s in

00:20:01.338 --> 00:20:05.168
northern Viti Levu, the biggest of the islands that make up Fiji.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.898
Ratu Udre Udre decided to keep a stone for every person that

00:20:10.908 --> 00:20:14.978
he consumed, and these stones still decorate his grave today.

00:20:15.998 --> 00:20:20.658
There are over 800 piled up, but because some have gone missing,

00:20:20.918 --> 00:20:24.848
it is thought that he ate closer to 1000 people in his lifetime.

00:20:25.938 --> 00:20:33.658
And the last known instance of cannibalism in Fiji was in 1867, not much more than a 150 years ago.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:39.588
A Christian missionary called Reverend Thomas Baker came to preach the word of

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:45.088
God, but he, along with his six Fijian students, ended up on the dinner table.

00:20:45.918 --> 00:20:50.148
Indeed the Reverend’s boots are still on display in a museum in Fiji.

00:20:50.922 --> 00:20:57.252
In 2003 Fiji duly issued a public apology to his descendants for eating him,

00:20:57.402 --> 00:21:01.572
but I imagine that they aren’t in a great hurry to take a holiday to Fiji.

00:21:02.702 --> 00:21:09.232
Now, there is also one final kind of cannibalism, which is perhaps somewhat more comprehensible.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.873
This is what’s called survival cannibalism.

00:21:13.453 --> 00:21:17.443
Survival cannibalism is when due to dire circumstances,

00:21:17.573 --> 00:21:20.003
people are forced to eat each other to survive.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:27.913
This might be as a result of widespread food shortages, such as the 1933 famine in Ukraine,

00:21:28.393 --> 00:21:35.443
failed expeditions into remote areas, such as the Donner Party who in 1847 became stranded in

00:21:35.443 --> 00:21:42.153
Sierra Nevada in the United States, or crashes, such as the 1972 Uruguayan Air Force Flight

00:21:42.183 --> 00:21:49.073
571 which came down in the Andean mountains, or even a recent case of a fisherman from El

00:21:49.073 --> 00:21:54.383
Salvador who is accused of eating his friend after getting stranded in the Pacific Ocean.

00:21:55.383 --> 00:21:59.903
This kind of cannibalism is of course a little bit different to the others, because

00:22:00.203 --> 00:22:05.213
in these cases it was literally a last resort, they were doing it out of desperation.

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:11.363
And interestingly enough, perhaps despite what you might expect, in

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:16.973
many countries, including the UK, cannibalism isn’t actually illegal.

00:22:18.013 --> 00:22:22.103
Killing someone obviously is, but eating them well, strangely

00:22:22.103 --> 00:22:25.343
enough, it isn’t technically illegal in the UK at least.

00:22:26.233 --> 00:22:33.543
Now, as we’ve seen, the history of cannibalism is long, complex, and in many instances disputed.

00:22:34.483 --> 00:22:38.763
For some eating human flesh was the ultimate act of conquest

00:22:38.823 --> 00:22:44.133
and a sign of prestige, for others it is a shameful last resort.

00:22:45.513 --> 00:22:50.713
Because the notion, the idea of eating people is now so reviled, and

00:22:50.873 --> 00:22:55.133
considered so revolting, it might seem strange that there are so many

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:59.203
instances across history and prehistory of people eating each other.

00:22:59.913 --> 00:23:05.113
Fortunately, unlike the prehistoric residents of Cheddar or a luckless missionary to Fiji,

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:10.443
in the 21st century we don’t have to worry too much about becoming someone else’s lunch.

00:23:12.053 --> 00:23:16.303
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cannibalism.

00:23:16.673 --> 00:23:21.543
I know it’s an uncomfortable subject, perhaps not one we like to think about too much, but

00:23:21.713 --> 00:23:26.463
it is fascinating to think of the reasons throughout history that have led to cannibalism.

00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:30.203
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:33.393
Did you manage to listen to all of it without getting too disgusted?

00:23:33.963 --> 00:23:37.543
Are there any other interesting or revolting instances of cannibalism?

00:23:38.153 --> 00:23:40.093
Were you hoping I’d mention Hannibal Lector?

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:44.723
I would love to know, so let’s get this cannibalistic discussion started.

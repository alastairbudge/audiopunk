Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.750
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.830
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.710
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.109
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.299
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:20.439
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.599
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.540
talking about Lee Harvey Oswald, the man

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.120
who assassinated an American president.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.930
He was a former marine who defected to

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.860
the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050
A strange man with a complicated past

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:39.694
who, to this day, is still the source

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:41.654
of conspiracy theories about what

00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:44.945
actually happened on that day in 1963.

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:47.654
In this episode we’ll take a look at the

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:50.784
early life of Lee Harvey Oswald, the type

00:00:50.814 --> 00:00:52.974
of man he was, his time in the Soviet

00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:55.610
Union and, of course, the event he was

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.967
most famous for, the assassination of JFK.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.250
As you will no doubt know, there

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.980
are plenty of conspiracy theories

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.850
about whether it was actually

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.870
Oswald who killed him, too many to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.870
go into in this episode in fact.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.370
So, we’ll have a follow-up episode where

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.880
we are going to look at all of these

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.950
theories, and I’ll leave you to decide

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.340
whether there’s any truth to them.

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:22.232
OK, let's get into it and

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:24.702
talk about Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:29.823
It was a sunny November afternoon in 1963.

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:32.284
The city of Dallas was in a

00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:34.534
jubilant mood because the young,

00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:37.364
charismatic and handsome President

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.524
of the United States was in town.

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.664
In Dealey Plaza, a park in downtown

00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:46.674
Dallas, crowds were gathering, excited

00:01:46.884 --> 00:01:50.434
for the arrival of the 46-year-old John F.

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:51.064
Kennedy.

00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:53.924
Dealey Plaza is a flat,

00:01:54.154 --> 00:01:56.214
open area filled with trees.

00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:58.344
There’s a bridge heading to the

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:01.264
motorway on one side, and on the other,

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:03.504
several buildings overlooking the park.

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:06.084
Throughout the morning, people

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.254
lined the street, and sat

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:10.474
waiting on the grassy banks.

00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:14.934
Finally, at 12:30pm the President’s

00:02:14.954 --> 00:02:17.017
convertible limousine turned

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:19.567
into Dealey Plaza and a buzz of

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:21.817
excitement washed over the park.

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:26.367
The limo slowed, and Kennedy smiled and

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:29.297
waved to the crowds, his wife and popular

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:31.850
First Lady, Jackie, sat beside him.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.320
Also in the car were the Governor of

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.500
Texas, John Connolly, and his wife Nellie.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.900
As they rounded the corner

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.155
into the park, Nellie Connally

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:46.472
turned to Kennedy and said: "Mr.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:48.062
President, you can't say

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:49.152
Dallas doesn't love you.”

00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:52.272
It's believed that Kennedy replied,

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.412
"No, you certainly can't" - not knowing

00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:58.682
that they were to be his last words.

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.872
Then suddenly, as Kennedy waved,

00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:04.392
there was a popping noise.

00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:07.182
Most in the crowd thought it was

00:03:07.382 --> 00:03:10.352
fireworks, or a car backfiring, and

00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:12.712
continued waving, and taking photographs.

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:16.797
But there was another shot, and the

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:19.317
President reached up, holding his neck.

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.777
There was confusion for a moment,

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.157
and some in the crowd dropped

00:03:23.187 --> 00:03:24.747
to the floor, taking cover.

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:28.277
Excitement turned to panic, and

00:03:28.297 --> 00:03:30.547
people began running for safety.

00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:34.147
Then, a third shot hit Kennedy

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:37.097
directly in the head, rocked his

00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:39.697
body backwards and sent blood and

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:41.887
brain flying across the limousine.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.937
Instinctively, Jackie Kennedy jumped

00:03:44.937 --> 00:03:46.632
up and leaned over the back of

00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:48.677
the limousine, trying to retrieve

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:50.927
the back of her husband’s skull.

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.030
The limousine tore off,  accelerated

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.880
very quickly, in the direction of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.760
the underpass towards the freeway.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.730
In a panic, the crowd began to run for

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.752
cover, and others turned, looking up.

00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.537
Police raced up the grassy

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.477
knoll, looking for the shooter.

00:04:09.377 --> 00:04:11.817
Witnesses pointed in the direction

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:13.777
they thought the shots had come from.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:16.927
Looking up, they saw a tall

00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:18.870
red-brick building: the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.610
Texas School Book Depository.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.040
Just half an hour later,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.950
at 1:00pm, John F.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.610
Kennedy was pronounced dead at

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.681
the Parkland Memorial Hospital.

00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.601
The President was dead - but

00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:36.131
who had pulled the trigger?

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.691
To understand who, and more

00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.401
importantly why, we need to go back

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.441
almost exactly 24 years, to the 18th

00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:48.901
of October, 1939, in New Orleans.

00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.461
This was the date that a lady called

00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:54.861
Marguerite Frances Claverie gave

00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:58.511
birth to a son, Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:02.391
His father, Robert, died two months

00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:04.801
before Lee was born, so the young boy

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.071
grew up without a father and didn’t

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:09.771
exactly have the easiest of upbringings.

00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:12.461
His mother became an alcoholic,

00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:14.961
and the family moved around a lot.

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.801
In fact, it's believed that by

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:20.121
the time he left school Oswald

00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:22.721
had lived in 22 different places

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.371
and gone to 12 different schools.

00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:29.535
Not an easy start, and this led to Oswald

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.465
skipping school, “truanting” the word is.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.605
When Oswald began truanting, he was

00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:38.185
seen by a psychiatrist at a juvenile

00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:40.635
reform centre, who concluded that the

00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:43.455
young boy had "personality pattern

00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:45.835
disturbance with schizoid features

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:47.865
and passive-aggressive tendencies.”

00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:51.095
The doctor went on: “Lee has to be

00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:53.785
seen as an emotionally, quite disturbed

00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:55.925
youngster who suffers under the impact

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:58.435
of really existing emotional isolation

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:00.870
and deprivation, lack of affection,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.250
absence of family life and rejection by

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.190
a self-involved and conflicted mother.”

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.760
At age 12, Oswald threatened

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.550
a family member with a knife.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.530
And by October of 1956, when

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.900
he was 17, he dropped out of

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.935
high school and joined the U.S.

00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:20.565
Marines.

00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:24.715
But he didn’t really take to, or enjoy

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:27.026
his time there, and was described by

00:06:27.026 --> 00:06:30.136
a fellow Marine as “lonely, aloof,

00:06:30.426 --> 00:06:32.446
and always hating the outfit.”

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.066
Importantly, for our story,

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.346
and for American history, he

00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:39.726
qualified as a marksman, meaning

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:41.876
someone trained to shoot a gun.

00:06:42.846 --> 00:06:45.306
Despite being a US Marine, and a

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:48.046
soldier during the Cold War, the battle

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.172
between Capitalism and Socialism,

00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:53.542
Oswald developed left-wing views, and

00:06:53.692 --> 00:06:56.692
began voicing pro-Soviet sentiment.

00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.482
In fact, he was known among his

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:02.102
fellow Marines as “Osvaldovich”, in

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.182
reference to his left-wing beliefs.

00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:08.422
One Marine said of Oswald that “If you

00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:10.482
complained about, ‘Oh, we’ve got to go on

00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:12.502
a march this morning’ or ‘oh, we’ve got

00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:14.732
to do this this morning,’ scrub barracks

00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:17.392
or whatever we had to do… he would say

00:07:17.632 --> 00:07:19.472
that that was the capitalist form of

00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:21.532
government making us do these things.

00:07:21.762 --> 00:07:23.602
Karl Marx and his form of

00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:25.322
government would alleviate that.”

00:07:26.348 --> 00:07:29.368
As strange as a communist US Marine

00:07:29.538 --> 00:07:32.818
might sound, perhaps this was Oswald

00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:35.378
- the neglected and isolated child,

00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:37.838
remember - it was him searching for

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:40.158
the belonging he hadn’t found in

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:42.908
family life, school or the Marines.

00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:46.478
In his diary, Oswald admitted as

00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:48.788
much, writing “I was looking for

00:07:48.788 --> 00:07:51.008
a key to my environment, and then

00:07:51.228 --> 00:07:53.288
I discovered socialist literature”

00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:56.258
He even taught himself some basic

00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:58.518
Russian from a grammar book, something

00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:00.378
that would come in handy later on.

00:08:01.628 --> 00:08:05.208
On the 11th of September, 1959, not even

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:08.708
3 years after enlisting, he was discharged

00:08:08.718 --> 00:08:10.848
from the Marines, he left the army.

00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:14.935
Just nine days later, at the height of

00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:18.415
the Cold War, Oswald took his pro-Soviet

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.795
studying to the next level and boarded

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:23.305
a boat from New Orleans to France.

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:26.126
From there he went to Southampton,

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:29.085
in England, then flew to Helsinki,

00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.455
was issued a Soviet visa a few

00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:34.015
days later, then crossed the border

00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:36.185
into the Soviet Union and arrived

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:38.605
in Moscow on the 16th of October.

00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:42.415
But Oswald had a problem - a big one.

00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:45.635
His visa was only valid for

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:47.755
a week, so what did he do?

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.135
He immediately tried to get

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:52.185
Soviet citizenship, to become

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:54.115
a citizen of the Soviet Union.

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:56.205
He figured that he would be

00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:58.355
welcomed with open arms, he would be

00:08:58.355 --> 00:09:00.825
welcomed into this communist utopia.

00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:03.865
But unfortunately for Oswald,

00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:06.855
things went somewhat differently.

00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:10.255
According to his personal diary, when

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:12.785
Oswald  met with a Russian visa official

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:15.605
and asked to become a citizen of the

00:09:15.765 --> 00:09:18.208
‘Great Soviet Union’, in his words, he

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:21.098
was told that the ‘USSR is only great in

00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:23.828
literature’ and that he should go home.

00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:28.818
Oswald was crushed, he was devastated.

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.588
He had spent years learning about

00:09:31.588 --> 00:09:34.448
communist theory and Soviet society, he

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.698
had tried to learn Russian, even saved

00:09:36.718 --> 00:09:39.068
up his wages from the Marines to make

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:42.268
the long journey across the Iron Curtain

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.678
only to be rejected once he arrived.

00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:49.388
As he wrote in his diary, “my

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:51.048
fondest dreams are shattered

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.448
because of a petty official.”

00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:56.605
Distraught, three days after

00:09:56.605 --> 00:09:59.348
his 20th birthday, and less than

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:01.038
a week after arriving in the

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:03.708
Soviet Union, Oswald attempted

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:05.925
suicide, he tried to kill himself.

00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:08.175
According to his diary,

00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:10.457
his plan was: “ End it.

00:10:10.907 --> 00:10:13.869
Soak wrist in cold water to numb the pain.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.339
Then slash my left wrist.”

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.840
He survived, and after a stint, a short

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.180
period, in hospital, he was released

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.860
and allowed to stay in the USSR because

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.100
the Soviet authorities feared he

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.120
would cause an international incident

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.590
if he tried to kill himself again.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.890
They sent him to Minsk, now the

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.230
capital of Belarus, where he was

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.830
given work at a radio and TV factory

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.320
and an apartment in the city centre.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.630
He enjoyed a relatively comfortable

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.270
standard of living compared to

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.440
working-class Soviet standards, but

00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:51.626
he was kept under strict surveillance

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:53.046
by the intelligence services.

00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:56.876
Strangely enough, Stanislau Shushkevich,

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:58.876
the man who would go on to become

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:01.206
Belarus’ first post-Soviet head of

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:04.110
state, also worked at the same factory

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.400
as Oswald and was even assigned

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.070
to help him improve his Russian.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.698
In Minsk, Oswald met a lady called

00:11:11.718 --> 00:11:14.408
Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova, and

00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:17.688
they married on April 30th of 1961.

00:11:18.908 --> 00:11:20.918
According to a man called Peter

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.947
Savodnik, who wrote a book about

00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:25.027
Oswald’s time in Minsk, Oswald

00:11:25.027 --> 00:11:28.072
defection was as psychological as

00:11:28.072 --> 00:11:30.362
it was ideological, or political.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.572
Though Oswald did want to be in the

00:11:33.572 --> 00:11:36.762
USSR and do his part for communism,

00:11:37.312 --> 00:11:39.172
Savodnik argues that “he went

00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:40.692
there because he didn't fit in

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:43.057
anywhere else, he was a desperate

00:11:43.257 --> 00:11:45.337
and lonely young man who believed

00:11:45.367 --> 00:11:47.607
that in Russia he would be rescued."

00:11:48.547 --> 00:11:50.817
Oswald was, it seems, still

00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:53.487
looking, yearning for somewhere

00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:54.767
he could feel at home.

00:11:55.977 --> 00:11:59.297
But Soviet life began to wear on the young

00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:02.917
man, and in February of 1962, he wrote

00:12:03.037 --> 00:12:05.117
to the U.S Embassy to report that the

00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:07.917
Soviet authorities were holding him and

00:12:07.917 --> 00:12:10.517
his wife against their will, and that he

00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:13.087
wanted to return to the United States.

00:12:13.977 --> 00:12:16.517
Because he had never formally renounced

00:12:16.707 --> 00:12:19.407
his American citizenship, in June of

00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:22.418
1962, Oswald was given a temporary

00:12:22.428 --> 00:12:25.278
US passport, allowed to return to his

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.938
homeland and arrived in New York with his

00:12:27.938 --> 00:12:30.288
Soviet wife and three-month old daughter.

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:33.888
The family quickly moved to Dallas,

00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:36.498
in Texas, and Oswald travelled

00:12:36.558 --> 00:12:38.268
to New Orleans to look for work.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.648
Struggling to hold a job down, he

00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:43.578
began engaging in political activity,

00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:45.738
claiming that he was a representative

00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:48.538
of a pro-Castro organisation called

00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:50.398
the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

00:12:51.178 --> 00:12:52.968
The New York headquarters of this

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:54.998
organisation, however, denied

00:12:55.138 --> 00:12:56.258
having any knowledge of him.

00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:59.478
One can only imagine what must have been

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.998
going on in his head at the time, but

00:13:02.098 --> 00:13:04.518
we do know for sure what he did next.

00:13:05.528 --> 00:13:08.991
In March of 1963, less than a year after

00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:11.401
returning home, back to the United States,

00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:14.441
he used an alias, or fake name, and

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:17.391
bought two guns: a rifle, and a revolver.

00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:19.821
Now, many people aren’t

00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:21.511
aware of this next part.

00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:25.441
But Oswald actually had a test run, a

00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:28.721
practice, to try out his new weapon.

00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:32.591
Around a month after buying his rifle,

00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:34.851
and just months before he would shoot

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:38.701
Kennedy, Oswald took his rifle to the home

00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:41.801
of an American general, a man called Major

00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:44.481
General Edwin Walker, and shot through

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.531
a window as Walker sat at his desk.

00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:50.781
Walker, who was a very vocal

00:13:51.051 --> 00:13:52.921
anti-communist voice in American

00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:55.771
society, escaped without any injuries.

00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.831
The assailant was never caught, and

00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:02.091
it was only after Oswald's death that

00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:04.050
it was revealed to have been him.

00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:07.135
When he returned to New Orleans, he

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:09.505
took part in a local radio debate and

00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:11.475
proudly declared himself a Marxist,

00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:15.405
and in August of 1963 he was arrested

00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:18.265
for distributing pro-Castro propaganda.

00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:21.989
Strangely enough, he was still given a

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.609
full foreign travel passport – despite

00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:26.569
the fact that he was known to the

00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:28.569
American authorities and had been

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:31.739
interrogated by the F.B.I and C.I.A

00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:33.919
when he returned from the USSR.

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:37.349
Using this new passport, Oswald

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:39.449
travelled to Mexico for a few weeks,

00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:41.879
where he visited the Soviet and Cuban

00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:44.659
embassies and tried to arrange to

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:47.199
travel to the Soviet Union via Cuba.

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:50.679
When he returned to the U.S, he was

00:14:50.754 --> 00:14:53.587
still looking for work, that was, until

00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:55.657
a Russian-speaking friend who had been

00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:58.137
helping Oswald’s wife mentioned that

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.747
a neighbour knew of a job opportunity

00:15:01.173 --> 00:15:03.331
- at a book depository in Dallas.

00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:06.671
Little did the neighbour know that

00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:09.871
their kind offer had unknowingly set

00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.441
the scene for the assassination of

00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:14.401
the President of the United States.

00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:18.351
In Dallas, Oswald rented a single

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:21.641
room under the name O H Lee and began

00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:23.401
working at the book depository, or

00:15:23.561 --> 00:15:26.061
warehouse, only returning to see his

00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:28.211
family in the suburbs on weekends.

00:15:29.341 --> 00:15:30.631
According to the owner of the

00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:32.581
boarding house where he stayed during

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:34.801
the week, Oswald didn’t interact

00:15:34.981 --> 00:15:36.481
with many of the other residents,

00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:38.811
only worked and made phone calls.

00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:41.311
“They were local phone calls and he

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:43.311
always made them in a foreign language."

00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:43.901
they said.

00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:46.621
"I think it was German, or maybe Russian.

00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:48.701
He was really considerate about it.

00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:50.721
If other people were wanting

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:52.041
to phone he would wait.

00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:53.571
He was just about as good a

00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:55.351
tenant as we could wish to have.”

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:59.743
In November of 1963, it was announced

00:15:59.923 --> 00:16:02.093
that President Kennedy would be

00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:04.553
visiting Dallas, and several local

00:16:04.553 --> 00:16:06.613
newspapers published the route that the

00:16:06.613 --> 00:16:08.753
President’s motorcade would be taking.

00:16:09.743 --> 00:16:13.043
It passed, of course, the Texas School

00:16:13.063 --> 00:16:16.263
Book Depository - Oswald’s place of work.

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:20.443
On the night of Thursday the 21st, Oswald

00:16:20.673 --> 00:16:23.023
unexpectedly returned to his family home

00:16:23.323 --> 00:16:25.443
and spent the night - something that

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.963
he only ever really did at weekends.

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:31.967
The next morning, on Friday the 22nd,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.023
Oswald’s 19-year-old neighbour, Wesley

00:16:35.023 --> 00:16:37.033
Frazier, gave him a lift to work.

00:16:38.153 --> 00:16:40.643
Frazier noticed that Oswald was

00:16:40.643 --> 00:16:43.223
carrying a long, heavy parcel.

00:16:44.193 --> 00:16:46.345
It was, Oswald told him, “just

00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:47.765
some window blinds which I’m

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.906
taking downtown to get fixed.”

00:16:51.346 --> 00:16:55.916
At 12:30pm that afternoon, on the 22nd of

00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:59.776
November, Oswald set up his rifle on the

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:01.956
sixth floor of the depository building.

00:17:03.026 --> 00:17:05.066
He waited for the motorcade to

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:08.126
pass, and fired three shots that

00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:10.086
killed President Kennedy as his

00:17:10.086 --> 00:17:12.016
car passed through Dealey Plaza.

00:17:12.754 --> 00:17:14.683
Well, as we will discuss in the next

00:17:14.683 --> 00:17:17.033
episode, that’s the official story.

00:17:18.183 --> 00:17:20.673
As the President’s car sped away and

00:17:20.683 --> 00:17:22.903
the crowd down in the plaza tried

00:17:22.913 --> 00:17:24.443
to make sense of what was going on,

00:17:24.783 --> 00:17:27.333
Oswald fled the scene and took a bus.

00:17:28.253 --> 00:17:30.363
But as there was such a buzz of

00:17:30.363 --> 00:17:32.833
police activity in Dealey Plaza, the

00:17:32.853 --> 00:17:35.243
city quickly filled with traffic.

00:17:35.943 --> 00:17:38.819
Oswald got out and took a taxi back to

00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:41.269
his boarding house, sitting in the front

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.009
seat as was common in the Soviet Union.

00:17:44.949 --> 00:17:47.179
The driver, who hadn’t yet heard the

00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:49.319
news of the President’s assassination,

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:51.699
asked Oswald what all the police

00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:54.009
sirens were for, not knowing that

00:17:54.009 --> 00:17:56.159
he was sitting next to the assassin.

00:17:57.439 --> 00:17:59.909
Oswald said nothing, and stayed

00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:01.849
silent for the entire journey.

00:18:02.849 --> 00:18:05.019
The driver would later say that he

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.879
thought Oswald was “a wino two days

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:10.189
off the bottle,” meaning an alcoholic

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:12.039
experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

00:18:13.269 --> 00:18:15.709
He dropped him off a few minutes from the

00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:17.909
boarding house, and after checking the

00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:20.269
coast was clear, after checking the police

00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:23.219
weren’t following him, Oswald went inside.

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:26.299
The only person there was a housekeeper,

00:18:26.968 --> 00:18:28.559
Earlene Roberts, who was sitting

00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:30.499
watching the television, having

00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:32.009
heard the news of the President’s

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:33.919
assassination just minutes before.

00:18:35.339 --> 00:18:38.479
Around 1pm Oswald, or “Mr.

00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:40.319
Lee” as he was known to the other

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.969
residents, arrived and rushed across

00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:44.519
the living-room into his bedroom.

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:47.329
“You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?” Roberts

00:18:47.329 --> 00:18:50.489
asked him, but Oswald did not respond.

00:18:51.379 --> 00:18:53.619
He left again moments later in a

00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:56.479
different jacket, a pistol stuffed

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:58.579
into the waistband of his trousers.

00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:02.119
Back at the Texas Book Depository, where

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:04.159
police officers were now searching,

00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:06.369
certain that that was where the shots

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:09.259
had come from, the supervisor told police

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.406
that only one man was

00:19:11.406 --> 00:19:14.556
missing: Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:19:15.706 --> 00:19:19.076
At 1.15pm Oswald was stopped by a

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:21.486
Dallas police patrolman named J.D

00:19:21.546 --> 00:19:23.596
Tippit, who thought he matched the

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:25.477
suspect’s description already being

00:19:25.477 --> 00:19:27.297
passed around on the police radio.

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:31.167
Oswald shot and killed Tippit with

00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:33.567
his revolver, and around half an

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:37.147
hour later, at 1.45pm, Oswald was

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.047
captured in the Texas Theatre.

00:19:40.507 --> 00:19:44.617
By 7pm, less than 7 hours after he had

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:46.947
pulled the trigger, he had been formally

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:49.637
charged with the murder of President

00:19:49.637 --> 00:19:52.706
Kennedy, and by then news of Kennedy’s

00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:55.496
assassination had spread around the world.

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:59.134
Oswald, the outcast Marine who had

00:19:59.134 --> 00:20:01.924
defected to the Soviet Union, had shot

00:20:02.264 --> 00:20:05.004
dead the President of the United States.

00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:08.194
So why did he do it?

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:10.824
According to one of Oswald’s

00:20:10.834 --> 00:20:13.074
friends, Paul Gregory, he didn’t

00:20:13.084 --> 00:20:15.624
even particularly dislike Kennedy.

00:20:16.184 --> 00:20:18.394
In fact, the family kept a copy of

00:20:18.394 --> 00:20:20.284
Time Magazine with Kennedy on the

00:20:20.284 --> 00:20:22.774
front cover on display in their home.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:26.434
Priscilla McMillan, a friend of Oswald’s

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.284
wife, even said that “Lee liked Kennedy.”

00:20:29.474 --> 00:20:30.964
“He liked him in civil rights.

00:20:31.134 --> 00:20:32.904
He disliked him for the Bay of

00:20:32.904 --> 00:20:34.634
Pigs invasion of Cuba,” she said.

00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:36.884
“But insofar as he spoke about

00:20:36.924 --> 00:20:39.044
Kennedy, it was to praise him.”

00:20:40.057 --> 00:20:42.277
As we’ll see in the next episode,

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.567
there are many, many different

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:47.137
theories as to why - and indeed

00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:49.167
how - Oswald killed Kennedy.

00:20:50.317 --> 00:20:52.747
But if we accept the official version

00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:55.647
of events for a moment, perhaps Oswald,

00:20:55.827 --> 00:20:58.206
despite actually quite admiring Kennedy

00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:00.666
on a personal level, decided that

00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:03.196
killing him was the best way to send

00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:05.816
a political, or ideological message.

00:21:07.056 --> 00:21:10.286
With Cold War tensions at their peak in

00:21:10.296 --> 00:21:13.636
1963, maybe Oswald thought that killing

00:21:13.636 --> 00:21:15.836
the symbol of American power - the

00:21:15.836 --> 00:21:18.196
president - would please the Soviet

00:21:18.196 --> 00:21:21.076
Union and that he would, finally, find

00:21:21.076 --> 00:21:23.706
the place he belonged, the place he

00:21:23.706 --> 00:21:25.756
had been searching for his entire life.

00:21:27.066 --> 00:21:30.676
But as you probably know, this is not the

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.556
end of the story of Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:36.926
On the morning of the 24th, less than

00:21:36.936 --> 00:21:40.771
48 hours after shooting JFK,  Oswald was

00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:42.931
being led through the underground car

00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:45.111
park of the Dallas police station to be

00:21:45.111 --> 00:21:47.727
transferred to an interrogation office.

00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:50.512
The small space was filled with a

00:21:50.577 --> 00:21:52.777
crowd of reporters and police officers,

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:55.687
and there was very little security.

00:21:56.707 --> 00:21:59.657
Nonetheless, Oswald was taken through

00:21:59.657 --> 00:22:02.627
the crowd with two officers by his side.

00:22:03.597 --> 00:22:05.987
James Leavelle, one of the Dallas police

00:22:05.987 --> 00:22:09.127
officers who was at his side, later said,

00:22:09.707 --> 00:22:11.897
“I put the handcuffs on him, and in the

00:22:11.907 --> 00:22:14.977
process of doing that, I more in jest kind

00:22:14.977 --> 00:22:17.577
of said, ‘Lee, if anybody shoots at you,

00:22:17.687 --> 00:22:19.347
I hope they’re as good a shot as you are.”

00:22:20.617 --> 00:22:23.387
Oswald, he said, “kind of laughed and he

00:22:23.387 --> 00:22:25.937
said, ‘Oh, you’re being melodramatic,’

00:22:26.087 --> 00:22:27.387
or something to that effect.

00:22:27.587 --> 00:22:29.387
‘Nobody’s going to shoot at me.'”

00:22:30.587 --> 00:22:33.607
Anyway, as Oswald emerged from the

00:22:33.607 --> 00:22:37.277
station, a man named Jack Ruby, a

00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:39.830
nightclub owner with ties to the

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.804
Chicago underworld, approached

00:22:41.864 --> 00:22:44.314
Oswald and shot him in the stomach.

00:22:45.479 --> 00:22:47.400
Everyone stood around in

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.920
shock for a second, as Oswald

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.310
screamed and fell to the floor.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.560
He was taken to Parkland Memorial

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.290
hospital - the same hospital where

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.440
Kennedy died just two days before.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.950
At 1.07pm, Oswald was pronounced dead.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.120
As the incident was being broadcast

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.960
on television, millions of Americans

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.840
watched Oswald’s assasination live.

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:19.550
As you may know, I’ve just given

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.050
you the official version of events.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.404
That Lee Harvey Oswald acted

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:26.840
alone was the final conclusion of

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.260
the Warren Commission - the body set

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.086
up to investigate the assassination.

00:23:31.712 --> 00:23:34.092
Yet the assassination of John F.

00:23:34.092 --> 00:23:36.262
Kennedy [and Oswald’s role in

00:23:36.262 --> 00:23:38.172
it] is perhaps the most popular

00:23:38.362 --> 00:23:40.232
conspiracy theory of all time.

00:23:40.942 --> 00:23:43.702
It is, you could say, the mother of

00:23:43.782 --> 00:23:45.812
all conspiracy theories - the one

00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:48.422
that even the most rational, trusting

00:23:48.422 --> 00:23:51.072
people believe has some truth to it.

00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:54.572
For many people, something about

00:23:54.572 --> 00:23:58.302
that day in 1963 smelled fishy,

00:23:58.702 --> 00:23:59.912
it just wasn’t quite right.

00:24:01.162 --> 00:24:03.472
Whether it be Oswald’s time in the

00:24:03.472 --> 00:24:05.762
Soviet Union, and conspiracies that

00:24:05.762 --> 00:24:07.782
he was a Soviet hitman sent to strike

00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:10.342
a blow in the Cold War, or Jack

00:24:10.342 --> 00:24:12.562
Ruby’s mafia connections - indeed,

00:24:12.792 --> 00:24:14.802
Kennedy’s supposed mafia connections.

00:24:15.382 --> 00:24:17.622
Or even the fact that he was walked

00:24:17.652 --> 00:24:20.052
through an open car park with minimal

00:24:20.062 --> 00:24:23.138
security just days after assassinating

00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:25.228
the President of the United States.

00:24:26.338 --> 00:24:28.938
Many Americans don’t believe the Warren

00:24:28.938 --> 00:24:31.758
Commission’s findings; that a lone gunman,

00:24:31.996 --> 00:24:34.276
one man alone, could kill the President.

00:24:35.356 --> 00:24:38.336
A Gallup poll from March of 2001

00:24:38.616 --> 00:24:41.335
found that 81 percent of Americans

00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:43.335
believed there were other people

00:24:43.495 --> 00:24:45.275
involved in Kennedy’s death.

00:24:45.915 --> 00:24:48.825
Just 13 percent believed

00:24:49.025 --> 00:24:50.775
that Oswald acted alone.

00:24:51.795 --> 00:24:54.245
Indeed, the focus of the next episode,

00:24:54.345 --> 00:24:56.595
a follow-up to this one, will be some

00:24:56.615 --> 00:24:58.595
of the most widely-believed conspiracy

00:24:58.595 --> 00:25:01.175
theories about what really happened

00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:03.335
on that fateful November afternoon.

00:25:04.785 --> 00:25:07.225
But it is important to remember that

00:25:07.245 --> 00:25:10.105
Oswald was, at the very least, involved.

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:13.215
He was a US Marine who defected

00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:14.825
to the Soviet Union, afterall.

00:25:15.045 --> 00:25:17.775
A trained marksman who hated American

00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:20.495
capitalism and everything it represented.

00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:23.375
A man who, wherever he went in the

00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:26.125
world, never seemed to quite fit in

00:25:26.395 --> 00:25:28.885
and lived a mysterious life, travelling

00:25:28.885 --> 00:25:31.435
around and interacting with political

00:25:31.435 --> 00:25:34.206
radicals, Soviet and Cuban spies.

00:25:35.566 --> 00:25:38.496
Some say he was personally instructed to

00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:40.886
kill Kennedy by the leader of the Soviet

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:43.745
Union, others say Oswald was the gunman

00:25:43.935 --> 00:25:46.375
in the biggest mob killing of all time.

00:25:47.255 --> 00:25:49.395
There are few who debate that Lee Harvey

00:25:49.395 --> 00:25:52.395
Oswald pulled the trigger, but to the

00:25:52.395 --> 00:25:54.955
question of “why”, and “with whose

00:25:54.955 --> 00:25:58.745
help?”, well that is a question that seems

00:25:58.795 --> 00:26:01.701
like it might never truly be solved.

00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:06.354
OK then, that is it for today’s

00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:08.944
episode on Lee Harvey Oswald - the

00:26:08.944 --> 00:26:10.634
man who killed the president.

00:26:11.234 --> 00:26:12.574
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:26:12.644 --> 00:26:14.824
and whether you knew a lot about Lee

00:26:14.824 --> 00:26:16.664
Harvey Oswald, or you didn’t know

00:26:16.664 --> 00:26:19.004
much about his backstory at all, well

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:20.454
I hope you learned something new.

00:26:21.234 --> 00:26:23.424
As always, I would love to know

00:26:23.424 --> 00:26:24.934
what you thought of this episode.

00:26:25.374 --> 00:26:27.074
Why do you think Lee Harvey

00:26:27.074 --> 00:26:28.874
Oswald killed John F.

00:26:28.874 --> 00:26:29.284
Kennedy?

00:26:29.644 --> 00:26:30.874
Do you believe he was

00:26:30.874 --> 00:26:32.094
the only person involved?

00:26:32.744 --> 00:26:34.504
How might the world have been

00:26:34.504 --> 00:26:36.714
different if the bullets had missed?

00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:39.274
I would love to know, so let’s

00:26:39.274 --> 00:26:40.674
get this discussion started.

00:26:41.044 --> 00:26:42.054

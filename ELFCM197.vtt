Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:16.666
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:21.026
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:26.776
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Highwaymen.

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:35.216
For a period of around 150 years, starting in the mid 17th century and continuing until

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:41.496
the start of the 19th century, travelling around Britain was a dangerous business.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:47.986
The roads were bad, it took a long time, the nights were cold, and the days were wet.

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:52.221
But there was a much greater danger: highwaymen.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:58.902
Men who would rush out in front of your coach, point a gun in your face, and say

00:00:59.032 --> 00:01:05.202
the infamous words, “your money or your life”, whereupon you would be forced to hand

00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:10.182
over whatever money you were carrying, and you would be able to continue on your way.

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:15.542
These men, and occasionally women, will be the subject of this episode.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:22.162
On our travels we’ll cover who exactly these people were, why they did what they did, the

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:28.282
circumstances that allowed them to do it, what they actually did, what happened to them if they

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:34.702
were caught, why and when this stopped being a problem, the legacy they left behind, and of

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:40.992
course along our journey we’ll hear the stories of some of the most famous of the highwaymen.

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:45.402
OK then, let’s jump right into it.

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:51.782
Let’s start our story with a little history recap, because an understanding

00:01:51.932 --> 00:01:56.732
of what was happening, and what had happened, in Britain by the early 19th

00:01:56.752 --> 00:02:02.215
century is vital for an understanding of what caused the growth of highwaymen.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:09.107
The English Civil War had taken place between 1642 and 1651.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:15.395
This involved nine long and bloody years of fighting, and a side called the

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:22.135
Parliamentarians, otherwise known as the Roundheads, the anti-monarchists, were victorious.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:28.285
King Charles I was executed, and supporters of the king, known as

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:33.916
Royalists, or Cavaliers, had to live under this new,  republican government.

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:41.716
Many of these Royalists would have had extensive military experience fighting in the civil war.

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:47.736
They had access to weapons, they knew how to use them, and they were angry.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:51.876
They had lost the war, and their enemies were in power.

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:58.286
Anyone who has lived in a country that has experienced civil war knows all too

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:04.486
well that even when the war is over, there is a lot of underlying tension between

00:03:04.486 --> 00:03:09.882
the winning and the losing side, and this certainly doesn’t disappear overnight.

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:16.052
On a socio-economic level, people were starting to move to towns

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:20.942
and cities, the country was starting the process of urbanisation.

00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:29.162
Trade routes were opening up, which meant an increase in people travelling between towns and cities.

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:38.162
The first railroad wouldn’t be built until 1825, but there was a relatively extensive road network.

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:43.629
If you wanted to go from one town to another, you had to travel by road.

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.589
The roads, although relatively extensive, were not good quality.

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:56.019
A carriage and its horses might travel at around 8 kilometres per hour, a fast walking pace.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:02.999
The banking system was still pretty basic - the Bank of England was only established

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.794
in 1694 - and if you wanted to move money from one place to another, you really

00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:15.886
needed to take it yourself, often in the form of gold coins, physical money.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:20.876
What’s more, there had been technological advances with guns,

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:24.756
and the invention of something called the flintlock pistol.

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:32.656
This allowed the holder to pull a trigger, a small piece of flint was brought into contact

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:38.966
with steel, and the sparks caused the gunpowder to explode and push the bullet out.

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:44.376
Before this, the way in which a shot was fired was much more complicated,

00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:48.506
and involved keeping a lit fuse and using that to fire the bullet.

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:54.793
Long story short, this new flintlock pistol, this new gun, meant that

00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:59.403
someone could prepare their gun to be ready to fire whenever they wanted.

00:05:00.573 --> 00:05:05.883
A combination of all of these factors created the ideal conditions for highwaymen:

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:12.183
People who had experience fighting but now no employment, an increased number of people

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:18.713
moving between cities having to carry larger amounts of money, conditions that meant they

00:05:18.713 --> 00:05:24.203
were easy to catch up with, and a deadly weapon that meant it was easy to threaten people.

00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:32.403
One such man, one such product of this environment and of these factors was a

00:05:32.403 --> 00:05:38.631
man called James Hind, a man who earned the nickname of The Royalist Highwayman.

00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:44.481
After fighting on the losing, Royalist, side in the English Civil War, he

00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:50.241
wanted to find a way to continue his quest against the Parliamentarians, people

00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:56.051
he held responsible for the murder of the true King of England, King Charles.

00:05:57.101 --> 00:06:01.761
He took to the roads, ambushing, laying in waiting for travellers,

00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:05.481
then jumping out at them and taking all their belongings.

00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:13.851
Crucially, he only attacked Parliamentarians, he only attacked the side that won in the civil war.

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:19.261
As the attacks grew, so did the stories of his exploits.

00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:24.261
By this time there was growing circulation of newspapers in England.

00:06:24.721 --> 00:06:30.861
And much like in the 21st century, in the 16th century, 500 years before,

00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:36.801
people loved stories of criminals on the run, especially criminals with

00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:42.931
what was, to some, a noble purpose, of only stealing from “bad” people.

00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:49.081
It’s hard to separate the real James Hind from the James Hind as he

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:53.531
was portrayed in the newspapers at the time, but he had a lot of the

00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:58.321
attributes of the “good criminal”, a sort of Robin Hood type figure.

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:02.161
He would avoid violence, unless he had to.

00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.901
He was brave, and would go straight up to the carriage of the person

00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:11.701
he was robbing, look them in the eyes, utter the words “Stand and

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:16.781
Deliver”, and allow them to escape alive if they gave him their money.

00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:23.321
This, by the way, is contrasted with the expectation of what a common thief

00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:28.711
might do, which would be to attack someone while they weren't looking, perhaps

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:34.361
hit them over the head or even kill them, and then rob them of their belongings.

00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:39.871
So, Hind was in many respects a “gentleman thief”.

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:47.371
His fame continued to grow when he tried to rob the most famous Parliamentarian in the country,

00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:53.121
Oliver Cromwell, who was the Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland at the time.

00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:58.148
Cromwell was essentially the most powerful person in the country, and

00:07:58.158 --> 00:08:03.065
the man who had ordered the execution of the previous king, Charles I.

00:08:03.872 --> 00:08:08.948
Hind’s attempt to rob Cromwell didn’t go to plan, Cromwell’s carriage

00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:13.618
was much better protected than Hind had expected, and Hind only

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:19.208
escaped by riding so fast and for so long that his horse actually died.

00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:22.038
Or so the newspapers reported it…

00:08:22.838 --> 00:08:25.688
And the eventual fate of James Hind?

00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:32.338
Well, as will be a theme with all of the highwaymen subjects in this episode, Hind’s

00:08:32.358 --> 00:08:39.448
life as a highwayman was adventurous, bold, made for a good story, but… short.

00:08:40.408 --> 00:08:47.338
He was captured in 1651, tried as a traitor, and hung, drawn and quartered.

00:08:48.418 --> 00:08:55.218
This was unusual because the normal punishment for being a highwayman was being hung, not

00:08:55.228 --> 00:09:01.554
being hung drawn and quartered, which was reserved for the even more serious crime of treason.

00:09:02.464 --> 00:09:08.134
There are some historians who believe that Cromwell was so angry after Hind’s

00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:14.494
attempted robbery that he personally made sure that Hind received a traitor’s death.

00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:20.417
Hind may have had political motivations when he decided to become a highwayman,

00:09:20.844 --> 00:09:26.084
but later highwaymen, especially after the Parliamentarians were kicked out

00:09:26.304 --> 00:09:31.334
and the monarchy restored in 1660, were not in it for political reasons.

00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:38.774
Of course, we do not have detailed insight into the exact motivations behind every highwayman,

00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:46.664
but their actions suggest that they were in it for the money, the glory, or for the thrill.

00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:50.314
And for some, it was a combination of all three.

00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:55.684
The next highwayman we’ll meet is actually French, although he

00:09:55.684 --> 00:09:59.094
is much more famous in England than the country of his birth.

00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:07.084
His name was Claude Du Vall, and he is perhaps the most famous example of the “Romantic Highwaymen”.

00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:12.144
He moved to England as a young man, during the period of

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:16.024
the Restoration, when King Charles II was put on the throne.

00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:21.874
He started off his career working as something called a footman, a man

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:26.394
whose job was to follow and protect the carriage of a wealthy person.

00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:31.874
Footmen were normally chosen because of their physical attributes.

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:36.514
They needed to be strong, so they could help people in and out of the

00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:41.564
carriages, and push or pull the carriage if it got stuck in the mud.

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:47.504
They also needed to be handsome, to be physically attractive, because they were an

00:10:47.504 --> 00:10:53.634
extension, or perhaps even a reflection, of their masters, of the people inside the carriage.

00:10:54.884 --> 00:11:00.064
In the age of the Highwayman, they also needed to be good with weapons, because

00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:05.184
part of their job was protecting the carriage against this external threat.

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:12.904
Being a footman was, in many respects, the best possible training for a Highwayman.

00:11:13.604 --> 00:11:21.964
It’s not clear exactly when Du Vall switched from protecting carriages to attacking them, but as

00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:28.654
a highwayman he gained a reputation for being a fashionable gentleman, someone who would never use

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:35.321
violence, and always be polite and courteous to the people he robbed, especially towards women.

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:41.881
There is a famous story about one carriage he attacked, which has gone

00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:46.351
down in history as an example of the true character of highwaymen.

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:50.721
Legend has it that he had stopped a carriage on the road.

00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:53.671
Inside were a man and his wife.

00:11:54.161 --> 00:12:00.671
The carriage held 400 pounds, the equivalent today of around €100,000.

00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:06.034
The woman, to try to show that she was not afraid, pulled out a

00:12:06.044 --> 00:12:10.979
small musical instrument called a flageolet, and started to play.

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:15.699
Du Vall, being a cultured gentleman, also pulled out

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:19.589
his flageolet, and they played together for a while.

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:26.469
Then - and bear in mind this is in the middle of a robbery, for which the punishment

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:32.139
was death - Du Vall politely asked the man whether he could dance with his wife.

00:12:33.049 --> 00:12:40.689
The man responded that he could, and then Du Vall and the lady danced together outside the carriage.

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:45.299
Du Vall was, reportedly, an excellent dancer, and when the

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:49.779
dance was finished he helped the lady back up onto the carriage.

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:56.359
The man then proceeded to give Du Vall 100 pounds, a quarter of the amount that he had on him.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:01.599
Instead of demanding the rest, Du Vall responded that “This hundred

00:13:01.609 --> 00:13:06.659
given so generously is better than ten times the sum taken by force.

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:12.769
Your noble behaviour has excused you the other three hundred which you have in the coach with you.”

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:20.359
Now, this may be legend, and it certainly makes for a good story, but it demonstrates

00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:26.689
how highwaymen were portrayed - normally not as violent criminals, but as gentlemen,

00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:33.549
brave and noble men whose job just so happened to involve stealing from others.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:41.299
Stories such as this one of Du Vall must have made being stopped by a highwayman an exhilarating

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:48.369
experience - yes, you might be being robbed, but you had heard so much about these noble,

00:13:48.469 --> 00:13:54.289
charismatic robbers, that you might well have been very curious to see one for yourself.

00:13:55.579 --> 00:14:02.649
Despite Du Vall’s reputation as a charismatic gentleman, he was, of course a thief, and when

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:09.929
he was eventually captured, aged only 27, he was given the punishment for his crimes, hanging.

00:14:10.709 --> 00:14:14.859
The message on his tombstone is revealing of the two things

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:18.879
he is remembered for: theft and his popularity with women.

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.389
It reads:

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:24.709
“Here lies Du Vall, reader, if male thou art,

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:28.689
Look to thy purse; if female, to thy heart.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:34.029
So, that’s an old style of writing, but it means if you

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:37.269
are a man, keep an eye out for your purse, your wallet.

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:44.009
And if you are a woman, look out for your heart, because that is what Du Vall was going to steal.

00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:49.162
In the interests of balance, it’s important to stress that

00:14:49.162 --> 00:14:52.982
not all Highwaymen were like James Hind and Claude Du Vall.

00:14:53.572 --> 00:14:59.482
Many would use great violence against their victims, and by the time the law caught

00:14:59.522 --> 00:15:06.342
up with them they weren’t tried for simple robbery, but murder, rape, and worse.

00:15:07.152 --> 00:15:12.322
Perhaps the most famous Highwayman in British history was a man called

00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:17.772
Dick Turpin, who terrorised the English roads in the early 18th century.

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:24.232
He wasn’t particularly famous when he was alive though - his fame only came after his

00:15:24.242 --> 00:15:30.762
story was taken up by a Victorian novelist 100 years after his death, and he was the main

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:37.092
character in a hugely popular novel called Rockwood, which romanticised his exploits.

00:15:38.412 --> 00:15:46.301
In this book, Turpin is a romantic Highwayman, and in order to give himself an alibi for a crime

00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:52.861
he rides his horse so fast and so far, all the way from London to York, that the horse dies.

00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:59.091
In the popular imagination Dick Turpin is this dashing, romantic

00:15:59.101 --> 00:16:04.931
hero, but the history books suggest that this is far from the truth.

00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:10.031
He was involved with a violent gang who robbed houses,

00:16:10.181 --> 00:16:13.801
raped women, and murdered anyone who stood in their way.

00:16:14.671 --> 00:16:18.451
He probably also shot and killed one of his partners,

00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:22.051
and was eventually captured for stealing horses.

00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:29.071
It’s not exactly the glamorous life of a gentleman thief that many might remember it as.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.086
And while we are on the subject of exceptions to the popular

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:39.526
idea of the highwayman, not all highwaymen were, well, men.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:44.946
One such example was a lady called Lady Katherine Ferrers.

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:52.366
Now, you may know that in English if you are called Lady something, it is a formal, noble title.

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:59.536
Lady Katherine Ferrers was an aristocrat, she was a rich lady who lived in a large house.

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:04.850
What possible reason did she have to become a Highwaywoman?

00:17:05.706 --> 00:17:10.536
Well, she came from a Royalist family, and during the time of the

00:17:10.536 --> 00:17:15.786
Parliamentarians, many Royalists fell into serious financial difficulties.

00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:19.266
She may have seen that her fortune was starting to

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:22.886
shrink, and felt that she needed to do something about it.

00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:29.166
Being a highwayman could be a lucrative profession, it could be a quick way of making some money.

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:32.976
Or, she might have just enjoyed the thrill.

00:17:33.626 --> 00:17:39.456
For a woman in 17th century England, society’s norms were pretty strict,

00:17:39.546 --> 00:17:44.826
there were strict codes of behaviour that you were expected to adhere to.

00:17:45.536 --> 00:17:51.316
And stopping strangers on the roads, pointing a gun in their faces and robbing them, well

00:17:51.556 --> 00:17:56.766
that was certainly something very different to what most 17th century women were up to.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:03.146
So, legend has it, after dinner was over, Lady Katherine Ferrers would

00:18:03.146 --> 00:18:09.446
slip into a secret side room, get changed into men’s clothes, put

00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:14.636
on her hat and mask, get on her horse and ride out into the night.

00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:20.696
Unlike James Hind or Claude Du Vall, she did not display gentlemanly behaviour.

00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:25.536
She was a cold-blooded killer, and would murder coach drivers

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:29.256
and their passengers even if they gave her their money.

00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:34.696
So, what happened to this aristocrat-turned-robber-murderer?

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:36.596
Well, you guessed it.

00:18:36.596 --> 00:18:39.706
Her criminal career wasn’t to last for long.

00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:47.676
Sometime in 1660, when she was only 26 years old, she was shot during an attack.

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:53.056
She managed to ride all the way back home, but died of her wounds.

00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:58.936
Her crimes were covered up by her servants, and indeed there is still

00:18:58.956 --> 00:19:04.136
doubt about exactly what she did, but her legend certainly lives on.

00:19:05.086 --> 00:19:11.637
Now, thankfully in Britain at least, we do not have to worry about Highwaymen or Highwayladies.

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:17.186
The entire career choice of Highwayman became significantly less popular

00:19:17.186 --> 00:19:22.756
and less attractive in the early 19th century for a number of reasons.

00:19:23.606 --> 00:19:29.546
Firstly, a mounted police force was created in 1805, so police

00:19:29.576 --> 00:19:33.706
officers would patrol the roads on horseback during the night.

00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:38.626
Secondly, advances in the banking system meant that

00:19:38.626 --> 00:19:42.356
people simply didn’t need to carry much money with them.

00:19:42.876 --> 00:19:47.696
A situation where someone would carry the equivalent of €100,000,

00:19:47.696 --> 00:19:51.776
as in the story of Claude Du Vall, was just far less likely.

00:19:52.617 --> 00:19:58.536
Thirdly, the Industrial Revolution had caused cities to expand even further out,

00:19:58.746 --> 00:20:04.166
so there were fewer completely isolated stretches of road close to the cities.

00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:10.566
There were also far more people travelling, so it was just busier on the roads.

00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:15.196
Long story short, being a highwayman was both a lot less

00:20:15.236 --> 00:20:18.935
profitable, and you were much more likely to be caught.

00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:24.695
The punishment was still death by hanging, and this was enough of

00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:29.425
a deterrence to end the era of the Highwayman once and for all.

00:20:30.235 --> 00:20:37.266
But while the last time someone was executed for highway robbery in Britain was in 1802,

00:20:37.399 --> 00:20:43.499
the legend of the highwayman has certainly endured, but it is one of contradiction.

00:20:44.089 --> 00:20:46.439
On the one hand, they were criminals.

00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:52.759
They stole from people, they killed people, they made the simple act of travelling from one

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:58.669
place to another an act that could cost you your life and all the money you had in the world.

00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:04.779
But, on the other hand, they are often remembered as noble gentlemen, people who

00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:10.599
may have sort of been criminals, but they were gentlemen first and criminals second.

00:21:11.199 --> 00:21:16.759
In some cases, and for some people, they even had good intentions, such as only

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:23.294
taking from bad, Parliamentarians, and living by a certain code of moral honour.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.209
They still attract fascination, and there have been countless books

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:32.649
and films made about the lives of Highwaymen, which almost always

00:21:32.929 --> 00:21:37.739
present them as misunderstood gentlemen rather than violent thieves.

00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:45.009
It’s hardly surprising, really, and there is still this fascination with the “gentleman thief”.

00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:49.659
French listeners will be familiar with Arsène Lupin, there’s

00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:53.469
The Thomas Crown Affair, or the Ocean’s Eleven films.

00:21:53.799 --> 00:22:00.049
And of course there are countless more of these kinds of stories, and of these kinds of thieves.

00:22:00.429 --> 00:22:07.289
Thieves who commit crimes but somehow, the more we know about the thief, and especially

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:13.219
if the thief doesn’t use violence and doesn’t really need to commit the crime in the

00:22:13.219 --> 00:22:19.609
first place, the more we are able to justify their actions, and almost admire them.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:27.852
And when it comes to highwaymen, the myth of the gentleman thief is so powerful that for many

00:22:27.852 --> 00:22:33.672
people they are a subject of admiration, and really aren’t remembered as criminals at all.

00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:41.348
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Highwaymen.

00:22:41.912 --> 00:22:45.202
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:45.642 --> 00:22:49.392
We have only really spoken about Highwaymen in Britain, but of

00:22:49.392 --> 00:22:52.722
course Britain was far from the only country with Highwaymen.

00:22:53.052 --> 00:22:56.712
So, what stories about Highwaymen are there from your country?

00:22:57.122 --> 00:22:58.352
How are they remembered?

00:22:58.732 --> 00:23:00.282
Gentlemen or thieves?

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:01.962
Or a combination of the two?

00:23:02.372 --> 00:23:06.382
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started - the

00:23:06.382 --> 00:23:10.292
place to go for that is community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:23:11.072 --> 00:23:15.942

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:16.241
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:21.311
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.611
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about electric cars.

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:31.541
We'll go into the history of electric cars and the

00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:34.421
history is probably a lot longer than you think it is.

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:39.281
We'll talk about why people love them, why people don't love them so

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:44.171
much, and of course we won't forget to mention Tesla and Elon Musk.

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:49.901
This is actually a request from one of our members, Didier, from France.

00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:53.291
So thank you,Didier, I think it's going to be a great episode.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:59.276
And if you are wondering how you can be more like Didier and do stuff like request

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:04.436
episodes, access all of the learning materials that come with the podcasts, unlock

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:09.866
a load of bonus member only episodes and come to our member only sessions, then

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.706
I'd definitely recommend checking out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:18.616
The place to do that is leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:21.946
Okay then, electric cars.

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:27.356
I said that the history of electric cars is a bit longer than you might think it is.

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:32.096
In fact, electric cars go back almost 200 years.

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:36.806
They have been around for a similar amount of time as petrol cars.

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:42.926
And for a while, it wasn't clear which of petrol, steam or

00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:46.946
electricity would be the way in which cars were powered.

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:53.291
The mid 19th century has been called 'the golden age' of the electric car.

00:01:54.131 --> 00:02:01.271
Throughout the US and Europe, intrepid inventors were creating new electric powered vehicles.

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.861
Electricity had several advantages over the other

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:09.221
competing ways of powering a car - steam and petrol.

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:16.031
Steam, which seemed like the natural way to power an engine, given its use

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:21.791
in train and ship engines often took a long time to actually get started.

00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:26.051
It could easily take 30 minutes to start a steam engine,

00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:30.761
which made it pretty impractical for any kind of shorter trip.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:36.821
Petrol engines on the other hand took less time to start, but

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.881
they still took a while and required some heavy manual labour.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:46.886
I'm sure we all have in mind, old films where starting a car meant going to

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:52.066
the front and turning a crank around and around until the engine started.

00:02:53.416 --> 00:03:00.796
Plus this was before the discovery of huge oil deposits, so petrol was a lot more expensive.

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:07.756
Electricity seemed like it could have been the future, even almost 200 years ago.

00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:14.981
It didn't emit any fumes, which made it an attractive choice for polluted cities like

00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:22.601
London, electric cars were easy to start and compared to a petrol or steam powered car, it

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:28.541
was just a lot easier to manage, it wouldn't break down so much and was a lot more reliable.

00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.071
This made them very popular for city driving.

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:41.246
Interestingly enough, early electric cars were actually marketed towards women drivers in cities

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:46.436
because they were easier to start, and because there wasn't that much that would go wrong with them.

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:55.336
So much so that these cars actually got a reputation for being for women, and as an attempt to

00:03:55.336 --> 00:04:03.896
not put off potential male buyers, some manufacturers added a fake radiator to the front, a fake

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:10.346
grill to the front, to make them look like they were petrol cars and suitable for a male driver.

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:16.876
However, there were a few problems with these early electric cars, some

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:21.886
of which you might recognise to be criticisms of electric cars today.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:29.056
Firstly, they had relatively short ranges, they couldn't go very far without a charge.

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:36.041
Secondly, and on a related note, the electricity grid didn't stretch very far.

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:43.131
Even at the turn of the 20th century, having electricity at home was rare in the US

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:48.911
and Europe and finding anywhere to charge your electric vehicle was almost impossible.

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:54.866
Just to put things in perspective, though, even though electric cars were relatively

00:04:54.866 --> 00:05:01.076
popular as cars go, they were still something that only the richest in society could afford.

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:08.606
It was only around a hundred years ago that cars started to outnumber horses for the first time

00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:16.106
in the United States, and a car was a huge expense, out of reach for most people in society.

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:21.386
The tables turned in 1908, though, something happened,

00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:24.476
which changed the course of the automobile industry.

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:27.756
The Ford model T was released.

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:35.256
Now we aren't going to talk at length about this, but this car was the first affordable car.

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:42.336
It cost $825, which is today's equivalent of about $18,000.

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:48.291
An electric car cost around three times as much, and the

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:52.881
model T and petrol powered vehicles started to dominate.

00:05:53.901 --> 00:05:56.541
It was curtains for the electric car.

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:03.351
It wasn't until around 60 years later during the oil crises of

00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.791
the 1970s that people started thinking about electric cars again.

00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:15.751
The oil price was fluctuating a lot, it went up and down huge amounts, and people thought

00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:23.581
that powering cars with electricity as opposed to petrol would mean that they weren't tied to

00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:30.641
circumstances outside their direct control, the price of electricity wasn't liable to huge spikes.

00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.141
Car manufacturers experimented with a few different types of

00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.431
electric cars, but nothing that really captured the market.

00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:45.711
They were still too expensive, couldn't go very far and were just quite

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:51.801
unappealing compared to the breadth of choice and the low cost of petrol cars.

00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:55.814
Then in 2003, Tesla launched.

00:06:56.024 --> 00:07:02.714
And in 2008, it launched its first, all-electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster.

00:07:03.884 --> 00:07:09.524
The importance of this wasn't the number of cars that it sold - it only sold

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:17.954
2,450 - but rather the fact that a company could come out of nowhere led by people

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:24.509
without real car manufacturing experience, successfully produce an electric car that

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:30.209
was far better than everything that the huge manufacturers had been able to make and

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:35.519
also attract a cult following, to actually make an electric car that people wanted.

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:41.749
The Roadster could go for almost 400 kilometres on a single battery

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:48.499
charge, and it could go from zero to 60 miles an hour in 3.7 seconds.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:51.209
It was a real serious car.

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:59.459
The fact that Tesla managed this got all of the executives at big car companies thinking and

00:07:59.789 --> 00:08:06.609
in the past 15 years or so, almost every manufacturer has released its own electric cars.

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:11.189
Some have sold very well, things like the Nissan Leaf, for example.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:13.439
Others, well, they're pretty awful.

00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:19.829
So electric cars are enjoying a new renaissance, and most industry

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:25.049
experts agree that the future of personal transport will be electric.

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:32.039
However, electric cars are not without their critics and it's worth spending a

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:37.919
moment just to talk through some of the more popular arguments against electric cars.

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:43.859
Firstly, there is the fact that even though an electric car doesn't pollute

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:48.164
its local environment, it doesn't have smoke coming out of its back like

00:08:48.164 --> 00:08:52.934
a petrol or diesel car, this electricity still has to come from somewhere.

00:08:54.254 --> 00:09:00.494
Secondly, and this is really a related point is that electric cars are a lot more

00:09:00.494 --> 00:09:07.934
environmentally unfriendly to produce than petrol or diesel powered cars, and so even

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:13.694
if you are saving the environment by driving an electric car, actually producing the

00:09:13.694 --> 00:09:19.729
thing results in far greater emissions than it would do for a petrol or diesel car.

00:09:20.749 --> 00:09:26.899
And thirdly, the fact that electric cars need large batteries with rare earth and other

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:33.109
precious metals means that they are responsible for using up these vital resources.

00:09:33.884 --> 00:09:37.544
Let's take point number one and two first as they are linked,

00:09:37.814 --> 00:09:41.174
then we'll come onto the rare earth and precious metals question.

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:49.514
So the basic point is that electric cars aren't actually as good for the environment as you think.

00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:54.104
They use energy that might have been created by burning fossil fuels,

00:09:54.464 --> 00:10:00.254
and a lot of fossil fuels are used in the manufacture of an electric car.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:06.934
To assess the carbon footprint of anything you need to look at its entire

00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:12.344
life cycle: how much carbon is used making it, transporting it, actually

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:17.414
using it, then disposing of it when it comes to the end of its life.

00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:20.564
Let's just do that with electric cars.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:25.664
It's certainly true that it currently requires more energy to make

00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:29.654
an electric car and more to dispose of it at the end of its life.

00:10:30.614 --> 00:10:34.574
This difference is caused by the carbon required to make

00:10:34.574 --> 00:10:38.114
and dispose of the battery, which isn't insignificant.

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:43.769
So the start and the end of an electric car's life are more polluting than

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:48.744
the petrol or diesel powered equivalents, but where it is also interesting

00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:53.874
is to calculate the emissions of an electric car when it's actually in use.

00:10:55.194 --> 00:11:00.054
To calculate the emissions from the electricity that goes into powering an electric

00:11:00.054 --> 00:11:04.404
car, you need to understand where the electricity in that country comes from,

00:11:04.884 --> 00:11:10.734
because exactly the same electric car driven in exactly the same way could have a

00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:16.404
very different carbon footprint based on where it plugs in to charge its battery.

00:11:17.804 --> 00:11:23.294
In a country like China or India, where a large proportion of the electricity comes

00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:29.296
from coal powered sources, an electric car isn't very environmentally friendly at all.

00:11:29.806 --> 00:11:35.216
It might not have smoke coming out of the back of it, but that smoke is coming out of a

00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:41.126
factory hundreds or thousands of kilometres away as that is where the electricity was produced.

00:11:42.146 --> 00:11:49.046
If you contrast this with a country like Paraguay or New Zealand, where the majority of electricity

00:11:49.226 --> 00:11:55.496
comes from renewable sources, that electric car becomes a lot more environmentally friendly.

00:11:57.046 --> 00:12:03.656
To help you understand the scale of this, an electric car in Paraguay emits, essentially,

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:11.406
zero grammes of CO2 per kilometre when it's in use, whereas one in India emits 300 grammes

00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:17.816
of CO2 per kilometre, which is actually comparable to many American petrol powered cars.

00:12:19.316 --> 00:12:24.757
When you factor in the carbon footprint of manufacturing and disposing of it when it's

00:12:24.757 --> 00:12:31.342
finished, over an average lifetime it works out to around 70 grammes of carbon per kilometre.

00:12:32.742 --> 00:12:39.612
So going back to our example of Paraguay over an electric car's lifetime it averages around 70

00:12:39.612 --> 00:12:46.182
grammes of CO2 per kilometre, but in India it would be around 370 grammes of CO2 per kilometre.

00:12:46.602 --> 00:12:50.412
That's 300 grammes for the electricity and 70 grammes for

00:12:50.412 --> 00:12:54.492
the manufacturer and disposing, so it's five times more.

00:12:55.354 --> 00:13:00.094
Overall, unless you are driving an electric car in a country that is powered

00:13:00.094 --> 00:13:06.514
by dirty energy, by electricity generated by things like coal, an electric car

00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:11.074
over the course of its life will be a more environmentally friendly choice.

00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:12.664
It's really quite simple.

00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:20.524
The third point, however, is a little more complicated and that's relating to rare earth

00:13:20.554 --> 00:13:25.984
elements and precious metals, the special elements that go into the batteries that we find in

00:13:25.984 --> 00:13:32.814
a huge amount of modern technologies from smartphones to computers, but also in electric cars.

00:13:33.654 --> 00:13:38.604
We actually just did a member's only episode on rare earths, it came out a few days ago,

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:44.244
so we aren't going to go into that in huge detail here, but I'll give you a little idea.

00:13:45.141 --> 00:13:51.281
Rare earth elements are, contrary to what you might think, not actually that rare, they

00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:57.731
are just difficult and therefore expensive to extract, to separate from other elements.

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:06.251
Around 80 to 95% of all the world's rare earths come from China and getting them out

00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:12.551
of the Earth's crust is dangerous and often highly environmentally damaging work.

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.606
Electric cars have got huge batteries and require much

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.996
more rare earths than let's say your mobile phone.

00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:27.566
The batteries that go into electric cars also need large amounts of things like cobalt.

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:32.846
60% of the world's cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of

00:14:32.846 --> 00:14:38.096
Congo, and there are some real valid concerns about working conditions

00:14:38.096 --> 00:14:42.386
there, as well as the environmental impact that these mines have.

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:49.016
So electric cars aren't as completely carbon free and zero impact on

00:14:49.016 --> 00:14:53.066
the planet as some people think they are, but they are a considerably

00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:57.476
better choice than pretty much anything that is powered by fossil fuels.

00:14:58.916 --> 00:15:03.746
Of course, the emperor of electric cars is the boss of Tesla, Elon Musk.

00:15:04.451 --> 00:15:11.785
If you haven't heard about him, he has a cult-like following, and although Tesla does make excellent

00:15:11.743 --> 00:15:18.432
cars in its own right, he has his own distinct personality and he is inseparable from Tesla.

00:15:19.942 --> 00:15:26.412
Investors, large and small, are betting that Elon Musk, and with him Tesla, is

00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:31.872
going to be the person and company that drives wide-scale electric car adoption.

00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:36.262
And Tesla's share price has zoomed up this year.

00:15:37.182 --> 00:15:43.062
It seems to go up and up every day, so no doubt by the time you listen to this, this

00:15:43.062 --> 00:15:50.892
number will be out of date, but it started 2020 at a price of $430, and when I just

00:15:50.892 --> 00:15:57.792
looked, it was at $2,200, a more than five times increase in just under nine months.

00:15:59.407 --> 00:16:04.387
Although Tesla may be at the front of the pack, there is growing appetite

00:16:04.477 --> 00:16:08.797
around the world for electric cars from almost every manufacturer.

00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:14.467
In April this year, electric cars accounted for 17% of

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:18.667
all car sales, which was up from 7% the year before.

00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:25.672
Electric cars are nothing new, and we've heard about how a hundred years ago their

00:16:25.672 --> 00:16:31.072
bright future was erased by the arrival of cheap petrol and cheap petrol cars.

00:16:32.122 --> 00:16:36.412
But this time in 2020, I think it would take a brave person to bet

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:40.762
against Elon Musk, against Tesla, and against an electric future.

00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:46.442
Okay then, that is it for electric cars.

00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:48.062
I hope it's been an interesting one.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.029
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.669
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.139
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Black Friday,

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.989
discounting, and how companies trick you into buying things you don’t really need.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:39.209
This episode is going to be released on the 27th of November, and

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.369
it might be the biggest shopping day in US and European history.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:47.079
If it’s not, the only reason will be due to the pandemic.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:53.539
So today we are going to talk about where this comes from, how it has developed over the years,

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:00.089
and some of the tricks that companies use to get you to do what they want, not what’s best for you.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.319
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can follow along to

recommend you do so, the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.089
OK then, Black Friday.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:44.359
Just in case you hadn’t heard of Black Friday, it’s the day after Thanksgiving

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.009
in America, which always falls on the fourth Thursday of November.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.919
It’s the day when shops offer all sorts of discounts and sales, in order to

00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:01.099
encourage people like me and you to buy stuff that we may or may not need.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.629
It certainly works.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:11.319
In 2013 Americans spent $1.93 billion, and that number has

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.839
been going up and up every year, reaching $7.3 billion in 2019

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.819
.
It’s not a uniquely American concept either.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:29.329
It’s now big business in the UK, as well as throughout Europe and further afield.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.439
No doubt you have been bombarded with offers this week, 50% off this,

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:41.449
80% off that, buy one get one free, and all sorts of tempting deals and

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.049
discounts to get you to buy everything from dog food to English courses.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.509
Now Black Friday has morphed, it has changed into an

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:57.179
extended period of seemingly endless discounts and deals.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:05.619
These discounts and deals are now extended for weeks before and after Black Friday, and this

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:13.649
time of year has turned into a 24/7 battle between companies for your attention, and your money.

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.109
So, where did this all come from?

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:23.289
Discounting, the offering of incentives to get people to buy something

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:29.159
is nothing new, and indeed can be traced back to the late 19th century.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.199
We’ll talk about that in a minute.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.739
Although it’s not exactly clear when shops first started offering discounts on

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.259
the day after Thanksgiving, there seems to have been an unwritten rule that shops

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:49.889
wouldn’t aggressively advertise or offer promotions until the day after Thanksgiving.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.819
Shoppers knew this, so they would wait until the day after Thanksgiving to do

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.449
their shopping, knowing that they would be able to buy things at lower prices.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:09.419
This is thought to have started around the beginning of the 20th century, but back then

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:15.289
people had less disposable income, there were fewer gadgets, fewer objects to tempt you.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.679
As disposable income continued to grow, consumerism increased, and

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.799
people had more money in their pockets and more things to spend it on,

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.169
they continued to spend more and more on this Friday after Thanksgiving.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.109
In order to compete, shops would open early, 7 o'clock in

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:41.869
the morning, then 6, 5, and some even opening at midnight.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.249
Shoppers would descend on city centres to queue up and get these

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.569
deals from all around, causing huge problems with traffic and parking.

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:59.159
And it's indeed from this that Black Friday gets its name.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.819
Now there’s a popular misconception that the name comes from shops going into the black.

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:12.009
In business if you are ‘in the black’, it means that you are making a

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.709
profit, and if you are ‘in the red’, it means you are making a loss.

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.879
The theory goes that it was only on the Friday after Thanksgiving,

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.489
when retailers would start offering promotions and shoppers would start

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.679
their Christmas shopping that shops would go ‘into the black’ again.

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:39.099
For some industries, things like children’s toys, they do make the vast majority of

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.899
their money during the holiday season, and so for some businesses no doubt this is true.

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.789
But the name Black Friday actually isn’t related to this at all.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.749
It started to be used in the mid-1960s in Philadelphia.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.989
There is an annual American football game on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, which

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.879
brings thousands of people into the city, and this combined with all the shoppers

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:14.809
hunting for Black Friday discounts would cause huge problems with traffic, both cars

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:20.289
driving into the city and the huge amounts of people around, hunting for bargains.

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:29.069
So the city’s police force started referring to it as Black Friday, and the name just stuck.

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.459
With the arrival of the internet, another shopping holiday was created,

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:41.476
Cyber Monday, in 2005, which is the Monday after Black Friday and this is

00:06:41.486 --> 00:06:46.866
yet another opportunity for you to be parted with your hard earned money.

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:54.526
The entire 4 day period is now a feast of consumerism, and no doubt you

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:59.076
are already being bombarded with temptations from all sorts of companies.

00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:06.016
So, that’s where Black Friday comes from, but now I want to talk a little bit

00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:12.536
about the history of discounts, and the psychology of making you buy stuff.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:18.716
Discounting, or someone getting a lower price for something than normal, was never

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:24.506
really invented, of course, or at least it wasn’t invented at a single point in time.

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:32.236
Any kind of transaction always involves an element of negotiation, and someone

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:37.246
is more likely to agree to it if they feel that they are getting good value.

00:07:37.996 --> 00:07:42.146
That’s just human nature - we like feeling that we’re getting a good deal.

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:47.946
The first person to really popularise the idea of the mass-discount

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:53.246
was actually a man called Asa Candler, the co-founder of a company

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:57.076
that you will have heard of, and you might well be a customer of.

00:07:57.886 --> 00:07:58.606
Coca-Cola.

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:07.246
When it was just getting started, as an unknown brand, Coca-Cola needed people to try its product.

00:08:08.536 --> 00:08:13.246
Candler knew that lots of people liked it after they tried it, so

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:18.376
it was surely just a question of getting enough people to try a Coke

00:08:18.676 --> 00:08:23.126
and then a certain percentage of them would become regular customers.

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:29.096
The avenue that the company had been pursuing was to work on its marketing,

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:33.436
telling people how delicious Coke was and how they should try it.

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:40.316
But to taste it they had to be sufficiently persuaded to buy it first.

00:08:41.516 --> 00:08:47.296
Candler had a different idea about how to get people to taste their first Coke.

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:54.046
Why not give out coupons for a free glass of Coke, to allow people to

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:59.206
try it, then they would like it so much that they’d buy it the next time.

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:07.086
This was an idea that had been tried by an accountant at Coca-Cola, but on a small scale.

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:15.016
Candler decided to do it en masse, and ended up giving away 8.5 million

00:09:15.016 --> 00:09:20.226
coupons for glasses of Coke, sending it to people through the post.

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:28.516
People thought he was mad, but it was one of the things that really catapulted Coca-Cola into

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:35.046
the category of ‘household name’, and it’s now one of the most valuable brands in the world.

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:41.876
Since the success of Coca-Cola, discounting is a strategy that is employed

00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:46.846
by almost all companies, especially around the Black Friday period.

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:51.526
And there are companies that are built purely on discounts.

00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:59.356
Groupon, which was once a 16 billion dollar company, exists just to give people discounts.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:04.456
And couponing is big business all over the world.

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:10.966
People love feeling that they have got a great deal, even if they really haven’t.

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:17.986
And this is a psychological weakness that retailers exploit, that companies exploit.

00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:25.076
With lots of products, especially digital products where the cost of distribution

00:10:25.086 --> 00:10:31.596
is effectively zero, companies offer seemingly huge discounts all the time.

00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:37.826
If you’ve ever bought a digital English course you’re probably aware of this.

00:10:38.926 --> 00:10:45.026
They might have a ‘sticker price’, a supposed ‘normal’ price of $300,

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:49.686
but only today it’s available to you for the bargain price of $30.

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:55.516
But who decides whether it’s actually worth $300 or not?

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:59.736
The company puts that price on there, knowing that

00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:03.706
most people will never pay $300, but it doesn’t matter.

00:11:04.836 --> 00:11:10.106
You are more likely to buy it if it says 90% off, if it says

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:15.996
$30 instead of $300, rather than just saying the price is $30.

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:21.766
I’m on the mailing list for a few English courses and I see this all the time.

00:11:22.236 --> 00:11:28.446
There’s one that you might know that every few days sends an exclusive offer for

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:36.716
€9.99 or €14.99 a year, promising that the normal price is €89 or something like that.

00:11:37.766 --> 00:11:44.536
Of course, long-term this erodes trust that consumers have in the company, and the brand.

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:49.106
The supposed ‘full price’ just becomes irrelevant,

00:11:49.536 --> 00:11:52.506
as we know that there’s always a discount coming up.

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:57.726
I’m sure you can think of examples of things that you buy that you

00:11:57.726 --> 00:12:02.116
would never pay ‘full price’ for, you just wait for the discount.

00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:05.116
I can certainly think of lots in my life.

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:10.446
I want to just leave you with a few examples of how companies

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:14.816
use discounts and offers to try and get you to make a purchase.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:22.646
You no doubt know about things like using 9.99 instead of 10, and offering

00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:27.996
2 for 1 deals, but here are a few tricks that you might not have realised.

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:36.076
Firstly, savvy companies, smart companies, will use what’s called the rule of 100.

00:12:37.426 --> 00:12:44.016
This means that if the product’s normal price is less than 100, they will use a

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:50.186
percentage discount, but if it’s greater than 100 they will use the number amount.

00:12:51.246 --> 00:13:01.216
For example, if a product’s normal value is €50 and the discounted price is €40 they will say it’s

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:11.006
20% off, not €10 off, because 20% seems bigger than €10, even though in this case it’s the same.

00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:18.066
And if the product’s normal value is €150 and the discounted

00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:24.626
price is €100 they’ll say it’s €50 off, not 33% off.

00:13:25.546 --> 00:13:26.196
See what I mean?

00:13:27.236 --> 00:13:29.756
So that’s one thing to look out for.

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:36.646
The second one that I think is quite interesting is that it’s been shown that prices

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:44.046
with fewer syllables, prices that are quicker to say, tend to lead to higher sales.

00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:46.856
Let me show you an example of this.

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:53.096
Let’s take two prices, 27.82 and 28.16.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:14:01.446
27.82 has 7 syllables, while 28.16 has 5.

00:14:02.706 --> 00:14:09.116
28.16 is obviously the higher price, but researchers showed that

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:14.566
people perceived it to be lower, because it has fewer syllables.

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:21.106
Even if you aren’t actually saying the price, your brain subconsciously

00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:27.046
encodes the audio version, and because it’s longer you are subconsciously

00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:31.386
more likely to think it’s more expensive, even if it’s not.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:39.516
Our third one is something that a lot of retailers do, and this is called phased discounting.

00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:47.606
Instead of offering one big discount for an entire week they will slowly lower

00:14:47.646 --> 00:14:52.216
and lower the discount so that it’s back at its original price at the end.

00:14:53.366 --> 00:15:00.306
The idea here is to encourage people to buy it at the lower price because they think

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:05.896
the price will go up, and for people coming later on in the discount period, they are

00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:11.956
probably less price conscious, so they’ll be happy to pay a slightly higher price.

00:15:12.856 --> 00:15:19.536
So, there are three things that you can watch out for if you are evaluating any Black Friday offers.

00:15:20.256 --> 00:15:25.746
The one thing you can do if you want to do the equivalent of Odysseus tying

00:15:25.746 --> 00:15:31.786
himself to the mast and putting beeswax in his ears to not be tempted by the

00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:39.326
siren’s song is to take part in the anti-Black Friday, called Buy Nothing Day.

00:15:40.326 --> 00:15:46.726
You probably don’t need me to explain what happens on Buy Nothing Day, the clue is in the name.

00:15:47.896 --> 00:15:54.966
It’s an international protest against consumerism, a protest against the fact that we are buying

00:15:54.966 --> 00:16:02.266
more and more stuff that we probably don’t need, engaging in a non-stop dance of overconsumption.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.066
How you take part is easy, and it’s also free.

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:09.206
You just don’t buy anything.

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:17.046
Some people protest in different, more active ways, for example going into stores and

00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:23.046
symbolically cutting up credit cards or pretending to walk around stores like zombies.

00:16:24.036 --> 00:16:28.626
But the easiest way to take part, if you so wish, is just to buy nothing.

00:16:29.826 --> 00:16:33.026
The one question you might still have on your mind is what

00:16:33.346 --> 00:16:37.126
Leonardo English is doing, if anything, for Black Friday.

00:16:38.226 --> 00:16:44.006
If you were hoping here for some huge discount or offer, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.

00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:51.346
I thought long and hard about this, but we are sitting out, we’re not participating in Black Friday.

00:16:52.176 --> 00:16:56.406
And I want to end this episode with telling you why that is.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:01.596
In case you weren’t aware, Leonardo English, the little company that

00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:06.726
makes this podcast is a 100% independent, self-sufficient company.

00:17:07.386 --> 00:17:14.086
We don’t do adverts or sell data, we have a membership where you can access all of our episodes and

00:17:14.086 --> 00:17:20.136
get all of the transcripts, the subtitles for the podcast, and you can hover over any unknown word

00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:26.186
and get its definition, as well as lots of other cool things like meetups and a growing community.

00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:29.776
I want to build it into the most interesting way for

00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:32.906
curious people like you to improve their English.

00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:39.176
It’s already, I think at least, and this has also been the feedback from our members,

00:17:39.556 --> 00:17:45.056
very good value, and it has been getting better all year without me raising the price.

00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:51.916
I could, of course, increase the supposed ‘normal’ price and then offer a ‘discount’, bringing it

00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:58.096
back to the original price and perhaps getting more people to take the plunge and become members.

00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:02.486
But I don’t think this is right, it’s bad business,

00:18:02.746 --> 00:18:05.636
and it’s not a sustainable long term thing to do.

00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:11.591
And for all the members who had joined they’d feel a bit silly to have

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:17.046
just joined at the normal price if there was some huge, arbitrary discount.

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:22.436
And what happens to lots of language learning companies that do this

00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:26.956
is  they end up with is a load of people who have been pushed into buying

00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:31.216
something that they don’t really need, so they never end up using it.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:34.236
And these are both bad, in my view.

00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:38.796
So, no Black Friday discounts or promo codes here.

00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:41.146
I guess you can take this two ways.

00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:44.826
You can either think ‘what a load of rubbish!

00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:49.746
I think I’m now tempted by the 90% off offers I’ve been bombarded with

00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:52.736
for the past week, at least it feels like I’m getting a discount’.

00:18:53.976 --> 00:18:57.916
Or you can think ‘thanks for the explanation, that all sounds fair enough’.

00:18:58.916 --> 00:19:04.066
Or you can sit out Black Friday altogether, flying the flag of Buy Nothing Friday.

00:19:05.236 --> 00:19:07.916
The choice is, of course, yours to make.

00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:11.576
Just make sure you don’t fall for any of the

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:14.686
discounting tricks you’ve learned about in this episode.

00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:22.646
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Black Friday and Discounting.

00:19:23.226 --> 00:19:26.446
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:27.556 --> 00:19:31.196
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

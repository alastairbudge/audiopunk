Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.758
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:21.178
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:27.208
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series

00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:32.508
on troubled but iconic American musicians of the 1950s and 60s.

00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:40.468
In part one we learned about Ray Charles, the boy who was born dirt-poor and was completely blind

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:46.928
by his 7th birthday, yet managed to become one of the most successful musicians of his generation.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:54.898
In part two we heard about Johnny Cash, “The Man in Black", and his wild and tragic life.

00:00:55.928 --> 00:01:03.498
And now, in part three it is on to the man they called “The King of Rock & Roll”, Elvis Presley.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:10.658
It’s the story of a cult generational icon, of what happens when you are the most famous

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:17.428
young man in 1950s America, an object of love and adoration by millions of teenagers.

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:25.238
But it’s also a tale of excess, of huge tragedy and wasted talent, and all

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:30.758
ended very sadly, in a bathroom when Elvis Presley was only 42 years old.

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:35.519
OK then, Elvis Presley.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.929
Elvis was born on January 8th, 1935, three years after

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.829
Johnny Cash and four and half years after Ray Charles.

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:52.119
The America he was born into was not a prosperous one.

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:56.719
America was just getting back on its feet after the Great

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.799
Depression, and Elvis’s parents were constantly struggling for money.

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:10.429
There’s even a legend that a 4-year-old Elvis, after hearing his parents yet again arguing

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:16.329
over money, told them to be quiet and promised that he would buy them a Cadillac one day.

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:22.899
Well, if he did indeed say this, he was correct, and this boy growing up

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.799
in a poor family in a small town in Mississippi, in the deep south of the

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.689
United States, would go on to be the highest selling artist of all time.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.149
Although Elvis found success at a young age, he came up against plenty of hurdles

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:44.919
on his way, and there are countless stories of people telling him he had no

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.599
talent, that he couldn’t sing, and that there was no way he would be a star.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.459
He almost never even picked up a guitar in the first place.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.489
The story goes that for his 12th birthday he wanted either a rifle or a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.109
bicycle, but his mother refused, thinking that they were both too dangerous.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.839
Instead, she bought the young boy a guitar, and he started taking guitar lessons.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:20.601
Elvis had shown some talent for music before, but wasn’t anything special.

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:26.081
He had entered a singing competition the year before, but came fifth.

00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.351
His teachers, on his report card, considered him to be an average

00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:36.631
student, he certainly showed no signs of what he would later become.

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.731
He was, by all accounts, just a normal student - a well-behaved

00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:46.151
young boy, he kept his hair short like other boys at the time, was

00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:50.901
polite, studied hard in school, but was nothing out of the ordinary.

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:56.541
It was to be the following year, when the family moved to Memphis,

00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:01.971
Tennessee, when Elvis started to first cultivate his own image.

00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:08.671
Memphis was a big city, filled with new and intriguing types of music.

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.711
It was very different from the small town Elvis had grown up in.

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:21.541
People dressed in a different way, and the young Elvis started to cultivate his own image.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:26.101
He grew long sideburns and grew his hair longer.

00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:31.681
He also started to add shoe polish to it to make it dark black.

00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:35.801
His natural colour when he was a boy was blondish.

00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:36.841
It was light.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:43.411
By this time he had set his sights on music as a career, and

00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:47.180
spent more and more time playing guitar, and jamming with friends.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.730
His style was a mixture of Southern-gospel and country, and he had

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.310
this unique voice that sounded to many people like he was black.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.050
After he graduated from high school in 1953, he decided that he wanted to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.720
record himself, reportedly because he had never actually heard himself sing.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.360
He went to the studio of Sun Records, which incidentally was the record label that

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.270
would go on to sign Johnny Cash a year later, and paid his $4 to record himself.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.890
Now, it’s thought that Elvis knew exactly what he was doing - he

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.830
wanted to be spotted, and this was a great way of doing it.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.990
He knew exactly what he sounded like, and there were far cheaper ways to

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.710
record yourself, Elvis didn’t need to go to the studio of a record label.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.810
In any case, when he walked into the studio, guitar in

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.700
hand, the receptionist asked him what kind of singer he was.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.700
He responded “I sing all kinds.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.070
I don’t sound like nobody”.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.970
He recorded two songs, and was noticed by the boss of

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.070
Sun Records and recorded as a “good ballad singer”.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.190
But nothing happened after that.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:17.780
Presley was forced to take a job as a delivery driver, driving trucks, where he was paid $1 an hour.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:26.105
He tried out for a few bands, but had no luck, even once being rejected by one singer who

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:31.865
famously told him to stick to driving trucks because “you’re never going to make it as a singer”.

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:39.115
It wouldn’t be until a year later, in 1954, that Elvis got his big break.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:46.495
He was back in Sun Records, and after failing to play anything that excited the record label

00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:54.025
bosses, was fooling around in the studio playing a cover of a blues song called “That’s all right”.

00:06:55.105 --> 00:07:00.275
When the boss of Sun Records, Sam Phillips heard it, he rushed into the studio.

00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:03.255
This was the sound he was looking for.

00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:07.595
It was recorded, and played on the local radio station.

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:13.025
It was such a hit that it was played multiple times, and people

00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:17.105
kept on calling in to the radio station to ask who it was.

00:07:18.385 --> 00:07:23.875
Elvis started touring, but he only really had one song, “That’s all right”.

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.810
He would play the song over and over, there were literally

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.770
concerts where this one song would be played on repeat.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:38.750
In 1954, by the way, when he first found success, he was only 19 years old.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:48.740
For his first stage performances, he was a shadow of the confident sex-icon Elvis that he became.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:55.680
Indeed, he was incredibly shy and nervous, he was not the confident man that you might imagine.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:02.510
And in fact it was a combination of being nervous and trying to keep the rhythm

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.550
of the music that caused him to move his legs and hips from side to side.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.630
But as soon as he did this, as soon as he moved his hips around, the

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:19.650
crowd, especially the young female members of the crowd, cried out in joy.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.790
This was something incredibly new and wild for 1950s America.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.030
Singers might click their fingers or move around a little

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.630
bit, but not their hips, and nothing at all sexual.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.330
There was Elvis, a very good-looking young man with a

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.440
guitar thrusting his hips around in a sexual manner.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.990
As the tours continued, the adoring female fans continued to

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.370
grow in number, and would do anything to grab Elvis’s attention.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.310
He would be mobbed by adoring fans, with girls just wanting to touch him.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:07.640
This female attention caused him to become the target of a lot of male jealousy, and in

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.622
some towns he would have to have a police guard to stop jealous young boys attacking him.

00:09:14.952 --> 00:09:18.622
It wasn’t only out of jealousy that some people disliked him.

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:24.632
Religious ministers considered him to be leading the nation’s youth astray.

00:09:25.312 --> 00:09:31.342
One reverend told his congregation that “Elvis Presley is morally insane” and

00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:37.772
another lamented that “his stage antics are intended to arouse the lower instincts.

00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:39.802
Apparently he is succeeding.”

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:47.262
There was even a letter sent to the director of the FBI from a Catholic church

00:09:47.492 --> 00:09:52.882
warning that "Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.

00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:59.712
... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.”

00:10:00.902 --> 00:10:03.552
Elvis Presley was certainly getting noticed.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:11.902
By 1955, shortly after his 20th birthday, he also got a new manager, a man named

00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:18.612
Colonel Tom Parker, who was to be a very powerful force in Elvis’ life and career.

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:26.672
Although he claimed to be called Tom Parker and to have been born in the United States, he was

00:10:26.722 --> 00:10:33.382
actually born in the Netherlands, and his real name was Andreas Cornelis [Dries] van Kuijk.

00:10:34.812 --> 00:10:41.812
Parker, his new manager, cultivated this image of Elvis Presley as a sex symbol, making

00:10:42.002 --> 00:10:47.632
Elvis tell a reporter that he had 25 girlfriends, but don’t worry ladies, Elvis wants you

00:10:47.632 --> 00:10:52.572
to know that you too can become one of his twenty five if you buy a ticket to his show.

00:10:53.692 --> 00:10:57.542
This new manager, Colonel Tom Parker, is thought to have

00:10:57.552 --> 00:11:02.192
controlled and squeezed Elvis, profiting greatly from his success.

00:11:03.432 --> 00:11:09.202
Parker took between 25% and 50% of all of the money Elvis made, and

00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:13.922
exerted very tight control over the direction of Elvis’s career.

00:11:14.892 --> 00:11:21.162
Although he can justifiably be accused of exploiting Elvis, he was certainly an

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:27.332
important part of Elvis’s success, and understood what the real appeal of Elvis was.

00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:35.182
By 1956, Elvis had several number one singles under his belt, and was popular

00:11:35.192 --> 00:11:40.992
on the radio, but to really experience Elvis you had to see him perform.

00:11:41.652 --> 00:11:47.612
And the best way for as many people as possible to see that was for him to go on TV.

00:11:48.962 --> 00:11:54.882
Parker managed to book Elvis to go on TV, on a popular show called the Ed Sullivan Show.

00:11:56.072 --> 00:12:01.282
Elvis’ first TV appearance came on September 9th of 1956,

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:06.461
when he was a mere 21-year-old, and performed Hound Dog.

00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:16.761
And 60 million people tuned in to see him, a record-breaking 83% of the entire TV audience.

00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:22.433
For many people, this was the first time they had seen Elvis.

00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:26.868
They might have heard him, but they had never seen him on stage.

00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:32.138
And what they saw was shocking, shockingly provocative.

00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:39.688
In particular, what Elvis did with his groin and his crotch, his famous sexualised movement

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:46.488
of his hips, was considered to be too provocative for mainstream TV audiences of the time

00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:53.688
The host, Ed Sullivan, complained about it, even saying that he thought Elvis had a coke bottle

00:12:53.818 --> 00:12:59.589
hidden in his trousers, and said “We can’t have this on a Sunday night - this is a family show”.

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:05.989
But, being provocative, and being very handsome, sells, and

00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:11.119
after this TV appearance he was catapulted to household fame.

00:13:12.588 --> 00:13:18.868
His next record, “Love Me Tender”, had a record-breaking one million pre-orders,

00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:24.118
and he was simply the biggest and most in demand musician in the world.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:31.218
Elvis concerts were characterised by his walking onto the stage to the screams of

00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:37.378
young girls, then he would start playing, typically Hound Dog, to much more screaming.

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:42.638
The irony of this all was, perhaps, that he really wasn’t

00:13:42.638 --> 00:13:46.208
considered by anyone to be a very talented musician.

00:13:47.438 --> 00:13:53.988
Reportedly he never actually wrote any of his own music - he was listed as a co-writer

00:13:54.028 --> 00:13:59.608
of most of his songs, but this is believed to have been a demand by his record label.

00:14:00.968 --> 00:14:06.848
And he was obviously quite good at the guitar, but nothing he did on the guitar was revolutionary.

00:14:07.668 --> 00:14:13.028
Elvis’s talent and appeal came from Elvis Presley the performer.

00:14:13.798 --> 00:14:15.643
He looked and acted the part.

00:14:15.828 --> 00:14:21.098
He was an incredibly handsome young man, and had an amazing presence.

00:14:22.108 --> 00:14:27.518
It was, therefore, perhaps no surprise that both he and his manager thought

00:14:27.608 --> 00:14:33.408
the next logical step for him was Hollywood, to make it as a movie star.

00:14:34.398 --> 00:14:41.298
The idea was that the movies would help sell his music, and not only would Elvis’s fame

00:14:41.308 --> 00:14:48.018
grow even larger but he, and everyone involved with him, would grow fabulously wealthy.

00:14:48.978 --> 00:14:55.688
And so, starting in 1956 with Love Me Tender, he set out on a career

00:14:55.728 --> 00:15:00.718
as an actor, and starred in 31 films over the course of his career.

00:15:01.938 --> 00:15:08.048
They almost all did well commercially, because, well, he was Elvis and people wanted to see him.

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:13.648
But they were very poorly reviewed - they weren’t great films.

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:19.768
They were formulaic, the stories were boring, and Elvis really wasn’t a very good actor.

00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:25.638
He was becoming fabulously wealthy though, and by the late 1950s,

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:31.008
when he wasn’t even 25, he had more money than he could ever wish for.

00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:36.748
He was rich enough to buy anything he wanted, and do anything he wanted.

00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:43.908
But no matter how rich he was, there was one thing he couldn’t avoid: military service.

00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:52.528
In 1958, shortly after his 23rd birthday, like hundreds of thousands of other young men his

00:15:52.528 --> 00:15:59.938
age, Elvis Presley was drafted into the US army and ended up serving two years as a soldier.

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:06.008
Contrary to many people’s expectations, he had joined very willingly.

00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:12.678
Tens of thousands of young girls had pleaded for Elvis to be exempted from military

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:18.688
service, for him to be allowed not to join, but Elvis had insisted on going.

00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:25.698
This was a requirement for every young man of his age, he was a patriot, he wanted

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:30.778
to serve his country and insisted that he be treated like any other soldier.

00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:37.278
He was sent to Germany, and was reportedly a popular member of his squadron.

00:16:37.718 --> 00:16:41.868
He was well-known for his generosity, and did things like

00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:45.648
buying extra TVs and clothes for his fellow soldiers.

00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:53.288
It was during his time as a soldier that he first met the woman he was to marry, Priscilla Beaulieu.

00:16:54.498 --> 00:16:58.448
The only problem was, and this was a pretty serious problem,

00:16:58.988 --> 00:17:02.828
that she was only 14 years old when they met and started dating.

00:17:03.558 --> 00:17:04.750
He was 23.

00:17:06.178 --> 00:17:09.428
Although this might have been slightly less socially

00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:14.908
unacceptable back in 1958, it was just as illegal as it is now.

00:17:15.518 --> 00:17:20.658
Elvis and Priscilla reportedly never actually had a sexual relationship when she

00:17:20.658 --> 00:17:27.318
was under 18, but this was still a case of a 23-year-old man, and one of the most

00:17:27.318 --> 00:17:33.238
famous, if not the most famous, young men in America dating an underage girl.

00:17:34.598 --> 00:17:39.488
While in military service Elvis also discovered prescription drugs, and

00:17:39.648 --> 00:17:44.098
this was to be a vice that would stay with him for the rest of his life.

00:17:45.108 --> 00:17:51.448
When he was eventually dismissed from military service, in 1960, he returned to the

00:17:51.448 --> 00:17:57.338
life of an entertainment star but things were never quite the same for Elvis Presley.

00:17:58.918 --> 00:18:03.438
Sure, on his return he released two of his most commercially successful

00:18:03.448 --> 00:18:09.718
ballads - Are You Lonesome Tonight and It’s Now Or Never both in 1960, but then

00:18:09.718 --> 00:18:15.198
he took a 7 year break from performing live to focus on his Hollywood career.

00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:20.488
The problem was that his films were just not very good, and people

00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:25.318
started to view him as a bit of a joke, a bit of a has-been.

00:18:26.748 --> 00:18:34.388
In 1968, after a series of poorly received singles, he plotted his return to the stage.

00:18:35.488 --> 00:18:40.488
He was only 33, but he had been out of the musical business for coming

00:18:40.508 --> 00:18:44.998
on a decade, and it was time to show the world that he was back.

00:18:46.448 --> 00:18:51.758
His manager, Colonel Parker, struck a deal with NBC, the TV

00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:56.868
network, to do an Elvis comeback special for Christmas 1968.

00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:03.508
The programme was simply called “Elvis”, and it was a huge success.

00:19:03.968 --> 00:19:08.628
It was watched by 42% of the entire American TV audience,

00:19:08.818 --> 00:19:12.328
and brought our protagonist back into the limelight.

00:19:13.358 --> 00:19:17.898
This was a different Elvis to the one the country had got to know though.

00:19:18.418 --> 00:19:20.198
His image had changed.

00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:26.508
Gone were the boyish good looks and charm, and for this performance he debuted,

00:19:26.508 --> 00:19:31.498
he first showed off what would become his trademark black leather suit.

00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:37.358
Elvis was nervous at first about returning to live performances, but

00:19:37.648 --> 00:19:41.778
when he saw the reaction of the audience he started to love it again.

00:19:42.608 --> 00:19:47.998
Elvis was, first and foremost, a performer - he thrived on the crowd.

00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:55.618
And so it was that, starting in 1969, he sealed a contract with the International Hotel

00:19:55.618 --> 00:20:02.518
in Las Vegas to play two shows every day for four weeks, every February and August

00:20:02.658 --> 00:20:09.298
for an annual salary of $1 million, which is about $7.5 million in today’s money.

00:20:10.488 --> 00:20:15.238
Put another way, this was over $100,000 a day in today’s money.

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:21.038
Now, there are contrasting views about Elvis’s time in Las Vegas.

00:20:21.728 --> 00:20:25.698
For some, it was his last shot at remaining a star.

00:20:26.168 --> 00:20:32.778
He certainly didn’t need the money - he was already wealthy beyond his dreams, but he wanted the

00:20:32.788 --> 00:20:38.898
status that came with being the most in-demand entertainer in the US’s entertainment capital.

00:20:40.058 --> 00:20:44.188
But for others it’s seen as a clever way for Elvis to

00:20:44.408 --> 00:20:48.118
reinvent himself, and that it was a monumental success.

00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:55.048
Indeed, over the next seven years he would play over 600 shows at the same hotel in

00:20:55.048 --> 00:21:00.838
Las Vegas, and every single one of them would sell out, all the tickets would be sold.

00:21:01.848 --> 00:21:04.498
It was to a different crowd though.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:11.308
The adoring teenage girls he had played in front of in the mid-1950s were now grown-up

00:21:11.318 --> 00:21:17.748
women, and the teenagers of the 1960s, well Elvis wasn’t quite so appealing to them.

00:21:18.518 --> 00:21:22.478
This was the era of The Beach Boys, The Beatles and The Who.

00:21:23.028 --> 00:21:25.858
Elvis was, well, he was Elvis.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:30.968
Even though he might not be so appealing to the new generation, he

00:21:30.968 --> 00:21:35.648
continued to pull in the crowds, and Elvis concerts would always sell out.

00:21:37.148 --> 00:21:41.128
Off-stage, however, his personal life was falling apart.

00:21:42.328 --> 00:21:46.928
He had married Priscilla in May of 1967, and their

00:21:46.968 --> 00:21:50.078
only child, Lisa Marie was born the following year.

00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:56.478
But Elvis was deeply unhappy with the direction in which his career was going.

00:21:56.928 --> 00:21:59.288
Yes, he was famous, yes he was rich.

00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:02.678
But he was a shadow of his former self.

00:22:03.478 --> 00:22:11.538
The fans he had in the late 1960s were often the same fans as the ones in the 1950s, apart from now

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:17.708
they were 15 years older, and were eating lobster dinners with their husbands at a Las Vegas hotel,

00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:24.328
they weren’t in love with him now, they were there at the show to experience what Elvis used to be.

00:22:25.768 --> 00:22:31.958
His new marriage was falling apart, and both he and Priscilla started having affairs.

00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:39.548
Elvis, first with a lady called Joyce Bova, and Priscilla with a man called Mike Stone,

00:22:39.831 --> 00:22:45.968
who was in fact her karate instructor, and had been introduced to her by Elvis himself.

00:22:47.008 --> 00:22:53.277
Elvis was incensed when he found out, he was incredibly angry, and became obsessed

00:22:53.357 --> 00:22:58.927
with the idea that Mike Stone, that Priscilla's lover, was trying to have him killed.

00:23:00.507 --> 00:23:07.517
Elvis became so fixated on this idea that he even had one of his bodyguards go and get a quote

00:23:07.727 --> 00:23:14.367
for how much it would cost for a professional assassin, a contract killer to murder Priscilla’s

00:23:14.377 --> 00:23:20.147
lover, but eventually decided against it, saying “Aw hell, let's just leave it for now.

00:23:20.387 --> 00:23:21.957
Maybe it's a bit heavy.”

00:23:23.477 --> 00:23:29.467
The Presleys divorced in 1973, and by this time Elvis was deeply

00:23:29.487 --> 00:23:34.857
addicted to two types of substances: prescription drugs and junk food.

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:43.217
Despite having been a vocal anti-drug advocate, someone who said he never did drugs and even

00:23:43.237 --> 00:23:49.587
appeared with President Richard Nixon as part of an anti-drugs campaign, Elvis Presley had

00:23:49.597 --> 00:23:56.337
developed a severe dependence on a large range of drugs, including opiates and barbiturates.

00:23:57.037 --> 00:24:02.457
He overdosed several times, and was hospitalised, but this was all tightly

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:06.637
covered up by his entourage, it was hidden by the people around him.

00:24:07.797 --> 00:24:10.827
His other addiction was also killing him slowly.

00:24:11.787 --> 00:24:17.977
He had always eaten a lot, but by the mid 1970s he had developed a very strange

00:24:17.987 --> 00:24:23.427
relationship with junk food, whereby he would binge on it, he would eat vast

00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:29.417
amounts of it, then go on radical diets to try to lose the weight he had put on.

00:24:30.947 --> 00:24:36.017
He would eat all sorts of junk food, burgers, chips, pizza, but one

00:24:36.117 --> 00:24:40.447
of his favourite things to eat was something called Fool’s Gold.

00:24:41.517 --> 00:24:47.287
This was a sandwich invented by a small restaurant in Denver, and it was

00:24:47.287 --> 00:24:53.437
made by hollowing out the middle of a loaf of bread, then putting an entire

00:24:53.457 --> 00:24:59.707
pot of jam, an entire pot of peanut butter and half a kilo of bacon inside.

00:25:00.657 --> 00:25:05.337
Just one of the sandwiches contained 8,000 calories.

00:25:06.257 --> 00:25:13.467
If you’re not familiar with how much 8,000 calories is, the recommended daily intake for a grown man

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:22.497
is 2,500 calories, so this one sandwich contained more calories than are recommended for three days!

00:25:23.747 --> 00:25:28.817
There’s even a story about Elvis getting so hungry one night that he flew on

00:25:28.817 --> 00:25:34.297
his private jet from Memphis all the way to Denver, a two-hour flight away,

00:25:34.637 --> 00:25:38.777
just so that he could get one of these heart-attack-inducing sandwiches.

00:25:40.067 --> 00:25:45.637
And, as I’m sure you know, the prescription drugs and the junk food caught up with him.

00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:53.007
At two o’clock in the afternoon on August 16th of 1977 he was found dead

00:25:53.287 --> 00:25:57.947
by his then 20-year-old girlfriend, Ginger Alden on the bathroom floor.

00:25:59.357 --> 00:26:01.207
He was only 42 years old.

00:26:02.378 --> 00:26:08.798
Immediately after his death his entourage and his doctors tried to cover up his drug addiction.

00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:13.768
He was taken to a hospital that was known to be more discreet.

00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:19.538
Given how anti-drugs Elvis had claimed to be, and how he had been part

00:26:19.538 --> 00:26:24.578
of Nixon’s anti-drug campaign, Elvis’s family managed to persuade the

00:26:24.588 --> 00:26:29.698
doctors to not mention drugs, in a bid to protect Elvis’ reputation.

00:26:30.934 --> 00:26:36.084
And indeed, after the primary autopsy, the doctors declared that

00:26:36.114 --> 00:26:41.534
Elvis had died of a heart attack and that drugs were not involved.

00:26:42.794 --> 00:26:48.244
But, after the toxicology report a few weeks later it was revealed that Elvis

00:26:48.254 --> 00:26:52.884
had vast amounts of prescription drugs in his body at the time of his death.

00:26:54.024 --> 00:26:58.604
This was all enabled by his personal doctor, a man affectionately

00:26:58.604 --> 00:27:02.324
called Dr Nick, who would give Elvis anything he wanted.

00:27:03.104 --> 00:27:08.964
Indeed, in the first 7 months of 1977 alone, Dr Nick prescribed

00:27:08.984 --> 00:27:13.774
Elvis more than 10,000 doses of sedatives and amphetamines.

00:27:14.794 --> 00:27:20.024
It is a theme that is unfortunately all too familiar with some musicians,

00:27:20.214 --> 00:27:25.374
that of having a personal doctor enabling a drug addiction, and Elvis

00:27:25.374 --> 00:27:29.374
would be followed by other greats such as Michael Jackson and Prince.

00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:35.464
As for the legacy of Elvis Presley, he is the best-selling solo

00:27:35.464 --> 00:27:40.704
artist of all time, selling over 500 million records worldwide.

00:27:41.924 --> 00:27:47.924
A particularly unique aspect of his legacy is, of course, the fact that he invented an

00:27:47.924 --> 00:27:54.874
entire career of “Elvis impersonator”, of people who dress up as Elvis and perform as him.

00:27:56.024 --> 00:28:02.384
Contrary to popular belief, these impersonators didn’t start after his death - the first

00:28:02.404 --> 00:28:08.584
known Elvis impersonator started in 1954, shortly after he released “That’s All Right”.

00:28:09.644 --> 00:28:14.184
It’s probably a testament to how unique his style of performance was,

00:28:14.374 --> 00:28:18.834
that almost as soon as he started performing, people wanted to copy him.

00:28:20.174 --> 00:28:25.674
And then after his death, after there was literally no possible way to experience the

00:28:25.674 --> 00:28:32.034
real Elvis again, the number of Elvis impersonators continued to grow, and it’s estimated

00:28:32.264 --> 00:28:39.234
that now there are anywhere from 250,000 to 400,000 Elvis impersonators worldwide.

00:28:40.494 --> 00:28:47.104
There’s also a famous story about Elvis entering into an Elvis lookalike competition and

00:28:47.294 --> 00:28:53.334
only coming in third place, but unfortunately this is an urban legend, it just isn’t true.

00:28:54.754 --> 00:28:58.734
When we come to look back at the musical career of Elvis Presley,

00:28:59.034 --> 00:29:03.104
there is a definite split, which came when he joined the army.

00:29:03.774 --> 00:29:07.894
In the years leading up to joining the army, he was the fresh-faced

00:29:08.124 --> 00:29:12.724
boy rock star, swinging his hips, having number one single after

00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:17.254
number one single, and touring the country to crowds of adoring fans.

00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:23.874
And then after returning from military service, in 1960, he had some commercial

00:29:23.874 --> 00:29:29.494
success, and he certainly made a lot of money, but he was never quite the same again.

00:29:30.534 --> 00:29:36.444
It was perhaps this inability to recreate his success as a young man that

00:29:36.454 --> 00:29:41.344
drove him towards the erratic behaviour, the junk food and drugs, and

00:29:41.504 --> 00:29:46.974
without anyone to really tell him no, he drove himself to an early grave.

00:29:48.114 --> 00:29:51.344
He might not have been the most talented musician of his

00:29:51.344 --> 00:29:54.614
time, but he was certainly one of the greatest performers.

00:29:55.234 --> 00:30:02.674
He was the sound of a generation, he was for many the first musical icon, the first real star,

00:30:03.044 --> 00:30:09.754
he made playing the guitar “cool”, and he went on to influence countless other artists and bands.

00:30:10.424 --> 00:30:16.024
So, you can think what you want about Elvis Presley, but it’s hard to argue

00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:21.474
that there is anyone more deserving of the title “The King of Rock and Roll”.

00:30:23.874 --> 00:30:30.364
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Elvis Presley, and with that comes

00:30:30.364 --> 00:30:35.914
the end of this three-part mini-series on musical icons of the 1950s and 60s.

00:30:36.524 --> 00:30:41.434
As a reminder, in part one we learned about the life and times of Ray

00:30:41.454 --> 00:30:46.284
Charles, in part two, which was one of our member-only ones, it was Johnny

00:30:46.284 --> 00:30:50.404
Cash, and part three was what you’ve just listened to, Elvis Presley.

00:30:51.104 --> 00:30:53.654
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:30:53.654 --> 00:30:56.704
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:30:57.364 --> 00:31:00.614
Given that we are talking about the best-selling solo artist of

00:31:00.614 --> 00:31:04.294
all time, I imagine that we might have some Elvis-fans listening.

00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:09.734
And even if you aren’t an Elvis fan, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:31:10.084 --> 00:31:14.964
So, what other amazing stories from the life of Elvis Presley do you know about?

00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:17.164
What are your favourite Elvis songs?

00:31:17.494 --> 00:31:21.624
And did he ever actually make any movies that you thought were any good?

00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:23.494
I would love to know.

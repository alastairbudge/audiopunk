Hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:09.837
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:16.257
Today we are going to be talking about a subject that's pretty dear to my heart.

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:19.702
How to use podcasts to learn English.

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:28.342
We'll go into why podcasts are just the most underrated resource, how smart English language

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:35.333
learners use them, and how you can turbocharge your English language learning game by introducing

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:43.743
English podcasts as a tool in your learning toolkit I'll also talk about how you can use a 10 minute

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:51.381
podcast to give yourself a intense two hour English lesson where you practice your listening,

00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:54.011
speaking, reading, and writing.

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.471
Yes, that's all just from a 10 minute podcast.

00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:04.982
Before we start out though, for those of you listening to this podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:10.722
Google podcasts, or wherever you might get your podcasts, I just wanted to remind you that you can

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:15.747
get a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the website.

00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:18.097
That's Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:21.537
Okay then, that's the housekeeping over.

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:25.667
Podcasts and how to use them to learn English.

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:29.952
Well, on one level, the answer is easy.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:31.422
Listen.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:37.945
The more you listen, the more native speakers you listen to, the more your ears will get used to,

00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:40.745
they'll get attuned to how native speakers speak.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.065
This means that not only will you find it easier to understand when you hear people speaking

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:53.925
English, but you'll also improve your English speaking as you'll just have been exposed to a higher

00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:55.465
quantity of English.

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.802
But that's at a very superficial level.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:04.892
And one thing that I don't want us to be accused of at the English Learning for Curious Minds

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.792
podcast is of being superficial.

00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:16.051
So let's go into exactly how they work and how you can use them in a way that most language learners

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:16.731
will never do.

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:21.512
Why do most language learners not use podcasts?

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:28.742
Yes, the reasons may vary, but it comes down to one thing and one thing only really.

00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:30.612
It's that they're hard.

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:37.372
If you listen to podcasts in your mother tongue, you're properly doing something else at the same

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:45.790
time, driving, doing the dishes, running, making craft lager, or indulging in some other fantastic

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.140
hobby.

00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:51.947
And when you try to listen to English language podcasts, it's hard, right?

00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:56.775
No matter how good your English is, it can feel like hard work.

00:02:57.908 --> 00:02:59.970
You don't understand all of the words.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.560
Maybe you miss something important and you can't just switch off like you would do in your native

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.980
language.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:16.370
So quite often you find yourself giving up or you revert to watching English videos or films on

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.580
Netflix or YouTube.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:24.285
Maybe you put English subtitles or you might even put your native language subtitles and tell

00:03:24.285 --> 00:03:26.675
yourself you're only using them as a backup.

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.508
Look, this is all fine and better than not doing anything.

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:38.232
After all, a little bit of English is better than no English and I can hardly judge, I've been in

00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:43.342
exactly the same position as you when learning other languages, so when learning French, Italian,

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:43.922
Mandarin.

00:03:44.527 --> 00:03:50.717
The reason that podcasts feel so hard is that you don't have any of the other signals.

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:54.807
There's no video, so the visual cues can't help you.

00:03:55.947 --> 00:04:00.236
With podcasts, all you have is one sense listening.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.712
This makes it so much harder, but also means that if you can understand just by listening, you'll

00:04:07.712 --> 00:04:12.272
have a skill that the vast majority of other English learners don't have.

00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:13.546
Why?

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:20.693
Well, if you are learning English through things like YouTube or Netflix, your brain doesn't really

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:22.693
have to do a huge amount of work.

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:29.953
You have the video to help you, and this means you can get by without really understanding

00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:30.393
everything.

00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:37.926
When listening to an English podcast, if your first language isn't English, of course, you have to

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:41.774
be focused, you don't have the benefit of visual cues.

00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:48.849
Of course this means it's a whole lot harder, but it also means that you really have to focus on

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.599
what is being said, on the language, and you end up learning a lot faster than if you have all these

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.911
other cues helping you.

00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:03.681
Plus, if you can understand with only the audio cues, when you go into a situation where you have

00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:10.358
visual cues, whether that's just a face to face conversation or if it's watching a film, it will

00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:11.868
seem so much easier.

00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:18.800
So it's clear that using podcasts is harder, but a lot more rewarding.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.880
But what are some of the best ways to use podcasts effectively to learn English?

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:31.988
My favourite ways to use podcasts include transcribing, writing down interesting pieces of

00:05:31.988 --> 00:05:36.278
vocabulary, shadowing and discussing them with a language partner.

00:05:37.193 --> 00:05:41.603
I'll just talk you through my favourite way of listening to podcasts to learn a language, and the

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:46.953
way in which I've seen work for the most successful English students I know.

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:54.723
This is how you can get a seriously intense lesson, where you practice listening, speaking, reading,

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:58.043
and writing, and all from a 10 minute podcast.

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:00.175
Okay?

00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:02.105
So I'll explain exactly how this works.

00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:08.445
You don't have to do everything here, but it should give you an idea of the kinds of things that you

00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:13.605
can do to really maximise the benefit you get out of each podcast.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.060
Okay, so first things first, I'll find a podcast that looks interesting.

00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:24.403
Once I found a podcast I like, I'll check that it has a transcript.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:33.448
Ideally, the podcast would be about 10 to 20 minutes long, which is, for me at least, is long enough

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:37.658
to get into a subject, but not too long so that I get bored.

00:06:38.468 --> 00:06:40.768
I'll aim for one that's around 10 minutes.

00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:49.284
I'll find a quiet place, turn my phone onto airplane mode, or at least make sure that I'm on Do Not

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.924
Disturb, so there are no distractions.

00:06:52.604 --> 00:06:58.915
And by distractions I'm talking about phone distractions, messages, notifications, whatever, and

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:00.545
also real life distractions.

00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:03.607
People knocking at a door or coming to ask me something.

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:07.079
I'll then listen to the entire podcast.

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.999
No dictionary, no transcripts, no pen or paper.

00:07:11.294 --> 00:07:15.454
I'll just listen and try to understand as much as I possibly can.

00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:21.720
If I can understand around 80% of it, that's a good sign.

00:07:22.607 --> 00:07:29.877
Much more, and I'm probably not learning a huge amount, much less, and it gets a bit annoying to

00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:30.257
follow.

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:38.077
I'll listen to the entire podcast, then when it's finished, I might write down in the language I'm

00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:39.877
learning, of course, some questions.

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:42.497
So for you, you'd be writing everything down in English.

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:47.790
If anything wasn't clear or if something was particularly interesting, I would just make a note of

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.980
it.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:55.495
I don't tend to pause and rewind when I listen to the podcast for the first time as I want to have

00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:59.675
as uninterrupted experience as possible.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.360
But you can if you like, it just depends on how patient you are.

00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:10.681
Once I've listened to it for the first time without writing anything down, I'll listen to the

00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:14.888
podcast again, but I'll do so with my notebook in front of me.

00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:22.962
I'll write down any interesting phrases or words that I don't know as I'm going along, or if the

00:08:22.962 --> 00:08:31.315
host uses any particularly interesting terms or structures or sentences that I think I'd like to use

00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:34.455
in my conversation, then I'll write those down as well.

00:08:35.962 --> 00:08:41.572
This time though, I'll pause as I go along so that I have enough time to write down interesting

00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:42.852
words and phrases.

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:50.327
All of my notes are in the target language, of course, and if I don't know the definition of a word,

00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:53.737
or if I can't figure it out, I'll just leave it there in my notebook.

00:08:55.263 --> 00:09:00.913
After I've listened to the podcast once again, I'll have a page in my notebook of interesting

00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:07.433
phrases, bits of vocabulary, and generally things I didn't know before, or at least things that I

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:10.343
wouldn't have been able to use in my own conversation.

00:09:10.763 --> 00:09:16.683
For a language I'm not so familiar with, or ones where I know that I need to practice my writing,

00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:21.833
I'll then listen a third time and try to transcribe the entire podcast.

00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:28.836
I normally do this on a laptop as I can type a lot faster than I can write, but if you're a pen and

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.956
paper type of person, then that's fine as well.

00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:38.891
One advantage of pen and paper is that you don't have a spellcheck, so you really need to get it

00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:39.131
right.

00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:46.305
For English, transcribing can be particularly useful as there are so many irregular spellings.

00:09:46.405 --> 00:09:54.265
So you know, words like dough, cough, plough, they all end in O U G H, right?

00:09:55.227 --> 00:10:00.607
If there are any words that I don't understand in the transcript, I'll circle them in a big red pen

00:10:00.907 --> 00:10:01.837
so I know to look them up.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:09.987
If the podcast I'm listening to has a transcript, and as I said, I always look for ones that do, if

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:14.637
it does have a transcript, I'll have a look at the transcript provided and compare it with my own.

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:20.297
I'll then go back to my notebook and review the words and phrases that I'd written down.

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:26.230
I'll probably have figured out what most of them mean by now, but if any aren't clear, I'll look

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.210
them up in a dictionary.

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:34.181
What I'll also do is practice recording myself, shadowing the podcast host.

00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.738
What this means is that I'll just pretend I'm the host.

00:10:38.177 --> 00:10:44.877
I'll open up the voice recorder on my phone and just record myself speaking the podcast using either

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:50.527
the transcript provided by the podcast or the one that I've done, if I'm comfortable that it is

00:10:50.557 --> 00:10:51.297
indeed correct.

00:10:52.123 --> 00:10:58.683
This might feel a bit weird when you do it the first time, but bear with it, it is hugely beneficial

00:10:58.683 --> 00:10:59.363
for speaking.

00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:06.742
Assuming that the podcast host is a native speaker, you literally have a native speaker telling you

00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:12.012
exactly how to pronounce the words and showing you how they would speak that sentence.

00:11:12.883 --> 00:11:19.813
In a language like English, when there's so much connected speech, this is a fundamental aspect of

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:20.723
good pronunciation.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:27.854
It means that you teach yourself how to pronounce words when words flow from one into another, and

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:34.344
it's a far, far better use of time than doing something like conversation practice with another

00:11:34.344 --> 00:11:40.134
non-native speaker where you both just speak English at each other, learn each other's errors, and

00:11:40.494 --> 00:11:44.484
aren't actually concentrating on how real native speakers speak.

00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:48.968
You can continue to record yourself again and again.

00:11:49.148 --> 00:11:53.728
Each time you'll get better and each time you'll be perfecting new sounds.

00:11:54.587 --> 00:12:01.117
Yes, it will sound weird at the start, and yes, it's not as fun as watching the latest series on

00:12:01.117 --> 00:12:05.897
Netflix, but it does wonders for your speaking confidence and your pronunciation.

00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:12.826
So these are things I try and do every time when I listen to a podcast in a language I'm learning.

00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:15.766
But there are a few other things as well that you can try.

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.631
You can try to write a summary of the podcast.

00:12:20.301 --> 00:12:26.161
Now this helps your listening and your writing skills as you need to use terms and language that are

00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:29.356
different to those that you'll have heard in the podcast.

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:38.177
Transcribing is a useful practice, but writing a summary of something is actually much more akin to

00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:41.847
the sort of thing that you would have to do in a real life environment.

00:12:42.187 --> 00:12:43.507
That's how life works, right?

00:12:43.761 --> 00:12:48.341
You take an idea and you convey it normally in different words.

00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:49.941
You don't just convey it word for word.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.855
Secondly, if you have a friend or colleague who is a similar level of English to you, then listen to

00:12:56.855 --> 00:13:03.425
the podcast with them, do these exercises together, and then afterwards have a conversation about

00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:05.695
the podcast in English of course.

00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:13.552
Talk about what you liked, what your opinion is on it, and discuss any interesting points that came

00:13:13.552 --> 00:13:13.942
up in it.

00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:19.387
Hey, you can even grab a friend now, hit rewind and listen to this podcast with them.

00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:26.751
Learning with podcasts can feel like a bit of a lonely pastime, and especially if you're the kind of

00:13:26.751 --> 00:13:31.421
person who loves group learning, then try to listen to it with someone else.

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:38.047
So that's how I use podcasts to learn a language, and these are some of the tricks that some of the

00:13:38.047 --> 00:13:41.157
most successful English learners I've seen have used.

00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:46.071
There are a few other, what I call housekeeping tips as well.

00:13:46.656 --> 00:13:53.595
I'm calling them housekeeping because well, they're pretty simple, easy to do, but easy to forget if

00:13:53.595 --> 00:13:54.885
you don't make sure you do them.

00:13:56.129 --> 00:14:02.959
Number one, feel free to slow down or speed up the audio depending on whether it's too hard or too

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:03.419
easy.

00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:09.252
Most podcast players have this functionality in built, so make use of it.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.340
If you slow it down too much, it can sound a bit weird, like the podcast host has had a little bit

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.370
too much to drink, but do stick with it.

00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:25.468
Number two, and this is the same for any skill you're trying to develop, set aside a time every day

00:14:25.468 --> 00:14:27.418
or week and actually stick to it.

00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:32.827
Look, it's not revolutionary, but everything I just described, it doesn't actually take that much

00:14:32.827 --> 00:14:33.177
time.

00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:39.139
I said at the start of the podcast, we'd talk about how you can use a 10 minute podcast to give

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:44.584
yourself a seriously intensive two hour lesson, but let's just walk through everything we talked

00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:50.324
about before and see how that compares to something else that you might consider, let's say watching

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:51.644
a film in English.

00:14:52.904 --> 00:14:54.615
So let's go through it then.

00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:59.032
So you listen to the podcast once without pausing or writing anything down.

00:14:59.562 --> 00:15:00.442
That's 10 minutes.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.646
Then you listen to it again, pausing to write down vocabulary and interesting phrases.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.850
Let's say that's another 15 minutes.

00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:14.431
Then you might transcribe it, which is probably another 30 minutes.

00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.411
So we're up to 55 minutes now.

00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:22.524
Then you can do the shadowing exercise where you record yourself speaking at the same time as the

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:23.424
podcast host.

00:15:24.154 --> 00:15:30.353
Let's say you do that a couple of times, which is another 30 minutes, so we're one hour and 25

00:15:30.353 --> 00:15:30.803
minutes.

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:36.489
If you're listening to it with a friend, you can both write a summary for 10 minutes and then have a

00:15:36.489 --> 00:15:37.779
25 minute conversation.

00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:43.025
This takes us up to two hours and you've just had a seriously intense English lesson.

00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:46.025
And all you needed was a 10 minute podcast.

00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:52.795
Compare this to watching a two hour film on Netflix, and I think it's pretty clear which one will be

00:15:52.795 --> 00:15:54.175
more useful for your English.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:16:03.069
Using this format with podcasts gives you a seriously intense lesson and all from the comfort of

00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.809
your smartphone.

00:16:04.719 --> 00:16:05.379
Cool, right?

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:13.173
This is of course, what has worked for me and a method that some of the best English learners I know

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:13.803
use.

00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:21.461
Yes, it's hard and yes, it might feel uncomfortable, but using this method will mean that you learn,

00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:27.791
I would say five to 10 times faster than you would do if you were just brainlessly flicking through

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:32.686
Netflix or YouTube telling yourself that you were learning, but in your heart of hearts, you know

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:33.506
that you're not really.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:39.447
If you have other tips or tricks about how you've learned English with podcasts, I'd love to know

00:16:39.797 --> 00:16:44.656

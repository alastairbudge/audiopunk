Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.719
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.929
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.379
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Charles Dickens.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:33.419
This is actually part two of a three-part mini-series on Great Victorian writers.

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.539
In part one we looked at Jane Austen, the author responsible for novels such as

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.769
Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and next up we’ll be looking at the Brontë sisters.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.550
OK then, The Inimitable Charles Dickens.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.340
If you’re wondering what this strange word “inimitable”

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.710
means, it means unable to be imitated, unable to be copied.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.970
Later on in his life, Dickens referred to himself, jokingly I

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.930
should add, as inimitable, but his style certainly was unique.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.170
Indeed, alongside George Orwell, he is one of the few English

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.569
authors whose surname has become an adjective, Dickensian.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.080
To get an understanding of how he reached this point, similar to the episodes on Jane Austen

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.910
and the Brontë sisters, in this episode we’ll go on a journey through four different areas:

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.220
the novelist's life, their novels, the impact of those novels and finally their legacy.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.230
So, our first stop is a brief look at Dickens's life.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.630
Although he was born in 1812 into what should have been a relatively secure middle-class life

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.640
in the southern English port city of Portsmouth, his father had no control over the family’s

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.470
spending and managed to put himself, and therefore his family, into considerable debt.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.390
The shock of such a sudden change from relative plenty to the kind of grinding, real

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.440
poverty, as experienced by the industrial working class, marked Dickens for life.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.450
He was only 12 when this traumatic event occurred, he found himself suddenly taken out of

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.810
the good school that he was in and sent to work in a factory which made black boot polish.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.350
Here, for three gruelling years, the sensitive and bright young Charles worked long hours in

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.460
a dismal factory near London's Charing Cross station, fixing labels onto jars of boot polish.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.650
His father and the majority of his many brothers and sisters had all been imprisoned

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.730
in what was known as a debtor’s prison until his father’s debts were all paid.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.200
If you’re familiar with Charles Dickens, you’ll know that there is a recurrent

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.650
theme of adults mistreating children, of adults treating children poorly.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.000
This theme clearly had its roots in this bruising early childhood experience.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.370
Young Charles’s formal education was therefore short-lived, it didn't last for long.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.130
After the blacking factory and a short further spell, a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.660
short period, at school, he went to work as a legal clerk.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.760
Rather than continuing to do his apprenticeship and become a lawyer, he quickly

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.230
learnt a new form of shorthand writing, which, together with his very quick mind

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.780
meant that he was soon expert at writing down accounts of criminal trials in court.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.950
Before long, he was doing a similar thing in London's Houses of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.390
Parliament, where he became a famous reporter on parliamentary debates.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.230
In the early days of railways, Dickens's ability to accurately record politicians' speeches and have

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.170
those speeches written up in newspapers which were distributed all over Britain was an important

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.990
part in the communications revolution which accompanied the growth of newspapers and rail travel.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.680
His talent for reporting speeches extended to writing sketches about famous politicians.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.830
This then led to short stories and then novels.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.700
Writing initially under what was a family nickname, Boz, his brilliance at creating

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.570
memorable characters and satirising institutions, making fun of institutions,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.240
meant that he soon became a famous writer, and this fame would only increase.

00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:55.610
When he was aged only 24, the publication of his first novel, The

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.240
Pickwick Papers, turned him into an international, literary celebrity.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.040
It helped that he also became editor of two popular magazines in succession.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.760
I mention this because the way in which the majority of

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.260
his novels were published was in what's called serial form.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.920
This meant that each week or month, you would have a few new chapters

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.860
of the latest Dickens novel, each ending in moments of suspense.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.380
So, the chapter would end on what’s called a “cliffhanger”, a point when the narrative or storyline

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.100
is in the balance and we are desperate to know how a particular set of events is going to progress.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.460
Cleverly, of course, it is organised so that the reader will surely buy the next instalment.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.470
This style of serial publication was to become the dominant form of publication for the Victorian

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.600
novel, and it’s obviously still a device that’s used even today in the latest TV series.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.450
But how about Dickens's personal life, perhaps you are asking?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.470
Well, although for his adoring public and indeed for succeeding generations,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.950
the famous Boz was regarded as being very much a family man, with his

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.300
long-term wife, Catherine and his 10 children, this was actually not the case.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.060
Like many high-profile people, he had a complex personal life.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.530
He had a passionate early love with a lady called Maria Beadnell, whom he did not marry.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.690
He did not treat his wife, Catherine, particularly well,

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.080
as he regarded her as very much below him intellectually.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.360
Somewhat bizarrely, he had a very close relationship with Catherine's sister,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.580
Mary Hogarth, whose early death was a great source of sadness for Dickens.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.720
After Dickens separated from his wife in 1858, he struck up a relationship with

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.080
an actress 27 years younger than him, Ellen Ternan, and there is little doubt

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.970
that she and he were lovers from the early 1860s until his death in 1870 aged 58.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.830
Dickens was also a famously charismatic individual.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.610
He was a powerful personality with great energy and spirit; he loved colourful clothes, such as

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.580
waistcoats, along with dancing, theatricals and, above all charitable work on behalf of causes

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:39.430
as wide-ranging as child poverty, prostitution, homelessness, educational reform and pollution.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.900
We will return to some of these themes shortly when discussing his impact on Victorian society.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.160
What about his work, his books?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.160
Well, as you would expect of a man with such energy, idealism and

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.910
genius, his productivity was prolific, he wrote a vast amount.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.590
He wrote 15 novels, mainly very long ones.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.520
In addition, his output included five short novels, hundreds of short

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.570
stories and many non-fiction articles which were published in his magazines.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.720
As if that wasn’t enough to keep him busy, and let’s not forget that he also had 10 children,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:26.250
he was a conscientious editor of his two weekly magazines which he published over a period

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:33.500
of 20 years and a similarly dutiful and careful contributor to charities, such as Urania

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.060
Cottage, the home that he and a wealthy banking heiress, Angella Coutts, set up for prostitutes

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.540
who were trying to free themselves from their lives as sex workers and start afresh.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:54.310
As for his novels, which is what he is best known for, they cover a very broad range of topics.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.320
The early ones are perhaps best known for their comedy, with The

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.460
Pickwick Papers and the Old Curiosity Shop examples of this genre.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.830
As he moved into his mature and late phase, he wrote powerfully critical

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.930
novels about important social problems and failures, such as the

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.910
educational system, which he covered in Hard Times and Nicholas Nickleby.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:26.110
He also experimented with historical novels, where the action is set someway in the past.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.730
Most famously, this was the case with A Tale of Two Cities, which set

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.660
the action in London and Paris during the time of the French Revolution.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.780
His later work became yet more complex and uncompromising in its

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.730
attacks on what he saw as the evils of the society that surrounded him.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.940
For instance, In Bleak House, he attacks the way in which the

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.550
legal system only serves lawyers and destroys young lives.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.850
In Little Dorritt the target is the effect of the debtors’ prison,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.540
whilst one of his darkest novels, Dombey and Son, involves a brilliant

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.700
dramatisation of how great wealth can eat out the heart of a family.

00:10:14.372 --> 00:10:21.692
The sad but sincere question of the young Paul Dombey to his rich father sets the tone of the novel.

00:10:22.802 --> 00:10:24.612
He says: "What's money?"

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:29.772
In Dickens's last decade he extended his lifetime’s enjoyment

00:10:29.772 --> 00:10:34.712
of drama and became an adored reader of passages from his books.

00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:41.222
In much the same way that today's best-known musicians make more money through going on

00:10:41.252 --> 00:10:47.522
tour than from selling music, Dickens would read to mass audiences, earning huge fees.

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:54.152
It would be an almost concert-like experience, with Dickens enjoying the rapturous

00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:59.272
applause and response of his audiences as he read favourite passages from his books,

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:05.382
such as the arguments between Nancy and her lover, Bill Sikes from Oliver Twist.

00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:11.098
It is said that the emotion he put into one of these public readings was actually

00:11:11.108 --> 00:11:16.508
a major factor in bringing on the stroke that killed him when he was only 58.

00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:23.058
As for the central ideas or themes in Dickens's work, it is difficult

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:27.948
to summarise them adequately as the work covers such a broad canvas.

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:35.798
Few elements of Victorian society escape his penetrating and accurate gaze – not

00:11:35.818 --> 00:11:42.248
just the educational, banking and legal systems as I mentioned, but also bureaucracy,

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:48.498
mess on public streets, horrible air quality and the inhumane treatment of children.

00:11:49.588 --> 00:11:54.088
However, above all, running through all his work like a golden

00:11:54.138 --> 00:11:58.638
thread is his celebration of human kindness and generosity.

00:11:59.858 --> 00:12:05.588
This, so his stories suggest, is much more likely to be found amongst the very

00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:11.238
poor than amongst the rich, although he is not so simplistic as to suggest that

00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:16.108
there cannot be mean-spirited poor people and generous-hearted wealthy ones.

00:12:17.698 --> 00:12:21.798
Let's now move on to explore the impact that he had in his lifetime.

00:12:22.748 --> 00:12:25.728
You will have gathered so far that he was a true national

00:12:25.728 --> 00:12:30.148
celebrity, recognised by people even in an age before photography.

00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:36.478
Although he loved the response of an adoring crowd, he also valued his privacy

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:41.718
and there are firsthand accounts of how, when he was, let's say, in the theatre

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:47.208
watching a play, he would hope not to be noticed, but as word got round that the

00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:51.758
famous Boz was in the audience, it was highly likely that the whole theatre would

00:12:52.008 --> 00:12:58.088
erupt in applause as his fellow theatre-goers would stand up, clap and cheer him.

00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:04.088
It's worth mentioning here that his fame was not confined to the literate

00:13:04.278 --> 00:13:07.908
and the wealthy, to those who could read and those who had lots of money.

00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:13.588
Because instalments of his work could be bought cheaply in magazine form

00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:18.578
and his stories were so gripping, they would be read out loud by the

00:13:18.748 --> 00:13:23.798
literate members of a family or the street, so that others could enjoy them.

00:13:24.488 --> 00:13:30.408
Indeed, it’s estimated that every book sold was read aloud to 14 people.

00:13:31.368 --> 00:13:34.738
It is no exaggeration to say that his fans ranged

00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:38.308
from Queen Victoria to the poorest of street sweepers.

00:13:38.678 --> 00:13:43.338
This, in itself, is a unique achievement for English novelists.

00:13:44.468 --> 00:13:50.408
Perhaps the easiest and most universal of impacts that Dickens had was to do with Christmas.

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:55.798
Dickens, initially through his most famous Christmas story, A Christmas

00:13:55.808 --> 00:14:01.378
Carol, more or less invented the idea of the White, or snowy, Christmas.

00:14:01.818 --> 00:14:05.658
He produced Christmas stories every year, although none would

00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:08.748
become as popular as the extraordinary A Christmas Carol.

00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:13.588
But perhaps the most positive and long-lasting impact

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:17.398
he had on his own age was that of his social activism.

00:14:18.268 --> 00:14:25.848
His idealism, his anger at social injustice and his relish or enjoyment at putting his own

00:14:25.848 --> 00:14:31.868
expertise and money behind practical social reforms, such as that home set up for women

00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:37.588
trying to escape prostitution, meant that he set an example to others of social activism.

00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:43.678
He was someone who not only felt very passionately about social injustice

00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:48.438
but actually did a great deal in practical terms to improve things,

00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:52.838
he did more than just highlight these injustices through his books.

00:14:54.298 --> 00:14:59.962
Moving on to his legacy – in other words things that have survived him and which we perhaps

00:15:00.202 --> 00:15:04.842
have some reason to be grateful for - there is once again much to say on this topic.

00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:11.322
As I said at the start, he is one of the few writers whose name has become an adjective.

00:15:11.892 --> 00:15:17.412
There will not be many days when one of the British newspapers does not use the word Dickensian

00:15:17.712 --> 00:15:23.632
to describe unacceptable, out of date and poor working conditions or living conditions.

00:15:24.762 --> 00:15:30.632
In terms of his artistic legacy, the attraction of Dickens's stories can be seen

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:35.562
by the vast quantity of film and stage adaptations that have been made of them.

00:15:36.332 --> 00:15:39.342
This has been the case right from the early days of cinema.

00:15:39.862 --> 00:15:45.202
Even in the era of silent films, some 100 movies were made of his novels.

00:15:45.752 --> 00:15:50.372
It is no exaggeration to say that his unique writing style, with his brilliant

00:15:50.412 --> 00:15:55.282
eye for human curiosities has been an inspiration to a vast number of

00:15:55.372 --> 00:16:00.312
subsequent writers, not just novelists but also playwrights and screenwriters.

00:16:00.716 --> 00:16:06.485
Dickens's extraordinary genius at combining photographic realism with great sweeps of

00:16:06.485 --> 00:16:13.375
imagination means that he has an unusual power to sum up the nature of a place or an institution.

00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:20.395
His near contemporary, the journalist Water Bagehot, described this back in 1858,

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:26.717
saying that Dickens "describes London like a special correspondent for posterity.”

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:31.367
In other words, he summed it up definitively and forever.

00:16:32.947 --> 00:16:37.607
Let's just finish with some of the specific linguistic Dickensian legacies,

00:16:37.807 --> 00:16:42.607
so you can get an idea of his talent for creating powerful images with words.

00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:47.507
Like Shakespeare, he invented words which have gone into the language.

00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:53.929
If someone keeps on dropping a ball or anything else, they are a butterfingers.

00:16:54.655 --> 00:17:00.505
If you are put into a panic or a confusion by something you might be flummoxed.

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:04.615
If you come across someone on a dark night who talks to you

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:08.555
in a nasty voice, you might say that they give you the creeps.

00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:13.875
Like any great writer, Dickens has also become synonymous with

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:18.105
particular sayings or images, so here are some to conclude:

00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:23.155
You may know that the start of A Tale of Two Cities begins with the

00:17:23.155 --> 00:17:27.015
sentence, "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times".

00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:34.215
In David Copperfield, he writes that "A loving heart is better and stronger than wisdom."

00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:39.395
And to conclude this episode, here is how he finished his last

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:42.825
public reading, which he made three months before his death.

00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:50.688
Just on a language note, “ garish”, which is a word you’ll hear, means “very bright and dazzling”.

00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:56.028
He ended his speech, perhaps knowingly, with the sentence:

00:17:56.528 --> 00:18:00.648
“From these garish lights I vanish now for evermore.”

00:18:03.378 --> 00:18:08.718
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Inimitable Charles Dickens.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:13.818
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that perhaps it

00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:18.628
might have inspired you to pick up a copy of one of his books and read one for yourself.

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:22.938
If you have a Kindle or an e-reader, because they are all out of

00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:26.398
copyright, you can pick up these books for tiny amounts of money.

00:18:26.928 --> 00:18:32.878
Indeed, I just checked and I've bought the entire works of Charles Dickens for €2,

00:18:32.948 --> 00:18:37.178
which I think must be the best value for money entertainment in the world right now.

00:18:38.148 --> 00:18:42.168
And if you have read any Charles Dickens, either in English or

00:18:42.278 --> 00:18:45.158
in your own language, I would love to know what you thought.

00:18:45.758 --> 00:18:46.658
Did you enjoy them?

00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:50.598
What do you think makes Dickens such an inimitable writer?

00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:54.618
Is there a writer in your language who you would compare Dickens to?

00:18:55.098 --> 00:18:56.408
I would love to know.

00:18:56.688 --> 00:18:59.658

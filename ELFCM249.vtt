Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:16.649
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.889
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:25.349
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.629
about the idea of utopia, the perfect, ideal society.

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:37.179
We’ll start by finding out about the book that gave rise to the term, then move onto

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:43.139
learning about some utopian ideas, what happened when people tried to put these into

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:49.469
practice, we’ll touch on the relationship between utopia and political theory, and

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:55.889
look at what has caused some utopian societies to succeed where others have failed.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.919
OK then, let’s talk about utopia.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:07.269
So, when you hear the word ‘utopia,’ what, exactly, comes to mind?

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.459
Try to close your eyes and imagine it for a minute.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.189
What does “utopia” mean to you?

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:20.049
If you look it up in the dictionary you’ll find the definition as something

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:25.939
like “an imagined place or state of things in which everything is perfect.”

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.399
Perhaps you are imagining some sort of tropical

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.659
paradise, filled with fruit trees and white-sand beaches.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.269
Perhaps it’s a wonderful forest.

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:39.149
Perhaps it’s a beautiful garden.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.859
Although the word utopia is typically used in a

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:49.039
general sense nowadays, it has a very specific origin.

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:59.069
The first recorded use of the word was in the year 1516, in a book called ‘Utopia.’ The book was

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:06.582
written by an Englishman named Sir Thomas More, who, as well as being a writer, was a lawyer,

00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:13.092
member of parliament, and Lord Chancellor of England — a type of highly ranked government officer.

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:18.792
He was also executed by Henry VIII, but that’s a story for another day.

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:24.992
In the book, More wrote about a fictional island community,

00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:29.052
whose geography and people he describes in great detail.

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:36.842
His utopia is a society governed by reason, one where no one is allowed to own

00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:43.472
private property, and is run by a system similar to what we would now call communism.

00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:49.802
It is a place without indulgences like laziness, excessive

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:53.842
drinking, and there is certainly no sex before marriage.

00:02:55.062 --> 00:03:01.262
Citizens of Utopia could also choose their own religion — though, perhaps somewhat

00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:07.582
ironically, More himself is said to have had several men burnt alive for religious

00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:13.162
reasons, and he was certainly not too keen on Henry VIII choosing his own religion.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:18.692
Whether we agree with More’s real-life practices or not,

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:23.042
what we can agree on is that More coined the word utopia.

00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:31.692
He created the word by combining parts of Greek: ‘ou,’ meaning not, and ‘topos,’ meaning place.

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:36.062
Put together, the word means: no place.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:43.292
It’s a pun - More created this term to show that such a perfect place simply cannot exist.

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:48.912
A perfect society is impossible - the clue is in the name, no place.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:56.402
The entire book was meant as a satire: that is, a piece of fiction that

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:01.612
is meant as an, often humorous, critique of some aspect of real life.

00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:06.172
It was a comment on the chaotic state of English society at

00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:10.472
the time, rather than an actual vision of a perfect society.

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:17.282
Regardless of More’s intentions, the word utopia entered the English

00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:23.922
language and became a synonym, another word, for a perfect, ideal place.

00:04:24.812 --> 00:04:31.162
Now, More may have coined the word utopia, but he was certainly not the first

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:36.462
to write about this kind of place — this so-called perfect society – and

00:04:36.462 --> 00:04:42.242
certainly not the first person to imagine what a perfect society might look like.

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:51.592
In Ireland, around the year 1330 — so nearly 200 years before the publication of Utopia — a

00:04:51.652 --> 00:04:58.622
collection of poems called the Kildare Poems describe a place called the Land of Cockaygne.

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.062
Cockaygne is a very different place to More’s Utopia.

00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:10.382
It is a land of ease and sensual pleasure, one where even monks

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:16.142
and nuns are free to engage in things like sex and public nudity.

00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:21.542
No one works, but everyone eats and drinks to their heart’s content.

00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:28.522
Rivers run with milk, honey, and wine, geese fly about already

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:33.412
roasted, and monks hunt with hawks and dance with nuns.

00:05:34.182 --> 00:05:39.528
But the idea of utopia is still far, far older even than Cockaygne.

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:44.832
Around 380 BC, nearly two thousand years before the Kildare

00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:49.572
Poems were written, the Greek philosopher Plato dreamed up a very

00:05:49.762 --> 00:05:53.702
similar-sounding place in a piece of writing called The Republic.

00:05:54.532 --> 00:06:01.982
The piece describes a place called Kallipolis, with a communist-style system of government — a

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:09.532
type of political and economic ideology in which all social classes and private property are done

00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:15.962
away with, there are no social classes or private property, and all goods are distributed equally.

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:22.472
And, no doubt, before humans wrote down stories, prehistoric men

00:06:22.472 --> 00:06:27.072
and women would tell stories of wonderful utopian worlds completely

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:32.192
uncorrupted by the problems they faced in their day-to-day lives.

00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:38.112
Utopian ideals are, of course, central to many world religions,

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:43.472
either in the form of a utopian afterlife or a creation story.

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:49.842
In Christianity, the biblical Garden of Eden is a kind of utopia — a

00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:54.702
paradise on earth, free from suffering – that is until Adam and Eve

00:06:54.842 --> 00:06:58.592
decide to listen to the words of a snake rather than the words of God.

00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:04.232
In Judaism, Israel is the true homeland of the Jews, a place

00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:08.032
where Jewish people can be happy and safe from persecution.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:15.482
But back to More, our original creator of the modern idea of “utopia”.

00:07:16.622 --> 00:07:21.382
When More’s book came out in 1516, it described a very

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:26.242
specific version of utopia, from a very specific point of view.

00:07:26.962 --> 00:07:33.502
Yet the book opened the floodgates for countless others to write their versions of

00:07:33.502 --> 00:07:39.612
utopia, and to explore their own ideas about what a perfect society might look like.

00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:45.982
In 1619, a German man named Johann Valentin Andreae

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:50.352
wrote about a Christian utopia called Christianopolis.

00:07:50.922 --> 00:07:56.592
A few years later, in 1623, the Italian writer Tommasso Campanella

00:07:56.942 --> 00:08:01.662
published a piece of utopian writing called City of the Sun, which

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:07.802
describes a theocratic society — or a society run by religious principles.

00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:14.152
In this city, everything is shared, nobody owns private property, and

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:19.632
poverty is nonexistent — quite similar to More’s version of utopia.

00:08:20.872 --> 00:08:28.322
Now, many of these writers dreamt up utopias that were heavily based on religious ideas.

00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:33.852
But some also based their utopias on science and technology,

00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:37.172
such as the English philosopher Sir Francis Bacon.

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:45.362
In 1627, Bacon wrote a book called ‘New Atlantis.’ In the book, Bacon imagines a

00:08:45.362 --> 00:08:51.592
world of human invention and discovery, where science plays a major role in society,

00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:57.332
and there are machines that sound very much like modern aeroplanes and submarines.

00:08:58.202 --> 00:09:02.642
But the idea of utopia wouldn’t be forever limited

00:09:02.812 --> 00:09:06.842
only to theory, only existing in people’s imaginations.

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:12.392
Many brave — and, perhaps, reckless — individuals went even

00:09:12.402 --> 00:09:17.252
further; they brought their versions and visions of utopia to life.

00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:24.842
Indeed, from the Enlightenment onwards, as political theorists and philosophers started to

00:09:24.842 --> 00:09:32.162
question “why” society was the way it was, there was increasing room for alternative proposals.

00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:37.912
And how this relates to utopia is, of course, that utopia is

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:42.882
something to aim for, it’s perfection, it is the perfect place.

00:09:43.352 --> 00:09:46.812
So, why not try to create it here on Earth?

00:09:47.972 --> 00:09:52.422
As you can imagine, and as I'm sure you know, these utopian

00:09:52.522 --> 00:09:57.012
visions didn’t always work out the way their architects planned.

00:09:57.442 --> 00:10:02.592
But it is fascinating to see how they tried, so let’s take a look at some of them.

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:09.722
One of the most successful utopian communities in history is a group called the Shakers.

00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:16.492
The Shakers was a Christian group founded in England in the mid-18th century, eventually

00:10:16.722 --> 00:10:24.862
leaving England and settling in America, in itself a new country built on semi-utopian ideals.

00:10:26.382 --> 00:10:30.282
It was a celibate group: this meant that members of

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:34.172
the group did not believe in either sex or marriage.

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:39.112
Not exactly everyone’s idea of paradise–and it was certainly very

00:10:39.132 --> 00:10:44.112
different from the Land of Cockaygne–but it seemed to work for the Shakers.

00:10:44.802 --> 00:10:49.272
The group valued hard work, communal living, and gender equality.

00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:55.302
It was one of the largest and longest-lived utopian societies in America, even

00:10:55.302 --> 00:10:59.742
though they couldn’t have children, they managed to sustain and grow their

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:04.362
numbers entirely through recruitment, by encouraging people to join them.

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:07.902
And there are still Shakers today.

00:11:08.242 --> 00:11:15.229
As of 2017, there were two living Shakers, who both live in Maine in the United States.

00:11:16.786 --> 00:11:25.242
Another well-known utopian community was Oneida, founded in 1848 by a man named John Humphrey Noyes.

00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:33.242
The Oneidans lived on 65 hectares of land, just over half a km2 of land, in New York state,

00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:39.902
and, like the Shakers, were devout Christians, and believed in hard work and gender equality.

00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:47.862
One thing that made Oneida quite different from the Shakers, however, was that members

00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:53.742
openly had sex with multiple partners, they were what we would now call “swingers”.

00:11:54.872 --> 00:11:58.672
Though many utopian communities have been based on religious

00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:02.642
beliefs, quite a few have nothing at all to do with religion.

00:12:03.212 --> 00:12:07.182
Many are focussed on things like philosophy, science, and the

00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:11.132
environment, or simply on providing better working conditions.

00:12:12.782 --> 00:12:18.252
Robert Owen, a Welsh mill-owner, was outraged by the long hours and

00:12:18.272 --> 00:12:23.152
terrible work conditions in 19th century Britain, particularly for children.

00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:29.122
So, he created a milling community in the town of New Lanark, in Scotland,

00:12:29.392 --> 00:12:34.792
that provided a relatively clean, and safe environment to workers escaping

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:38.882
from cities like Edinburgh, which was crowded and dirty at the time.

00:12:40.382 --> 00:12:43.072
Owen built a number of other communities that were

00:12:43.332 --> 00:12:47.462
similar to New Lanark, based on cooperation and unity.

00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:52.392
Families lived in apartments set around a large square,

00:12:52.482 --> 00:12:56.332
and children were raised communally after the age of three.

00:12:57.262 --> 00:13:04.302
At the end of the 19th century, against a backdrop of increasing industrialisation and urbanisation,

00:13:04.512 --> 00:13:11.632
an Englishman named Ebenezer Howard came up with an idea for a type of city called a garden city,

00:13:11.842 --> 00:13:17.602
which was a place where the natural environment and the built environment could exist in harmony.

00:13:18.412 --> 00:13:22.902
Howard built two of these cities, called Letchworth and Welwyn

00:13:22.912 --> 00:13:27.052
Garden City, in Hertfordshire, in England, just north of London.

00:13:27.772 --> 00:13:33.712
Howard’s ideas also inspired the creation of a number of other garden cities worldwide.

00:13:34.442 --> 00:13:41.112
Although I would perhaps warn you that if you go to Letchworth or Welwyn Garden City now in search

00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:48.412
of utopia, you will probably be somewhat disappointed - they are simply slightly sad suburbs of

00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:54.292
London, and I don’t think any resident of Welwyn Garden City would describe living in utopia.

00:13:55.612 --> 00:14:01.342
Now, moving on to more modern utopias, the heyday of utopia creation,

00:14:01.512 --> 00:14:06.432
or should I say attempted utopia creation, came in the 20th century.

00:14:07.672 --> 00:14:14.892
While Thomas More might have got rid of private property in a theoretical, fictional, utopia, in

00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:21.522
the 16th century, the 20th century saw countries actually get rid of private property in practice.

00:14:22.312 --> 00:14:30.342
From the Soviet Union to China, Cuba to even Spain, the 20th century saw areas of countries,

00:14:30.392 --> 00:14:37.492
and entire large nation states experiment with various forms of socialism and communism.

00:14:38.372 --> 00:14:43.822
To state the obvious, these didn’t always lead to prosperity for all citizens,

00:14:43.982 --> 00:14:49.132
and it turns out that although the idea of everyone sharing everything

00:14:49.232 --> 00:14:54.102
sounds nice, actually getting it to work in practice is very difficult.

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:55.902
Perhaps even impossible.

00:14:57.012 --> 00:15:04.472
It was also clear that ideas about a perfect society can end up being very dangerous and exclusive.

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:10.162
The National Socialist German Workers' Party, for example, had a vision

00:15:10.372 --> 00:15:15.162
for a perfect Germany where all Germans could live happily and freely.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:22.330
If you don't immediately recognise the name, the National Socialist German Workers Party,

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:28.484
well you’ve surely heard of its other name, The Nazi Party, and of its leader, Adolf Hitler.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:36.094
Evidently, this utopian vision for a perfect Germany involved exterminating Jews,

00:15:36.284 --> 00:15:42.544
Roma, homosexuals, and anyone else who didn’t fit into his idea of a Utopian society.

00:15:43.974 --> 00:15:49.234
Now, while successfully forming a completely utopian nation state has proved

00:15:49.644 --> 00:15:55.804
problematic, nigh impossible, and in many cases it only succeeds in creating a

00:15:55.964 --> 00:16:02.384
dystopian state, creating smaller utopias has proved slightly more achievable.

00:16:03.764 --> 00:16:07.164
One of the most fascinating of today’s utopia-like

00:16:07.164 --> 00:16:11.274
communities is Arcosanti, which is in the Arizona desert.

00:16:12.494 --> 00:16:17.034
The people who designed Arcosanti wanted a community where people could

00:16:17.034 --> 00:16:21.454
live in harmony with nature, and so they made Arcosanti energy-efficient.

00:16:22.224 --> 00:16:27.084
It looks a bit like something a little bit out of a sci-fi novel, but it is in

00:16:27.084 --> 00:16:32.404
fact a real community: there are currently 70 full-time residents living there.

00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:35.594
You can also visit or even stay overnight.

00:16:37.354 --> 00:16:41.324
There’s also Maharishi Vedic City in the state of Iowa, where

00:16:41.514 --> 00:16:45.244
residents practise something called transcendental meditation.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.644
In the community of Auroville, in the South of India, around

00:16:49.694 --> 00:16:54.054
3,000 residents from nearly 60 different countries live together.

00:16:54.864 --> 00:16:59.694
Another example of a kind of modern-day utopia is the Israeli

00:16:59.694 --> 00:17:04.064
kibbutz — a type of communal farm founded on socialist ideals.

00:17:04.694 --> 00:17:11.254
On a kibbutz, residents share all work and responsibilities, and are given free room and board.

00:17:12.254 --> 00:17:17.744
Of course, none of these communities is perfect; they have problems like anywhere else.

00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:23.884
But they were all built by people hoping to create their own version of a perfect society.

00:17:24.604 --> 00:17:29.414
The reason that they have succeeded, or semi-succeeded, or at least

00:17:29.544 --> 00:17:34.114
they continue to exist, comes down primarily to their small size.

00:17:34.664 --> 00:17:39.204
Everyone has slightly different visions of what a perfect society is.

00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:43.504
Yours is probably different to mine, and is probably slightly

00:17:43.504 --> 00:17:47.734
different to your partner’s, your parent’s, or your child’s.

00:17:48.604 --> 00:17:54.484
If you have a utopian society of 10 or 100 people, it’s perhaps

00:17:54.734 --> 00:17:59.264
manageable; you can do it, your differences are small, and there are

00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:04.524
sufficiently few people that any differences are easily resolved.

00:18:05.114 --> 00:18:09.324
If you have a society with 10 million, 100 million or even a

00:18:09.324 --> 00:18:13.124
billion people, well, it becomes a whole lot more difficult.

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:18.814
So, while Utopia is something that we can all strive towards, that we

00:18:18.814 --> 00:18:23.464
can all aim for, it’s important to remember that the clue is in the name.

00:18:23.944 --> 00:18:28.784
Utopia is no place, a place that does not and cannot exist.

00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:36.214
In the original Utopia, More wrote “Things will never be perfect, until human

00:18:36.214 --> 00:18:41.254
beings are perfect - which I don't expect them to be for quite a number of years!”

00:18:42.234 --> 00:18:49.064
Well, he wrote the book over 500 years ago, and if he were alive today I’m sure

00:18:49.144 --> 00:18:54.274
he’d look around and think that there’s still a fair bit of waiting to be done.

00:18:57.145 --> 00:19:02.305
OK then, that is it for today's episode on visions of utopia.

00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:06.085
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:10.555
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:13.445
What does utopia mean to you?

00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:19.535
What are some interesting attempts to recreate utopian communities that you know about?

00:19:20.145 --> 00:19:24.595
What are some that have gone right, and what are some that have gone terribly wrong?

00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:29.855
And how does the idea of a utopian society marry, how

00:19:29.855 --> 00:19:33.865
does it relate, to the practicalities of the real world?

00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:39.205
I would love to know what you think, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:19:39.685 --> 00:19:42.515

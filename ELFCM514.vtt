Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.750
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.900
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.560
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part series on the loose theme of education.

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.320
In case you missed it, in the last episode we talked

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.950
about the crisis affecting British universities.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.490
In the next episode, we will look into our crystal ball and talk

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.110
about some of the main ideas about the education system of the future.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.160
But today we are going to talk about private tutoring, 1:1 tuition, and the idea of genius.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.220
We have a lot to get through, so let’s get started.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.210
Let me start this episode by asking you to do something for me.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.069
Close your eyes and imagine a genius.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.799
Not a clever friend from your schooldays, or someone who is a whizz at Excel

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:14.935
at your company, someone who is known around the world for being a genius.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:17.065
Got that person?

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:18.645
Good.

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:24.014
Now, let me hazard a guess and say that I imagine that

00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:27.334
person might have been born hundreds of years ago.

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:34.473
Maybe you thought of someone like Leonardo Da Vinci, Albert Einstein, or Marie Curie?

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.393
A great composer like Mozart, maybe you would go even

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:42.473
further back and name someone like Plato or Aristotle.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:49.979
The point is, when we think of genius, that person is typically long dead.

00:01:51.097 --> 00:01:57.077
Google any “list of geniuses”, and you will find very few that are still alive.

00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:03.591
And in March a couple of years ago, an American neuroscientist called

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:09.715
Erik Hoel published an essay titled “Why we stopped making Einsteins”.

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:15.790
I’ll add a link to it so you can read it for yourself if you like, but in this essay,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.840
he details how the world stopped producing geniuses, and asks the question of why.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.340
His conclusion is that it can all be traced back to the decline in private tutoring.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.340
In the past, Hoel explains, the children of affluent parents were

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.780
often educated privately, on a one-on-one basis by a private tutor.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.390
These private tutors were often real subject-matter experts and well-known geniuses

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.431
in their own right, and they would challenge and push their students to their limits.

00:02:56.565 --> 00:03:03.410
And students would achieve outsized results, they would make faster and better progress than anyone

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.700
would do in a traditional classroom setting, and they would be much more likely to make the kind

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.670
of scientific discoveries or artistic creations that would cause them to be hailed as geniuses.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.690
Everyone I named a couple of minutes ago: Leonardo Da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.020
Mozart, Plato and Aristotle, they were all privately tutored, often by well-known great minds.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.390
In the case of Aristotle, as you may know, he was tutored by Plato.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.770
And Hoel gave this as the key reason for why the world seems to produce

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.420
so few geniuses today, despite how much easier it is to access information

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.490
and how much larger the world’s population is than it was 500 years ago.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.250
The essay even starts with this provocative statement: “I think the most depressing

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.912
fact about humanity is that during the 2000s most of the world was handed essentially

00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:14.232
free access to the entirety of knowledge and that didn’t trigger a golden age.”

00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:20.094
Now, let’s first talk about why Hoel believes that private tutoring

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:24.114
was a key reason for the geniuses of the past, then we’ll talk

00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:28.054
about some of the criticisms of the essay, and what it all means.

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:37.194
So, to start, is being privately tutored really so much better in terms of educational outcomes?

00:04:38.684 --> 00:04:40.494
In a word, yes.

00:04:41.684 --> 00:04:47.394
If you have ever had a 1:1 class, whether that’s a language class or a music class

00:04:47.394 --> 00:04:52.759
or any form of private tuition, you will no doubt have experienced this yourself.

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:59.189
You learn significantly faster, you make more progress, and you can engage with the

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:04.879
subject in a way that you can’t if you are in a classroom with 20 or 30 other people.

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.629
And this isn’t just his opinion or my opinion; an influential American

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.589
psychologist called Benjamin Bloom did extensive research into the subject, and

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:23.309
in one famous study he reported that students who had received private tutoring,

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:29.819
1:1 lessons, performed two standard deviations better than those who hadn’t.

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:36.614
Or, to translate that into plain English, those who had been privately

00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:43.863
tutored performed better than 98% of the population; they were in the top 2%.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.870
And most, not all, but most of the people we would

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.700
now call geniuses had some form of private tutoring.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.990
So all it took was someone who was naturally gifted anyway to be pushed even further, lifted

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.816
up even higher by a curious and attentive tutor, and ta-da, a genius would be created.

00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:13.366
Today, Hoel argues, we have very little private tutoring,

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:17.826
or at least the private tutoring that exists has changed.

00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:23.743
For starters, a private tutor is very expensive, and

00:06:23.913 --> 00:06:27.633
very few families can afford one even if they want to.

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:34.853
Secondly, knowledge for knowledge’s sake is no longer so in vogue.

00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:41.313
Instead, if a private tutor is hired to educate a child, it is typically

00:06:41.523 --> 00:06:45.153
to prepare them for a particular test that will get them a good

00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:49.733
grade and allow them to get into a particular school or university.

00:06:50.683 --> 00:06:57.773
The primary purpose of a private tutor in 2024 is rarely to expand a student’s

00:06:57.793 --> 00:07:03.953
intellectual ability; it is to teach them how to pass a test, to jump through a hoop.

00:07:05.453 --> 00:07:09.753
And, of course, very few people have any form of private tutoring.

00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:14.313
Most people go through a traditional schooling system, which

00:07:14.313 --> 00:07:19.153
involves classroom-based learning: one teacher and multiple students.

00:07:20.453 --> 00:07:27.103
Some children are still homeschooled, which is a form of private tutoring, but this is a

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:34.573
serious minority and in most cases the parent is not a world-renowned expert in that field.

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:40.033
Parents who homeschool their children are no doubt doing their best and are

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:46.133
often capable and enthusiastic teachers, but it is a long way from Aristotle

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:51.573
being tutored by Plato or Alexander The Great in turn being tutored by Aristotle.

00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:59.553
Private tutoring, Hoel argues, allows a child to develop their own intellectual interests,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.242
learn more quickly and efficiently and have a more rounded understanding of the world.

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.802
He then contrasts this with the modern school system,

00:08:10.202 --> 00:08:13.972
which prioritises efficiency and equality of outcomes.

00:08:15.232 --> 00:08:21.071
The number of children in a classroom might be different, and as everyone knows, some teachers

00:08:21.304 --> 00:08:26.850
are more able to inspire and motivate their students, but the general format the world

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:35.510
over is the same: students learn “subjects”, they pass “tests”, education is standardised.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:42.340
In most education systems, a student receives a grade, a mark, and

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.280
they can easily be compared to everyone else in their age group.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.157
Some might receive the top mark, they might get an A* or 10/10.

00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:57.150
But it is unlikely that the teacher will take them to one side and give them

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.080
a completely different set of reading, pushing them to achieve even more.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.730
They can’t do; teachers are busy enough as it is, and in most education systems the teacher’s job

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.860
is to ensure that every student reaches a minimum standard, especially those who are struggling.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.840
As any teacher listening to this will know, the focus is typically on helping the students

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.390
who are falling behind, making sure that everyone keeps up with the pace of the curriculum.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.220
The idea is to bring the whole class to a certain level of

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.980
competence, rather than push the top students to excel beyond it.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.186
For most teachers, their main concern is ensuring that nobody is

00:09:43.186 --> 00:09:47.736
left behind, rather than fostering the next Einstein or Da Vinci.

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:53.836
This is one of the major criticisms of the modern education system when it comes

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:59.316
to the best and brightest students, and it’s one repeated by Hoel—it’s designed

00:09:59.556 --> 00:10:04.936
to create a sense of equality, to ensure that everyone has the same opportunities.

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:12.596
But in doing so, it often sacrifices the potential of the few who could be exceptional.

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:19.116
It lifts the majority to a certain level, but it doesn’t necessarily encourage

00:10:19.206 --> 00:10:23.686
or enable those with the greatest talent to reach their full potential.

00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:29.689
Would-be geniuses, the Mozarts and Leonardo Da Vincis of the 21st

00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:33.959
century, are stuck in a system that doesn’t push them hard enough.

00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:40.339
Now, Hoel does offer some words of hope, potential rays of sunshine.

00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:46.619
He is optimistic about the potential of technology, that AI could democratise

00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:52.459
access to private tutoring, and any child could be tutored by an AI-Einstein and

00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:58.619
talk philosophy with AI-Plato and then hone their painting skills with AI-Picasso.

00:10:59.929 --> 00:11:06.789
It is an interesting idea, of course, but going back to the opening line of Hoel’s essay, we

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:14.069
have had unbridled access to free information via the Internet for twenty-plus years, and it

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:19.879
hasn’t led to the explosion of knowledge and genius that some might have thought it would have.

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:25.759
Now, this essay caused quite a splash when it was published.

00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:31.309
There were thousands of comments, other famous authors and educational researchers

00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:37.609
writing full responses to it, and the author went on to write two follow-up essays.

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:45.009
It was a controversial subject, and the main criticisms of the arguments Hoel made are as follows.

00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:50.148
Firstly, that not all geniuses were privately tutored.

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:56.159
People like Isaac Newton and Thomas Edison received little or no private

00:11:56.159 --> 00:12:00.329
tutoring, but would certainly rank on many people’s lists of geniuses.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:07.129
Hoel is looking at geniuses of the past and assuming that the reason they were “geniuses”

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:12.679
is because of the fact they were privately tutored, but the reality is that there were

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:18.169
privately tutored geniuses and there were non-privately tutored geniuses, there were both.

00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:23.759
Secondly, the way society is structured now makes the

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:27.629
emergence of an individual genius far less likely.

00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:33.679
Work is far more collaborative, people work together on projects, and

00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:38.969
this means that it’s far less likely that a single person, a single

00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:45.109
researcher, will be singled out as “the genius” that created x, y or z.

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:50.369
Discoveries are often incremental and collaborative,

00:12:50.789 --> 00:12:53.429
rather than the result of a single person’s work.

00:12:54.289 --> 00:13:01.549
Think of the Human Genome Project or CERN, these are genius-level developments but they are

00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:07.289
the result of large groups of people working together, not the work of a single individual.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:13.889
And on a related note, there is the comeback that nowadays we have “tall poppy

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:18.799
syndrome”, where people don’t want to be singled out as being responsible for something.

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:26.009
So even if there was one genius who pushed forward an entire project that resulted in

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:32.262
a miraculous discovery, they will typically credit the team rather than the individual.

00:13:33.482 --> 00:13:38.612
Thirdly, there is the criticism that it’s not that we don’t make geniuses any more,

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:45.109
but that good ideas that geniuses used to discover are becoming less easy to find.

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:51.289
If you think of historical examples of when a genius “discovered” something,

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:56.289
you might think of the legendary story of when Archimedes got into a bath,

00:13:56.669 --> 00:14:00.919
saw that the water level rose and therefore he realised that the amount of

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:04.479
water that’s displaced by an object is directly proportional to its volume.

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:08.779
And you might remember, he reportedly ran out of his house

00:14:08.789 --> 00:14:13.209
stark naked shouting “eureka”, or “I’ve found it”, in Greek.

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:20.279
In other words, we have thousands of years of lived human experience and scientific

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:26.649
experimentation so someone stumbling across an important discovery is much less likely.

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:33.069
Instead, important discoveries are made over the course of months and years

00:14:33.177 --> 00:14:37.933
and involve lots of people, so there simply aren’t cases of a man seeing what

00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:42.583
happens when he gets into a bath or another one having an apple fall on his head.

00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:45.893
All the easy ideas have been discovered.

00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:52.658
And finally, one of the big criticisms of the essay is that there are still just as many

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:59.108
geniuses, but capitalism and the modern globalised economy encourages them to work in

00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:05.588
other sectors where their genius is at best hidden from view and at worst channelled

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:11.768
towards areas that are economically productive but do little to further global knowledge.

00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:18.341
There was a great quote from an early Facebook employee, and it was “The

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:23.731
best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.“

00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:30.181
In other words, the top graduates from the best universities, the smartest people in the

00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:35.821
country who might otherwise be working on medical breakthroughs or particle physics, are

00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:41.391
being lured to companies like Facebook where they will work on problems like how to get

00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:47.121
people to log into the app more frequently or how to show people more relevant advertisements.

00:15:48.451 --> 00:15:54.121
If someone graduates from the top of their Astrophysics class at Harvard and can choose between

00:15:54.131 --> 00:15:59.904
applying for a grant to continue their studies or taking a six-figure salary offer from a

00:15:59.944 --> 00:16:05.754
technology company or a Wall Street bank, perfectly understandably, many opt for the latter.

00:16:07.234 --> 00:16:11.594
And in terms of the idea of encouraging private tutoring over

00:16:11.594 --> 00:16:14.974
traditional schooling, there are many arguments against it.

00:16:16.084 --> 00:16:20.464
First, the very reasonable criticism that a society in which every

00:16:20.464 --> 00:16:25.494
child is educated to a good standard is better than one in which most

00:16:25.494 --> 00:16:29.914
receive a poor education and a select few get all of the attention.

00:16:31.274 --> 00:16:35.924
Secondly, from a developmental point of view for the potential wonder kid,

00:16:36.314 --> 00:16:41.974
that it is preferable for a gifted child to be mixed with other children and to

00:16:41.974 --> 00:16:46.854
understand that everyone is different, that not everyone learns at the same pace.

00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:52.294
That’s a good thing, because that’s how the real world works, and a

00:16:52.294 --> 00:16:57.054
rounded education requires understanding your place within the world.

00:16:58.104 --> 00:17:02.344
I think one of the main reasons this essay was so controversial was

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:06.244
because it got a lot of people thinking about the point of education.

00:17:07.224 --> 00:17:12.254
Is it to push every child to their intellectual limit, whatever that might be?

00:17:13.234 --> 00:17:16.564
If so, what does that mean for the schooling system?

00:17:17.254 --> 00:17:22.854
For those would-be geniuses, the Aristotles or Einsteins of the modern day,

00:17:23.314 --> 00:17:27.614
is it the responsibility of the school system to nurture their inner genius?

00:17:28.034 --> 00:17:31.084
Or does this responsibility lie with the parents?

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:36.855
Or is nurturing genius simply not as important as it used to be?

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:43.839
And looking to the future, as we will do in much more detail in the next

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:48.579
part of this mini-series, we are presented with both promise and challenge.

00:17:49.229 --> 00:17:53.759
Technology like AI might democratise access to personalised learning,

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:57.939
giving every child the opportunity to have their intellectual curiosity

00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:02.609
sparked, as private tutors once did for the geniuses of the past.

00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:06.889
But how would that work in practice, how would that fit

00:18:07.139 --> 00:18:10.179
into the constraints of the education system we have today?

00:18:10.929 --> 00:18:18.129
Will it become two-tiered, with would-be geniuses racing ahead while everyone else is left behind?

00:18:18.629 --> 00:18:24.879
What does that mean in terms of educational systems, budgets, and resource allocation?

00:18:26.349 --> 00:18:32.549
Who knows, but the fate of the next generation of geniuses hangs in the balance.

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:39.909
OK then, that is it for today's episode on private tutors and the decline of geniuses.

00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:43.949
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:47.949
that it might have made you think a little more about the nature of education.

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:52.969
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode, especially as

00:18:52.969 --> 00:18:57.319
I know we have so many teachers and people involved in education in this community.

00:18:57.649 --> 00:18:59.389
So, let me know what you think.

00:18:59.769 --> 00:19:02.159
Do you agree with the arguments Hoel makes?

00:19:02.379 --> 00:19:07.619
Have you ever taught a student who had genius-like qualities, and how did you manage it?

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:11.349
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:14.389

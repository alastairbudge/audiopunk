Okay.

00:00:01.165 --> 00:00:06.805
Hi everyone and welcome to this special bonus episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:10.495
It's a bonus special episode because we have a special

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:14.245
guest and that is Lindsay McMahon from All Ears English.

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:15.025
Hi Lindsay.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.332
Hi Alastair.

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:17.522
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.202
Thanks for having me on your show.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:22.565
It's absolutely awesome for, for you to join us.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:29.345
Lindsay, can you tell our listeners a little bit more about yourself, about All Ears English

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:36.785
and about three words in particular that that you think will resonate with any English learner?

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:37.842
Oh my gosh.

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:38.622
Absolutely.

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:44.277
So All Ears English is based on, what we want to do with All Ears English is to help our

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:50.247
listeners, our students around the world understand how to use English, not just to learn it.

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:53.217
We believe that there should be something higher than just learning

00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:56.127
the grammar, learning the vocabulary, and that is connection.

00:00:56.577 --> 00:01:01.467
So everything we do, everything we teach is about human connection.

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:06.827
You know, how can you maintain eye contact and not get nervous despite making mistakes?

00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:08.777
How can you connect despite your mistakes?

00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:13.007
And so I think a lot of our listeners feel inspired by this having gone

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:18.287
through school and made mistakes and been locked into a cycle of perfectionism.

00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:21.007
So that's what we focus on at All Ears English.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.387
How do you see the right balance between connection and perfection?

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:31.867
Because I think lots of learners really struggle with this because,

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:36.487
yes you want to connect but you want to be as as accurate as possible.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.687
Could you talk me through your thoughts on that?

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:40.674
Of course, it's so true.

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:41.734
That's a good point, Alastair.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.604
It doesn't mean that we don't care about being correct.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.619
Right.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.799
We still practise.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:47.689
We still work hard.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.399
We still try to learn the finer grammar points and we try, right.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.169
We, we work in integrity.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.889
We try to be the best version of ourselves as an English speaker.

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.079
But the whole point of this phrase is at the end of the day, you're still gonna make mistakes.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.009
And, and under this idea of "connection not perfection",

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.739
we know that and we make the connection anyways.

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:11.069
Does that make sense?

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:12.429
It does.

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.792
It does, I guess, does this come from some kind of personal

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:21.552
experience that you've had or or that, yeah, where does it come from?

00:02:22.082 --> 00:02:23.439
Well, I would say so.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.449
I was just chatting with someone last night about this.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.139
I think it came from, well, of course, years taking

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.599
French classes in middle school and feeling frustrated.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.434
Feeling embarrassed that I was making mistakes, being

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:36.744
in that position that our students have been in.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.554
But then it also came from a year of traveling in south America.

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:44.251
I was on a beach one night in in Colombia.

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:49.404
I was traveling with just Spanish speakers and so they were really buddy, buddy.

00:02:49.404 --> 00:02:49.764
Right.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:51.984
They could connect, they could laugh, they could tell jokes.

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:55.704
And we were all sitting in a circle on the beach and I was kind of on the outside.

00:02:56.214 --> 00:03:00.954
And in that moment, I felt really alone to be honest, like really lonely.

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.849
And in that moment, something like lit a fire in my belly.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.199
And I said, I don't want anyone to feel disconnected because of language.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.969
Like no one should feel this.

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.449
Right.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.909
So that's kind of where it came from, that moment.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.069
And I have a hunch that a lot of our listeners have either been

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.759
in a situation like that, or we want to avoid those situations.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.339
Language should never come between people.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.839
So that's where it came from.

00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:26.017
Interesting.

00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:26.587
Yeah.

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:31.657
I think everyone's been in that situation where you feel like there's a conversation that you're

00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:37.897
excluded from, and you perhaps feel that it's because you're not able to communicate in the right

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:43.717
way or you're afraid of being judged or making mistakes, but, but once you kind of throw yourself

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:49.099
in at the deep end you realise that connection is not about language it's about it's about humans.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.689
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.019
And even though we're all speaking different languages, we can still connect.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.829
So again, it's not about ignoring grammar, it's not about being lazy.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.159
Right.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.669
It's kind of more about what you do in the moment of conversation.

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:05.659
In the moment of face-to-face of interfacing with someone.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:12.949
What we do before is hard work is like I said, integrity is dedication, right?

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.204
But it's what we do in that moment that actually

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:18.424
matters the most, or it's the combination of the two.

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:19.204
So

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:24.202
I understand, that is a super interesting perspective.

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:29.643
Why do think this is a particularly important message for, for English

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:34.383
learners, particularly now, and particularly people are who are

00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:39.263
trying to learn or improve their English for professional reasons?

00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:44.961
Yeah, I think that, you know, with globalisation and right now in this

00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:49.281
very moment, people are speculating that globalisation is going backwards.

00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:50.271
I don't believe that.

00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:50.601
Right.

00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:51.621
That's not going to happen.

00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:54.441
You know, globalisation is a force that's going to continue.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:59.406
We are going to continue crossing cultures, the economy is global forever.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:04.296
And I think along with crossing cultures, there's a certain pragmatism that we need

00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:09.126
to have achieving the connection, achieving the goal, which let's talk about it.

00:05:09.126 --> 00:05:09.306
Right.

00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:14.136
If we're doing business across cultures, it is getting the deal done or getting the

00:05:14.136 --> 00:05:19.866
project done with our product manager in Paris when we are from Tokyo, so at this

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:24.366
moment because of globalisation, because of crossing cultures, because everything is so

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:30.456
fast, we don't have any time to dwell on our perfection actually, no one cares, right?

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:31.536
We just don't care.

00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:34.956
Again there's a certain quality that we want to achieve and strive for.

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:37.866
But at the end of the day, did you get the deal done?

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:39.216
Did you complete the project?

00:05:39.396 --> 00:05:41.256
Did you get a handshake?

00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:41.676
Right?

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:45.516
Did you do the business you need to do in a peaceful and

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:49.026
you know, a good way that has built that relationship?

00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:50.746
So it's focusing on the relationships.

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:53.876
So it's because of how fast the economy is now.

00:05:53.926 --> 00:05:54.336
Yeah.

00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:01.518
I'm sure lots people listening to this are kind of nodding quietly as as I am as well.

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:06.533
But when it comes down to putting it into practice, when it comes down

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:11.273
to actually having that conversation, quite often, you, freeze up, right?

00:06:11.273 --> 00:06:17.958
You, you can't remember how to, say that particular phrasal verb or you can't kind of

00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:22.968
conjugate that particular sentence and you think, ah, and, and either you've just missed

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:27.821
the missed the moment and the conversation has passed or you, you still feel afraid.

00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:36.708
How, what would your advice be to a learner on how they can get over that a practical basis?

00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:37.611
Yeah.

00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:43.581
So I have a couple of tips for how to kind of take on, and this is very possible, we've had our

00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:48.621
listeners write into us and tell us that they have, by listening to the show, by just believing in

00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:54.711
this, they have been able to take this on, you know, as a new way to be with English in the world.

00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:57.351
So a couple of tips, I mean, the first thing.

00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:02.226
Is ask yourself, like, do you really want to make this change?

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:05.496
Because I think that a lot of people hide in perfectionism.

00:07:05.856 --> 00:07:07.026
It's a great place to hide.

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.866
It's really easy to say, I'm not ready.

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:11.916
I'm not perfect.

00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:13.886
Therefore I'm not going to go out and speak.

00:07:14.516 --> 00:07:16.806
So does your desire to connect?

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:18.036
Is that more?

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:22.086
It should be, and it actually is, right, because the mind is just confused.

00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:26.526
I mean, I study meditation and Buddhism and like learning about the human mind.

00:07:26.856 --> 00:07:30.336
If your mind is stuck in perfectionism, it's trying to protect you.

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:31.566
It's just confused.

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:35.996
What you actually want as a human being is to connect in

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:38.526
like your heart of hearts, at least that's what I want.

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:39.156
Right.

00:07:39.156 --> 00:07:44.196
And so ask yourself as a step one, do you actually want this and how can you

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:47.556
kind of get to the place where you are ready, and you do want to go for it?

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:52.773
You want to go for connection and kind of leave perfection in the rear in the rear view mirror.

00:07:53.163 --> 00:07:55.203
That'd be my first tip.

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:55.613
Okay.

00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:57.403
Do you do you have other tips?

00:07:58.273 --> 00:07:59.943
For for sure.

00:07:59.976 --> 00:08:00.786
Would you like to hear them?

00:08:01.203 --> 00:08:04.946
I think we're getting a lot of gold here, so I want to keep

00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:06.206
Keep it going.

00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:06.516
Okay.

00:08:06.516 --> 00:08:07.776
All right.

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:12.006
So tip number two is set new definitions for failure and success.

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:16.381
So now, up until now, failure has been, I made a mistake, right?

00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:19.981
And of course you curled up and you walked away, you retreated

00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.941
into the safety of, I don't know, know, just not connecting.

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.821
Your new, you know, your new definition of failure is

00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:30.511
now, right, that you basically, you made the mistake.

00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:30.811
Yes.

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.071
But you broke the connection.

00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:34.081
It's what you did after you made that mistake.

00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:37.231
So it's okay to make that mistake.

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:38.821
It's actually part of success.

00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:44.256
But if you, the way that you've, if you fail, it means that you have, you know, maybe you

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:51.006
have, again, dropped eye contact or your voice cracked or in your mind something switched.

00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:54.676
And that person saw that and you were no longer in connection with them.

00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:55.366
All right.

00:08:55.386 --> 00:08:56.226
So that's failure.

00:08:56.496 --> 00:09:00.366
Success is that you, you made a mistake and then you

00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:03.666
maintained that connection despite, or because of that mistake.

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:06.246
Maybe you made a joke about yourself.

00:09:06.636 --> 00:09:07.676
Why not, right?

00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:10.016
A little self-deprecating humour?

00:09:10.296 --> 00:09:10.686
Okay.

00:09:11.306 --> 00:09:12.266
Cause we've all been there.

00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:13.856
I lived in Japan for a year and a half.

00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:16.016
I mean, you're living, are you living in Italy?

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:16.346
Is that

00:09:17.226 --> 00:09:21.253
I live in Malta, which is just south of Italy, yup.

00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:21.403
yeah

00:09:21.733 --> 00:09:22.616
We've all lived abroad.

00:09:22.706 --> 00:09:24.206
We've all been in these situations.

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:24.536
Yeah.

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:27.236
So what do you do after you make the mistake?

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:33.686
That's tip two and then I have some tips, some more practical, linguistic type tips for tip three.

00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:36.326
We'd like to call this the brain box.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:40.311
So open your brain box and what this means, this is a

00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:43.671
practical thing you can do before you enter a situation.

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:48.561
It means that you actually linguistically prepare your mind for

00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:52.581
certain words that you may need, or that you may hear for listening.

00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.721
So if I'm going to go to a day at the beach, my friends, again, my

00:09:56.721 --> 00:10:00.501
friends in Colombia, all Spanish speakers have invited me to go back to

00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:04.551
that beach that I was on in 2007 for a day at the beach and hang out.

00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:05.931
This time, I'm going to connect.

00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:09.381
I have my Spanish, I'm going to open my brain box before I go.

00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:14.991
Maybe even write down some key words and phrases that I think I'm going to hear.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:19.041
And this has been proven in linguistics that it prepares the brain.

00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:22.221
You know, even when you write a subject line and you read the subject

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.401
line first, you'll have an easier time understanding the email.

00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.821
You prep your brain for what's coming, so you'll hear things,

00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:32.321
you'll understand things, and the vocab will be ready for you.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:38.721
So that's kind of on the practical side of what you can do and then just a sub tip for

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:43.371
that would be thinking in English as much as possible, you know, around your house.

00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:46.221
When I lived in Japan, I tried to think in Japanese

00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:48.735
all the time, I never made it past high beginner.

00:10:49.838 --> 00:10:53.421
But even, yeah, we don't have to be in the country to think in that language.

00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:55.161
Just what is the dialogue?

00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:57.441
What language is the dialogue going on in your head?

00:10:57.801 --> 00:10:59.901
Is it in your native language or in English?

00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:11.358
So my, my final question actually is for people who are learning English, who

00:11:11.358 --> 00:11:15.288
are improving their English, but are not living in an English speaking country.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:19.458
And I know we've got lots and lots of listeners who live in places like

00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:25.386
Spain and Italy and Germany who don't often have the opportunity to,

00:11:25.626 --> 00:11:29.346
to speak with native speakers or even speak with people in English.

00:11:29.766 --> 00:11:38.928
How would you apply the the idea of connection not perfection to people in situation.

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:41.478
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.318
So I would push back on the idea that if we're living

00:11:45.318 --> 00:11:47.988
in our home country, we have no opportunity to speak.

00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:49.218
Well, two things I'd push back on.

00:11:49.638 --> 00:11:52.668
So, you know, our students, our listeners often say that

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:55.218
they, they feel they need to speak with a native speaker.

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:56.028
I don't agree with.

00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:57.053
Right.

00:11:57.053 --> 00:12:02.843
I think speaking with another learner who's at your level can be just as valuable.

00:12:03.233 --> 00:12:07.523
So I want us to try to get out of this mentality that it has to be a native speaker, right?

00:12:07.523 --> 00:12:09.203
Cause that's a tough place to be.

00:12:09.203 --> 00:12:11.003
That can be impractical at times.

00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:12.233
And number two.

00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:15.013
We all have access to the internet now.

00:12:15.343 --> 00:12:18.883
There are so many online marketplaces that have free exchanges or

00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:23.263
paid exchanges where you can buy 15 minutes with a tutor, right.

00:12:23.293 --> 00:12:29.293
With a native speaker or, or with a non native speaker to just practise as a language exchange.

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:34.938
So with the internet, I have, I have a hard time believing that we can't put ourselves into

00:12:34.938 --> 00:12:40.248
that moment where we can actually speak or interface with the language in one way or the other.

00:12:40.248 --> 00:12:41.928
We just have to make a little extra effort.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.938
It's not going to walk into our, our house.

00:12:43.938 --> 00:12:44.688
Right it's not going to knock.

00:12:44.748 --> 00:12:49.228
English is not going to come knocking on your door and show itself in, you just have

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:54.831
to take a little extra have to take a little extra effort to go after it, right?

00:12:54.831 --> 00:12:58.111
I think that is, that is very nice way to think about it.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.961
English is certainly not going to come knocking at your door, but

00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:05.251
there have never been more opportunities to to engage with English

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:10.451
and to put Lindsay's idea of connection not perfection into practice.

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:14.301

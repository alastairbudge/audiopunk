Hello hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:11.978
English.

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:13.328
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:22.723
Today, we are going to be talking about North Korea, one of the most isolated and strangest places

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:23.353
in the world.

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:30.656
Before we get right into it, I just want to remind those of you listening to this podcast on Apple

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:37.556
Podcasts, Spotify, iVoox, or wherever you get your podcasts that you can get a copy of the

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:43.086
transcript and key vocabulary over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.035
We've also launched a really cool new feature so that the transcript animates as you listen, so

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:57.575
instead of scrolling down the page or reading the PDF, it's as if there were subtitles for the

00:00:57.575 --> 00:00:58.265
podcast.

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:06.635
I think it's pretty cool, everyone who has used it says, whoa, that's quite neat, and it does make

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:09.875
it a lot, lot easier to follow every single word.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:11.705
So check that out.

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.025
It's over at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.275
Right then North Korea.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:24.215
Today we are going to ask ourselves, how did it get to this?

00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:34.295
One country slap bang in the middle of the economic powerhouses of China, Japan, and South Korea,

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:42.269
that has ended up being pretty much the most isolated place in the world to outsiders and a complete

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:44.004
pariah state.

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:53.844
So much so that in English it's known as the hermit kingdom, so a hermit is normally someone who

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:59.124
cuts themselves off from society, usually for religious reasons.

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:07.584
The reasons that North Korea is cut off from the rest of the world aren't religious, of course, and

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.774
there isn't one single reason.

00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:18.649
Especially given everything that has been going on in the past few years with Kim Jong-un and Donald

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:26.449
Trump, it's easy for people to characterise the situation into being a sort of mad dictator with

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:31.429
nuclear powers, sort of like a Austin Powers situation.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.829
But the situation is a lot more complicated than that.

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:45.229
And the story of North Korea is a really interesting one to try and understand some of the power

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:51.454
dynamics that have been going on between the East and the West in the past hundred years or so.

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:58.127
Today we are going to be asking ourselves, how did it get to this?

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:06.317
Why does North Korea really continue to develop nuclear weapons and what might the future hold for

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:06.827
North Korea?

00:03:08.457 --> 00:03:16.227
We'll also end with four very strange facts about North Korea that I'd be willing to bet you didn't

00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:16.587
know.

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:24.596
As always, it's worth just recapping a little bit of history to understand how we got to this

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:25.256
situation.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:33.228
For the purposes of today's podcast, we'll start at the beginning of the 20th century, just over a

00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:41.733
hundred years ago when the entire Korean peninsula was occupied and then annexed by the Japanese.

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:51.177
It was kept as a Japanese colony for the next 35 years until Japan was defeated in the Second World

00:03:51.177 --> 00:03:51.597
War.

00:03:53.217 --> 00:04:01.167
When Japan finally surrendered, the Northern part of the Korean peninsula was occupied by the

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:05.967
Russians, and the Southern part was occupied by the Americans.

00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:15.215
Neither wanted to give up territory and influence in this very strategic point of East Asia, and so

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:23.075
the peninsula was divided into two countries, the North being the Democratic People's Republic of

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:28.985
Korea and the South being the American-aligned Republic of Korea.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:39.010
As leader of the North, the Soviets installed a man called Kim Il-sung who had previously been a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.290
communist guerilla.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:50.360
So it was actually only in 1948 that North Korea was formed previously there never was North and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.860
South Korea, this is actually a pretty recent construct.

00:04:57.086 --> 00:05:04.934
However, even though the peninsula had been split into two parts, both the North and the South

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:15.524
claimed that they had jurisdiction over the entire peninsula, and so in 1950, just two years after

00:05:15.584 --> 00:05:23.924
the formation of North Korea, the North, with the backing of the Soviets, attacked the South, which

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.054
kicked off the Korean war.

00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:34.685
The United States, of course sensing that if the South was defeated, they would lose an important

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:44.588
stronghold in East Asia, they supported the South and the end result was this very nasty messy war

00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:51.533
that cost the lives of two and a half million people, most of them actually civilians.

00:05:52.365 --> 00:06:03.211
In 1953, after three years of a pretty pointless war an armistice was signed, and note that it was

00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:09.931
only an armistice, a temporary peace, the war is still technically ongoing.

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:19.121
Since then, however, South Korea has developed into a thriving country with high living standards,

00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:25.001
some world-class companies, and a big cultural impact on the world.

00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:31.901
North Korea, as you will know, is almost a polar opposite.

00:06:32.953 --> 00:06:37.566
You could be forgiven for thinking that it was immediately downhill for North Korea.

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:46.766
However, until the 1980s or so, North Korea was actually more advanced than its southern neighbour.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:56.666
It invested heavily in industries like mining and steel production, and it built up a sizeable

00:06:56.756 --> 00:06:57.356
military.

00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:03.736
It was able to do this mainly through support from the Soviet Union.

00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:12.491
However, as the Soviet Union began to unwind, the money and support stopped flowing to North Korea

00:07:13.121 --> 00:07:15.851
and things went backward pretty quickly.

00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:23.712
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, North Korea soon realised that it was pretty short of

00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:24.462
friends.

00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:32.787
Communist governments were falling, they were being toppled, all across the world, and without

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:40.947
allies, North Korea would be in a pretty precarious position if its Southern neighbour decided to

00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:41.487
attack it.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:50.007
So North Korea made efforts to cozy up even more to China, it tried to befriend China even more.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:08:00.393
It was, and still is in China's advantage to have an ally in North Korea as it acts as a buffer, a

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:05.283
sort of protective wall against the US affiliated South.

00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:13.998
Without North Korea, and if the entire Korean peninsula was taken over by what's now South Korea,

00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:23.238
China would in effect have a border with a US-aligned country and it evidently doesn't want to do

00:08:23.238 --> 00:08:23.748
that.

00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:33.605
Cut off from the world and only supported by China, life turned from bad to worse in North Korea.

00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:40.875
There were huge famines in the 1990s and millions of people perished.

00:08:42.325 --> 00:08:50.975
The original leader of North Korea, Kim Il-sung died in 1994 and was replaced by his son, Kim

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:51.345
Jong-il.

00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:59.007
And it was under Kim Jong-il that North Korea first started enriching uranium in order to create its

00:08:59.007 --> 00:09:03.987
own nuclear capabilities, despite having promised not to.

00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:14.151
Fast forward a few years and after Kim Jong-il died in 2011 and was replaced by one of his sons, Kim

00:09:14.151 --> 00:09:22.011
Jong-un, things continued to get weirder and more volatile, more unpredictable, in the hermit

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:22.461
kingdom.

00:09:23.445 --> 00:09:31.340
Kim Jong-un appears to be a pretty ruthless leader, executing members of his own family, including

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.310
his oldest half brother and his uncle.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:44.180
He also appears to be a highly erratic individual, testing nuclear weapons in 2017 despite knowing

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:51.350
that his counterpart in the White House was probably equally erratic and impulsive.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:10:00.455
And I don't know about you, but the idea that Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump both almost literally had

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:06.305
their fingers on a big red button, that's not a particularly comforting thought.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:15.115
So that's a quick bit of North Korean history, which helps explain how we have got to the situation

00:10:15.205 --> 00:10:15.985
we're in now.

00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:26.885
One of the main questions people have about North Korea now though, is about why it continues to

00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:28.955
develop nuclear weapons.

00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:35.855
You can't really talk about North Korea without mentioning the fact that it is a nuclear power

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:43.775
controlled by a pretty erratic dictator, so this seems to be one of the first questions that people

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:44.135
ask.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:52.340
If they could just be brought back into world society, if they could just be another normal country,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.210
if they gave up nuclear weapons, why don't they do it?

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.320
Well, there are a few reasons here.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:08.540
It's certainly not that they actually want to use them offensively for an attack on the South or

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.690
Japan or the US or anywhere else.

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:20.345
Doing so would lead to immediate reprisals, immediate payback, causing huge devastation in the

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:23.735
North, and it would make absolutely no sense to do so.

00:11:24.305 --> 00:11:28.655
It would be a completely suicidal move for the regime.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:38.990
So if it's not for offensive reasons, it must be for defensive reasons, to defend North Korea

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.090
against a potential attack from the South or from the US.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:51.680
Or rather, we should say that it's for defensive reasons, but more as a deterrent than as a real

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.250
defense.

00:11:53.105 --> 00:12:00.665
Having nuclear weapons just shows what you're capable of if someone attacks you, so it helps you

00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:02.975
avoid being attacked in the first place.

00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:10.595
While this is supposedly the reason that any country would have nuclear weapons, it's particularly

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:11.945
true for North Korea.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:20.929
So the primary reason, according to most experts, that North Korea has nuclear weapons is this one,

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:23.179
to act as a deterrent.

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:30.709
But it's not quite as simple as that, and there are a few more important reasons that it's worth

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:31.309
talking about.

00:12:32.581 --> 00:12:40.081
Firstly, without nuclear weapons, North Korea would have really very little bargaining power when it

00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:44.011
comes to economic or diplomatic negotiations.

00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:53.934
As we have seen through the start of the negotiations with the US, the North thinks that it can use

00:12:53.934 --> 00:13:03.714
its nuclear capabilities as a way to extract concessions in a negotiation, as a way to get more than

00:13:03.714 --> 00:13:05.214
it would otherwise.

00:13:06.874 --> 00:13:14.574
Basically saying, you should give us more favourable treatment, and in return, we will get rid of

00:13:14.574 --> 00:13:20.424
our nuclear weapons, or at least you need to give us better treatment because we have nuclear

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:20.964
weapons.

00:13:22.023 --> 00:13:30.135
There's also the factor that living standards in North Korea are pretty dismal, pretty terrible, and

00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:39.225
having nuclear weapons is a great source of national prestige, used to make people more proud of

00:13:39.225 --> 00:13:43.545
their country despite their pretty terrible day-to-day life.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:52.424
Kim Jong-un, as he doesn't have any of the revolutionary credentials of his grandfather or the

00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:01.270
political longevity credentials of his father, he has portrayed himself as the keeper of the nuclear

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:09.970
weapons, consistently publishing pictures of himself with missiles, inspecting weapons facilities,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:17.980
and the nuclear weapons are also a sort of personal legitimacy for Kim Jong-un.

00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:26.174
So there are several pretty good reasons that the North has to keep its nuclear weapons and it

00:14:26.174 --> 00:14:33.824
doesn't seem very likely at all that they will do anything to give them up, no matter how many love

00:14:33.824 --> 00:14:37.124
letters Kim Jong-un receives from Donald Trump.

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:45.824
This being said, relations between the North and the South, between North Korea and South Korea, and

00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:51.824
North Korea and the rest of the world, they appear to be slightly better than they were at least

00:14:51.884 --> 00:14:52.664
five years ago.

00:14:53.894 --> 00:15:03.014
Kim Jong-un and the South Korean president Moon Jae-in met in April, 2018 almost two years ago, and

00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:05.504
that was for the first time in 10 years.

00:15:06.194 --> 00:15:14.099
And there have been several other gestures such as North Korea sending a team to the winter Olympics

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:23.579
in South Korea in 2018, and these slightly surreal conferences between the US and North Korea,

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:26.339
between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump.

00:15:28.436 --> 00:15:34.279
But life in North Korea, despite these gestures, is still pretty brutal.

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:42.289
It's estimated that hundreds of thousands of people are imprisoned in labour camps, there are

00:15:42.289 --> 00:15:50.629
frequent food shortages and any criticism of the ruling party is met with fierce punishment.

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:58.849
It's still possible to visit as a tourist and a few thousand people do travel there every year.

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:09.484
However, it's very tightly controlled and after the death, or should I say murder of a US tourist in

00:16:09.484 --> 00:16:18.094
2017 after he was arrested for stealing a poster from a hotel and sentenced to 15 years

00:16:18.094 --> 00:16:25.350
imprisonment, I imagine many people are understandably thinking twice about North Korea as their

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.000
next holiday destination.

00:16:29.302 --> 00:16:35.733
So the question we asked ourselves at the start of the podcast was North Korea, how did it get to

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:36.243
this?

00:16:37.783 --> 00:16:41.563
And I guess the response is, well, it's actually quite complicated.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:50.389
But I think it's fascinating to understand more about it, and as always, things aren't as simple as

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:53.089
they may be portrayed to be by the media.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.794
Before we call it a day for today though, I want to just finish with some strange and sort of

00:17:00.794 --> 00:17:03.044
lighthearted facts about North Korea.

00:17:04.814 --> 00:17:11.894
Firstly, it's that it isn't just freedom of speech that is curtailed, that is limited.

00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:21.404
The style of your haircuts also have to match a particular style, each of which is state approved.

00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:25.454
There are only 28 hairstyles approved by Kim Jong-un.

00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:34.004
Men can choose between 10 hairstyles and women can decide between 18 various styles.

00:17:35.043 --> 00:17:40.889
I don't know about you, but part of me thinks that this isn't actually a terrible idea.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:46.949
Going to the hairdresser and just saying, "please can I have a number eight" would remove a lot of

00:17:46.949 --> 00:17:47.459
confusion.

00:17:49.984 --> 00:17:57.214
Second interesting bit of trivia about North Korea - while free speech is certainly not allowed,

00:17:57.694 --> 00:17:59.644
marijuana is allowed.

00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:06.764
I couldn't find out exactly why that is, but it is true, there is nothing illegal about smoking

00:18:06.764 --> 00:18:13.094
marijuana in North Korea, and apparently 30% of North Koreans regularly use drugs.

00:18:13.814 --> 00:18:14.474
Who would have known?

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:23.660
Thirdly, and here is another fact provided by the North Korean press, but I will let you make up

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.880
your own mind as to whether you believe it.

00:18:27.095 --> 00:18:34.325
Kim Jong-il, the son of the country's first leader, has performed amazing feats, amazing acts,

00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:36.965
according to state controlled media.

00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:47.615
These include him scoring a perfect 300 the first time he went bowling and the first time he played

00:18:47.615 --> 00:18:51.095
golf, he sank 11 holes in one.

00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:54.005
What a phenomenally talented man.

00:18:55.659 --> 00:19:02.228
And finally, our final weird fact about North Korea is that the calendar isn't quite the same as the

00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:04.688
one that you or I probably use.

00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:14.978
In North Korea the calendar starts on the 15th of April, 1912 which was Kim Il-sung's date of birth.

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:24.294
So while now it's the year 2020 for most of the world, in North Korea it's the year 107 and later on

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:25.084
it'll be 108.

00:19:26.724 --> 00:19:33.174
Okay then, I hope that this has been an enlightening little dip into North Korea, the hermit

00:19:33.174 --> 00:19:33.564
kingdom.

00:19:34.284 --> 00:19:41.184
It's a hugely complicated situation, but pretty fascinating to think about how it has got to this.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:45.654
As always, I'd love to know what you thought of the podcast.

And final point, do check out the new animating transcripts on the website.

00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:04.104
It means you can listen to the audio with the words flashing up on the screen in front of you, and

00:20:04.104 --> 00:20:09.534
it is a really cool way to listen while also not missing out on one single word.

00:20:10.164 --> 00:20:12.464

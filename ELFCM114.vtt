Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:16.444
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:20.934
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:26.404
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:30.584
Charles Darwin, the father of modern evolutionary theory.

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:36.304
There are few people that one can point to that have had such a monumental

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:40.744
impact on our understanding of how the world works than Charles Darwin.

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:47.954
He was the author of the book On The Origin of Species which put forward the revolutionary

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:53.614
idea that instead of every creature on the planet being created by a God, creatures

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:58.994
adapted to their environment through natural selection, and evolved accordingly.

00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:06.154
How he actually came to this conclusion is fascinating, and it’s certainly unexpected.

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:11.354
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about the life of Charles

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:16.894
Darwin, the ideas that shaped him, how he almost became a priest, and

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:20.794
then became fascinated with the natural world and where animals come from.

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:28.394
We'll also see how, 20 years after having the first idea about natural selection, he

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:33.964
published this revolutionary book and changed our understanding of evolution forever.

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:40.904
Before we get right into that though, let me just quickly remind you that you can follow along

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:46.104

a Christmas or birthday present to, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:24.054 --> 00:02:26.974
OK then, let’s talk about Charles Darwin.

00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:34.634
He was described by his uncle as “a man of enlarged curiosity”, and

00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:39.944
it certainly does take a curious mind to present an idea so radical

00:02:40.364 --> 00:02:45.044
not just to go against the belief at the time, but to go against God.

00:02:45.894 --> 00:02:50.194
Reading the theories of Charles Darwin might give you the idea that he was

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:55.574
a troublemaker, a rebel, proposing revolutionary theories to stir things up.

00:02:56.764 --> 00:02:59.724
In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.

00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:07.344
He was born to a wealthy family, in 1809, in the town of Shrewsbury, in England.

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:15.354
His father was a wealthy doctor, and he came from a well-known family of Enlightenment thinkers.

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:22.024
His paternal grandfather, his grandfather on his father’s side, had authored

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:27.374
a book on evolution, and his maternal grandfather, his grandfather on his

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:32.304
mother's side, had been a passionate advocate for the abolition of slavery.

00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:36.964
Both were, at the time, non-conventional views.

00:03:38.514 --> 00:03:42.574
And the young Darwin grew up in a household and environment

00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:46.764
of freethinkers, encouraged to think for himself.

00:03:48.084 --> 00:03:53.584
He was sent away to medical school in Edinburgh, in Scotland, when he was only 16 years old.

00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:59.244
Edinburgh was at the time the best medical school in Britain,

00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:04.844
and also a rare university that wasn’t dominated by the church.

00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:10.694
At Edinburgh the young Darwin loathed, he hated medical studies.

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:15.054
At the time he was studying, anesthetic was not yet

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:19.084
available, so surgery was quite something to witness.

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:24.084
It’s said that Darwin was forever turned off medicine

00:04:24.574 --> 00:04:28.034
when witnessing an operation with a child that went wrong.

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.484
Which I’m sure was as horrible as it sounds.

00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:37.794
Instead, he developed a deep love and curiosity for the natural

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:43.074
world, joining a natural history society and spending his days in

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:48.234
the area around Edinburgh collecting shells and small marine animals.

00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:55.544
The University of Edinburgh, unlike most other British universities, didn’t have such a

00:04:55.544 --> 00:05:01.994
strong church presence, and ideas about evolution were discussed that would never have been

00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:08.004
allowed in universities with stronger connections to the church, such as Cambridge or Oxford.

00:05:09.064 --> 00:05:12.924
Darwin wasn’t getting anywhere with his medical studies, and

00:05:12.924 --> 00:05:17.044
so his father pulled him out, he took him out of university.

00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:23.384
At the time there were really only two respectable non-military

00:05:23.434 --> 00:05:27.544
professions that a young, wealthy Englishman could go into.

00:05:28.764 --> 00:05:32.614
The first was medicine, but Darwin was failing at that.

00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:39.264
The second was the church, and Darwin’s father sent him to Cambridge

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:43.544
to study natural history, the history of the natural world.

00:05:44.714 --> 00:05:50.054
Now, natural history might not immediately sound like the type of course

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:55.234
that someone embarking on a career in the church should be doing, but

00:05:55.634 --> 00:05:59.684
it was actually exactly the type of course that they should be doing.

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:07.004
The belief at that time was that God created everything, and so an understanding

00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:12.124
of the natural world was pretty much the best way to understand God.

00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:16.994
Indeed, the course that Darwin took at Cambridge was a

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:21.314
very well trodden path towards a career in the church.

00:06:22.554 --> 00:06:28.794
The University of Cambridge had deep links with the church, and just to graduate

00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:35.004
you had to sign the 39 articles of the Church of England, of the Anglican church.

00:06:36.484 --> 00:06:44.334
While he was at Cambridge, Darwin developed a great passion for beetles, for these little insects.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:49.984
Now, you might have trouble understanding why anyone could be so

00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:55.124
interested in beetles, but for Darwin they were just fantastic.

00:06:56.414 --> 00:06:58.964
Firstly, there are lots of them.

00:06:59.904 --> 00:07:06.404
By lots, I mean there are 350,000 different species of beetle, or Order

00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:12.464
Coleoptera, which is the scientific name for what you or I might call a ‘beetle’.

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:18.204
Darwin was obsessed with collecting beetles, analysing

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.954
how they were different, and classifying them.

00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:29.794
There’s even quite a funny, or disgusting, episode in his diary where he is out hunting for beetles.

00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:37.764
He describes having one beetle in each hand, and then discovering another, rare, new one.

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:44.594
Now, he didn’t want to drop either of the two beetles that he had, so he put

00:07:44.604 --> 00:07:49.924
one in his mouth so that he could free up one hand and pick up the other one.

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:55.674
Unfortunately the beetle that was put in Darwin’s mouth didn’t like it in

00:07:55.674 --> 00:08:02.314
there, and it spat out an acrid fluid that burned Darwin’s tongue, it gave

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:07.744
off a horrible liquid, so Darwin spat it out and all the beetles were lost.

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:13.354
I guess the moral of the story there is don’t put a beetle in your mouth.

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:21.734
Despite Darwin’s increasing understanding of the rich variety of different species, and curiosity

00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:28.714
about how and why species were different, this didn’t disprove anything about the Christian faith.

00:08:29.414 --> 00:08:34.274
Creationism allows for the idea that animals can be a little bit different,

00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:38.694
they can adapt a little bit, but it doesn’t allow for them to change

00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:44.174
completely, for them to move too far from their original ‘God-given’ form.

00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:50.534
So Darwin at the time didn’t really have any revolutionary new theories

00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:55.484
about evolution, and he was still on the path to joining the church.

00:08:56.834 --> 00:09:03.254
But soon after graduating from Cambridge he was presented with a remarkable opportunity.

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:11.704
He had been proposed, he had been put forward, by his friend and mentor, a botanist called

00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:19.394
John Stevens Henslow, to go on a 2 year trip around South America to observe new species.

00:09:20.804 --> 00:09:26.434
A ship, the HMS Beagle, was leaving in 4 weeks time, and there was a

00:09:26.464 --> 00:09:31.674
place for a gentleman naturalist to go and observe the natural world.

00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:38.814
Darwin leapt at the opportunity, and it was to be a trip that expanded on the

00:09:38.814 --> 00:09:43.964
ideas and passions that he had been developing at Edinburgh and Cambridge.

00:09:45.104 --> 00:09:53.034
They left in 1831, and didn’t return for 5 years, sailing from Britain down the Atlantic,

00:09:53.374 --> 00:09:59.604
around the coast of South America, up to the Galapagos Islands, all the way across the

00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:05.874
Pacific to New Zealand and Australia, through the Indian Ocean, stopping off at Cape

00:10:05.874 --> 00:10:11.834
Town, back to Brazil before stopping off at Tenerife and then returning to Britain.

00:10:13.244 --> 00:10:19.434
Darwin’s role on the trip was purely as a botanist, as a researcher of the natural world.

00:10:20.664 --> 00:10:26.404
Although he suffered terribly from seasickness, he actually spent most of his time

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:32.664
on land, collecting samples of interesting animals and plants, and documenting them.

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:38.644
Naturally, it was quite the trip, it was a fantastic experience, and he

00:10:38.664 --> 00:10:43.054
encountered thousands of creatures that he had never seen back in Britain.

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:49.054
Although he was amazed and astounded by his discoveries at almost

00:10:49.134 --> 00:10:54.254
every stage of his trip, nowhere was this more true than the five

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:59.154
weeks he spent in the Galapagos Islands, just off the coast of Ecuador.

00:11:00.184 --> 00:11:04.014
This was in September and October of 1835.

00:11:05.384 --> 00:11:11.134
Now, the Galapagos Islands were particularly fascinating to Darwin for several reasons.

00:11:12.514 --> 00:11:17.454
To start with, they are volcanic, and had been formed by volcanic

00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:22.364
eruptions relatively recently, only about 3 million years ago.

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:28.184
So there was no life on them before that, they emerged from nothing.

00:11:29.484 --> 00:11:34.804
Darwin noticed different varieties of similar animals on the different

00:11:35.104 --> 00:11:39.774
Galapagos Islands, leading him to believe that they might have evolved

00:11:39.784 --> 00:11:43.754
to best adapt to the different environments that they lived in.

00:11:44.544 --> 00:11:49.004
But this belief still didn’t completely negate creationism, it

00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:53.164
didn’t disprove the idea that a God designed every creature.

00:11:54.044 --> 00:11:59.614
Indeed, Darwin didn’t have some great eureka moment in the Galapagos Islands

00:11:59.774 --> 00:12:04.724
when he saw a giant tortoise and thought, I’ve finally cracked it, that

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.854
tortoise is like that because of natural selection, it wasn't like that at all.

00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:17.024
When he got back to Britain, 5 years after he had set off, he continued to work on his ideas

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:24.374
about evolution, and about how the animals he had encountered had evolved in their separate ways.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:30.864
But it wasn’t until 1837, a year after returning, that there is the

00:12:30.864 --> 00:12:35.554
first evidence that he had a theory about what caused evolution.

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:41.374
He had been keeping detailed notebooks, but they were secret, shown to nobody.

00:12:42.724 --> 00:12:49.744
On a page of this notebook we see the words ‘I think’, and then a drawing of a tree.

00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:57.894
Darwin had been developing the idea of the tree of life, that animals branch off

00:12:58.034 --> 00:13:03.484
from one another, forming new species that are better suited to their environments.

00:13:04.664 --> 00:13:08.674
He also now had a theory about why this was.

00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:14.814
There was a famous essay published in September 1838 by the

00:13:14.814 --> 00:13:19.284
economist Thomas Malthus called The Principle of Population.

00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:26.744
Malthus proposed that the world’s population was growing too fast, that there wasn’t going

00:13:26.744 --> 00:13:32.984
to be enough food to feed everyone, and that there was going to be a struggle for resources.

00:13:34.074 --> 00:13:37.334
The world was going to run out of space to produce food,

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:41.034
and this would be what would stop population growth.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:45.514
With not enough food to go around, people would die, and

00:13:45.564 --> 00:13:49.264
only the best adapted for the situation would survive.

00:13:50.654 --> 00:13:53.134
Suddenly it clicked for Darwin.

00:13:54.244 --> 00:13:57.964
What if similar laws applied in the natural world?

00:13:58.924 --> 00:14:02.804
Animals that were best adapted to their situations

00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:07.214
would flourish, and those that weren’t would die out.

00:14:08.824 --> 00:14:14.724
This would lead to the best adapted for survival passing their genes down

00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:20.694
as they reproduced, and those that were not suited for survival dying out,

00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:26.514
and it was this that caused different species to evolve in different ways.

00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:30.024
This was the idea of natural selection.

00:14:31.434 --> 00:14:35.984
Now, to you or me, this might just seem sensible, logical

00:14:35.994 --> 00:14:40.384
and rational, but at the time it was a revolutionary idea.

00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:45.334
It was going against God, it wasn’t compatible with Creationism,

00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:50.954
and Darwin knew that publishing would lead to a huge backlash.

00:14:51.854 --> 00:14:57.094
So he didn’t publish it, or at least he waited 20 years to do so.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:05.824
In the 20 years between Darwin having this breakthrough moment and when On The Origin of Species

00:15:05.824 --> 00:15:12.724
was published, Darwin lived the life of a biologist, studying and cataloguing the natural world,

00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:20.044
while working on his heretical, revolutionary ideas about evolution and natural selection in secret.

00:15:20.964 --> 00:15:27.564
Already in 1842 he drafted an initial version of the book, but he didn’t publish it.

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:31.924
Instead, he wrote a letter to his wife saying that

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:35.597
if he died, she should pay an editor to publish it.

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:40.777
It’s as if he knew the importance of his discovery, but

00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:44.727
was too afraid of what would happen if he published it.

00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:51.357
He even wrote to a friend that believing in evolution, believing that species

00:15:51.357 --> 00:15:57.227
were not immutable, not unchangeable, was “like confessing to a murder.”

00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:05.647
Although he believed it, and had a working hypothesis about how natural selection and evolution

00:16:05.647 --> 00:16:12.817
worked, he wanted to be as sure as he possibly could be, and he continued his research in secret.

00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:21.027
Then, in June 1858, 20 years after having returned from his trip, he received

00:16:21.057 --> 00:16:26.367
a letter from a man called Alfred Russel Wallace, another British naturalist.

00:16:27.427 --> 00:16:31.357
Russel Wallace had been developing similar ideas to Darwin,

00:16:31.807 --> 00:16:35.717
and he sought Darwin’s advice on how to publish them.

00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:40.517
This was a subject that Darwin had been thinking about for almost

00:16:40.547 --> 00:16:44.789
all of his life, and to which he had dedicated himself for the past

00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:49.217
20 years, so he didn’t want Russel Wallace to take all the credit.

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:54.347
Darwin came clean, he explained everything he had been doing,

00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:58.917
and proposed to Russel Wallace to present their ideas together.

00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:06.407
Russel Wallace agreed, and extracts of their work were to be read at a meeting of the

00:17:06.407 --> 00:17:12.837
Linnean Society, the oldest biological society in the world, on the 1st of June 1858.

00:17:14.407 --> 00:17:18.247
Darwin wasn’t able to make it, unfortunately, he was sick, and

00:17:18.247 --> 00:17:22.697
was grieving for the loss of a son, who had died of scarlet fever.

00:17:23.797 --> 00:17:28.587
After the meeting, Darwin rushed to put all of his ideas together in an

00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:34.297
accessible book, and On the Origin of Species was published on the 24th of

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:42.067
November 1859, less than 6 months after the ideas were first aired to the world.

00:17:43.237 --> 00:17:45.137
These ideas were revolutionary.

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:52.457
But Darwin didn’t really see himself as a revolutionary, and instead of being the public face

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:59.747
of the theory he let his friend, Thomas Henry Huxley, a young biologist, defend them publicly.

00:18:01.107 --> 00:18:05.127
Darwin retreated further and further out of the public

00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:09.887
eye, and eventually died 20 years later, aged 73.

00:18:11.477 --> 00:18:18.157
Now, we hardly have to say quite how important Darwin, and On the Origin of Species are.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:22.447
His theory of natural selection completely changed

00:18:22.457 --> 00:18:25.437
the way in which people understood the natural world.

00:18:26.437 --> 00:18:32.557
Although he didn’t specify this in the book, the takeaway for many was that humans

00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:38.907
descended from apes, that they weren’t created by a divine being, which is evidently

00:18:39.007 --> 00:18:44.437
problematic for world religions that specify that this was how humans were created.

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:50.027
And of course, not everyone believes in Darwin's theory of evolution.

00:18:50.846 --> 00:18:56.396
To be precise, 37% of Americans don’t, but it is the basis

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:59.796
of most scientific theories about how creatures evolve.

00:19:00.976 --> 00:19:05.946
There have been a few updates, a few new discoveries, mainly that there

00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:11.496
is now a theory that evolution doesn’t always happen gradually, as Darwin

00:19:11.496 --> 00:19:17.066
thought, it can happen by genes jumping from one species to the next, but

00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:23.686
this is just a development to Darwin’s theory, it doesn’t disprove it at all.

00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:30.866
When that discovery was published, in 2009, there was a very misleading headline in the New

00:19:30.906 --> 00:19:38.726
Scientist Magazine of “Darwin Was Wrong”, which excited a lot of creationists, but when they

00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:45.436
read the article it was clear that he wasn’t really wrong, he just wasn’t 100 percent correct.

00:19:46.666 --> 00:19:51.836
One thing that continued to puzzle Darwin, and of course continues

00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:56.876
to puzzle us today, was where life actually first came from.

00:19:57.796 --> 00:20:03.386
If you believe that we all evolved from something, what thing was that?

00:20:04.226 --> 00:20:10.406
This is now referred to as LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor, which

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:15.966
lived over three and a half billion years ago, soon after the Earth was formed.

00:20:17.186 --> 00:20:23.226
Interestingly, Darwin’s theory about what this could have been is remarkably similar

00:20:23.516 --> 00:20:29.536
to the current theory, that the first life came from some form of body of water.

00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:37.606
Darwin thought it was probably a warm little pond with lots of salts, ammonia and so on.

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:45.615
Nowadays it’s thought to be much more likely to come from the oceans, from when various different

00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:52.184
compounds dissolved in the water, the ocean thickened and created what’s called ‘primordial

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:58.634
soup’, and it was here that the first life was formed, from which we are all descended.

00:20:59.534 --> 00:21:04.834
But that is a mystery that most definitely still remains unsolved.

00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:11.614
OK then, that is it for the life of Charles Darwin, rightly

00:21:11.614 --> 00:21:15.814
named one of the most influential figures in human history.

00:21:16.594 --> 00:21:20.044

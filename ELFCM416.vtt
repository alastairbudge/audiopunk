Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.925
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:19.805
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:24.885
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three, our final part, of

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:29.329
our mini-series on the quest to find the origin of the river Nile.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:36.369
As a reminder, in part one we learned first about why finding the source of the Nile was of such

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:42.669
interest, and secondly about the amazing story of Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.559
In part two,  we learned about the attempt by Dr David Livingstone to locate

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:53.309
the source of the Nile, how he was lost to the outside world for many years,

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.599
and the interesting way in which he was greeted when he was finally found.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.802
And in today’s episode, the final episode, we will conclude our story

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:07.432
with the tale of the Welsh-American explorer, Henry Morton Stanley.

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:12.166
OK then, the voyage of Henry Morton Stanley.

00:01:13.736 --> 00:01:19.874
As a quick recap of the story, in 1858 Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:25.066
Speke had had an almighty disagreement over the true source of the Nile.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:33.066
After travelling inland from Zanzibar in search of a great lake that could be the mysterious source

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:40.306
of this great river, the pair had found two lakes, but disagreed on which one led to the Nile.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:49.036
Richard Burton maintained that it was Lake Tanganyika, John Hanning Speke that it was Lake Victoria.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:57.626
The disagreement ended with the ultimately death of Speke, and Burton’s claim that Speke had shot

00:01:57.636 --> 00:02:03.496
himself in order to save himself from the embarrassment of having to admit that he was wrong.

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:10.246
And 8 years later, a Scottish doctor and missionary by the name of

00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:14.706
David Livingstone had set out to try to find the answer for himself.

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:22.236
But, he had got lost on the way, or rather, he disappeared for several years and

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:27.166
was famously found by a Welsh-American explorer by the name of Henry Morton Stanley,

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:33.816
and was greeted, reportedly, with the immortal line, “Dr Livingstone, I presume?”

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:42.786
Dr Livingstone died in 1873, having left behind some important discoveries about the geography

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:49.656
of southern Africa, but nobody had definitive proof about what the source really was.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:54.416
Stanley had gone back to the United States, and found

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:57.226
the fame and glory that he had always hoped for.

00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:04.326
As a reminder, Stanley had been abandoned by his mother, thrown into a workhouse

00:03:04.432 --> 00:03:09.582
at the age of 5, and had escaped to the United States at the age of 18.

00:03:10.772 --> 00:03:12.172
He was a nobody.

00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:18.596
Or rather, he had been a nobody until he published his account of finding Dr Livingstone,

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:24.952
aptly titled “How I Found Livingstone; travels, adventures, and discoveries in Central Africa”.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:31.301
This unlikely success, against all the odds, gave him the credibility

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:36.671
to persuade his backers to support him financially on another mission.

00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:45.651
In 1874, backed by the New York Herald and The Daily Telegraph, he set out on another expedition.

00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:50.761
Its objective was to complete the exploration of the Great Lakes of

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:56.181
Africa and to, once and for all, find the source of the river Nile.

00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:02.831
This mission was equal, if not greater, to both of the previous ones.

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:09.991
Like the previous ones, the expedition started in Zanzibar, on the east coast, but

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:16.401
this one would be much longer; it would involve travelling over 11,000 kilometres.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:24.271
And let’s remember, the land part of this would have been done on foot, because

00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:28.541
cows and horses would've been killed by the disease-carrying Tsetse fly.

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:33.491
So they would have walked, and porters would have had to carry everything.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:43.211
Stanley recruited a troop of a reported 224 porters and servants, and they headed west.

00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:48.611
The first task was to accurately circumnavigate the great

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.721
lakes, to go all the way around them and map any rivers.

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:55.481
And that’s exactly what they did.

00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:02.151
Stanley went all the way around Lake Victoria and Lake Albert, before getting to Lake Tanganyika.

00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:07.911
Stanley observed that Lake Victoria had one large outflow,

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:11.231
the river that Speke had observed several years before.

00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:18.571
This was most probably the source of the Nile, he thought, but there was still one more possibility.

00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:23.061
He had learned from the man he had rescued, Dr.

00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:30.711
Livingstone, that Lake Tanganyika also had a large river that flowed north, out from its west side.

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:36.181
Livingstone had tried to follow its path, but hadn’t

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:38.590
been able to make the progress he had hoped for.

00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:44.841
Stanley realised that if he was going to solve the mystery of the origin

00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:50.081
of the river Nile, the answer lay in this river, the Lualaba River.

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:53.391
It looked like it could lead to the Nile.

00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:58.571
When it leaves the west side of Lake Tanganyika, it goes west for a little

00:05:58.571 --> 00:06:04.001
bit and then heads north, over 1,200 kilometres north to be precise.

00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:09.301
It looked like, with a bit of a bend to the right, it

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:12.831
was heading straight for Egypt, that it was the Nile.

00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:17.921
Stanley needed to follow the river and see where it ended up.

00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:23.421
He would be heading into virgin territory, from the European perspective

00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:27.961
at least; no other European explorer had gone all the way down the river.

00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:33.981
Even the Arab slave traders had reportedly been put off by stories of

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:39.891
man-eating cannibals, so where the river led was a mystery to outsiders.

00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.501
And this was far from the only issue.

00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:50.651
When you go down a river the current might be on your side, but this comes with its own problems.

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:58.291
Specifically, waterfalls and white water rapids, which are impossible to go down safely on a boat.

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:04.821
Every time the expedition came across these obstacles, they would have to quickly steer to the river

00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:11.421
bank before it was too late, take the boats out of the water and attempt to find a safe way around.

00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:16.401
In many cases, they didn’t, and members of the party

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:19.911
were swept away with the rushing water and drowned.

00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:25.861
And those who didn’t died in the river, died from sunstroke,

00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:29.641
malaria, and a miscellany of other gruesome illnesses.

00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:37.363
In total, of the 228 initial members of the party, only 111 survived.

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:39.833
more than half died on the journey.

00:07:41.153 --> 00:07:45.423
Indeed, Henry Morton Stanley was the only surviving European.

00:07:46.953 --> 00:07:52.253
Despite the hardship and huge loss of human life, the plan worked.

00:07:53.513 --> 00:08:00.713
After going more than 1,000 kilometres to the north, the Lualaba river snaked westwards, eventually

00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:07.463
merging into the Congo river, which flows out into the Atlantic Ocean, nowhere near the Nile

00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:15.023
Stanley had his answer, and now it was clear that John Speke had been right.

00:08:15.723 --> 00:08:18.453
All other possibilities had been eliminated.

00:08:18.923 --> 00:08:24.723
The origin of the river Nile was indeed Lake Victoria, as Speke had correctly identified.

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:31.703
At last, Stanley had managed to solve the puzzle that had stumped explorers for centuries.

00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:36.513
He discovered that the source of the White Nile was not Lake Tanganyika

00:08:36.923 --> 00:08:41.153
as Burton had claimed, nor was it a separate, undiscovered lake.

00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:43.803
Instead, it was Lake Victoria.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:48.401
Now, we must finish this episode with three things.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:56.410
First a little bit of an addendum, a final chapter, of the story of Henry Morton Stanley, as any

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.980
glory he gained through the discovery of the Nile would be tarnished with what happened next.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:09.900
He would go on to be hired by King Leopold II as the Belgian king’s agent in Congo.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.877
Now you may know about the atrocities of King Leopold II

00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:18.730
already or you might remember them from episode number 289.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.720
To clarify, there is no evidence that Stanley knew what the bloodthirsty Belgian

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.600
king had in mind, and as soon as he discovered his employer’s cruel plans

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.500
for the Congo, he protested and condemned the plans before leaving his post.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.600
But still, his name has forever been tarnished by his involvement in King Leopold

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.730
II’s atrocities, and his achievements in terms of the discovery of the Nile

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.180
can’t really be mentioned without some acknowledgement of what came afterwards.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.570
Now, as a penultimate point to finish off the episode, and this

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.660
mini-series, I want to leave you with some reflections on the different

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.050
characters who tried to solve the question of the origin of the Nile.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.870
They might all have been British men of the Victorian Era, and it's easy to put them all

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:20.370
into the same bucket, perhaps even painting them as heartless colonial imperial invaders.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.770
On one level, yes they were.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.620
These were all men who travelled from a small cold island in northern

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.990
Europe to supposedly “discover” a continent and claim it as their own.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.820
But the truth is that painting them all with the same brush is to greatly

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.950
simplify things, as these men were very, very different characters.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:50.990
From part one we had Sir Richard Burton, in some respects a classic Victorian explorer.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.080
Fluent in over 20 languages, charismatic, highly cultured and

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.450
genuinely interested in the people and cultures that he met.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.140
But he never quite fitted in back in Britain, he would be accused of being

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.820
a colonial racist, and he was very jealous of Stanley’s discovery, and

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.440
ultimate proof that he had been wrong all along about Lake Tanganyika.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:21.240
And we also had Burton’s nemesis, John Hanning Speke, a man who was probably

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.150
a more accomplished explorer, but whose motivations were more selfish.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:33.390
What’s more, he too couldn’t take criticism and ended up dying in mysterious circumstances.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.370
Both Burton and Speke, by the way, were wealthy, upper class Englishmen.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.710
Then in part two we had Dr David Livingstone, a Scotsman, not an Englishman.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.420
He was very different from the previous two, as he had not been born to a

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:56.490
wealthy family, he worked his way “up”, and his entire reason for setting foot in

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:02.280
Africa and then dedicating his life to the continent was a moral one, to spread

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.950
Christianity and then to do everything he could to stop the Arab slave trade.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.480
He was far from the caricature of an imperial Victorian explorer.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.410
And in part three, or in fact also making a very important appearance in

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.130
part two, we had the subject of today’s episode, Henry Morton Stanley.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.360
Again, he was not English, he was Welsh by birth, and

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.090
would only go on to become an American citizen in his 40s.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.310
And he wasn’t really even an explorer; he was a journalist

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.440
initially, and his first mission was primarily a journalistic one.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.930
And he came from the most lowly background possible; a life as

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.410
a workhouse boy, right on the bottom rung of Victorian society.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.550
And in terms of his motivation, it was two-fold.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.140
First, in his mission to find Livingstone, it was fame and fortune,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.020
it was a way of putting his childhood poverty behind him, of achieving

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.660
the unthinkable, locating the world’s most famous disappeared explorer.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:18.250
And afterwards, why did he go back on this hugely dangerous mission, why

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.140
did he return to Africa to continue the search for the source of the Nile?

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.300
Well, it was principally to continue the work of the man he

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.829
had come to consider as a father figure, Dr David Livingstone.

00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:35.560
Livingstone had made it his life’s work to find the source

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.890
of the Nile, but had died before it could be completed.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.850
Stanley felt that he had a duty to complete this mission, even

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.620
if the probability of dying in the process was incredibly high.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.170
But, he did it.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.450
And the irony is that, even though he was the least of an “explorer”, at

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.310
least by training, he was by far the most accomplished explorer of them all.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.620
He circumnavigated Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, he went all the way down the

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:14.050
river Lualaba, and ultimately it was this young Welshman who had been abandoned by

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.220
his parents, it was he who managed to answer a question that has preoccupied people

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.730
literally for thousands of years, the question of the true source of the river Nile.

00:14:25.534 --> 00:14:30.840
But, in one final plot twist, if you remember back to part one of this

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.390
mini-series, Ptolemy had written that the true source of the Nile was the

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.570
“mountains of the moon”, a long belt of mountains that stretched all the way

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:46.280
across Africa, and were indeed thought to exist even until the early 19th century.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.970
According to some geographers, the ultimate source of the Nile is

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.940
not Lake Victoria, as Speke had claimed and as Stanley had “proved”.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.780
Instead, it’s a mountain range called the Rwenzori

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.130
mountains, which are just to the west of Lake Victoria.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.430
These snow capped mountains have a variety of different glaciers, whose

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.530
melting ice leads to a collection of small rivers, some of which lead to

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.180
Lake Victoria, which leads to, well, you’ve guessed it, the river Nile.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:26.620
So, the Rwenzori mountains are, in all probability, the mountains of the moon.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:33.683
In this twist of fate, and after all the expeditions we’ve learned about, from Burton

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:40.890
and Speke to Livingstone to Stanley, perhaps old 1st century Ptolemy was right all along.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:48.400
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Quest To Find The Origin of The River Nile.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.830
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.566
As always, I would love to know what you thought about

00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:57.443
this episode and of this mini-series more generally.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.430
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.800
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.410
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something called The Cobra Effect.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.820
It’s what happens when good intentions lead to unexpected, negative consequences.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:43.938
It’s a story of human psychology, of people outwitting, outsmarting, governments

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:51.058
and policymakers, a story of human ingenuity, and provides a lesson to us all of

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:56.428
what happens when we don’t think through the possible consequences of our actions.

00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:05.156
In today’s episode we’ll come across snakes, rats, cars, heroin, railways and rubbish.

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:09.856
We’ll travel from Britain to India, Vietnam to the United States,

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:14.876
but there will be one unifying factor throughout: human beings.

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:22.009
From Bogota to Bangkok, Kabul to Calcutta, people are people, and as we’ll

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.839
soon find out, people are excellent at finding opportunities when they arise.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.569
So, let’s get right into it.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.989
In life, there are broadly two ways of getting anyone to do what you want.

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:42.099
Whether we are talking about persuading a 2-year-old child to brush his

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:48.029
teeth or getting the population of an entire country to pay their taxes, you

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:53.139
can either incentivise them to do it, or punish them if they don’t do it.

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:59.519
You might give your 2-year-old child a star for brushing his teeth or tell

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:04.009
him he isn’t allowed to play with his toys if he doesn’t brush his teeth.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:11.399
In our national “paying your taxes” scenario, a country might remind citizens of their

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:18.669
civic duty to pay their taxes, or offer some reward for paying them on time, or it

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:24.499
might send its citizens to jail, or fine them money, if they don’t pay their taxes.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.589
Of course, this is a gross simplification, but as someone trying to get someone else

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:37.929
to do something, you have two broad categories of options: the carrot, and the stick.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.539
And so it was in British India, in Delhi to be precise,

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.509
that the British were presented with a problem.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.049
In a story recalled by the German economist Horst Siebert, the British government was concerned

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:01.679
with the amount of cobras, poisonous deadly snakes, slithering around the streets of Delhi.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.509
You couldn’t exactly ask the snakes politely to leave, or punish them for being in the city.

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:13.809
The government could have surely hired people to go around either killing the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.629
snakes or pushing them away from the city, but it tried to do something different.

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:26.759
It thought, well, if we offer a reward to local people for killing cobras, people will

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:33.061
have a reason to kill them, the population will reduce, and our problem will be solved.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:40.055
So, it was widely published that the British would pay for any skin of a cobra.

00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:43.275
Initially it was a great success.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:49.607
People started hunting cobras, killing them and bringing in their skins for a reward.

00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:57.937
The cobra population started to go down, but then there was a constant and indeed

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:04.447
ever-increasing number of cobra skins appearing at government offices, and there didn’t seem

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:11.457
to be any real decrease, any real reduction, in the number of cobras roaming the streets.

00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:16.337
How was it possible that there were so many dead cobras being

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:21.367
brought to government offices, yet so many still roaming the streets?

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:26.507
Well, it turns out that some enterprising people had seen

00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:30.247
that this new law presented a money-making opportunity.

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:36.167
They had started cobra farms, they had started breeding cobras for

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:40.737
the specific purpose of being killed and collecting the rewards.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:47.812
The cobra population swelled as people realised there was a quick buck, some quick

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:54.992
money, to be made, and cobra farms started to pop up throughout the city and nearby area.

00:04:56.022 --> 00:04:59.612
When the British government cottoned on to this, when they

00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:04.522
realised what was going on, the reward for cobra skins was stopped.

00:05:05.302 --> 00:05:06.722
So what happened?

00:05:07.082 --> 00:05:11.112
Well, this was pretty bad news if you were a cobra farmer.

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:15.882
There was only really one potential customer for cobras, the

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:20.162
government, and if it stopped paying you you were in real trouble.

00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:27.732
According to Horst Siebert, the German economist who recalled the story, the cobra farmers

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:34.522
simply released their cobras into the wild, back into the city, and the government had

00:05:34.522 --> 00:05:40.482
an even bigger problem on its hands than before it had tried to “solve” the problem.

00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:46.592
This incident gave the name to the Cobra Effect, when a

00:05:46.592 --> 00:05:52.652
well-intentioned law or regulation has unintended negative consequences.

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:58.902
It just so happens that some of the most famous examples of this are to do

00:05:58.902 --> 00:06:04.852
with animals, and specifically encouraging the reduction of animal populations.

00:06:06.342 --> 00:06:12.352
In 1902, in Vietnam, when it was under French rule, the French government

00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:16.014
was concerned with the amount of rats running through the city.

00:06:17.264 --> 00:06:18.804
So what did it do?

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:23.982
Like the British, it offered a cash reward, but not for the

00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:29.062
skins of the rats, or the dead bodies, just for the tails.

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:35.242
The government was flooded with rat tails, and it no doubt thought itself very

00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:41.212
clever for creating this incentive for the local population to solve the problem.

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:46.386
But before long government officials started to notice

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:49.906
that there were rats running around without tails.

00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:54.806
What had been happening was that the enterprising local population

00:06:55.126 --> 00:07:00.236
would cut off the tails of the rats, but then let them go, still alive.

00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:07.766
The tail wouldn’t grow back, but the rats would be able to breed, to have children,

00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:13.486
meaning there would be more baby rats with tails to cut off and money to be made.

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:20.046
And of course, there were plenty of enterprising people who also set up rat farms.

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:27.986
And as you might imagine, the number of rats in the city swelled, it increased dramatically.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:35.036
This was over 100 years ago, and you might have thought that people would have learned by now.

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:37.496
It turns out that we haven’t.

00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:45.646
In 2007, in an army base in Georgia, in the United States, there was a problem with wild pigs.

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:51.556
There were thousands of these pigs that roamed the army base and nearby area,

00:07:51.796 --> 00:07:58.256
breeding rapidly, destroying local crops, and generally being a nuisance to farmers.

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:05.006
In order to incentivise hunters and local people to kill these

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:11.646
pigs, the US army stated it would pay up to $40 per pig killed.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:17.346
The army didn’t need the entire pig to be brought in as evidence, that

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:22.596
would be complicated, having to deal with thousands of bodies of dead pigs.

00:08:23.496 --> 00:08:30.766
So, like French back in Vietnam over 100 years ago, to collect the reward you

00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:37.194
just needed the tail, complete with a form stating where the pig had been killed.

00:08:38.564 --> 00:08:40.754
You might be able to guess what happened.

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:45.914
It seemed to be an initial success, and thousands of pig tails

00:08:45.914 --> 00:08:50.034
were brought in, and tens of thousands of dollars were paid out.

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:55.654
But people were bringing in so many pig tails, saying that

00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:59.684
they had killed so many pigs, that it seemed hard to believe.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.540
There weren’t pigs wandering around with no tails, so, if these

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.200
tails hadn't come from the wild pigs, where had they come from?

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.010
After the army started calling around local meat

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.630
processing plants, they discovered something surprising.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:26.240
They asked the owners of these meat processing plants whether they had ever sold pig tails before.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.660
No, not really, came the response.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.120
You can’t do anything with a pig tail, they were simply thrown away.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:42.910
But ever since the army started offering $40 per tail, meat processing plants had started

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:49.480
receiving calls from local people offering to buy as many tails as they could get their hands on.

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:56.261
Indeed, it was common knowledge that the “market value” of a pig tail was now

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:04.770
not $0, it was $40, and a mini black market started to emerge for pig tails.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:11.180
Pigs became more valuable, creating an even greater incentive to increase production.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.410
And the Cobra Effect isn’t just for snakes, rats or pigs.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:24.360
We will talk a bit  more about this in the next episode, on where our rubbish goes, but

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:32.670
in 1997 the UK introduced something called the “Packaging Recovery Note”, PRN for short.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.730
A PRN is given to a recycling company by the UK government

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.230
for every one tonne of recycling that is recycled.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:51.330
If a recycling company recycles 100 tonnes of recycled goods, it gets 100 PRNs.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.085
These PRNs can then be sold to the companies that produce goods that use materials like

00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:06.095
plastic, who are obliged to buy PRNs to offset the materials that go into their products.

00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:09.995
This is what’s called the “Polluter Pays” principle.

00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:13.245
At first glance, this is good, right?

00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:17.485
We should encourage people to recycle, and a government

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:21.005
should provide financial incentives to recycle.

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:25.805
But it turns out that this system might actually be reducing

00:11:25.975 --> 00:11:29.795
the amount of waste that is recycled, not increasing it.

00:11:30.615 --> 00:11:33.995
See, for one of these “Packaging Recovery Notes” to be

00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:37.765
issued, a company must show it has done the recycling.

00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:45.795
If it’s in the UK, the recycling is weighed after it’s processed and the PRN is issued.

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:51.125
If the recycling is exported, sent abroad to be processed,

00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:56.105
it is weighed before it’s exported and the PRN is issued.

00:11:56.885 --> 00:11:59.115
And herein lies the problem.

00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:08.865
With the example of plastic, only about 50% of plastic recycling is actually able to be recycled,

00:12:08.965 --> 00:12:17.065
so one tonne of mixed plastic recycling results in about half a tonne of recycled plastic.

00:12:18.045 --> 00:12:24.775
So if it is processed in the UK, 1 tonne of mixed plastic recycling leads to

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:31.895
half a Packaging Recovery Note, but if it is exported, because the entire batch

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:37.459
is weighed before it is separated, the company gets paid for the whole volume.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.429
And there are very little checks on whether the

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:45.679
material is ever actually recycled after it is exported.

00:12:46.589 --> 00:12:52.519
There was a documentary from 2018 that revealed that there were huge amounts of

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:59.523
UK “recycling” just sitting in fields in places like Turkey, Poland and Malaysia.

00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:07.003
The entire incentive system that was created to encourage people to recycle resulted

00:13:07.193 --> 00:13:14.253
in a reduction in recycling happening in the UK, no incentives for the UK to invest in

00:13:14.253 --> 00:13:20.563
recycling facilities, an incentive for dishonest recycling companies to add waste to

00:13:20.563 --> 00:13:26.033
their “recycling” that isn’t actually recycling, and ultimately for waste that might

00:13:26.093 --> 00:13:31.723
otherwise have been recycled to be sitting in a field or dump in a foreign country.

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:37.953
It might be criminal, but it wouldn’t be the first time that people have been

00:13:37.953 --> 00:13:43.437
pushed into illegal activities because of a law that had positive intentions.

00:13:44.188 --> 00:13:48.507
Afghanistan, as you may know, is one of the world’s biggest

00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:53.287
producers of opium, the main ingredient required to make heroin.

00:13:54.317 --> 00:13:59.607
After the US invasion of the country, the occupying forces tried to

00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:04.737
figure out how to reduce opium production, and what to do with the

00:14:04.737 --> 00:14:09.767
poppy farmers - the poppy is the flower from which opium is harvested.

00:14:10.697 --> 00:14:16.767
It could burn poppy fields when they were discovered, and punish the farmers for growing the crop.

00:14:17.407 --> 00:14:23.497
But Afghanistan is a large, mountainous country, which is very difficult to control.

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:29.587
And no matter how many poppy fields were burned, new ones would pop up.

00:14:30.547 --> 00:14:36.597
Afghanistan was, and of course still is a very poor country, and the money that

00:14:36.597 --> 00:14:42.637
could be made from growing opium offered a rare opportunity to earn a decent income.

00:14:43.697 --> 00:14:48.507
So, the British and US officials started offering opium farmers

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:54.447
money, cash, to burn their poppy fields and switch to other crops.

00:14:55.277 --> 00:15:01.707
Yes, these farmers would make less money if they grew other, legal, crops, but they would be

00:15:01.707 --> 00:15:08.467
paid the difference, and in fact in many cases they would be paid a lot more for burning the

00:15:08.467 --> 00:15:14.417
poppy fields, meaning that there shouldn’t be any financial reason to continue growing opium.

00:15:15.227 --> 00:15:21.287
Sounds good in practice, of course, but what it actually led to was a boom in new

00:15:21.307 --> 00:15:28.327
opium farmers, because people rushed to grow opium in order to get paid to switch.

00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:35.367
Many poppy farmers would even harvest the opium from the poppies before burning the fields,

00:15:35.547 --> 00:15:41.887
thus they were paid twice - once for selling the drug, and another for destroying the crop.

00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:47.755
Today, Afghanistan is the world’s number one producer of opium

00:15:47.885 --> 00:15:53.855
and is responsible for 80% of all of the opium produced worldwide.

00:15:54.945 --> 00:15:59.035
And for our last incentive we are going to go to a country, and

00:15:59.305 --> 00:16:03.387
indeed a continent,  that we haven’t talked about yet in this episode.

00:16:04.267 --> 00:16:08.487
We’re going to South America, and heading to Bogota in Colombia.

00:16:09.497 --> 00:16:15.637
If you have been to Bogota, you will probably have spent quite some time stuck in traffic.

00:16:16.157 --> 00:16:21.147
The city’s traffic is notorious, and with an over-reliance on private

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:26.107
cars and an inefficient public transport system there is a vicious cycle.

00:16:26.815 --> 00:16:31.805
Public transport is bad so people use cars, so there are more cars on

00:16:31.805 --> 00:16:36.545
the road, there’s more pollution, and the situation gets even worse.

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:43.805
In 1998 the local government proposed what it no doubt thought was an innovative solution.

00:16:44.245 --> 00:16:49.965
In fact, it was inspired by a policy from Mexico City 8 years before, but the

00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:54.385
local government thought it would help solve the problem of traffic and pollution.

00:16:55.375 --> 00:17:00.905
Cars with different combinations of letters and numbers would be allowed to drive

00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:06.445
on different days, meaning that drivers wouldn’t be able to use their car every day.

00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:13.555
Good idea, in theory, but what it led to in practice was an increase in

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:18.845
the number of cars per household, as people bought second cars in order to

00:17:18.855 --> 00:17:23.485
be able to drive on the days when their primary car wouldn’t be able to.

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:29.825
To make matters worse, because buying a car is expensive, these

00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:35.685
second cars would often be cheaper, older, and more polluting models.

00:17:36.635 --> 00:17:41.855
So instead of encouraging people to take public transport on the days of the week they

00:17:41.855 --> 00:17:47.685
couldn’t drive, many just switched to more polluting cars, meaning that there were

00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:52.625
just as many cars on the road, and they were pumping out more and more exhaust fumes.

00:17:53.075 --> 00:17:56.715
As a result, pollution increased, not decreased.

00:17:57.725 --> 00:17:59.245
And we could go on.

00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:04.355
The Chinese listeners may remember Chairman Mao’s “4 pests” campaign,

00:18:04.465 --> 00:18:10.095
which encouraged the eradication of “mosquitoes, rodents, flies, and

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:15.135
sparrows”, which he believed were responsible for destroying the crops.

00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:20.635
There were huge incentives to get rid of these pests, and the population,

00:18:20.985 --> 00:18:25.765
especially of sparrows - which are small birds - was decimated.

00:18:26.775 --> 00:18:33.605
But it turns out that these sparrows played a pretty important role in the crop ecosystem.

00:18:33.935 --> 00:18:35.605
They ate insects.

00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:41.628
And without any sparrows to eat the insects there was a huge infestation,

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:46.861
damaging the crops even more than the sparrows, and contributing to a mass

00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:52.861
famine that is thought to have killed anywhere from 15 to 60 million people.

00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:59.675
And if you have ever travelled on a train in the United States and thought - hmm, this

00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:05.584
doesn’t seem to be a particularly direct route, the track seems to be looping from side

00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:10.624
to side, perhaps you were travelling on a piece of track built when the United States

00:19:10.654 --> 00:19:17.764
Congress decided to pay railway builders per distance of track laid, thus encouraging

00:19:17.994 --> 00:19:24.754
dishonest railway construction companies to lay track in loops rather than in a direct line.

00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:31.604
Now, it might be easy for us to say, with the benefit of hindsight, to look back

00:19:31.714 --> 00:19:36.174
at all of these examples and think “surely they could have thought of that before”.

00:19:36.864 --> 00:19:40.214
Or at least, surely they could have learned from other examples.

00:19:40.743 --> 00:19:46.853
But while there might only be a small group of people who devise, who create, such a

00:19:46.863 --> 00:19:52.933
scheme, as soon as it is public there are thousands, millions, perhaps even hundreds

00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:58.013
of millions of people for whom this scheme might present a money-making opportunity.

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:05.523
And, try as you might, for all of the second, third, and fourth-degree thinking, all of

00:20:05.523 --> 00:20:12.793
the brainstorming about how someone might try to abuse the system, or how there might

00:20:12.793 --> 00:20:18.303
be problems that people hadn't thought about, history certainly suggests that, try

00:20:18.303 --> 00:20:23.913
as you might, it’s easy to forget something that might later seem blindingly obvious.

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:31.659
As the author of Freakonomics, Steve Levitt, once said, “When you introduce an incentive scheme,

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:37.589
you have to just admit to yourself that no matter how clever you think you are, there’s a

00:20:37.629 --> 00:20:44.749
pretty good chance that someone far more clever than yourself will figure out a way to beat it.”

00:20:46.949 --> 00:20:51.899
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Cobra Effect.

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:55.829
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:56.708 --> 00:21:00.248
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:00.588 --> 00:21:04.008
No doubt there are examples of the Cobra Effect that you have

00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:08.478
seen in your town, city or country, and I would love to know.

00:21:08.868 --> 00:21:10.578
What were their intentions?

00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:12.108
What actually happened?

00:21:12.658 --> 00:21:15.738
Do you think this was something utterly predictable,

00:21:15.838 --> 00:21:19.308
or did someone find some ingenious way around it?

00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:22.988
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:23.418 --> 00:21:26.518

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:17.358
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:21.978
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:26.498
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:31.208
about Apples, the fourth most popular fruit in the world.

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:37.418
If you’re wondering what numbers 1, 2, and 3 are, tomatoes are technically the world’s

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:42.268
favourite, although I know that some people might consider them to be a vegetable,

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:49.428
then it’s bananas, then watermelons, and then comes the topic of this episode, apples.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:57.208
So, in today’s episode, we are going to start with the history of apples, where they come from,

00:00:57.218 --> 00:01:04.068
how they developed, and why apple production is different to that of the majority of fruits.

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:10.578
Then, we’ll talk about the weird history of an unusual American, a man so

00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:15.718
associated with apples that he was given the nickname “Johnny Appleseed”.

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:21.628
We’ll then talk about apples today, and see how apple cultivation has

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:26.628
changed over the years to satisfy the needs of the global economy.

00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:33.758
And finally, we will look at some fun linguistic marks that apples have left on the

00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:40.658
English language, and I’ll explain how you can use a few phrases that involve apples.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.569
Let’s get stuck in right away.

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:51.069
To many of us now, apples are a fundamental part of our diet, and of our cuisine.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.609
In England, we have baked apples, apple crumble, delicious cloudy English apple juice, and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.889
of course, schoolchildren up and down the country are encouraged to eat apples as a snack.

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.179
And for billions of people around the world, the apple is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.049
a fruit that features prominently in the national cuisine.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.769
But, where does it actually come from?

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.369
And how did it become such a popular fruit?

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.069
To the first question, the answer might surprise you.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.849
The fruit that you and I know as the apple is thought to have

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:35.059
originated from central Asia, probably in modern day Kazakhstan.

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:40.489
Indeed, the largest city in Kazakhstan is called Almaty, the word

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.349
Almaty is closely related to the Kazakh word for apple, “alma”.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.579
And the Russian version of the city’s name is “Alma-Ata”, which is translated as “father of apples”.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.269
Names aside, all apples are thought to have originated from this

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.689
area of the world, from a type of tree called “Malus Sieversii”.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.919
Now, this episode isn’t going to go deep into the biological history of apple trees,

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:19.529
but there are some important points to note about apples that help us understand firstly

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.559
how they have developed and changed over time, and secondly how they are grown now.

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:34.079
So, the first point to understand is that apples are what’s called “extreme heterozygotes”.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.479
What this means, in practical terms, is that you can take the seeds from

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.799
an apple, put them in the ground, and wait until an apple tree grows.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:53.549
But the apples that this tree produces will probably look nothing like the original apple.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.649
It will still be an apple, yes, but it won’t be the same.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.399
It could be a different colour, different taste, different

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.879
size, it could be a completely different type of apple.

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:12.709
This means that, if you find a delicious type of apple, and you think that you would like to

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:19.829
plant a tree that will produce more of those delicious apples, you can’t just plant the seeds.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:27.619
What you need to do is find a piece of the original apple tree and stick it into a different tree.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.719
The word for this process in English is “grafting”.

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:37.829
Now, this is a great simplification of what happens, but the point is that if

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:43.709
you want to consistently produce the same kinds of apples, this is how you do it.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.529
Planting the seeds won’t work.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.519
Now, that is the horticultural part of the episode over.

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:56.429
Let’s get back to how this is relevant to the history of apples.

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:02.619
It’s thought that the original apple tree was domesticated anywhere

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:08.729
between 4 and 10,000 years ago, it is an incredibly old fruit.

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:15.939
Given the fact that it originated from an area in the middle of The Silk Road, apples

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:22.599
started to be transported both ways, towards Europe and across the Gobi Desert to China.

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:28.169
As these apples were transported and their seeds were planted

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.829
elsewhere, entirely new types of apples would have sprung up.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.929
For people who didn’t know about grafting, the process of attaching a piece of apple

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:44.809
tree to another tree, they would plant the seeds and completely new apples would emerge.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:51.649
It’s not completely clear exactly when, or how, societies discovered grafting.

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:58.019
There are some theories that it was known as early as the third century

00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:03.369
BC, based purely on the amount of apples of the same variety that were

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.179
being produced in The Middle East, but historians are not completely sure.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.879
The Romans did an excellent job at taking apples all over Europe,

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.259
and are thought to have been responsible for bringing them to the

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:23.149
UK, where they thrived, and have become almost a national fruit.

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:30.389
The Romans were aware of how to use grafting to reproduce apple varieties,

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:35.239
which led to the first “orchards” in Britain - orchards being the

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.859
collection of trees planted together, all producing the same kind of fruit.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:46.499
When the Romans left Britain, at the end of the 4th century AD, knowledge

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:52.109
of apple cultivation started to die out, but there is evidence of apple

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:57.819
production mainly through old town names given by Anglo-Saxon invaders.

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.779
For example, there is a town in England called Applegarth, which means Apple

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:09.649
Orchard, and “Appleton”, which means “where apples grow”, these settlements were

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:14.709
presumably given these names because of how many apple trees there were there.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:22.289
When the Normans invaded Britain in 1066, they brought with them a love for good

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.589
food, a renewed interest in apples and a knowledge of how to grow them, plus

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:33.669
they were thirsty for cider, the alcoholic drink you make from fermented apples.

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:40.219
All of this, combined with the fact that apples grow very easily in Britain,

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:45.309
meant that apple trees again became a feature of the English landscape.

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:52.679
And by The Middle Ages, across much of Europe, apples were a permanent part of

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:57.579
the national cuisine, for similar reasons that they are still popular today.

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:05.139
They are tasty, they grow relatively easily in much of Europe, they are quite cheap, you

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:11.359
can transport them easily, they don’t go bad quickly - I mean, you can store them for

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:17.419
a long time after picking them from a tree - there are a lot of advantages to apples.

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:23.639
It was, therefore, no surprise that when European settlers sailed

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:28.709
to America, they took this delicious and versatile fruit with them.

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:36.159
The first orchard was planted in America in 1625, and reportedly,

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:44.249
by 1644, 90% of all farms in Maryland contained apple orchards.

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:51.529
The settlers found an abundance of land in America, and built vast orchards.

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:57.819
They knew about grafting, but they would also experiment with new apple

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:03.169
varieties, testing out how planting different seeds in different types of

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:08.739
soil would lead to new, and potentially even more delicious, types of apple.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:15.979
Planting a new orchard from apple seeds must have felt a little like playing the lottery,

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:21.979
but a lottery that would take years for you to figure out whether you had won or not.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:29.239
You would plant the seeds, then wait typically six years or more before the tree even started

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:36.049
producing fruit, and only then would you be able to taste it and see whether it was any good.

00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:43.699
Now, although apple growing was popular almost from the day the pilgrims first set foot on

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:50.279
the continent, there is one man who has forever gone down in history for his association

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:57.829
with apple growing in America, a man called John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:03.359
Johnny Appleseed was born in 1774, in Massachusetts.

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:07.809
This was at the time of the American frontier, when

00:10:07.969 --> 00:10:12.229
people were heading west to seek out new land and fortune.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:17.629
There were economic incentives for people to move west and settle.

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:22.799
One of these was that anyone would receive approximately 40

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:27.559
hectares of land if they planted an orchard of a certain size.

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:32.459
Johnny Appleseed had some training in apple farming,

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:36.259
and he headed out west with his 12-year-old brother.

00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:42.419
So the legend goes, everywhere he went, he planted orchards.

00:10:43.189 --> 00:10:48.629
He wasn’t doing this for economic reasons, and he lived a very simple life.

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:54.589
He wore simple clothes, was very generous with everyone he met, and

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:58.799
he was a vegetarian, which would have been very rare at the time.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:05.839
He followed a particular form of Christianity which focussed on love for the natural

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:12.279
world, which probably explains his wanting to go forth and plant trees everywhere.

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:19.059
Importantly for our story, and for the development of apples in the United States,

00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:25.919
he did not use the technique of grafting, as he believed that it hurt the trees.

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:32.509
Grafting involves cutting off a branch of an apple tree, and Johnny Appleseed

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:37.292
didn’t want to do this, because he didn’t want to cut and hurt a tree.

00:11:37.812 --> 00:11:42.952
He planted his orchards directly from apple seeds, which, remember,

00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:48.082
means you have no control over the type of apple trees that would grow.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:54.422
What Appleseed would do is plant an orchard, then leave it for someone

00:11:54.432 --> 00:11:59.292
else to manage and farm, then move further west and plant another one.

00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:05.672
He did this for over 50 years, and left a huge variety

00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:09.302
of different apples in all of the orchards he planted.

00:12:09.982 --> 00:12:16.332
Because he didn’t use grafting, all of these apples would have had slightly different tastes.

00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:23.862
Given that the main use of his apples would have been to make cider, which was hugely popular

00:12:23.982 --> 00:12:29.572
in America at the time, it didn’t really matter that much that they tasted so different.

00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:37.102
His legacy though, other than being an example told to schoolchildren of how to be a

00:12:37.102 --> 00:12:44.092
good, honest, kind and generous person, is of creating an enormous variety of apples.

00:12:44.712 --> 00:12:53.082
Indeed, even now there are 2,500 different varieties of apple grown in the United States.

00:12:54.182 --> 00:12:59.472
Now, this brings us to apples today, and how they have conquered the world,

00:12:59.732 --> 00:13:04.482
or at least feature in the national cuisines of a large number of countries.

00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:11.582
Partly thanks to Johnny Appleseed, and mainly thanks to the vast size and natural

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:16.842
geography of the country, apple production in the United States continued to grow.

00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:25.152
It had a slight hiccup, it dipped slightly, during the Prohibition era, when alcohol was banned,

00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:31.572
and apple trees were cut down and orchards burned, so that they couldn't be used to make cider.

00:13:32.522 --> 00:13:36.922
Since then though, apple production has continued to increase, and

00:13:37.102 --> 00:13:42.522
the US is the world’s second largest apple producer, behind China.

00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:48.382
The US produces around 5 million tonnes of apples per year.

00:13:48.822 --> 00:13:53.082
China actually produces more than 8 times the US

00:13:53.102 --> 00:13:57.162
production, at 42 million tonnes of apples per year.

00:13:57.602 --> 00:14:04.202
Indeed, almost half of the apples produced in the entire world are grown in China.

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:10.682
For those of you living in Europe though, if you’re thinking that you haven’t eaten a Chinese

00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:17.562
apple, most of the apples grown in China are either eaten in China, or exported to South East Asia.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:24.542
So, coming back to apples today, even though the fruit is so variable, and

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:29.502
its seeds will naturally produce different trees, and different fruits,

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:35.442
a small selection of apple varieties dominate the global apple market.

00:14:36.382 --> 00:14:42.602
There are about 7,500 different varieties of apple grown all over the world,

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:49.982
but in the US just 11 varieties are responsible for 90% of apple sales.

00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:57.252
Creating the supposed “perfect apple” is now a real science, and gone

00:14:57.302 --> 00:15:01.842
are the days of people like Johnny Appleseed roaming around the country

00:15:02.052 --> 00:15:07.022
scattering seeds and wondering whether a delicious new variety will emerge.

00:15:07.822 --> 00:15:11.772
One of the world’s most popular apples, the Honeycrisp

00:15:11.772 --> 00:15:15.152
apple, was developed at the University of Minnesota.

00:15:15.552 --> 00:15:21.162
New versions of apples are even patented, to stop others from copying them.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:26.912
And new varieties of apple are not chosen only for their taste.

00:15:27.412 --> 00:15:33.172
They need to look attractive, they need to be just the right amount of juicy,

00:15:33.372 --> 00:15:38.862
they need to travel well, they need to not go bad for a long amount of time,

00:15:39.552 --> 00:15:44.602
they need to be able to be piled on top of each other in supermarkets, there

00:15:44.609 --> 00:15:49.752
are all sorts of factors that go into the development of new types of apples.

00:15:50.602 --> 00:15:57.362
And when apple producers think they have found a winning formula, they launch new varieties

00:15:57.392 --> 00:16:03.592
of apples in a similar way to if they were launching a new chocolate bar or breakfast cereal.

00:16:04.072 --> 00:16:11.972
At the end of 2019, the producers of Honeycrisp and Enterprise came together to create

00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:18.602
an apple called Cosmic Crisp, which had a $10 million marketing budget behind it.

00:16:20.132 --> 00:16:25.052
So, things have come a long way since the days of Johnny Appleseed.

00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:30.072
And as with anything that has been a fundamental part of society

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:34.982
for so long, apples have also made a mark on the English language.

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:43.222
English is, of course not unique in terms of its use of apples in idioms: French listeners

00:16:43.222 --> 00:16:49.182
will be familiar with what “falling into apples”, “tomber dans les pommes” means - for

00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:55.752
the non-French speakers, it means to faint, to pass out, to lose consciousness, and I’m

00:16:55.752 --> 00:17:01.182
sure there are some fun and interesting expressions in your language based around apples.

00:17:01.832 --> 00:17:07.802
But here are a few in English that you might come across, and might want to use for yourself.

00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:10.890
Firstly, “ bad apple”.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:18.050
If someone is a bad apple, they are fundamentally a bad person, they have a bad character.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:25.010
It’s normally used to refer to one person who is bad among a group of good people.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.890
You might think, ok, well if someone is a good person, can I call them “a good apple”?

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.610
No, sorry.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:39.450
You can call them a good egg, which is pretty much the opposite of a bad apple.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.970
Confusing, I know.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.040
Our second apple expression is “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.930
You might be familiar with a similar expression in your language, and in

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.890
English it means, as you might imagine, eating apples is good for you.

00:17:56.844 --> 00:18:02.170
Third, is the expression “it’s like comparing apples to oranges”.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.460
You can use this expression if you think someone is making an unfair

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:12.110
comparison, that they are comparing two things that shouldn’t be compared.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.390
So, for example, if you are comparing someone’s English ability to their

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.850
cooking skill, you could say “that’s like comparing apples to oranges”.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.280
Our fourth expression, our penultimate expression, is an expression

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.670
I particularly like, and that's “how do you like them apples?”

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.287
You can say this as a comeback, as a way of replying to someone else

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:45.067
to show that you have actually done something better, and surprising.

00:18:46.012 --> 00:18:51.202
For example, a child taking a test might ask their friend what score

00:18:51.202 --> 00:18:55.982
they got, they might say “I got a B”, and the other one might turn the

00:18:55.982 --> 00:19:01.602
paper around, show the “A” grade, and say “how do you like them apples”.

00:19:02.492 --> 00:19:06.862
You might think that it sounds grammatically incorrect, because of

00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:11.642
course it should be “how do you like those apples”, or “these apples”.

00:19:12.172 --> 00:19:16.482
Indeed, as I was writing this episode, Google Docs tried to

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:21.442
correct my grammar, but the expression really is “them apples”.

00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:29.442
And our final apple-related expression is “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”.

00:19:30.532 --> 00:19:37.132
This is used to communicate the fact that a child is similar to their parents, so if

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:43.652
there was a child that was, let’s say, very talented at the violin, and the child's mother

00:19:43.842 --> 00:19:49.442
was a famous musician, you might say “well, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:56.602
It’s actually more frequently used to describe negative qualities, so let’s say

00:19:56.602 --> 00:20:01.962
that a child does something bad, or gets into trouble, and they had a parent who

00:20:02.172 --> 00:20:07.192
also got into trouble, you might say “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”.

00:20:08.232 --> 00:20:14.852
Although on one level this phrase makes etymological sense, because the idea is

00:20:14.872 --> 00:20:20.372
that similar talents are passed down the family, when you know about how apples

00:20:20.842 --> 00:20:26.292
actually reproduce, you realise that this expression doesn’t make much sense at all.

00:20:28.902 --> 00:20:34.102
So, there we have it, a brief look at the curious history of apples.

00:20:34.572 --> 00:20:38.822
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that next

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:45.162
time you take a bite out of a Golden Delicious, a Fuji, a Granny Smith, Braeburn,

00:20:45.192 --> 00:20:50.392
or whatever type of apple is most popular in the country you live in, then you’ll

00:20:50.392 --> 00:20:54.782
know a little bit more about the fascinating history of this delicious fruit.

00:20:55.252 --> 00:20:59.522
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:59.632 --> 00:21:02.772
What is the most popular type of apple where you are from?

00:21:03.232 --> 00:21:08.112
This episode focussed on the history of apples mainly in the English-speaking

00:21:08.112 --> 00:21:13.342
world, but tell me, what stories are there about apple pioneers in your country?

00:21:13.952 --> 00:21:19.972
And finally, there are no doubt so many fun expressions that use apples in your language.

00:21:20.482 --> 00:21:22.272
What are they, and what do they mean?

00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:23.692
I would love to know.

00:21:23.972 --> 00:21:27.052

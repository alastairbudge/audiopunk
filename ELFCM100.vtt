Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:16.305
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:21.315
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:27.567
I'm Alastair Budge and today’s episode is a very special one, because

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:32.591
it’s the one hundredth episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:39.854
So as a mini celebration of this , the subject of this episode is going

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:45.014
to be the man after whom Leonardo English is named, Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:52.604
He is debatably the most curious mind in history, a painter, a sculptor,

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:58.874
an engineer, an anatomist, a mathematician, a futurist and much more.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:06.114
So today we are going to learn all about this fantastic man, and his wonderful life.

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:08.644
And it really is quite something.

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:15.464
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:21.384
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:27.114
episode and for all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:32.384
This is where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English, and join

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:37.654
a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups, exchanging

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:42.724
ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:46.874
Again, the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:53.624
Ok then, let’s get started and talk about Leonardo Da Vinci, the

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:58.554
world’s greatest polymath, probably the greatest painter in history,

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:03.834
and someone who perfectly embodies the concept of the Renaissance man.

00:02:04.914 --> 00:02:10.474
He was born on the 15th April 1452 in the small town

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:13.604
of Vinci, just outside Florence, in Tuscany, Italy.

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:22.804
His father was a wealthy Florentine legal notary, and his mother was thought to be a peasant.

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:29.044
They weren’t married, so he was born out of wedlock, he was illegitimate.

00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:34.984
This meant, amongst other things, that he wasn’t given a surname.

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:40.824
He was just Leonardo Da Vinci, Da Vinci means ‘of Vinci; in Italian.

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:45.474
Not a huge amount is known about Leonardo’s early life.

00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:52.724
Because he was illegitimate, he couldn’t follow in his father’s footsteps and become a legal notary.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:58.504
Instead, he was sent to Florence to do an apprenticeship in the

00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:03.634
workshop of a leading Florentine painter and sculptor called Verrocchio.

00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:08.534
Now, those of you that have listened to the episode on the

00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:13.064
Medici will know all about Florence in the 15th century.

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:18.194
It was a hub, a centre of creativity, and had already

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:22.254
produced such great artists as Donatello and Botticelli.

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:28.324
Leonardo joined the workshop when he was 17 years old, and stayed

00:03:28.564 --> 00:03:33.854
for around 7 years, quite a bit longer than one might have expected.

00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:42.104
His talents soon became apparent, and there’s a story of his master, Verocchio, a great

00:03:42.104 --> 00:03:48.374
painter himself, seeing Leonardo’s work on a Baptism of Christ, a painting that they

00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:55.504
were doing together; it was so beautiful that Verocchio put down his paintbrush, vowing

00:03:55.504 --> 00:04:01.474
never to paint again because he could never create something so beautiful as Leonardo.

00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:08.024
Now, that may be apocryphal, it might not actually be true, but it

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:13.124
is undeniable that Leonardo’s talents were there for everyone to see.

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:19.664
He started winning commissions all over Florence, but developed a bit of a

00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:26.054
reputation for taking on big projects that he would get bored of and not finish.

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:35.394
His mind would wander, and he would get distracted by a new, exciting project or problem to solve.

00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:42.364
This actually got him in some legal trouble, as his clients understandably

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:47.254
were frustrated when Leonardo’s attentions turned to something new.

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:54.404
Although he didn’t keep a traditional diary, so we don’t know a huge amount

00:04:54.484 --> 00:05:01.204
about his day to day movements, he did keep meticulous notebooks, very detailed

00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:08.414
notes about everything he was thinking about, and these are a fascinating insight

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:15.714
into how his mind worked, and also help explain why he was so easily distracted.

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:21.984
Leonardo, quite simply, wanted to understand everything.

00:05:23.044 --> 00:05:27.234
He observed the natural world, tried to understand why

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:31.824
certain things happen, and tried to test his assumptions.

00:05:33.114 --> 00:05:38.084
He has been called the most relentlessly curious man in history.

00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:46.054
From asking himself why clouds form to how birds can fly, from asking

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:51.744
himself what function different organs in the body play to how to

00:05:51.754 --> 00:05:56.904
calculate the size of Milan, he wanted to understand everything.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:06.284
We love to put labels on people, to say what people are or what they do, and indeed at the

00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:13.304
start of this episode I described Leonardo as a painter, an engineer, a mathematician, and more.

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:19.254
But Leonardo Da Vinci wouldn’t have considered himself as any of these, or

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:24.134
rather, he wouldn’t have seen a difference between a painter and an engineer.

00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:31.344
The natural world was all interconnected, and so one needed an understanding of

00:06:31.344 --> 00:06:39.214
mathematics to create great art, one needed to know how birds fly to be a master engineer.

00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:44.724
There was no dividing line between these different disciplines, and Leonardo

00:06:44.724 --> 00:06:49.624
sought to understand how everything worked, how it was all connected.

00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:55.424
It goes without saying that when Leonardo was alive our understanding

00:06:55.534 --> 00:07:00.164
of the way the world works was considerably less developed.

00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:05.944
You or I might have these thoughts, we might think “I wonder what

00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:09.934
features of birds actually mean they can fly”, but we have the

00:07:09.934 --> 00:07:14.514
advantage of being able to look up the answer on Google or read a book.

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:20.274
Leonardo obviously didn’t have this advantage, or perhaps he might

00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:25.184
have thought it a disadvantage, and he took everything from first

00:07:25.214 --> 00:07:29.934
principles - he sought to understand and explain the world for himself.

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:37.314
In 1481, when he was 29 years old, and had already got quite a name

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:42.954
for himself in Florence as an artist, he decided to try his luck in

00:07:42.954 --> 00:07:48.254
Milan, and sent a letter to the Duke of Milan asking for employment.

00:07:49.304 --> 00:07:54.844
Despite being one of Florence’s most famous painters, when Leonardo wrote his letter

00:07:55.014 --> 00:08:01.744
of introduction to the Duke of Milan explaining how he could help him, he didn’t even

00:08:01.754 --> 00:08:07.894
really mention the fact that he was a painter, instead focussing on his talents as a

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:15.324
military engineer, writing about how he could build bridges, guns, and weapons of war.

00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:22.444
Only right at the end of his letter did he say “I can carry out sculpture in marble, bronze or

00:08:22.454 --> 00:08:30.204
clay, and also in painting whatever may be done, and as well as any other, be he whom he may”.

00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:35.864
His application was successful, and he stayed in Milan for 17 years,

00:08:36.364 --> 00:08:42.144
creating some of his most famous works, including The Last Supper, which

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:46.514
you can still visit in Santa Maria Delle Grazie, a church in Milan.

00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:52.264
It was soon clear that although he had remarkable talents as an

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:56.904
engineer, his talents as a painter were really without equal.

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:05.544
He left Milan in 1500 after it was invaded by the French, going first to Venice, Cesena,

00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:11.864
then back to Florence, and then ending up in the service of King Francis of France

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:18.714
in 1516, and moving to the Château Royal d'Amboise, the King’s residence in the Loire

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:26.424
valley, to the south west of Paris, where he remained until his death in 1519, aged 67.

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:32.844
Now, that’s a whirlwind tour, it's a very quick tour, through some of the

00:09:32.844 --> 00:09:37.664
key events of his life, but let’s get into the more interesting stuff.

00:09:38.654 --> 00:09:45.424
Firstly, although this life of Leonardo that we’ve just whizzed through might sound quite

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:54.674
idyllic, and a tale of a genius just rising to the top, he was in many ways an outcast,

00:09:54.704 --> 00:10:01.551
and a misfit, someone who didn't fit in properly, in Florentine Renaissance society.

00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:07.021
He was illegitimate, to start with, which although it might not sound

00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:12.024
so terrible to us today, it meant that he always had this mark on him.

00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:17.544
He was left handed, which, again, it might not seem like such a handicap

00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:22.714
at all now, in the days of writing with pen and ink it meant that if

00:10:22.724 --> 00:10:27.404
you weren’t careful you would smudge the ink, you would mess the ink.

00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:34.764
So reportedly he developed a technique of writing each letter backwards on the page.

00:10:35.944 --> 00:10:42.424
He didn’t seem to care about fame and fortune, at least when he was young, shown by the fact that

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:49.514
he stayed with Verrocchio for much longer than would be expected, and was much more interested in

00:10:49.514 --> 00:10:56.304
expanding his mind than his bank balance, which although admirable, wasn’t entirely predictable.

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:59.544
It’s also quite clear that he was gay.

00:11:00.104 --> 00:11:05.414
He was arrested in Florence for sodomy, for being found with a male prostitute,

00:11:05.994 --> 00:11:11.564
he never married, and his notebooks suggest that he was involved in a long term

00:11:11.564 --> 00:11:18.504
relationship with his pupil, a man he gave the nickname of Salai, or ‘little devil’.

00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:25.794
And finally, he was a vegetarian, which was pretty unusual for someone 500 years ago.

00:11:26.824 --> 00:11:31.794
His vegetarianism actually brings us on to our next interesting part of his

00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:38.464
life, and way of thinking, which was a deep interest in, and love for animals.

00:11:39.654 --> 00:11:48.634
He is most famous for his work as a painter and engineer, but he was also a fantastic anatomist, and

00:11:48.864 --> 00:11:56.234
developed a great interest in understanding how bodies of animals, both humans and others, worked.

00:11:57.654 --> 00:12:01.654
He would reportedly buy birds from merchants in Florence,

00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:06.204
only to set them free from their cages and see how they flew.

00:12:07.364 --> 00:12:14.594
Given his status as a well known artist, he was allowed to dissect human corpses,

00:12:14.614 --> 00:12:20.034
to cut up dead bodies, in order for him to understand how our bodies worked.

00:12:21.204 --> 00:12:26.544
He was the first person to realise that our spines, the central big

00:12:26.614 --> 00:12:32.054
collection of bones in our back is actually curved, it’s not straight.

00:12:33.344 --> 00:12:40.034
His drawings of things like our muscles, sexual organs, and heart are amazingly detailed.

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:48.394
He observed how blood flows through our bodies, the function our heart plays, and how bodies work.

00:12:49.984 --> 00:12:58.364
He did all this not out of some wish for fame or fortune, he did it because he wanted to understand.

00:12:58.364 --> 00:13:06.493
Indeed his notes on anatomy weren't published and it was a few hundred years until a lot of what

00:13:06.493 --> 00:13:13.403
Leonardo Da Vinci had figured out in the early 16th century was then ‘discovered’ by anatomists.

00:13:14.703 --> 00:13:20.043
It was the same anatomical approach, of observing how something worked, then

00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:25.453
looking at it very closely, and trying to recreate it, that he used as an engineer.

00:13:26.963 --> 00:13:33.063
For Leonardo, there wasn’t a difference between the natural world and the mechanical world.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:38.363
It was just the world, and he could take what he saw in the natural world,

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:45.163
for example with how birds could fly, and apply that to his own creations.

00:13:46.473 --> 00:13:52.033
This didn’t mean that he’d just try to recreate a bird, but rather he would

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:57.963
observe what properties allowed a bird to fly and use that information

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:03.413
when devising his own creation, when creating his own flying machines.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:08.703
Indeed, he is often credited with being the first person to

00:14:08.703 --> 00:14:12.953
design the helicopter, the parachute, or even the aeroplane.

00:14:14.373 --> 00:14:20.563
His designs look a little different to modern planes of course, but the point is that

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:26.303
he understood a lot of the fundamental principles of what allows something to fly.

00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:32.903
He had observed it in the natural world, and tried to apply that to the mechanical world.

00:14:33.943 --> 00:14:39.413
Now, this wouldn’t be a real episode on Leonardo Da Vinci if we didn’t mention

00:14:39.423 --> 00:14:44.473
his most famous work, The Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda, as it’s called in Italian.

00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:50.163
The Mona Lisa needs no introduction, you’ve heard of it, and you know what it looks like.

00:14:51.193 --> 00:14:55.323
It could be considered the epitome of Leonardo’s work.

00:14:55.323 --> 00:15:01.353
He started it around 1503, kept it with him, and it’s believed

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:05.253
that he continued to work on it for the rest of his life.

00:15:06.213 --> 00:15:13.843
There are few paintings that have elicited so many questions, with which there are so many unknowns,

00:15:14.263 --> 00:15:21.223
but here are a few that might be interesting specifically related to the life of Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:15:22.353 --> 00:15:26.693
So, the identity of the woman in the painting is debated.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:34.373
It’s thought to be the wife of a Florentine silk merchant, a woman called Lisa Gherardini, but the

00:15:34.373 --> 00:15:43.783
nose, forehead and smile are very similar to that of Salai, the man thought to be Leonardo’s lover.

00:15:44.933 --> 00:15:51.533
So is the Mona Lisa really a painting of, or at least a tribute to, his male lover?

00:15:52.663 --> 00:15:58.843
Also, why did Leonardo take a commission from someone who was only a silk merchant?

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:05.883
He had requests from the richest and most famous people in Italy, so why

00:16:05.883 --> 00:16:10.813
did he accept a commission from someone who was a comparative nobody.

00:16:11.713 --> 00:16:16.253
And why did Leonardo never deliver the painting to the man who commissioned it?

00:16:17.313 --> 00:16:22.683
It’s an enduring mystery that Leonardo left us, and I’m sure will baffle

00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:27.103
art historians, it will confuse art historians, for years to come.

00:16:28.033 --> 00:16:33.513
So, the life of Leonardo Da Vinci is as fascinating as it is mysterious.

00:16:33.933 --> 00:16:41.283
We can piece together our own ideas about the real Leonardo Da Vinci, but the understanding

00:16:41.293 --> 00:16:47.533
that we have is formed pretty much only through his own notebooks, which are full of his

00:16:47.843 --> 00:16:53.853
unanswered questions about how the world works, and his ideas about how it might work.

00:16:55.443 --> 00:17:00.383
Certainly, we can still be inspired by the relentless curiosity of the

00:17:00.383 --> 00:17:05.893
man, his thirst for knowledge, and his desire to understand everything.

00:17:06.733 --> 00:17:15.213
Leonardo was clearly a case of the more you know, the more you know you don’t know, and even in his

00:17:15.223 --> 00:17:23.053
final years he thought he hadn’t achieved enough, that he hadn’t managed to learn or create enough.

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:29.533
After having produced the most famous painting in the world, probably the most

00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:34.463
famous drawings in the world, and made countless discoveries in the fields

00:17:34.593 --> 00:17:40.373
of mathematics, engineering and anatomy, if he died thinking that he hadn’t

00:17:40.383 --> 00:17:44.763
achieved enough, then I don’t know what hope there is for the rest of us.

00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:54.623

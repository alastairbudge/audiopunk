Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:16.305
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:21.315
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:27.567
I'm Alastair Budge and today’s episode is a very special one, because

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:32.591
it’s the one hundredth episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:39.854
So as a mini celebration of this , the subject of the episode is going

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:45.014
to be the man after whom Leonardo English is named, Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:52.604
He is debatably the most curious mind in history, a painter, a sculptor,

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:58.874
an engineer, an anatomist, a mathematician, a futurist and much more.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:06.114
So today we are going to learn all about this fantastic man, and his wonderful life.

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:08.644
And it really is quite something.

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:15.464
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:21.384
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:27.114
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:31.664
This is where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

bit like Leonardo, then make sure you become a member before midnight on the 31st.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:26.074
Again, the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:32.824
Ok then, let’s get started and talk about Leonardo Da Vinci, the

00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:37.754
world’s greatest polymath, probably the greatest painter in history,

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:43.034
and someone who perfectly embodies the concept of the Renaissance man.

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:49.674
He was born on the 15th April 1452 in the small town

00:02:49.714 --> 00:02:52.804
of Vinci, just outside Florence, in Tuscany, Italy.

00:02:54.394 --> 00:03:02.004
His father was a wealthy Florentine legal notary, and his mother was thought to be a peasant.

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:08.244
They weren’t married, so he was born out of wedlock, he was illegitimate.

00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:14.184
This meant, amongst other things, that he wasn’t given a surname.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:20.024
He was just Leonardo Da Vinci, Da Vinci means ‘of Vinci; in Italian.

00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:24.674
Not a huge amount is known about Leonardo’s early life.

00:03:25.544 --> 00:03:31.924
Because he was illegitimate, he couldn’t follow in his father’s footsteps and become a legal notary.

00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:37.704
Instead, he was sent to Florence to do an apprenticeship in the

00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:42.834
workshop of a leading Florentine painter and sculptor called Verrocchio.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:47.734
Now, those of you that have listened to the episode on the

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:52.264
Medici will know all about Florence in the 15th century.

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:57.394
It was a hub, a centre of creativity, and had already

00:03:57.394 --> 00:04:01.454
produced such great artists as Donatello and Botticelli.

00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:07.524
Leonardo joined the workshop when he was 17 years old, and stayed

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:13.054
for around 7 years, quite a bit longer than one might have expected.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:21.304
His talents soon became apparent, and there’s a story of his master, Verocchio, a great

00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:27.574
painter himself, seeing Leonardo’s work on a Baptism of Christ, a painting that they

00:04:27.574 --> 00:04:34.704
were doing together; it was so beautiful that Verocchio put down his paintbrush, vowing

00:04:34.704 --> 00:04:40.674
never to paint again because he could never create something so beautiful as Leonardo.

00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:47.224
Now, that may be apocryphal, it might not actually be true, but it

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:52.324
is undeniable that Leonardo’s talents were there for everyone to see.

00:04:53.374 --> 00:04:58.864
He started winning commissions all over Florence, but developed a bit of a

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:05.254
reputation for taking on big projects that he would get bored of and not finish.

00:05:06.214 --> 00:05:14.594
His mind would wander, and he would get distracted by a new, exciting project or problem to solve.

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:21.564
This actually got him in some legal trouble, as his clients understandably

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:26.454
were frustrated when Leonardo’s attentions turned to something new.

00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:33.604
Although he didn’t keep a traditional diary, so we don’t know a huge amount

00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:40.404
about his day to day movements, he did keep meticulous notebooks, very detailed

00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:47.614
notes about everything he was thinking about, and these are a fascinating insight

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:54.914
into how his mind worked, and also help explain why he was so easily distracted.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:06:01.184
Leonardo, quite simply, wanted to understand everything.

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:06.434
He observed the natural world, tried to understand why

00:06:06.444 --> 00:06:11.024
certain things happen, and tried to test his assumptions.

00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:17.284
He has been called the most relentlessly curious man in history.

00:06:17.984 --> 00:06:25.254
From asking himself why clouds form to how birds can fly, from asking

00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:30.944
himself what function different organs in the body play to how to

00:06:30.954 --> 00:06:36.104
calculate the size of Milan, he wanted to understand everything.

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:45.484
We love to put labels on people, to say what people are or what they do, and indeed at the

00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:52.504
start of this episode I described Leonardo as a painter, an engineer, a mathematician, and more.

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:58.454
But Leonardo Da Vinci wouldn’t have considered himself as any of these, or

00:06:58.474 --> 00:07:03.334
rather, he wouldn’t have seen a difference between a painter and an engineer.

00:07:04.374 --> 00:07:10.544
The natural world was all interconnected, and so one needed an understanding of

00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:18.414
mathematics to create great art, one needed to know how birds fly to be a master engineer.

00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:23.924
There was no dividing line between these different disciplines, and Leonardo

00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:28.824
sought to understand how everything worked, how it was all connected.

00:07:30.204 --> 00:07:34.624
It goes without saying that when Leonardo was alive our understanding

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:39.364
of the way the world works was considerably less developed.

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:45.144
You or I might have these thoughts, we might think “I wonder what

00:07:45.144 --> 00:07:49.134
features of birds actually mean they can fly”, but we have the

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:53.714
advantage of being able to look up the answer on Google or read a book.

00:07:54.484 --> 00:07:59.474
Leonardo obviously didn’t have this advantage, or perhaps he might

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:04.384
have thought it a disadvantage, and he took everything from first

00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:09.134
principles - he sought to understand and explain the world for himself.

00:08:10.184 --> 00:08:16.514
In 1481, when he was 29 years old, and had already got quite a name

00:08:16.514 --> 00:08:22.154
for himself in Florence as an artist, he decided to try his luck in

00:08:22.154 --> 00:08:27.454
Milan, and sent a letter to the Duke of Milan asking for employment.

00:08:28.504 --> 00:08:34.044
Despite being one of Florence’s most famous painters, when Leonardo wrote his letter

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:40.944
of introduction to the Duke of Milan explaining how he could help him, he didn’t even

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:47.094
really mention the fact that he was a painter, instead focussing on his talents as a

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:54.524
military engineer, writing about how he could build bridges, guns, and weapons of war.

00:08:55.374 --> 00:09:01.644
Only right at the end of his letter did he say “I can carry out sculpture in marble, bronze or

00:09:01.654 --> 00:09:09.404
clay, and also in painting whatever may be done, and as well as any other, be he whom he may”.

00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:15.064
His application was successful, and he stayed in Milan for 17 years,

00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:21.344
creating some of his most famous works, including The Last Supper, which

00:09:21.354 --> 00:09:25.714
you can still visit in Santa Maria Delle Grazie, a church in Milan.

00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:31.464
It was soon clear that although he had remarkable talents as an

00:09:31.464 --> 00:09:36.104
engineer, his talents as a painter were really without equal.

00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:44.744
He left Milan in 1500 after it was invaded by the French, going first to Venice, Cesena,

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:51.064
then back to Florence, and then ending up in the service of King Francis of France

00:09:51.354 --> 00:09:57.914
in 1516, and moving to the Château Royal d'Amboise, the King’s residence in the Loire

00:09:57.924 --> 00:10:05.624
valley, to the south west of Paris, where he remained until his death in 1519, aged 67.

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:12.044
Now, that’s a whirlwind tour, it's a very quick tour, through some of the

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:16.864
key events of his life, but let’s get into the more interesting stuff.

00:10:17.854 --> 00:10:24.624
Firstly, although this life of Leonardo that we’ve just whizzed through might sound quite

00:10:24.904 --> 00:10:33.874
idyllic, and a tale of a genius just rising to the top, he was in many ways an outcast,

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:40.751
and a misfit, someone who didn't fit in properly, in Florentine Renaissance society.

00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:46.221
He was illegitimate, to start with, which although it might not sound

00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:51.224
so terrible to us today, it meant that he always had this mark on him.

00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:56.744
He was left handed, which, again, it might not seem like such a handicap

00:10:56.834 --> 00:11:01.914
at all now, in the days of writing with pen and ink it meant that if

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:06.604
you weren’t careful you would smudge the ink, you would mess the ink.

00:11:07.184 --> 00:11:13.964
So reportedly he developed a technique of writing each letter backwards on the page.

00:11:15.144 --> 00:11:21.624
He didn’t seem to care about fame and fortune, at least when he was young, shown by the fact that

00:11:21.624 --> 00:11:28.714
he stayed with Verrocchio for much longer than would be expected, and was much more interested in

00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:35.504
expanding his mind than his bank balance, which although admirable, wasn’t entirely predictable.

00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:38.744
It’s also quite clear that he was gay.

00:11:39.304 --> 00:11:44.614
He was arrested in Florence for sodomy, for being found with a male prostitute,

00:11:45.194 --> 00:11:50.764
he never married, and his notebooks suggest that he was involved in a long term

00:11:50.764 --> 00:11:57.704
relationship with his pupil, a man he gave the nickname of Salai, or ‘little devil’.

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:04.994
And finally, he was a vegetarian, which was pretty unusual for someone 500 years ago.

00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:10.994
His vegetarianism actually brings us on to our next interesting part of his

00:12:10.994 --> 00:12:17.664
life, and way of thinking, which was a deep interest in, and love for animals.

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:27.834
He is most famous for his work as a painter and engineer, but he was also a fantastic anatomist, and

00:12:28.064 --> 00:12:35.434
developed a great interest in understanding how bodies of animals, both humans and others, worked.

00:12:36.854 --> 00:12:40.854
He would reportedly buy birds from merchants in Florence,

00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:45.404
only to set them free from their cages and see how they flew.

00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:53.794
Given his status as a well known artist, he was allowed to dissect human corpses,

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:59.234
to cut up dead bodies, in order for him to understand how our bodies worked.

00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:05.744
He was the first person to realise that our spines, the central big

00:13:05.814 --> 00:13:11.254
collection of bones in our back is actually curved, it’s not straight.

00:13:12.544 --> 00:13:19.234
His drawings of things like our muscles, sexual organs, and heart are amazingly detailed.

00:13:19.794 --> 00:13:27.594
He observed how blood flows through our bodies, the function our heart plays, and how bodies work.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:37.564
He did all this not out of some wish for fame or fortune, he did it because he wanted to understand.

00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:45.693
Indeed his notes on anatomy weren't published and it was a few hundred years until a lot of what

00:13:45.693 --> 00:13:52.603
Leonardo Da Vinci had figured out in the early 16th century was then ‘discovered’ by anatomists.

00:13:53.903 --> 00:13:59.243
It was the same anatomical approach, of observing how something worked, then

00:13:59.243 --> 00:14:04.653
looking at it very closely, and trying to recreate it, that he used as an engineer.

00:14:06.163 --> 00:14:12.263
For Leonardo, there wasn’t a difference between the natural world and the mechanical world.

00:14:12.513 --> 00:14:17.563
It was just the world, and he could take what he saw in the natural world,

00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:24.363
for example with how birds could fly, and apply that to his own creations.

00:14:25.673 --> 00:14:31.233
This didn’t mean that he’d just try to recreate a bird, but rather he would

00:14:31.463 --> 00:14:37.163
observe what properties allowed a bird to fly and use that information

00:14:37.413 --> 00:14:42.613
when devising his own creation, when creating his own flying machines.

00:14:43.643 --> 00:14:47.903
Indeed, he is often credited with being the first person to

00:14:47.903 --> 00:14:52.153
design the helicopter, the parachute, or even the aeroplane.

00:14:53.573 --> 00:14:59.763
His designs look a little different to modern planes of course, but the point is that

00:14:59.843 --> 00:15:05.503
he understood a lot of the fundamental principles of what allows something to fly.

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:12.103
He had observed it in the natural world, and tried to apply that to the mechanical world.

00:15:13.143 --> 00:15:18.613
Now, this wouldn’t be a real episode on Leonardo Da Vinci if we didn’t mention

00:15:18.623 --> 00:15:23.673
his most famous work, The Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda, as it’s called in Italian.

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:29.363
The Mona Lisa needs no introduction, you’ve heard of it, and you know what it looks like.

00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:34.523
It could be considered the epitome of Leonardo’s work.

00:15:34.523 --> 00:15:40.553
He started it around 1503, kept it with him, and it’s believed

00:15:40.703 --> 00:15:44.453
that he continued to work on it for the rest of his life.

00:15:45.413 --> 00:15:53.043
There are few paintings that have elicited so many questions, with which there are so many unknowns,

00:15:53.463 --> 00:16:00.423
but here are a few that might be interesting specifically related to the life of Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:05.893
So, the identity of the woman in the painting is debated.

00:16:06.293 --> 00:16:13.573
It’s thought to be the wife of a Florentine silk merchant, a woman called Lisa Gherardini, but the

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:22.983
nose, forehead and smile are very similar to that of Salai, the man thought to be Leonardo’s lover.

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:30.733
So is the Mona Lisa really a painting of, or at least a tribute to, his male lover?

00:16:31.863 --> 00:16:38.043
Also, why did Leonardo take a commission from someone who was only a silk merchant?

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:45.083
He had requests from the richest and most famous people in Italy, so why

00:16:45.083 --> 00:16:50.013
did he accept a commission from someone who was a comparative nobody.

00:16:50.913 --> 00:16:55.453
And why did Leonardo never deliver the painting to the man who commissioned it?

00:16:56.513 --> 00:17:01.883
It’s an enduring mystery that Leonardo left us, and I’m sure will baffle

00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:06.303
art historians, it will confuse art historians, for years to come.

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:12.713
So, the life of Leonardo Da Vinci is as fascinating as it is mysterious.

00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:20.483
We can piece together our own ideas about the real Leonardo Da Vinci, but the understanding

00:17:20.493 --> 00:17:26.733
that we have is formed pretty much only through his own notebooks, which are full of his

00:17:27.043 --> 00:17:33.053
unanswered questions about how the world works, and his ideas about how it might work.

00:17:34.643 --> 00:17:39.583
Certainly, we can still be inspired by the relentless curiosity of the

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:45.093
man, his thirst for knowledge, and his desire to understand everything.

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:54.413
Leonardo was clearly a case of the more you know, the more you know you don’t know, and even in his

00:17:54.423 --> 00:18:02.253
final years he thought he hadn’t achieved enough, that he hadn’t managed to learn or create enough.

00:18:03.443 --> 00:18:08.733
After having produced the most famous painting in the world, probably the most

00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:13.663
famous drawings in the world, and made countless discoveries in the fields

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:19.573
of mathematics, engineering and anatomy, if he died thinking that he hadn’t

00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:23.963
achieved enough, then I don’t know what hope there is for the rest of us.

00:18:26.893 --> 00:18:33.823
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Leonardo Da Vinci, our 100th episode.

00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:35.263

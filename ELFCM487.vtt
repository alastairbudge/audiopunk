Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.259
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.310
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.349
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series on British Divisions.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.439
In case you haven’t listened to them yet, part one was on Scotland’s 1,000-year

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.450
rivalry with England, part two was on the North-South divide, and in part

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.500
three we are going to be tackling the huge subject of The Wars Of The Roses.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.920
I feel like I should give you a bit of a warning before we start this one.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.449
It is complicated, there are lots of different characters, and it is about a period of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.089
English history from the 15th century, so it is completely on the other end of the scale

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.960
from an easy YouTube video where someone teaches their favourite idioms about the weather.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.590
It is not easy, but it is fascinating.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.670
It was said to be a large inspiration for the author of Game Of Thrones, and involves

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.380
princes and princesses jostling for power, marriages of love, marriages of convenience,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.720
powerful men, powerful women, evil uncles, mental breakdowns, murders, executions,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.680
the French, treason, and a battle in which 3% of all men in England were slaughtered.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.399
So, if you are ready for all of that, let’s get started and talk about The Wars Of The Roses.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.739
9 month old babies are not capable of doing very much.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.979
They can probably sit up, crawl around, perhaps take a few

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.649
steps on their own, smile and make unintelligible noises.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.940
They are cute but utterly incapable of looking after themselves.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.300
But on the 31st of August 1422, a 9-month-old baby called Henry was

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:11.990
given more responsibility than any 9-month-old should ever be given.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.310
After the death of his father, he was made not only King of England but also King of France.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.329
Of course, he wasn’t expected to actually rule as a baby; a group of powerful nobles

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
was appointed to rule on his behalf until he was old enough to rule for himself.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.019
But this sequence of events would put into motion a series of wars and battles for the crown

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:51.450
that would last for 30 years, from 1455 to 1487, and fundamentally reshape the British monarchy.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.710
In fact, the seeds had already been sown for this dispute many years before Henry’s birth.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.869
In 1377, the powerful and popular English king, King Edward III, died.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.240
Although he had shown remarkable foresight in planning his succession, having

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.739
had 12 children, nine of whom survived to adulthood, his death would result in

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.730
one of the messiest and most protracted inheritance fights in British history.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.140
His firstborn son and heir, Edward “The Black Prince”, died a year before he

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:41.530
did, so the crown passed directly to his son and Edward III’s grandson, Richard,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.230
who was then only a 10-year-old boy but would later become King Richard II.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.150
Richard was guided by his uncle, but as he grew older and more mature,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.440
he sought to assert his own authority and make his own decisions as king.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.780
The problem was that there was now an increasing number of claimants to the English

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.896
throne, people who said that they were more directly related to the deceased Edward III.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:23.800
One of these was Richard II’s cousin, Henry, and indeed in 1399, after raising an army and marching

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.623
against Richard II, Henry proved victorious and declared himself king, becoming King Henry IV.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.190
This king Henry had a son, Henry, who became Henry V, and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.369
he had a son who was called, you’ve guessed it, Henry too.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.099
And it was this Henry who was the 9-month-old baby king, King Henry VI.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:54.310
Now, I know we are only a few minutes in and we’ve already had a lot of

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.790
names here, and perhaps you’re thinking it’s already impossible to follow.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.650
Fear not.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.929
There are a lot of characters and different factions, but the important

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:09.850
thing to remember is that it can all be traced back to Edward III, with

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.419
his eight sons and five daughters, most of whom have multiple children.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.270
One son in particular will play an important role in our story today, and

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.809
that’s his fourth son, John of Gaunt, who had a grand total of 14 children.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.820
John of Gaunt was called the Duke of Lancaster, and his descendants will all form part

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.780
of the House of Lancaster, which is going to be one side of The Wars Of The Roses.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.459
Don’t worry so much about all of the names, but the point to underline is that, as

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:51.300
you can see, there is this vastly complicated web of claims to the English throne.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.289
This is the environment into which Henry VI is thrust

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.729
when he is crowned king at the age of 9 months.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.580
To further complicate the situation, as he grows into a man and takes on the

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:13.740
responsibilities of a king, Henry VI does not turn into a strong and decisive leader.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.880
He never had a role model of what a king should look like, as his father died

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.890
when he was a baby, so he could only listen to stories and learn from books.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.242
He was surrounded by a clique, a powerful group of people at court, and

00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:35.312
both at home and abroad, things were not going well for the country.

00:06:35.972 --> 00:06:39.262
England had lost territory in France, there had been a

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:43.042
peasant rebellion, things seemed to be falling apart.

00:06:44.152 --> 00:06:50.702
Some English nobles felt that the king was surrounded by poor advisors, that he was being pushed

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:57.142
around, and that he was incapable of providing the strong leadership that the country needed.

00:06:58.382 --> 00:07:02.412
One man, in particular, took matters into his own hands.

00:07:03.393 --> 00:07:10.382
Henry’s cousin, Richard Duke of York, believed that the situation was serious enough to take action.

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:19.032
In 1453 the Duke of York got his chance after the king had a complete mental breakdown.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:24.922
We are in the 15th century here, so there is no sort of advanced psychological

00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:30.072
diagnosis, but clearly, he was mentally incapacitated in a serious way.

00:07:30.772 --> 00:07:37.872
He was completely unresponsive for almost a year and a half, unable to say or do anything.

00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:42.982
Given the king’s condition, a protector was needed, someone who

00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:46.852
could act in the country’s best interest while the king recovered.

00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:51.712
And Richard, Duke of York, was elected protector.

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:58.180
As soon as he took power, he wasted no time in getting rid of the people he believed

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.600
were a bad influence on the king, and reversing some of the king’s policy decisions.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.720
But sometime in early 1455, after a year and a half of being incapacitated, the

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.610
king came to his senses and was considered mentally capable enough of ruling again.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.730
The king’s allies, who had been pushed aside by the Duke

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.690
of York, were out for blood, they were seeking revenge.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.320
Most of York’s actions were reversed, and York was furious.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.800
He marched south and met the royalist forces at St Albans, just outside London.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:47.263
This was the first time that the two rival sides, the Lancasters and the Yorks,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.600
met in battle, and is widely considered to be the start of the Wars Of The Roses.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.610
It wasn’t a bloody battle, with as little as 50 people being killed.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.500
But there were two important developments for the York side.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.550
Firstly, the leader of the Royalists, of the king’s forces, was killed.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.760
Secondly, the king, Henry VI was captured.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.090
But he wasn’t executed or paraded through the streets.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.750
Remember, the stated objective of Richard, Duke of York, was

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.500
only to help the king, to get rid of his unhelpful advisors.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:36.740
When the king was located, it was discovered that he had again had some form of mental breakdown.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.410
So, with the leader of the Royalist forces out of the picture and the king again mentally

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.890
unfit to rule, The Duke of York declared that he would again take on the role of Protector.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.680
However, according to some historians, the Duke of York’s

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.390
intention all along was to claim the throne for himself.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:05.100
He was Henry’s cousin, and by some measures, he had a greater claim to the English throne than

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:12.530
Henry, because he had two grandparents who were children of Edward III, after a marriage of cousins.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.920
York ruled as Protector for another year, but then Henry recovered

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:25.400
again, and this time when Henry retook the throne, he and his supporters

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.900
wasted no time in sidelining York, even declaring him a traitor.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.710
Now, it is here that I need to introduce another character who will play an important

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.300
role on the side of the Lancasters, probably more important even than the King’s.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.500
And this is Margaret of Anjou.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.290
She was a French princess, and the wife of the weak and

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.030
often mentally incapacitated English King, Henry VI.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.090
She was an incredibly skilled and clever political operator, and

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.670
she effectively commanded large parts of the Lancaster campaign.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.740
Her interest in the success of the House of Lancaster was for several reasons.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.590
Firstly, it was her husband.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:23.040
Secondly, she might well be imprisoned or executed if the House of Lancaster was defeated.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.840
And thirdly, probably most importantly, it was on behalf of her son, Edward.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:36.450
He would only become king if the House of York’s claim was quashed, and

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.140
so as long as the Duke of York was alive, her son’s life was in danger.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.720
So, here’s the situation: on the one side we have the House of Lancaster,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:54.010
which is formed of Henry VI, his wife, Margaret of Anjou, their son, Edward,

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.570
and noble families who have professed their support and loyalty to them.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:05.110
On the other side, there is the House of York, formed of Richard Duke of York, noble

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:12.060
families loyal to his cause, and importantly, his son, who is confusingly also named Edward.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:19.110
And if you’re wondering why they are called the Wars Of The Roses, it is because the House of

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:27.080
Lancaster was represented by a red rose and the House of York was represented by a white rose.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.490
In the interests of brevity and to not throw too many dates and names

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.630
at you we are going to skip over some of the details, but the next major

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.850
development is another battle in which King Henry is captured again.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.180
Henry was having another mental breakdown and was taken to the

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.660
Tower of London, where he was to be kept prisoner for his wellbeing.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.590
Importantly, parliament then declared that Richard Duke of York would be Lord

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:05.420
Protector for the duration of Henry’s life, and even more importantly, when Henry

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:12.320
died the throne would pass to Richard’s son, Edward, rather than Henry’s son.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.980
Things looked like they were going pretty well for the House of York but

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:23.010
Henry VI’s wife, Margaret of Anjou, wasn’t one to give up without a fight.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.020
She fled to Scotland, then raised an army and marched south.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.500
The two opposing forces met at the Battle of Wakefield, in

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.500
Northern England, and Richard, Duke of York, was killed.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:45.900
And to give you some sense of the kind of person Margaret of Anjou was, she had Richard of

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:53.010
York’s head cut off, stuck on a pike, and raised high over the walls of the city of York.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:59.810
Things had looked so good for Richard and the House of York, but now they were very different.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.500
The only hope for the Yorkists lay with Richard’s son, Edward.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.840
It turned out that Edward was quite a formidable military

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.380
commander, and he continued to have success after success.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.870
Noble families who had previously pledged their allegiance to the Lancasters

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:29.550
switched sides and became Yorkists, and it seemed like the tide was turning for good.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:38.070
And then, on a snowy March Sunday in 1461, the two armies faced off again.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.140
Lancaster vs.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.750
York at the Battle of Towton.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:50.450
You might not have heard of this, but it is the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil, with

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:58.660
an estimated 3% of the entire male population of the country losing their lives, some 28,000 men.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.670
It was incredibly bloody, but the Yorkists won.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.910
In anticipation of victory, Edward had declared himself

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.860
king shortly before the battle, becoming King Edward IV.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.000
But there was a slight problem.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:25.480
Henry VI, from the House of Lancaster, was still alive, and he was also still king.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.090
He was also no longer in the Tower of London, having been

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.660
freed after Margaret of Anjou’s victory at Wakefield.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:40.330
And there was another problem, but this one was entirely of Edward’s making.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.240
He had married, but he had married for love.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.290
And he didn’t marry another noble princess; he married

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.640
a commoner, a woman called Elizabeth Woodville.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.540
This upset some of his closest allies, and his closest and most powerful ally, The

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:07.330
Earl of Warwick, switched sides in protest, and supported the House of Lancaster.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.700
Warwick marched on London, went to the Tower of London and freed King

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:18.400
Henry VI, who had in the meantime been captured and imprisoned again,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.490
and paraded him around the streets of England as the rightful king.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:30.190
To state the obvious, Edward IV, the other king, was not going to take this sitting down.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.890
Together with his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, they marched south to London,

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.730
and did battle with their old ally, now enemy, the Earl of Warwick, at Barnet.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:49.100
Warwick was killed, his forces defeated, Henry VI was captured and sent back to

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.800
the Tower of London, and the ball was back in the court of the House of York.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.339
But let’s not forget Henry’s wife, Margaret of Anjou.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.200
At this time she was still in France, trying to raise another army,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.750
but she rushed back to England to try to join up with her allies.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.960
The Yorkists rushed to intercept her, and there was a

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.690
decisive battle in the west of the country, at Tewkesbury.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.140
Decisive because the Lancasters were defeated, decisive because

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.790
Margaret was captured and then exiled to France, and decisive because

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.790
Margaret and Henry’s son and heir, Edward, was killed in the battle.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:40.220
That evening there was a huge celebration, and the luckless King Henry VI died in

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.060
the Tower of London, almost certainly murdered on the orders of King Edward IV.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.980
You could be forgiven for thinking that this was the end of The Wars Of The Roses, but no.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.000
Less than a decade later, King Edward IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:04.720
He had two male heirs, but they were just boys, just 9 and 12.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.160
Their uncle, Edward’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester, became their

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.950
guardian, and sent them to the Tower of London for their wellbeing.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:21.130
After all, they were the sole heirs, and there were plenty of other noble young men with

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.590
claims that they could trace back to Edward III, where this gigantic mess all started.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.850
But it turned out that the threat was closer to home.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:39.120
Remember that Edward IV had upset his old ally, Warwick, by marrying a commoner?

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.290
Edward IV’s brother, the prince’s uncle, the Duke of Gloucester,

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.210
took this as his opportunity to seize the throne for himself.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.970
He publicly declared that his brother’s, the king’s, marriage to his commoner wife was

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:03.110
illegal, and therefore his nephews, the two princes in the tower, were illegitimate.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.250
So who was the rightful king?

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.860
He was, of course, the Duke of Gloucester became Richard III of England.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.520
And what of the two princes in the Tower?

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.410
Nothing more is known about them, and it is thought that the

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.320
unfortunate young boys were murdered on the orders of their uncle.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.890
He might finally have had the crown on his head, but Richard III was not a popular king,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.620
and what’s more, the House of York of which he formed a part was very short on male heirs.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:47.330
The princes had disappeared, and Richard III had no surviving male heirs of his own.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:55.790
The House of Lancaster was similarly sparse, lacking in potential male heirs, but there was one.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:02.980
His name was Henry Tudor, and he had spent most of his young adult years

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:08.220
living in exile in France, out of the way of the ruling York dynasty.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:14.870
But he sensed his opportunity to return to England and take what he saw as rightfully

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:21.160
his, or at least what was as much his as it was Richard III’s: the English crown.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:30.080
In 1485, a good 30 years after the first battle and more than 100 years after

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.530
the death of Edward III, Henry Tudor landed in England and raised an army.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.380
He was supported by French, Welsh and Scottish forces, and he met

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.370
Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, on the 22nd of August.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.790
It was a resounding victory for Henry and the House of Lancaster, and

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:58.330
his opponent and rival for the throne, King Richard III, was killed,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.980
becoming the last English king to be killed on the battlefield.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.079
Henry Tudor became Henry VII, king of England, ending this monumental

00:21:08.099 --> 00:21:12.329
conflict that had plagued the country for most of the 15th century.

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:17.689
And if you are wondering where this all fits into British history that

00:21:17.689 --> 00:21:22.669
you might be more familiar with, Henry Tudor started the period we know

00:21:22.709 --> 00:21:28.889
as The Tudors and the son of Henry VII was, surprise surprise, Henry VIII.

00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:35.329
So, there you have it, a very much whistlestop tour through this fascinating

00:21:35.329 --> 00:21:40.739
period of English history full of twists and turns, rivalries, betrayals and more.

00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:44.159
If you have managed to keep up with the story, I take

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:47.239
my hat off to you, as it is a complicated one indeed.

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:51.849
But it is fascinating, with drama to rival any Hollywood movie.

00:21:52.539 --> 00:21:55.859
If you are a Game of Thrones fan, I’m sure you will agree

00:21:56.229 --> 00:22:00.779
that sometimes true life is just as exciting as fiction.

00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:07.419
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Wars Of The Roses.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:12.079
I hope it was a fun one, and that you managed to follow along with the general gist of the story.

00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:16.529
If you like this sort of thing, I would certainly recommend exploring the story

00:22:16.529 --> 00:22:20.969
in further detail, as we have only had the chance to do a bit of a superficial

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:25.829
overview, and it will probably not surprise you to find out that there are amazing

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:31.279
books and wonderful documentaries that go into the entire thing in much more detail.

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:36.919
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

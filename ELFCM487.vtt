Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.259
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.310
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.349
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series on British Divisions.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.439
In case you haven’t listened to them yet, part one was on Scotland’s 1,000-year

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.450
rivalry with England, part two was on the North-South divide, and in part

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.500
three we are going to be tackling the huge subject of The Wars Of The Roses.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.920
I feel like I should give you a bit of a warning before we start this one.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.449
It is complicated, there are lots of different characters, and it is about a period of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.089
English history from the 15th century, so it is completely on the other end of the scale

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.960
from an easy YouTube video where someone teaches their favourite idioms about the weather.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.590
It is not easy, but it is fascinating.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.670
It was said to be a large inspiration for the author of Game Of Thrones, and involves

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.380
princes and princesses jostling for power, marriages of love, marriages of convenience,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.720
powerful men, powerful women, evil uncles, mental breakdowns, murders, executions,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.680
the French, treason, and a battle in which 3% of all men in England were slaughtered.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.399
So, if you are ready for all of that, let’s get started and talk about The Wars Of The Roses.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.739
9 month old babies are not capable of doing very much.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.979
They can probably sit up, crawl around, perhaps take a few

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.649
steps on their own, smile and make unintelligible noises.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.940
They are cute but utterly incapable of looking after themselves.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.300
But on the 31st of August 1422, a 9-month-old baby called Henry was

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:11.990
given more responsibility than any 9-month-old should ever be given.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.310
After the death of his father, he was made not only King of England but also King of France.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:28.329
Of course, he wasn’t expected to actually rule as a baby; a group of powerful nobles

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
was appointed to rule on his behalf until he was old enough to rule for himself.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.019
But this sequence of events would put into motion a series of wars and battles for the crown

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:50.588
that would last for 30 years, from 1455 to 1485, and fundamentally reshape the British monarchy.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:57.848
In fact, the seeds had already been sown for this dispute many years before Henry’s birth.

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:06.008
In 1377, the powerful and popular English king, King Edward III, died.

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:12.378
Although he had shown remarkable foresight in planning his succession, having

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:18.878
had 12 children, nine of whom survived to adulthood, his death would result in

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:23.868
one of the messiest and most protracted inheritance fights in British history.

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:32.278
His firstborn son and heir, Edward “The Black Prince”, died a year before he

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:40.668
did, so the crown passed directly to his son and Edward III’s grandson, Richard,

00:03:41.148 --> 00:03:46.368
who was then only a 10-year-old boy but would later become King Richard II.

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:53.288
Richard was guided by his uncle, but as he grew older and more mature,

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:59.578
he sought to assert his own authority and make his own decisions as king.

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:05.918
The problem was that there was now an increasing number of claimants to the English

00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:12.034
throne, people who said that they were more directly related to the deceased Edward III.

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:22.938
One of these was Richard II’s cousin, Henry, and indeed in 1399, after raising an army and marching

00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:30.761
against Richard II, Henry proved victorious and declared himself king, becoming King Henry IV.

00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:36.328
This king Henry had a son, Henry, who became Henry V, and

00:04:36.348 --> 00:04:40.508
he had a son who was called, you’ve guessed it, Henry too.

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:47.238
And it was this Henry who was the 9-month-old baby king, King Henry VI.

00:04:48.198 --> 00:04:53.448
Now, I know we are only a few minutes in and we’ve already had a lot of

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:57.928
names here, and perhaps you’re thinking it’s already impossible to follow.

00:04:59.118 --> 00:04:59.788
Fear not.

00:05:00.118 --> 00:05:04.068
There are a lot of characters and different factions, but the important

00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:08.988
thing to remember is that it can all be traced back to Edward III, with

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:13.558
his eight sons and five daughters, most of whom have multiple children.

00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:19.408
One son in particular will play an important role in our story today, and

00:05:19.628 --> 00:05:25.948
that’s his fourth son, John of Gaunt, who had a grand total of 14 children.

00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:33.958
John of Gaunt was called the Duke of Lancaster, and his descendants will all form part

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:38.918
of the House of Lancaster, which is going to be one side of The Wars Of The Roses.

00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:44.598
Don’t worry so much about all of the names, but the point to underline is that, as

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:50.438
you can see, there is this vastly complicated web of claims to the English throne.

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:55.428
This is the environment into which Henry VI is thrust

00:05:55.658 --> 00:05:58.868
when he is crowned king at the age of 9 months.

00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:05.718
To further complicate the situation, as he grows into a man and takes on the

00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:12.878
responsibilities of a king, Henry VI does not turn into a strong and decisive leader.

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:19.018
He never had a role model of what a king should look like, as his father died

00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:24.028
when he was a baby, so he could only listen to stories and learn from books.

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:29.380
He was surrounded by a clique, a powerful group of people at court, and

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.450
both at home and abroad, things were not going well for the country.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.400
England had lost territory in France, there had been a

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.180
peasant rebellion, things seemed to be falling apart.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.840
Some English nobles felt that the king was surrounded by poor advisors, that he was being pushed

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.280
around, and that he was incapable of providing the strong leadership that the country needed.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.550
One man, in particular, took matters into his own hands.

00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:09.520
Henry’s cousin, Richard Duke of York, believed that the situation was serious enough to take action.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.170
In 1453 the Duke of York got his chance after the king had a complete mental breakdown.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.060
We are in the 15th century here, so there is no sort of advanced psychological

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.210
diagnosis, but clearly, he was mentally incapacitated in a serious way.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:37.010
He was completely unresponsive for almost a year and a half, unable to say or do anything.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.120
Given the king’s condition, a protector was needed, someone who

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.990
could act in the country’s best interest while the king recovered.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.850
And Richard, Duke of York, was elected protector.

00:07:51.734 --> 00:07:57.318
As soon as he took power, he wasted no time in getting rid of the people he believed

00:07:57.318 --> 00:08:02.738
were a bad influence on the king, and reversing some of the king’s policy decisions.

00:08:03.638 --> 00:08:10.858
But sometime in early 1455, after a year and a half of being incapacitated, the

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:16.748
king came to his senses and was considered mentally capable enough of ruling again.

00:08:17.938 --> 00:08:21.868
The king’s allies, who had been pushed aside by the Duke

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:25.828
of York, were out for blood, they were seeking revenge.

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:31.458
Most of York’s actions were reversed, and York was furious.

00:08:32.498 --> 00:08:38.938
He marched south and met the royalist forces at St Albans, just outside London.

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:46.402
This was the first time that the two rival sides, the Lancasters and the Yorks,

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:52.738
met in battle, and is widely considered to be the start of the Wars Of The Roses.

00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:58.748
It wasn’t a bloody battle, with as little as 50 people being killed.

00:08:59.388 --> 00:09:03.638
But there were two important developments for the York side.

00:09:04.748 --> 00:09:09.688
Firstly, the leader of the Royalists, of the king’s forces, was killed.

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.898
Secondly, the king, Henry VI was captured.

00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:19.228
But he wasn’t executed or paraded through the streets.

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:23.888
Remember, the stated objective of Richard, Duke of York, was

00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:28.638
only to help the king, to get rid of his unhelpful advisors.

00:09:29.888 --> 00:09:35.878
When the king was located, it was discovered that he had again had some form of mental breakdown.

00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:42.548
So, with the leader of the Royalist forces out of the picture and the king again mentally

00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:48.028
unfit to rule, The Duke of York declared that he would again take on the role of Protector.

00:09:49.078 --> 00:09:52.818
However, according to some historians, the Duke of York’s

00:09:52.818 --> 00:09:56.528
intention all along was to claim the throne for himself.

00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:04.238
He was Henry’s cousin, and by some measures, he had a greater claim to the English throne than

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:11.668
Henry, because he had two grandparents who were children of Edward III, after a marriage of cousins.

00:10:12.948 --> 00:10:18.058
York ruled as Protector for another year, but then Henry recovered

00:10:18.108 --> 00:10:24.538
again, and this time when Henry retook the throne, he and his supporters

00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:30.038
wasted no time in sidelining York, even declaring him a traitor.

00:10:31.338 --> 00:10:36.848
Now, it is here that I need to introduce another character who will play an important

00:10:36.858 --> 00:10:42.438
role on the side of the Lancasters, probably more important even than the King’s.

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:46.638
And this is Margaret of Anjou.

00:10:47.978 --> 00:10:52.428
She was a French princess, and the wife of the weak and

00:10:52.478 --> 00:10:56.168
often mentally incapacitated English King, Henry VI.

00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:02.228
She was an incredibly skilled and clever political operator, and

00:11:02.418 --> 00:11:06.808
she effectively commanded large parts of the Lancaster campaign.

00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:12.878
Her interest in the success of the House of Lancaster was for several reasons.

00:11:13.668 --> 00:11:15.728
Firstly, it was her husband.

00:11:16.438 --> 00:11:22.178
Secondly, she might well be imprisoned or executed if the House of Lancaster was defeated.

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:28.978
And thirdly, probably most importantly, it was on behalf of her son, Edward.

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:35.588
He would only become king if the House of York’s claim was quashed, and

00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:40.278
so as long as the Duke of York was alive, her son’s life was in danger.

00:11:41.338 --> 00:11:46.858
So, here’s the situation: on the one side we have the House of Lancaster,

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:53.148
which is formed of Henry VI, his wife, Margaret of Anjou, their son, Edward,

00:11:53.488 --> 00:11:57.708
and noble families who have professed their support and loyalty to them.

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:04.248
On the other side, there is the House of York, formed of Richard Duke of York, noble

00:12:04.248 --> 00:12:11.198
families loyal to his cause, and importantly, his son, who is confusingly also named Edward.

00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:18.248
And if you’re wondering why they are called the Wars Of The Roses, it is because the House of

00:12:18.248 --> 00:12:26.218
Lancaster was represented by a red rose and the House of York was represented by a white rose.

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:32.628
In the interests of brevity and to not throw too many dates and names

00:12:32.658 --> 00:12:37.768
at you we are going to skip over some of the details, but the next major

00:12:37.768 --> 00:12:41.988
development is another battle in which King Henry is captured again.

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.318
Henry was having another mental breakdown and was taken to the

00:12:47.318 --> 00:12:51.798
Tower of London, where he was to be kept prisoner for his wellbeing.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:57.728
Importantly, parliament then declared that Richard Duke of York would be Lord

00:12:57.728 --> 00:13:04.558
Protector for the duration of Henry’s life, and even more importantly, when Henry

00:13:04.568 --> 00:13:11.458
died the throne would pass to Richard’s son, Edward, rather than Henry’s son.

00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:16.118
Things looked like they were going pretty well for the House of York but

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:22.148
Henry VI’s wife, Margaret of Anjou, wasn’t one to give up without a fight.

00:13:23.198 --> 00:13:28.158
She fled to Scotland, then raised an army and marched south.

00:13:29.098 --> 00:13:33.638
The two opposing forces met at the Battle of Wakefield, in

00:13:33.648 --> 00:13:37.638
Northern England, and Richard, Duke of York, was killed.

00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:45.038
And to give you some sense of the kind of person Margaret of Anjou was, she had Richard of

00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:52.148
York’s head cut off, stuck on a pike, and raised high over the walls of the city of York.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:58.948
Things had looked so good for Richard and the House of York, but now they were very different.

00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:04.638
The only hope for the Yorkists lay with Richard’s son, Edward.

00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:09.978
It turned out that Edward was quite a formidable military

00:14:09.978 --> 00:14:14.518
commander, and he continued to have success after success.

00:14:15.698 --> 00:14:21.008
Noble families who had previously pledged their allegiance to the Lancasters

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:28.688
switched sides and became Yorkists, and it seemed like the tide was turning for good.

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:37.208
And then, on a snowy March Sunday in 1461, the two armies faced off again.

00:14:37.788 --> 00:14:39.278
Lancaster vs.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:41.888
York at the Battle of Towton.

00:14:43.228 --> 00:14:49.588
You might not have heard of this, but it is the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil, with

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:57.798
an estimated 3% of the entire male population of the country losing their lives, some 28,000 men.

00:14:59.178 --> 00:15:03.808
It was incredibly bloody, but the Yorkists won.

00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:10.048
In anticipation of victory, Edward had declared himself

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:13.999
king shortly before the battle, becoming King Edward IV.

00:15:15.118 --> 00:15:17.138
But there was a slight problem.

00:15:18.008 --> 00:15:24.618
Henry VI, from the House of Lancaster, was still alive, and he was also still king.

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:29.228
He was also no longer in the Tower of London, having been

00:15:29.248 --> 00:15:32.798
freed after Margaret of Anjou’s victory at Wakefield.

00:15:33.988 --> 00:15:39.468
And there was another problem, but this one was entirely of Edward’s making.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:44.378
He had married, but he had married for love.

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:49.428
And he didn’t marry another noble princess; he married

00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:52.778
a commoner, a woman called Elizabeth Woodville.

00:15:54.178 --> 00:16:00.678
This upset some of his closest allies, and his closest and most powerful ally, The

00:16:00.698 --> 00:16:06.468
Earl of Warwick, switched sides in protest, and supported the House of Lancaster.

00:16:07.478 --> 00:16:12.838
Warwick marched on London, went to the Tower of London and freed King

00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:17.538
Henry VI, who had in the meantime been captured and imprisoned again,

00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:21.628
and paraded him around the streets of England as the rightful king.

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:29.328
To state the obvious, Edward IV, the other king, was not going to take this sitting down.

00:16:30.588 --> 00:16:35.028
Together with his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, they marched south to London,

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:40.868
and did battle with their old ally, now enemy, the Earl of Warwick, at Barnet.

00:16:42.038 --> 00:16:48.238
Warwick was killed, his forces defeated, Henry VI was captured and sent back to

00:16:48.238 --> 00:16:52.938
the Tower of London, and the ball was back in the court of the House of York.

00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:58.477
But let’s not forget Henry’s wife, Margaret of Anjou.

00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:03.338
At this time she was still in France, trying to raise another army,

00:17:03.798 --> 00:17:07.888
but she rushed back to England to try to join up with her allies.

00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:13.098
The Yorkists rushed to intercept her, and there was a

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.828
decisive battle in the west of the country, at Tewkesbury.

00:17:17.898 --> 00:17:22.278
Decisive because the Lancasters were defeated, decisive because

00:17:22.288 --> 00:17:26.928
Margaret was captured and then exiled to France, and decisive because

00:17:26.938 --> 00:17:31.928
Margaret and Henry’s son and heir, Edward, was killed in the battle.

00:17:32.848 --> 00:17:39.358
That evening there was a huge celebration, and the luckless King Henry VI died in

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:44.198
the Tower of London, almost certainly murdered on the orders of King Edward IV.

00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:50.118
You could be forgiven for thinking that this was the end of The Wars Of The Roses, but no.

00:17:51.058 --> 00:17:57.138
Less than a decade later, King Edward IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40.

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:03.858
He had two male heirs, but they were just boys, just 9 and 12.

00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:09.298
Their uncle, Edward’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester, became their

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:13.088
guardian, and sent them to the Tower of London for their wellbeing.

00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:20.268
After all, they were the sole heirs, and there were plenty of other noble young men with

00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:25.728
claims that they could trace back to Edward III, where this gigantic mess all started.

00:18:27.068 --> 00:18:30.988
But it turned out that the threat was closer to home.

00:18:32.468 --> 00:18:38.258
Remember that Edward IV had upset his old ally, Warwick, by marrying a commoner?

00:18:39.678 --> 00:18:43.428
Edward IV’s brother, the prince’s uncle, the Duke of Gloucester,

00:18:44.008 --> 00:18:48.348
took this as his opportunity to seize the throne for himself.

00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:56.108
He publicly declared that his brother’s, the king’s, marriage to his commoner wife was

00:18:56.108 --> 00:19:02.248
illegal, and therefore his nephews, the two princes in the tower, were illegitimate.

00:19:03.138 --> 00:19:05.388
So who was the rightful king?

00:19:06.238 --> 00:19:10.998
He was, of course, the Duke of Gloucester became Richard III of England.

00:19:12.268 --> 00:19:14.658
And what of the two princes in the Tower?

00:19:15.638 --> 00:19:19.548
Nothing more is known about them, and it is thought that the

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:23.458
unfortunate young boys were murdered on the orders of their uncle.

00:19:24.888 --> 00:19:31.028
He might finally have had the crown on his head, but Richard III was not a popular king,

00:19:31.678 --> 00:19:38.758
and what’s more, the House of York of which he formed a part was very short on male heirs.

00:19:39.688 --> 00:19:46.468
The princes had disappeared, and Richard III had no surviving male heirs of his own.

00:19:47.408 --> 00:19:54.928
The House of Lancaster was similarly sparse, lacking in potential male heirs, but there was one.

00:19:56.408 --> 00:20:02.118
His name was Henry Tudor, and he had spent most of his young adult years

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:07.358
living in exile in France, out of the way of the ruling York dynasty.

00:20:08.268 --> 00:20:14.008
But he sensed his opportunity to return to England and take what he saw as rightfully

00:20:14.008 --> 00:20:20.298
his, or at least what was as much his as it was Richard III’s: the English crown.

00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:29.218
In 1485, a good 30 years after the first battle and more than 100 years after

00:20:29.218 --> 00:20:34.668
the death of Edward III, Henry Tudor landed in England and raised an army.

00:20:35.408 --> 00:20:40.518
He was supported by French, Welsh and Scottish forces, and he met

00:20:40.688 --> 00:20:45.508
Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, on the 22nd of August.

00:20:46.718 --> 00:20:51.928
It was a resounding victory for Henry and the House of Lancaster, and

00:20:52.268 --> 00:20:57.468
his opponent and rival for the throne, King Richard III, was killed,

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:01.118
becoming the last English king to be killed on the battlefield.

00:21:02.238 --> 00:21:07.217
Henry Tudor became Henry VII, king of England, ending this monumental

00:21:07.237 --> 00:21:11.467
conflict that had plagued the country for most of the 15th century.

00:21:12.957 --> 00:21:16.827
And if you are wondering where this all fits into British history that

00:21:16.827 --> 00:21:21.807
you might be more familiar with, Henry Tudor started the period we know

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:28.027
as The Tudors and the son of Henry VII was, surprise surprise, Henry VIII.

00:21:29.537 --> 00:21:34.467
So, there you have it, a very much whistlestop tour through this fascinating

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:39.877
period of English history full of twists and turns, rivalries, betrayals and more.

00:21:40.547 --> 00:21:43.297
If you have managed to keep up with the story, I take

00:21:43.297 --> 00:21:46.377
my hat off to you, as it is a complicated one indeed.

00:21:46.877 --> 00:21:50.987
But it is fascinating, with drama to rival any Hollywood movie.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.997
If you are a Game of Thrones fan, I’m sure you will agree

00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:59.917
that sometimes true life is just as exciting as fiction.

00:22:02.297 --> 00:22:06.557
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Wars Of The Roses.

00:22:06.897 --> 00:22:11.217
I hope it was a fun one, and that you managed to follow along with the general gist of the story.

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:15.667
If you like this sort of thing, I would certainly recommend exploring the story

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:20.107
in further detail, as we have only had the chance to do a bit of a superficial

00:22:20.137 --> 00:22:24.967
overview, and it will probably not surprise you to find out that there are amazing

00:22:24.977 --> 00:22:30.417
books and wonderful documentaries that go into the entire thing in much more detail.

00:22:31.647 --> 00:22:36.057
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

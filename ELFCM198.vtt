Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.740
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.060
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.240
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Pirates.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.590
Now, we all know something about pirates.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.880
As a child, we learn about pirates at school, we dress up as pirates,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.790
countless books, films and TV series have been made about the lives of pirates.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.340
But in this episode we are going to go a little deeper.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.090
We’ll talk about the different types of pirates, who actually were these pirates, why did

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.400
they become pirates, what was life as a pirate actually like, what was it like to be attacked

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.510
by pirates, why pirates were the early masters of the power of image, what happened to a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.900
pirate when he was caught, and why pirates don’t exist, at least in the same form, today.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.760
And, of course, we will learn all about this through the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.270
stories of some of the most famous pirates in history.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.510
I should say that this episode comes hot off the heels of episode number 197, our members-only

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.290
episode that came out on Tuesday, and was on Highwaymen, the men and occasionally women

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.930
who would stop you on the road, point a gun in your face, and relieve you of your money.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.670
So, that episode was on one of the most famous types of land-robber,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.970
and today, we’re covering the most famous type of sea-robber.

00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:53.440
OK then, pirates.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.980
When you hear the term pirate, a certain image might spring to mind.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.900
For many, it will be a man with a hat, long dark hair, perhaps an earring, a parrot

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.010
on his shoulder, he might be carrying a sword and a pistol, maybe he is holding

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.330
a bottle of rum, and he’s probably wearing some extravagant, colourful clothes.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.230
Perhaps he has a wooden leg, or even a hook instead of one of his hands.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.780
These images, although there are elements of truth to them, mainly come from the books

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.640
and films that have chronicled the lives of pirates, from authors and directors who

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.430
have created pirate characters, and fabulous stories about a particular type of pirate.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.810
And that is the pirate from the Golden Age of Piracy, a period which lasted from

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.430
the mid 17th century to the early 18th century, a period of around 70 years.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.130
While this period will be the focus of today’s episode,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.060
these pirates are far from the only type of pirates.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.650
Indeed, for as long as there have been ships with goods

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.630
to steal, there have been pirates in some shape or form.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.170
Going back all the way to Ancient Egypt, there were reports of something called the “Sea Peoples”,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.810
a group of people who lived in the Mediterranean and attacked Ancient Egyptian boats and cities.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.670
Essentially, pirates.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.980
And the Middle Ages saw the arrival of a people from Scandinavia we don’t normally

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.380
refer to as pirates, but who certainly weren’t much different from pirates: The Vikings.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.240
And it is of course not just a European phenomenon - piracy in different shapes and forms has

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.730
existed all over the world, ever since ships have sailed, people have sought to steal their goods.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.510
But no period in history is more famous for pirates than the period

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.650
between 1650 and 1720, otherwise known as The Golden Age of Piracy.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.810
It was during this period that piracy boomed, that it became a real problem for maritime

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.350
trade, and from which most of the popular conception of who pirates were originated.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.230
So, why was there a boom in piracy in the mid 17th century?

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.550
Well, there are several reasons, both on the supply and the demand side.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.010
For piracy to be attractive, pirates need ships to steal from.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.250
The Age of Discovery had started a couple of centuries before.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.680
By the mid-17th century, European powers had established trade

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.170
routes between Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and North America.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.070
Much of this was, as you will know, the grisly and heinous business of slave trading.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.940
Ships would sail from Europe south to west Africa, where

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.220
they would exchange weapons and machinery for human beings.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.260
These poor people would be packed into ships and sent to the Caribbean and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.430
North America, where they would be sold as slaves, to work in plantations.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.440
In exchange for the slaves, the ships would receive goods like tobacco, coffee, sugar, and rum.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.030
They would then return to Europe filled with these riches, that they would sell to European traders.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.820
In order to cut costs and increase profits, these ships would typically

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.480
have very few sailors on them, normally around 20 men on a ship.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.320
So, the Caribbean, the North Atlantic and the waters off West Africa contained an

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.310
increasing amount of ships filled with valuable goods and not many men to guard them.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.760
An attractive proposition for a potential pirate.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.890
Back in Europe, the 17th and 18th centuries were characterised by

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.970
long and brutal wars, which were increasingly being fought at sea.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.700
Every time one of these wars ended, it resulted in well-trained

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.280
sailors being out of work, and looking for a new job.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.980
Even if they did manage to find a job on one of these merchant ships, one of

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.570
the ships transporting goods, the pay was terrible, and conditions were worse.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.100
There is even one report of more merchant seamen dying on the journey from

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.600
west Africa to the Caribbean than the slaves that the ship was carrying.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.660
In England, more and more small farmers were being pushed off the land, and

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.070
industrialisation was starting to push people towards the cities in search of work.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.570
These conditions were ripe for a boom in piracy.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.970
But this wasn’t a just case of people deciding “well, I’m going to be a pirate now”, and setting

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.670
sail on a pirate ship from London to the Caribbean, which was the centre of pirate activity.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.070
In many cases there was actually a thin line between who was a pirate and who wasn’t.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.660
Indeed, one of the most famous pirates in British History, a man

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.400
called Captain Kidd, protested that he was never actually a pirate,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.720
and he was acting on the orders of the English King, King William III.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:56.960
Kidd was something called a privateer, which one might best describe as a state-sanctioned pirate.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:05.110
This meant that he was given official permission to engage in acts of piracy by the English king.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.470
This was in 1696, when England was fighting in The Nine Years' War against France.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:20.470
Partly in order to raise money, and partly in order to steal from and disrupt the enemy, countries

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:26.550
would give special licenses to ships to attack and steal from ships from certain countries.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.990
Captain Kidd was the leader of one of those ships, so at

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.890
least when he first set sail, he wasn’t an illegal pirate.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.890
He was given specific permission from the king to attack and steal

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.190
from ships from certain countries who were not allies of England.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:51.330
He was provided with a large ship with powerful cannons, and a crew of sailors eager to

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:57.660
go and find merchant ships, because they would all get a proportion of what was stolen.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:05.440
But knowing which ships to attack and which ships not to attack wasn’t always easy.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.550
After having set off from London, Kidd sailed all the way down the Atlantic and

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.710
around the southern tip of Africa without finding a suitable ship to attack.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.670
When they came across a Dutch merchant ship, his crew urged him to

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.090
attack it, despite The Dutch Republic being an ally of England’s at

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.810
the time, and the King of England, William III, being Dutch by birth.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.010
Kidd knew that attacking this ship would have been a very bad move.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:44.270
He refused to attack it, and as a consequence was called a “lousy dog” by one of his crew.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.710
Furious, Kidd took an iron bucket and hit the man over the head with it.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.070
He must have hit him very hard, because the man died of his injuries the following day.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:04.870
Although captains were allowed to use violence to discipline their men, Kidd had gone too far.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.780
He had killed one of his crew, and he risked being put on trial for murder when he returned.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.550
Kidd was becoming increasingly desperate to find a target.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.510
He needed to return with huge riches so that the King would be happy,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.150
and that he would have a better chance of not being charged with murder.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:32.290
A couple of months later he came across a huge Armenian ship called the

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:38.520
Quedagh Merchant, which was carrying vast amounts of silk, textiles, and opium,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.970
treasure that would be valued at tens of millions of euros in today’s money.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.720
Crucially, the ship was flying under French colours.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:56.620
England was at war with France, and so this ship was fair game, it looked like it was ok to attack.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:03.170
But, when Kidd’s sailors boarded the ship, they discovered firstly that the owner

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.690
of the goods was a Mughal lord, and the captain of the ship was an Englishman.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:15.590
The entire trip had also been organised by the East India Company, a British company.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:22.210
Suddenly it wasn’t so clear whether this ship was actually ok to attack.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:29.290
Kidd reportedly tried to return the goods, but his men rebelled, they refused.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.750
Kidd took the treasure, and with it he had completed the transition

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.540
from privateer, or state-sponsored pirate, to real pirate.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.040
As news returned to England, the king was furious.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.320
Kidd was a wanted man, and eventually he was lured, he was tricked into

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.270
returning to New York, whereupon he was arrested, sent back to England, and hung.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.790
As a warning to other and future pirates, Kidd’s body

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.370
was left hanging on the edge of the river Thames.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:12.250
Now, not all pirates took the same route as Kidd, and went from privateer to pirate.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.690
Most skipped the privateer step.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.450
Many would actually come from merchant ships that had been attacked

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.340
by pirates, and they weren’t all forced to become a pirate either.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.900
The life of a pirate, although dangerous and often short, was an attractive one while it lasted.

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:40.580
It was remarkably democratic, compared to normal life back on land but also on a merchant ship.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.470
On a merchant or navy ship, the captain held all the

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.450
power, and conditions were terrible for normal sailors.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.650
On a pirate ship, there was a captain, and a certain hierarchy,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.830
but it wasn’t nearly as strict, and it was a lot more equal.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.730
Stolen goods would be shared between the men, and there were rules for how goods would be shared.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.520
Ordinary pirates would be given one share, and a pirate captain would be entitled

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.220
to two to three times the amount of treasure that an ordinary pirate would.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:26.140
So, when one hears of the bosses of large companies being paid thousands of times more

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.480
than ordinary employees, a pirate ship seems like an incredibly democratic institution.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.450
What’s more, pirates seemed to be far more tolerant of

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.050
people from different backgrounds and of different races.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.630
Pirate crews were made up of people from a multitude of different

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.030
countries, countries that were often fighting each other back in Europe.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:56.760
A pirate called Blackbeard, whose story we’ll hear shortly, had a crew that was 60% black.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.920
They were also meritocratic organisations, if you did a good job as a pirate you would get

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.100
promoted quickly, no matter who you were, where you came from, or what colour skin you were.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.590
So, although they might have been living a life of crime, they lived,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.540
in lots of respects, in a very forward-thinking society, at least one

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.370
that was a lot more tolerant and democratic than “normal society”.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.210
Plus, of course the major attraction of being a pirate was the opportunity to get rich.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:39.160
Their standard pay was pretty low, but each time they successfully managed to attack

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.740
a ship they would typically receive goods that were valued at around a year’s salary.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.930
So, there was of course a large incentive to attack as many ships as possible.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:57.980
And when it came to these pirate attacks, for many people there’s this idea of pirates

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:03.880
being incredibly vicious and aggressive, attacking ships and killing everyone onboard.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.950
But this isn’t actually completely true.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.480
Pirates wanted you to think that they wouldn’t hesitate to kill you if

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:18.580
you resisted, but if you surrendered without a fight they would spare

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:23.340
your life, and perhaps would even invite you to join them as a pirate.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:31.530
Pirates really were early masters of the power of image, of the power of PR - they

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:36.440
knew that what people thought about you was more important than the truth.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.250
If word got out that pirates would kill every sailor on board, then these

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.970
sailors would have fought bravely and aggressively, they would have fought

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.910
to the last breath if they believed that certain death awaited them.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.170
But if they knew that they would escape with their life, and perhaps

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.640
even be able to escape the terrible life of a merchant seaman and become

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.974
a pirate, then they were much more likely to give up without a fight.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.120
The important thing was that people needed to be afraid of pirates, and to

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.100
think that they were so ferocious that it was better not to even challenge them.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:22.235
A master of this was a famous pirate captain called Blackbeard.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.760
His name, of course, wasn’t actually Blackbeard, his name was Edward Teach.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.952
But he was known by everyone as Blackbeard.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.980
He had a huge long beard, which reportedly went up to just below his eyes.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:44.460
He would twist the hair of his beard into little plaits, and when it

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.400
was time to attack a ship he would light matches and stick them in his

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.200
beard and under his hat, so there was smoke coming out from his head.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.680
Above his ship he would fly a flag with a skull and

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.340
crossbones, but also a red heart to indicate death.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.470
He knew that his reputation was far more powerful than his sword.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.940
Ironically perhaps, given his reputation as a fearsome and terrifying

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.250
pirate, there are no verified reports of Blackbeard actually killing anyone.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:28.270
Most often, instead of actually resisting a pirate attack, especially against someone

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:33.630
with the fearsome reputation of Blackbeard, merchant ships would simply surrender.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.163
The pirates were well armed, and there were almost always more pirates than sailors,

00:17:39.163 --> 00:17:45.030
there were normally around 20 sailors on a merchant ship and 80 to 100 pirates.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.210
The pirates had this terrible reputation and were better armed, so in most

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.220
cases the sailors would simply surrender, resulting in pirates actually

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.300
ending up doing significantly less fighting than most people think.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.060
In fact, the most vicious of the pirate battles were almost always

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.510
against the British navy, the official sea forces of the government.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:18.780
And it was in one of these battles, in 1718, that the pirate career of Blackbeard was to be ended.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:24.090
Blackbeard was one of the most wanted pirates in the whole world, and

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:30.025
eventually his ship was found by a British navy lieutenant named Robert Maynard.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.380
A fierce battle ensued, and Blackbeard was killed on deck.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:42.680
In order for Maynard to collect the reward for killing Blackbeard, he needed to prove he was dead.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.920
So, Blackbeard head was chopped off, and hung up from

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.640
one of the masts, the wooden bar that holds the sails.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:19:00.850
His headless body was thrown over the side of the ship, and the legend goes that it swam all the

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:07.270
way around the ship several times looking for its head before sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.530
And Blackbeard’s fate was not unique.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.750
Most pirates, like Blackbeard, were victims of their own success.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.940
The more ships they attacked, the more they drew attention to themselves, the greater problem

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:28.270
they posed to the powers back in Europe, and the more forces were sent to deal with them.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.280
In 1670, there were just two British Royal Navy warships in

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.630
the Caribbean, where most pirate activity was taking place.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:45.830
By 1718 there were 124 warships, and by 1815 there were 214.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:52.700
What’s more, in 1698 Britain had changed the laws around piracy,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:57.360
making it easier for pirates to be put on trial and executed.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.680
Before, they would have to be captured and taken back to England and then tried.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:11.130
After 1698 the pirates could be put on trial anywhere, and executed immediately.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.600
Put simply, it was a lot harder to be a pirate and survive for

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.190
long, and by around 1720, the Golden Age of Piracy was over.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:29.060
Most pirates had been killed, either at sea or were captured and executed back on land.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.470
Some had actually retired from a life of piracy.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.420
Although we think of pirates as living at sea, of course they needed to come to land

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.130
to spend their money, and they often had close relationships with people on land.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:51.340
They had to exchange their stolen goods, and they would need to come ashore to find

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:57.220
ways to spend their money - it’s not much good having a load of gold or silk on

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.400
your pirate ship; you need to exchange that into something you can actually use.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.580
So, for some pirates, they took their riches and essentially

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:13.040
retired, using them to buy pieces of land and live an honest life.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.500
Now, the legacy that pirates have left is...

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.720
vast, and incredibly impressive for such a small group of people.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.220
It’s hard to know exactly, but at its peak historians believe

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.100
that there were around 5,000 pirates roaming the seas.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.990
In the grand scheme of things, this is an absolutely tiny

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.750
group, but one that has fascinated people ever since.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.440
It is, on one level, a completely understandable fascination, both at the time and now.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.640
During The Golden Age of Piracy people would hear or read about pirates,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.740
mysterious people who lived on ships, taking treasure, creating their

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.900
own society, and one that was very different to the one on shore.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.430
Much like the Highwaymen we heard about in the last episode, the life

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.600
of a pirate was alluring, it was attractive, it was interesting, it was

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.290
completely understandable that normal people were so curious about them.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:27.000
Pirate executions, when pirates were caught and publicly killed, might be the first and only

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.480
time that anyone would ever see a pirate, and they were always incredibly popular events.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.140
And even now, we as a society are obsessed with pirates.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.220
We make films about them, we dress up as them, there is even an

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.110
International Talk Like a Pirate Day, which was on September 19th by the way.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:55.340
We have also created this image of a pirate which isn’t completely true, so before

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:01.010
we end let’s bust some of these myths, and confirm some that are partly true.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:08.330
Firstly, no there is no record of real pirates ever having parrots on their shoulders.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.030
This all comes from a book by Robert Louis Stevenson called Treasure Island.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.320
Secondly, there was no real “pirate language”.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:24.760
Most pirates came from Britain, so most would have spoken English, but there wasn’t some secret

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:30.500
pirate language, although there were no doubt a few words or phrases that pirates would have used.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.830
The “pirate language” we think of is actually is a

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.710
form of accent from Cornwall, in south west England.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.540
This accent has come to be associated with pirates only because of a

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.240
comic opera called Pirates of Penzance, written by Gilbert & Sullivan.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.890
Thirdly, did pirates have hooks for hands or wooden legs?

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.340
Actually, yes they probably did.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.360
Losing a hand or leg was quite common not just for a pirate, but for anyone working on a ship.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.800
Pirate ships would often specify how a pirate would be compensated,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.640
how much they would be paid if they lost certain body parts.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:17.500
And there is evidence of pirates having hooks and using wooden

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.460
prosthetics replacing their legs, making at least that one partly true.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.370
And finally, did pirates actually bury their treasure?

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.570
Well, there isn’t much evidence of this.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:36.770
The myth of pirate treasure comes from books such as Treasure Island, and is based

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.930
on the real story of Captain Kidd and the treasure he took from the Quedagh Merchant.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:50.020
While he was in prison, awaiting execution, he wrote a letter to a friend saying that he knew

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:57.840
the location of goods valued at £100,000, which is around 25 million Euros in today’s money.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.870
But, Kidd was a desperate man, and historians believe that

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.580
he had written this in the hope that it might save his life.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:13.080
It didn’t, and this treasure, if indeed it ever existed, has never been found.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.930
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Pirates.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.343
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.250
that you now know a little bit more about pirates than you did 25 minutes ago.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.810
One thing we didn’t talk about in this episode is piracy today.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.550
And you will probably know that pirates aren’t sailing around the Caribbean

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.960
with large black beards, but piracy today is debatably an even bigger

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.820
problem than it was 300 years ago, the pirates have just changed location.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:54.340
Luckily we did an episode on Modern Pirates, it is episode number 78, so if

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.030
you want to learn more about that, then I’d recommend giving that one a listen.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.280

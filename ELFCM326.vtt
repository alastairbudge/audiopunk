Hello, hello hello, and welcome
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.830
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.030
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.430
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.960
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are
going to be talking about an app that is

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.830
installed on one in four phones across
the world, an app that has caught the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.710
attention of presidents, and an app
that 10 years ago didn't even exist.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.310
The app is, of course, TikTok.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.140
Now, unless you have been
living under a rock, you will

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.880
probably have heard of TikTok.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.770
It’s an incredibly popular
app that has gone from nothing

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.870
to almost two billion users.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.310
Maybe you’re one of
them, maybe you’re not.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.360
In either case, the story of the
growth of TikTok is fascinating.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.310
So in this episode we’ll look at where
it came from, how it exploded, why it is

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.739
so popular, not just from an emotional
point of view but also the technology

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:13.450
that makes this possible, and look at
how this one app took over the world.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.629
Let’s get right into it.

00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:18.377
We're looking at TikTok.

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:22.097
We may be banning TikTok, we
may be doing some other things.

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:25.097
There are a couple of options,
but a lot of things are happening,

00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:26.327
so we'll see what happens.

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:31.097
But we are looking at a lot of
alternatives with respect to TikTok.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.213
That was former president
Donald Trump in July of 2020.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.860
Sure, it might not have been the most
eloquent of speeches, but the point is

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.250
that the President of the United States
publicly announced that he was looking

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.900
at banning TikTok, an app that started
out as a way for teenage girls to record

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.140
themselves singing along to music.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.940
So, the big question we’ll
look at today is…why?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.330
Now, the first point to address is one
that might sound like a simple question.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.010
What is TikTok?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.280
Is it a social network?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.470
Is it a social media app?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.240
Is it a video sharing platform?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.010
Is it an entertainment service?

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.390
It’s a hard one to put a label
on, but it’s a bit of everything.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.550
Let me quickly explain how it works
from a superficial level, just in

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.170
case you are not a TikTok user.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.680
When you open the TikTok app, you are
immediately presented with a short

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.320
video created by another TikTok user.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560
The video starts playing right away.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.640
You can do nothing, and the video will
keep playing, and then play again when

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.410
it gets to the end, you can swipe up,
to be shown a new video, you can “like”

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.030
the video by pressing a heart button,
you can comment on it, you can share

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.260
it, you can bookmark it, etcetera.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.890
On the surface of it, simple,
you might be thinking.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.460
Based on this description alone,
it sounds a little like YouTube

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.580
or any other video sharing app.

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:15.750
But as we’ll come to discuss shortly,
this design has important consequences,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.820
and is a big part of why TikTok has
experienced such explosive growth.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.240
And when it comes to this explosive
growth Tik Tok has grown faster

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.340
than any other app in history.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.260
You might have heard that TikTok is
a Chinese app, but it is actually an

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.340
interesting mix of Chinese and American,
or at least apps that built off success

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.750
both in China and in the United States.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.000
So, a brief history.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.000
The origin of TikTok is an app called
Musical.ly, which was built by two

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.560
Chinese friends in Shanghai back in 2014.

00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:02.239
It was an app that allowed people to
create and share short lip-synching

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.157
videos, videos where people pretended to
sing songs at the same time as the music.

00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:14.427
But, Musical.ly never really
took off in China, it was never a

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:16.467
great success in its home market.

00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:22.657
Instead, it found early traction,
initial success, across the

00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:24.407
Pacific in the United States.

00:04:25.257 --> 00:04:31.107
And specifically, with a market of
teenage girls, who absolutely loved it.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:37.977
Teenage girls might love to lip-synch,
to dance and pretend to sing along

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:42.917
with pop songs, but it’s not everyone’s
cup of tea, and there are only so

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:44.647
many teenage girls in the world.

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:49.467
In any case, Musical.ly
was clearly onto something.

00:04:50.617 --> 00:04:56.497
Back in China, a Beijing-based technology
company called ByteDance, was developing

00:04:56.547 --> 00:05:01.377
its own video-sharing app that was
heavily inspired by, some might even

00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:04.077
say directly copied from, Musical.ly.

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:10.757
In September of 2016, it launched
an app called Douyin, which was

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:12.837
available exclusively in China.

00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:20.387
Within a year, it had 100 million
users, and was racking up one billion

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:23.707
views of its videos every single day.

00:05:24.747 --> 00:05:29.827
Clearly, it was onto something big,
and so it launched an international

00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:33.717
version of the app, which was
made available outside China.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:37.057
This app was, of course, TikTok.

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:43.697
Now, Douyin and TikTok are very
similar, but not exactly the same.

00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:50.627
They look very similar if you just
open the app, but Douyin has some more

00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:55.737
advanced features, such as the ability
to buy things directly within the app.

00:05:56.947 --> 00:06:02.297
Anyway, both apps were growing
fast - Douyin within China,

00:06:02.497 --> 00:06:04.187
and TikTok internationally.

00:06:05.637 --> 00:06:12.657
To accelerate its international growth,
in 2017 ByteDance bought Musical.ly,

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:16.597
this app that was super-successful
in the United States with this

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:19.107
niche audience of teenage girls.

00:06:20.557 --> 00:06:26.437
The price tag was a reported billion
dollars - a lot of money, but it would

00:06:26.437 --> 00:06:28.447
turn out to be quite the bargain.

00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:37.387
In 2018 the acquisition was complete, and
Musical.ly merged with TikTok, becoming

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:43.447
one joint app, with the copied app buying
the original version it was copied from.

00:06:44.997 --> 00:06:49.967
Over the next few years, TikTok
began to advertise heavily in the

00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:54.877
United States, spending by some
estimates hundreds of millions of

00:06:54.877 --> 00:06:59.457
dollars a month on advertising,
trying to hook new users on the app.

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:05.747
Companies like Facebook and Snapchat were
all too happy to accept TikTok’s money.

00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:10.827
They were getting paid handsomely,
and besides, it didn’t seem like a

00:07:10.827 --> 00:07:15.772
threat - a Chinese app had never had
any real success in the United States.

00:07:16.073 --> 00:07:21.237
American culture is unique, it’s not
something a foreign app can easily

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:26.677
crack, especially an app from a culture
as different to the US’s as China’s.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:31.767
But there was something that these
American technology companies

00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:36.772
hadn’t understood properly, or at
least hadn’t properly appreciated.

00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:39.962
Tiktok was different.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:45.199
It didn’t rely on cultural relevance
or understanding, it worked

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.319
in a completely different way.

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:54.019
And this brings us back to what I hinted
at earlier, in terms of the design of

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:56.949
the app, how TikTok works on the surface.

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.379
When you think of the other social media
apps you might use, think Instagram,

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:09.989
Facebook, Snapchat, or Twitter, they
typically work on a “social graph” basis.

00:08:11.402 --> 00:08:14.962
Going back to the early days of
Facebook, you would be friends with

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:19.462
people, Facebook would understand that
you had a relationship with them, and

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:22.272
show you their photos and updates.

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:27.632
As these products grew and
became more advanced, more

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.634
complexity was added to this.

00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:34.114
You could follow pages of businesses,
you could express your interests,

00:08:34.384 --> 00:08:39.374
Facebook would see who you sent messages
to, it bought Instagram, and so on.

00:08:40.404 --> 00:08:45.074
Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat all
worked in slightly different ways,

00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:49.844
but the principle was the same:
you create an account, you create

00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:54.914
connections between people, and you
see the content that these people post.

00:08:56.024 --> 00:08:59.664
But the problem here is that
this isn’t always what people

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:01.314
want to see and engage with.

00:09:01.994 --> 00:09:06.434
You might be Facebook friends with someone
you went to university with 15 years ago,

00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:12.554
or even school 60 years ago, but are you
interested in what they are doing now?

00:09:13.564 --> 00:09:18.044
You might have chosen to follow someone
on Instagram or Twitter because you’re

00:09:18.044 --> 00:09:22.664
interested in their tips about making
cookies, but do you want to hear

00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:24.444
their opinion about the World Cup?

00:09:25.244 --> 00:09:28.534
Sometimes, but often the answer is “no”.

00:09:29.624 --> 00:09:34.884
TikTok completely bypassed this,
it avoided the question of forming

00:09:34.984 --> 00:09:38.304
cross-directional relationships
between people altogether.

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:43.974
Yes, you can follow people on TikTok,
in the same way as you can on other

00:09:43.974 --> 00:09:49.834
social networks, but TikTok’s focus is
on serving you videos that it thinks you

00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:52.404
will like, regardless of who made them.

00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:57.714
It’s the quality of the content
that matters, not your relationship

00:09:57.874 --> 00:09:59.394
with the person who created it.

00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:05.544
That’s why, when you open the TikTok
app, it opens on a page called “For

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:10.344
you”, which could be any kind of video
that the app thinks you will enjoy.

00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:14.224
And how does it decide
what you will enjoy?

00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:16.684
Well, here’s the clever part.

00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:22.804
On a very superficial level, you can
say it’s “the algorithm”, the computer

00:10:22.824 --> 00:10:26.174
code that decides what you like
based on what you have liked before.

00:10:26.804 --> 00:10:31.254
But let’s go several levels deeper,
because it’s not just a case of there

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:35.425
being an extremely smart set of computer
code sitting on a server somewhere.

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:38.115
We need to talk about two things.

00:10:39.253 --> 00:10:43.269
First, the design of the
TikTok app, and how this is

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:45.403
different to other social apps.

00:10:46.283 --> 00:10:52.087
Remember, you only ever see one video
per screen, so the TikTok algorithm can

00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:56.567
get a sense of your thoughts about that
video based on the actions you take.

00:10:57.437 --> 00:11:01.277
Do you swipe up right away
to move onto another video?

00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:04.657
OK, that indicates it wasn’t interesting.

00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:06.717
Did you watch it all?

00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:08.797
Good, that’s a promising start.

00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:12.687
Did you watch it all and
then tap the heart button?

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:14.767
Better, you probably like it

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:19.287
Did you watch it all several times,
tap the heart button, follow the

00:11:19.287 --> 00:11:23.387
person who made it, then send it to
lots of people and save the video?

00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:27.527
Boom, I think we’re in business,
you clearly like this a lot.

00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:34.017
When you contrast this to the information
that an app like Facebook or Twitter gets,

00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:38.987
where there are often multiple pieces
of content on the screen, Facebook and

00:11:38.987 --> 00:11:43.507
Twitter have more difficulty figuring out
what you actually think about something.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:49.037
If you scrolled past something,
did you just miss it, or were

00:11:49.037 --> 00:11:50.147
you not interested in it?

00:11:50.687 --> 00:11:54.437
If you stopped scrolling, which
piece of content were you looking at?

00:11:54.807 --> 00:11:58.837
Did you stop because you agreed or
disagreed with that piece of content?

00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:05.217
See, the entire design of TikTok makes
it far easier for the algorithm to

00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:07.577
figure out what you like and don’t like.

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:13.480
And when it comes to the actual
content on TikTok, the videos that

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.890
users make, the TikTok algorithm is
very good at recognising what is in a

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:24.409
video, recognising people and objects
and general “stuff” that's going on.

00:12:25.525 --> 00:12:26.635
But that’s not all.

00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:32.072
This is combined with a team of people
who are going through the videos and

00:12:32.232 --> 00:12:37.722
manually checking and assigning tags
and categories to each video, so that

00:12:37.722 --> 00:12:43.353
when  the algorithm sees the actions
people take on these videos, all that

00:12:43.393 --> 00:12:49.023
information is stored and can be used to
make better recommendations in the future.

00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:53.804
Now to the second reason that this
TikTok recommendation algorithm

00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:56.033
is so good at recommending videos.

00:12:56.863 --> 00:13:01.593
Like every other social network,
TikTok’s algorithm relies heavily on

00:13:01.713 --> 00:13:06.323
machine learning, where an algorithm
is trained on large amounts of data.

00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:11.743
The more input data it has to
train on, the better the output,

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:13.633
the better the recommendation.

00:13:14.703 --> 00:13:19.983
And this brings us back to the early
history of TikTok, and to Musical.ly,

00:13:20.153 --> 00:13:24.633
which was, you’ll remember, the
Chinese app that was very popular in

00:13:24.633 --> 00:13:26.343
the United States with teenage girls.

00:13:27.843 --> 00:13:32.923
When Musical.ly and Tiktok merged,
Tiktok got access to billions of

00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:37.333
hours of content that it could use
to train and improve its algorithm.

00:13:38.273 --> 00:13:40.673
This gave it a huge head start.

00:13:41.593 --> 00:13:46.783
And as more and more content is created
on TikTok the better its recommendation

00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:50.973
algorithm gets, the more time people
spend on it, the more videos are

00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:55.813
created, which in turn improves the
recommendation algorithm, and so on..

00:13:57.033 --> 00:14:01.153
Which brings us back to President
Trump at the start of the episode.

00:14:02.213 --> 00:14:09.613
By 2020, TikTok had more than 800 million
users outside of China, and was drawing

00:14:09.613 --> 00:14:11.783
the attention of American politicians.

00:14:12.803 --> 00:14:17.813
The advertising, reportedly more
than a billion dollars a year, was

00:14:17.813 --> 00:14:22.603
working, and the app was adding
millions of new users every single day.

00:14:23.553 --> 00:14:28.953
Now, why was this problematic, why did
it warrant President Trump proclaiming

00:14:28.953 --> 00:14:31.623
that he was looking at banning the app?

00:14:32.763 --> 00:14:34.273
Well, a few reasons.

00:14:35.113 --> 00:14:41.393
Firstly, TikTok’s parent company,
ByteDance, was Chinese, and–like

00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:46.063
any large Chinese company–had close
ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:52.705
TikTok is technically an American
company, with data on its American

00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:58.938
users stored in the US, not in China,
but it was a perceived security threat.

00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:03.668
There was the worry of what TikTok
would do if it was asked by its

00:15:03.678 --> 00:15:08.038
parent company, and ultimately
asked by the Chinese government, to

00:15:08.038 --> 00:15:12.318
share personal data on its American
users with the Chinese government.

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:17.652
As you’ve heard, the more you use
TikTok, the better it knows you, and

00:15:17.652 --> 00:15:22.662
so there were security concerns about
how this personal data could be used.

00:15:23.802 --> 00:15:28.472
Secondly, it was one thing to have a
company like Facebook, now of course

00:15:28.712 --> 00:15:32.802
“Meta”, but one thing to have an
American company like Facebook or

00:15:32.802 --> 00:15:38.132
Google be powerful and influential,
but to have hundreds of millions of

00:15:38.132 --> 00:15:44.022
Americans opening up a Chinese-made app
every day, in an era of increased trade

00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:47.062
protectionism, well that was a first.

00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:52.742
Thirdly, there were concerns about the
impact that TikTok was having on American

00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:55.172
culture, and society more widely.

00:15:56.362 --> 00:16:01.532
US TikTok users are now spending an
average of 80 minutes a day on the app,

00:16:01.942 --> 00:16:07.992
more than Facebook and Instagram combined,
primarily watching videos recommended

00:16:08.062 --> 00:16:10.422
by an algorithm developed in Beijing.

00:16:11.462 --> 00:16:13.352
Now, what’s wrong with this?

00:16:13.892 --> 00:16:18.882
Perhaps, nothing, it's simply a very
efficient algorithm and provides

00:16:18.892 --> 00:16:23.452
users with relevant and personalised
recommendations on the best content

00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:25.432
for them at any particular time.

00:16:26.812 --> 00:16:30.562
But sceptics have highlighted
the potential for this to be

00:16:30.562 --> 00:16:33.102
used in non-innocent ways.

00:16:34.132 --> 00:16:38.752
For example, if you wanted to reduce
the amount of educational content

00:16:38.892 --> 00:16:44.042
that was available to US teenagers and
increase the amount of socially divisive

00:16:44.082 --> 00:16:49.242
content, well, that can be done with a
tweak, a small change, of the algorithm.

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:56.459
And the dangers of excessive social
media use by teenagers is well-known.

00:16:57.414 --> 00:17:02.444
In China, children under the
age of 14 are restricted from

00:17:02.444 --> 00:17:06.984
spending more than 40 minutes a
day on Douyin, the Chinese TikTok.

00:17:08.064 --> 00:17:13.654
Outside China, there is no such limit,
with many teenagers spending most

00:17:13.694 --> 00:17:16.074
of their day sucked into the app.

00:17:17.254 --> 00:17:23.514
So, the sceptics ask, why is this
app limited in China, but promoted so

00:17:23.514 --> 00:17:25.994
heavily and without any limits abroad?

00:17:26.994 --> 00:17:31.074
And it’s this that is perhaps
most alarming, this almost

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:35.744
science-fiction like power of an
app to shape culture and society.

00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:41.874
Now, it should be said that TikTok
of course is not banned, and since

00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:46.184
Trump spoke about potentially banning
it, it has gone from strength to

00:17:46.184 --> 00:17:50.324
strength, not just in the United
States but all over the world.

00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:56.444
There are almost a billion international
TikTok users, and the app has experienced

00:17:56.454 --> 00:18:01.044
huge success in places with very
little cultural similarities to China.

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:05.384
In the Middle East, for example,
TikTok is hugely popular.

00:18:05.754 --> 00:18:10.774
It’s popular in Indonesia, Brazil,
France, Iceland, all over the world.

00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:15.904
And this is the beauty, you could
say, of the way in which the

00:18:15.914 --> 00:18:17.654
recommendation algorithm works.

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:22.724
It surpasses, it jumps over
cultural norms and traditions.

00:18:23.474 --> 00:18:28.204
All that matters is what
you, as a TikTok user, like.

00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:34.564
If you use TikTok, you’ll probably know
all too well that the algorithm has an

00:18:34.564 --> 00:18:39.324
incredible way of showing you videos
that you like, no matter your interests.

00:18:40.434 --> 00:18:46.834
If you like fish, “fishtok” has 17
billion views, medieval role playing

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:51.874
videos have 4 billion views, and you
may well have seen that there is no

00:18:51.874 --> 00:18:57.184
shortage of English teachers dancing
around and teaching you idioms or telling

00:18:57.184 --> 00:18:59.504
you you need to stop saying “I’m fine”.

00:19:00.294 --> 00:19:04.404
By the way, I think it’s absolutely
fine to say “I’m fine”, but of course

00:19:04.504 --> 00:19:08.004
it’s the controversial viewpoints
that get all the attention on TikTok.

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:14.624
Now, another interesting development,
or implication of the way the TikTok

00:19:14.624 --> 00:19:18.714
recommendation algorithm works, is
that it has made it far easier for

00:19:18.714 --> 00:19:23.884
people to find videos even made by
small, relatively unknown people.

00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:30.324
If you compare this to YouTube or
Instagram, for example, previously

00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:34.974
with these apps you would only see
content from people you follow, which

00:19:35.094 --> 00:19:39.504
in many cases would be celebrities
or people with large followings.

00:19:40.544 --> 00:19:46.854
With TikTok, because the algorithm is not
primarily based on friends or followers,

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:52.646
videos can go viral based on merit alone,
based on how entertaining they are,

00:19:53.014 --> 00:19:55.594
which has led to a burst of creativity.

00:19:56.364 --> 00:20:02.374
The TikTok app makes it very easy for
anyone to create funny videos using only

00:20:02.374 --> 00:20:07.354
their phone, so now anyone in the world
has the chance of creating something

00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:11.774
that will be seen by millions of people,
you don’t have to be Kim Kardashian.

00:20:13.084 --> 00:20:17.984
And, of course, the easier it is to
create videos and be seen by millions of

00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:22.324
people, the more people create videos,
and the more people create videos, the

00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:27.174
more input data the algorithm has, the
better it gets, the more people come back

00:20:27.194 --> 00:20:32.444
to TikTok, the more people create videos,
as you can see it is a virtuous circle.

00:20:33.404 --> 00:20:36.437
And all this leads us
back to the present day.

00:20:37.357 --> 00:20:43.464
While Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube were
all too happy to take TikTok’s billions of

00:20:43.474 --> 00:20:48.734
marketing dollars, they have now realised
that TikTok has been eating their lunch.

00:20:49.884 --> 00:20:54.404
Every minute spent on TikTok is a
minute that can’t be spent on another

00:20:54.404 --> 00:21:00.068
social network, and in a business
where eyeballs and time equal money,

00:21:00.531 --> 00:21:06.032
TikTok has gone from a  customer to a
competitor, perhaps even, a predator.

00:21:07.336 --> 00:21:13.246
And what this has led to is an increasing
TikTok-ization of apps like Facebook

00:21:13.246 --> 00:21:18.736
and Instagram, where your friends and
followers are being deprioritised in

00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:21.296
favour of algorithmic recommendations.

00:21:22.176 --> 00:21:26.976
If you’re a user of these apps, you’ll
probably have seen this already, with

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:31.920
“for you” style tabs where you are shown
content that the app thinks you will like.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.280
And, according to most
commentators, this is bound to

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.570
continue because…well, it works.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:46.160
Until TikTok, there was very little
true innovation in social media

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.680
apps, the innovation there was was
usually swiftly copied by others.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.670
“Stories” was first a Snapchat
development, before it was copied

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.660
by Instagram and then Facebook.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.620
Twitter “Spaces” is the same
idea as “Clubhouse”, and there

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.090
are countless other examples.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:10.780
The innovation of TikTok was to completely
flip the “social” element of social

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.780
media on its head, and instead approach
the problem more as “how can we show you

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.450
the most entertaining video right now?”

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.177
As it turns out, it doesn’t matter
who made the video, they could be

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:28.457
your best friend or they could be
someone on the other side of the

00:22:28.457 --> 00:22:30.067
world that you’ve never seen before.

00:22:31.157 --> 00:22:36.527
And this is the real power, you could
say the “equalising” power, of TikTok.

00:22:37.497 --> 00:22:43.497
So, to conclude this exploration into
this hugely influential app, even if

00:22:43.497 --> 00:22:48.877
you never download or install TikTok,
you will experience the effects of

00:22:48.927 --> 00:22:54.727
TikTok on culture, society, and on the
products and services you use, you’ll

00:22:54.737 --> 00:22:59.377
see how TikTok has already changed the
world, and will continue to change it.

00:23:00.627 --> 00:23:05.957
If you look on the TikTok website,
you’ll find the words “ Our mission is

00:23:05.987 --> 00:23:09.057
to inspire creativity and bring joy.”

00:23:10.219 --> 00:23:14.417
Certainly, there is no doubt that
it has inspired a vast amount of

00:23:14.417 --> 00:23:18.797
creativity, and brought joy to
billions of people around the world.

00:23:19.887 --> 00:23:24.377
The question remains though,
about what unforeseen other things

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:26.117
it might have brought with it.

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:32.267
OK then, that is it for
today's episode on TikTok.

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:37.557
I hope it's been an interesting one, and
whether you are an avid TikTok user or

00:23:37.697 --> 00:23:41.437
you’ve never even seen a TikTok, well,
I hope that you've learnt something new.

00:23:42.307 --> 00:23:45.507
As always, I would love to know
what you thought about this episode.

00:23:45.887 --> 00:23:46.957
Do you use TikTok?

00:23:47.337 --> 00:23:51.447
Do you think it’s a harmless and
entertaining app, or it’s something

00:23:51.447 --> 00:23:53.077
a little bit more nefarious?

00:23:53.537 --> 00:23:56.927
How much control do you think
governments should have over

00:23:56.927 --> 00:23:58.537
the apps and services we use?

00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:02.297
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

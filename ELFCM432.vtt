Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.059
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.439
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.709
I'm Alastair Budge, and this episode is going to be released on December 29th, so it’s not

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.610
only the last episode of the year, but it’s also the last episode before New Year’s Eve.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.980
So, to mark this occasion, the subject of today’s episode

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.809
is going to be The Most Unusual New Year's Eve Traditions.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.460
On this fun little journey we’ll come across colourful underwear, dark haired men

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.470
rushing into Scottish houses, falling fridges, grapes, bells and smashing plates.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.230
OK then, The Most Unusual New Year's Eve Traditions.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.140
A few years ago, at about this time of year, I was given what seemed

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.470
to be a strange gift by my father-in-law, by my wife’s father.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.890
It was late December, and he presented me with a pair of red boxer shorts, a pair of red underwear.

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:26.830
It didn’t seem to be ironic, it wasn’t some kind of joke, it was a genuine present.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710
But to me, it seemed strange.

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:37.280
I mean, in the UK giving underwear to your son-in-law, especially bright red

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.400
underwear, would elicit some raised eyebrows, it would be considered rather strange.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.460
I asked my wife about it, and she laughed.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.880
See, my father in law, and my wife for that matter, are Italian, and as the Italians

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.360
among you will know, in Italy giving someone red underwear to wear on New Year’s Eve

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.200
is the done thing, it's something that many people traditionally do on New Year’s Eve.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.880
Now my wife didn’t know exactly where this tradition came from, and there is one theory

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.470
that it can be traced back to Ancient Rome, when soldiers would wear red clothes to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.970
cover up blood in battle, and there’s another that it’s the colour of love and passion.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.670
In any case, if you are in Italy in December and see red underwear for sale in shop

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.040
windows, that’s the reason: people are buying it as gifts to give their loved ones.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.360
Now, to kick off this global exploration of unusual new year’s traditions, we

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.730
are going to start in the UK, but in a particular part of the country: Scotland.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.000
You might know that New Year’s Eve is a particularly big

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.020
deal in Scotland, and it even has its own name: hogmanay.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.650
Now, if you wander around the streets of a Scottish town or city on the evening of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.570
December 31st you could be forgiven for thinking that the main traditions involve

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.250
drinking vast amounts of alcohol and forgetting to wear adequate warm clothing, but there

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.610
are some more traditional activities that you might be interested in learning about.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.260
You might already know about singing Auld Langs Syne, eating haggis and listening

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.120
to the bagpipes, but you might not know about something called the “First footing”.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.770
This is a tradition that dictates that the first person to enter

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.870
the house in the New Year can either bring good luck…or bad luck.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.250
If this person is a man with dark hair, that means the house

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.894
will be blessed with good luck and prosperity in the coming year.

00:03:57.354 --> 00:04:02.294
If this person is a man with light or red hair, or

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:06.354
any woman for that matter, it’s thought to be unlucky.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:15.464
So, in Scotland this “First footing” tradition requires everyone to go out of the house before

00:04:15.494 --> 00:04:22.536
midnight, then a dark-haired man to be the first to enter the house after the clock strikes 12.

00:04:23.988 --> 00:04:28.324
What’s more, this man should bring with him a few objects.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:35.744
First, some coal, which symbolises warmth, then a coin, which symbolises money

00:04:35.744 --> 00:04:41.924
and wealth, and then some food in the form of shortbread, salt, and a black bun.

00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:47.724
And of course, how could I forget, he should also bring a “wee dram” of whiskey.

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:52.564
The tradition is believed to stem from the time of

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:55.744
the invading Vikings in the 8th and 9th centuries.

00:04:56.454 --> 00:05:01.144
The Vikings came from Scandinavia, they often had red or light hair,

00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.674
and they were the sort of people that you definitely didn’t want to

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:08.564
welcome into your home, so you can see where this tradition comes from.

00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:14.594
And if you’re thinking, “ok, I can see the issue with red-haired or blonde men,

00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:20.114
but what’s wrong with all women?”, well, one theory about this is that it’s because

00:05:20.114 --> 00:05:25.614
of an old belief in a crone goddess of winter and death called the Cailleach.

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:34.014
This nasty god who took the form of an old woman would knock on people’s doors and bring

00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:39.964
bad luck to everyone in the house, so the theory about why all women are bad luck, as

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:45.444
far as the “First Footing” tradition is concerned, can be traced back to this goddess.

00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:50.114
Now, let’s move on to talk about a more modern

00:05:50.114 --> 00:05:54.944
tradition, but one that is equally if not more unusual.

00:05:56.464 --> 00:06:00.994
In the unlikely event that you are listening to this episode while walking

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:05.924
around a suburb of Johannesburg, in South Africa, called Hillbrow, I would

00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:11.274
recommend you press pause immediately and seek cover, you get out of the street.

00:06:12.584 --> 00:06:18.014
And this is because one local tradition involves the residents throwing

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:22.594
furniture and appliances out of their windows onto the streets below.

00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:30.594
It might sound strange, but if you walk down the wrong street on New Year’s Eve in Johannesburg,

00:06:31.114 --> 00:06:38.584
there is a very real danger of being squashed by a flying fridge or a stray broken television.

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:45.544
Starting in the 1990s, residents of this particular suburb took to throwing

00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:50.184
unused and unwanted pieces of furniture out of the window on New Year’s

00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:54.844
Eve as a way of symbolically saying “out with the old, in with the new”.

00:06:56.324 --> 00:07:01.734
After all, this was at the time that the racist apartheid regime was abolished, which was

00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:07.374
clearly something to celebrate, but it has developed into a dangerous and problematic tradition.

00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:12.524
It's such a problem, in fact, that the local health services

00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:16.934
have a specially designed ambulance that looks more like a tank.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:24.064
It’s huge, raised high off the ground, with large wheels and armoured covering, so as

00:07:24.064 --> 00:07:28.984
to protect the paramedics from falling fridges and cookers from the tenth floor windows.

00:07:30.214 --> 00:07:33.154
And unfortunately people do get hurt.

00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:42.584
In 2013, an 11-month-old girl was seriously injured after being struck on the head by a brick, and

00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:48.674
a total of nine people had to go to hospital after being hit by things flying from the balconies.

00:07:50.044 --> 00:07:54.840
So, despite the fact that it might have become something of a tradition, it is of course.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.860
very dangerous and illegal, and the police have started to clamp down on it in recent years.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.200
So, who knows, perhaps this year will be the year people decide to

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.990
dispose of their old fridges in a less traditional but safer way.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.780
Now, moving on to our next tradition, this will be one that will be well-known

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.510
to our Spanish and Latin American listeners, and it involves grapes.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.215
Specifically, it involves 12 grapes, and is called "Las

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:32.960
Doce Uvas de la Suerte" or "The Twelve Grapes of Luck."

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.990
In Spain, it is a well-established tradition where people eat one grape

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:43.210
with every chime of the clock at midnight, leading up to the New Year.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:51.180
The idea is to make a wish for each grape consumed, and it's believed that successfully

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:57.020
eating all 12 grapes will bring good luck and prosperity for each month of the coming year.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.580
Of course, this is easier said than done.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.110
There is about 3 seconds between each chime, so you

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.940
need to eat 12 grapes in approximately 36 seconds.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.630
It’s not easy, but one way in which you can make life easier on

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.340
yourself, so I am told, is by taking the skin off the grapes beforehand.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.780
But perhaps that is deeply offensive to people who are able to do it without

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.260
interfering with the grapes beforehand, the 12 grape traditionalists.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:34.070
Now, in terms of where this particular tradition comes from, there are a few theories.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.400
One is that it was started by a winemaker from the Alicante region at

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.110
the start of the 20th century as a cunning trick to sell off certain

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.540
types of extra grapes that they would otherwise have thrown away.

00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:54.391
Another, which experts seem to believe is more probable, is that it dates back

00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:59.231
to the end of the 19th century when the Madrid bourgeoisie copied the French

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:04.581
tradition of drinking champagne at midnight, and eventually normal Spanish people

00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:09.416
started eating grapes as a way of poking fun at the pretentious bourgeoisie.

00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:15.661
Whatever the origins, it is exceptionally popular, and no doubt many

00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:18.851
of you will be popping 12 grapes into your mouth on New Year’s Eve,

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:23.411
hopeful to manage to get them all down before the clock strikes 12.

00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:29.691
And if you are going to try this, good luck, it certainly sounds like a more

00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:33.651
wholesome tradition than the unofficial Scottish whisky-downing traditions.

00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:40.421
Now, moving on, for our next unusual New Year’s tradition we are going to continue with the

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:47.301
theme of numbers, but for this tradition we will go all the way to the east of Asia, to Japan.

00:10:48.812 --> 00:10:52.272
New Year’s Eve in Japan is known as ōmisoka.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:59.980
Much like in countries all around the world, the new year is brought in with the ringing of bells.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:08.590
In Japan, these are temple bells, but instead of ringing 12 times to mark 12 o’ clock,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:16.173
each temple bell rings 108 times as part of a Buddhist ritual called joya no kane.

00:11:17.638 --> 00:11:21.140
Now, where this comes from is also debated.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.190
Some theories suggest that the 108 number represents the cleansing of

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:32.110
108 worldly passions, others that it represents the Japanese divisions

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.180
of the year, or that it represents different kinds of suffering.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.220
Nobody seems to know for sure, but it certainly seems like a safer tradition

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.510
than throwing a fridge out of a window onto an unsuspecting passer by.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:53.430
And as for our final Unusual New Year’s Eve Tradition, we are going to go to a European

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:58.965
country that you might not necessarily think of when you think of smashing plates.

00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:05.685
Greece might be the country that first comes to mind in that respect, but the

00:12:05.685 --> 00:12:09.763
Greek tradition of smashing plates is associated with celebrations and festivities.

00:12:10.015 --> 00:12:17.288
When it comes to New Year's Eve, you are in fact more likely to hear the sound of

00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:23.785
smashing plates on the streets of Copenhagen or Aarhus than in Athens or Thessaloniki.

00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:30.145
In Denmark it is traditional to save up your slightly broken or

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:34.725
chipped plates from that year for New Year’s Eve, then take them to a

00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:38.755
friend’s house and smash them against the front door of their house.

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:44.935
It might make quite the mess, but apparently the bigger the pile of smashed plates you

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:50.005
have outside your door on January 1st, the more luck you will have in the following year.

00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:56.645
And as for the origins of this tradition, yet again it is something

00:12:56.645 --> 00:13:01.195
of a mystery, but it’s thought to symbolise leaving negative energy

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:05.765
and thoughts in a previous year, and starting the new year afresh.

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:09.075
And why do you do it on your friend’s door?

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:14.920
Again, nobody seems to know for sure, but the theory is that smashing plates against a

00:13:14.965 --> 00:13:20.755
door is a way of saying “thanks”, and of wishing that person good luck for the next year.

00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:28.505
So, there we have it, a selection of unusual and unorthodox New Year’s Eve traditions.

00:13:29.035 --> 00:13:33.615
You’ve heard about Italian red underwear, my Italian red underwear that is, why a

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:37.695
man with red hair shouldn’t be the first person through the door in the new year

00:13:37.705 --> 00:13:42.465
in Scotland, why you should make sure you look up in Johannesburg, a trick to

00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:46.915
eat 12 grapes more quickly, the number of times the temple bells ring in Japan,

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:52.605
and why you might find piles of smashed crockery all over Denmark on January 1st.

00:13:53.648 --> 00:13:56.389
IAll that remains for me to say is Happy New Year.

00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:01.845
If you're listening to this before January 1st, I hope you have a wonderful New Year's Eve.

00:14:02.535 --> 00:14:08.275
And if you are listening to this on or after January 1st I hope you celebrated in style,

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:14.615
and my special message for any listeners of the Johannesburg suburb of Hillbrow is

00:14:14.615 --> 00:14:21.039
this: congratulations, you’re alive, I’m glad you managed to avoid the falling fridges.

00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:28.705
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Unusual New Year’s Eve Traditions.

00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:33.017
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that perhaps

00:14:33.037 --> 00:14:36.887
you might have found some inspiration for some traditions you might like to take up.

00:14:37.797 --> 00:14:40.347
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:14:40.687 --> 00:14:43.187
What other traditions would you like to have learned about?

00:14:43.637 --> 00:14:47.487
There were loads more to talk about, but in the interests of time we

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:51.327
had to skip over Brazilian underwear and Ecuadorian effigy burnings.

00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:52.827
So, let me know.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.527

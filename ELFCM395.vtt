Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for  Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.109
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.289
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.339
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a Japanese cult.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.639
On the face of it, it might have seemed like a harmless religious system that

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:36.599
combined Hinduism and Buddhism, with a bit of Christianity thrown in for good measure.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.539
But before long it would transpire that appearances could be deceiving, and

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.669
that it was a deeply dangerous group that would have far-reaching consequences.

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:51.739
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into the

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.612
harrowing but fascinating story of Aum Shinrikyo.

00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:03.309
In the early hours of the morning, on the 6th of July, 2018, the guards

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.699
entered a prison cell in Tokyo Detention House, a large prison in Japan.

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:15.779
In the cell, they found a man with long straggly hair and a wispy beard.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:23.329
They knew the man well; not only was he the country’s highest profile prisoner, but he

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:31.199
had been in police custody since 1995, and had been on death row for the past 14 years.

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:36.479
They politely informed him that he only had hours to live.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.059
He didn’t shout or complain.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.199
Indeed, he had not spoken a word for a decade.

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:50.259
Shortly after they took him to the execution chamber, and fastened a noose around his neck.

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:54.199
The order was given, the trapdoor opened.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:02:01.639
The man dropped through, his life extinguished in an instant as the rope tightened around his neck.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.339
He wasn’t the only person executed that day.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.259
Six others met the same fate, and six more would be executed later that month.

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:14.509
What were their crimes?

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.899
They were all convicted for the same crime.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.009
They were responsible for the deadliest terror attack on Japanese soil in history,

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:31.669
the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, which killed 14 and injured a thousand more.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:37.939
But it was the first man, the man with the wispy beard, the man who had maintained

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.019
his silence for 10 years, who would be more responsible than any of the others.

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:52.269
His name was Shoko Asahara, and he was the founder of Japan’s most deadly cult, Aum Shinrikyo.

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:57.499
A cult always starts with one person, a persuasive,

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.699
charismatic but deluded and often dangerous individual.

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.059
And in the case of Aum Shinrikyo, this individual was Shoko Asahara.

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.389
This wasn’t his birth name; he was born Chizuo Matsumoto, and would

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.099
only change his name when the cult really got into full swing.

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.309
I’ll use both names in this episode, because they represent

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:26.319
different stages in his life, but I am talking about the same person.

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.069
He was born in 1955 to a large family.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.569
He was one of seven children, and his father struggled to

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.179
support his extensive family on his meagre salary as a mat-maker.

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:46.469
One thing that helped his parents financially was that several of their children

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.299
were blind, and so they could be sent to a government-run school for the blind.

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.419
Chizuo Matsumoto wasn’t completely blind, but he was blind in one eye.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.629
This qualified as “legally blind”, so he could be

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:03.959
sent

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:04.979
to this government school.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.699
When he got there, he would be remembered as a terrible bully.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:16.309
He tormented, teased and exploited his fully blind classmates.

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:20.169
He was a big guy, and he used his strength and

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.669
athleticism to completely control the kids at the school.

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:28.639
Not only this, but his teachers would later recall how he seemed

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:32.419
to be able to persuade the other children to do anything he wanted.

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.399
You might reasonably point out that a group of blind children aren’t exactly the

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:43.979
hardest target, especially if you aren’t fully blind yourself, but this seems to

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:49.719
be an early indicator of his character, and this experience of realising he could

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.869
bully and manipulate others to do what he wanted would come in handy later on.

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.689
Now, not a huge amount is known about what he did after he left school.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:07.319
It’s believed that he tried to get into Tokyo University to study medicine, but was rejected.

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:13.139
After failing to make progress with modern medicine, he got involved with

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:18.769
acupuncture and traditional medicine, and started selling traditional cures.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:26.373
Now, a sceptic might say that this is an ideal job for a future charlatan, as

00:05:26.373 --> 00:05:30.507
you can sell anything as a cure and tell your customers that it might work.

00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:36.413
If this was what he thought, he would soon realise that it wasn’t

00:05:36.443 --> 00:05:40.913
completely true, as he would end up being arrested by the police for

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:45.833
selling fake and unregulated medicine, and his pharmacy shut down.

00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:52.223
In 1977, at the age of 22, he had got married to a

00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:54.753
woman that he would go on to have six children with.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:58.913
And it was also at around this time that he became

00:05:58.943 --> 00:06:02.313
increasingly interested in spirituality and religion.

00:06:03.443 --> 00:06:06.223
Nothing so unusual so far, you might think.

00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:09.133
He was seeking truth, looking for answers.

00:06:10.143 --> 00:06:14.463
Religion in Japan, as you may know, is relatively fluid.

00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:17.763
Many people practise and follow elements of several

00:06:17.763 --> 00:06:21.533
religions, with Shinto and Buddhism being the most popular.

00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:25.643
Chizuo Matsumoto wasn’t content with two.

00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:31.273
Yes, he explored Shinto and Buddhism but also looked further afield.

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:38.143
He grew interested in Christianity and Hinduism, and looked in particular at Tibetan Buddhism.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:44.675
He also became a keen practitioner of yoga, which has roots in both Buddhism and Hinduism.

00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:49.695
What’s more, he studied the works of the 16th century French

00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:54.185
astronomer Nostradamus, who claimed to be able to predict the future.

00:06:55.115 --> 00:07:02.005
And in 1984, after his illegal and probably fraudulent pharmacy had been forced to shut down,

00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:08.115
he opened another small business, this time, part yoga school and part publishing house.

00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:10.075
All good so far.

00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:15.615
He was a mere yoga teacher with a curious mind and an appreciation for a mixture

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:20.475
of world religions, and one who was doing what he could to feed his growing family.

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:27.204
But beneath the surface, things weren’t quite so innocent, and it

00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:32.454
seems that Chizuo Matsumoto already had lofty ambitions for himself.

00:07:33.974 --> 00:07:41.274
His yoga school was initially free, but it was no normal yoga school; it came with a catch.

00:07:42.134 --> 00:07:47.324
It was, essentially, a religious organisation in which Matsumoto taught yoga.

00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:52.804
He would hand out flyers and preach to unsuspecting passers by, who

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:56.534
would come to listen to his spiritual teachings and practise yoga.

00:07:58.104 --> 00:08:03.794
His organisation was initially called Aum Shinsen no Kai, which translates

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:09.814
as something like “Immortal Mountain Hermit Association”, but in 1987

00:08:10.214 --> 00:08:15.704
he changed it to Aum Shinrikyo, which translates to “Supreme Truth”.

00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:21.004
And it was also at about this time that he changed his own name

00:08:21.204 --> 00:08:26.559
from Chizuo Matsumoto to the more spiritual sounding Shoko Asahara.

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:34.424
Now, Aum Shinrikyo might have started as a “yoga school”, but Asahara, as he was by this

00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:40.944
time, wanted to turn it into a fully-fledged religion, with himself firmly at the centre.

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:49.504
And in 1989 he got exactly what he wanted; it was granted the status of a religious corporation.

00:08:51.074 --> 00:08:53.824
This was important for several reasons.

00:08:54.994 --> 00:08:59.374
Firstly, it meant that it was tax exempt, it didn’t need to pay taxes.

00:09:00.914 --> 00:09:05.764
Secondly, it meant that the authorities weren’t allowed to investigate its “religious

00:09:05.764 --> 00:09:11.834
activities or doctrine”, meaning that Aum, and initially Asahara, could say or

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:17.084
do practically anything without fear of being investigated by the authorities.

00:09:18.294 --> 00:09:23.424
It was a complete game changer for Aum, and free from government

00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:27.894
oversight it ballooned in popularity, wealth and power.

00:09:29.254 --> 00:09:34.484
It reported having 3.4 million dollars in assets in 1989 when it

00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:40.170
was granted religious status, but this was over a billion by 1995.

00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:48.147
Similarly, its membership grew from a few hundred in 1989 up to 10,000 in

00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:55.547
1992 and a reported 50,000 by the time of the Tokyo Subway Attacks in 1995.

00:09:56.397 --> 00:10:00.874
It was absolutely massive, so what did it actually preach?

00:10:01.107 --> 00:10:04.747
What did you believe if you were a follower of Aum Shinrikyo?

00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:11.627
Well, like most cults, it’s somewhat unclear, variable, and

00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:16.187
the only constant is undying support and belief in the leader.

00:10:17.797 --> 00:10:23.317
Aum Shinrikyo was based on a mixture of Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity,

00:10:23.777 --> 00:10:28.047
and later on doomsday prophecies similar to those of Nostradamus.

00:10:28.697 --> 00:10:32.957
Essentially a belief that the end of the world was imminent and

00:10:33.127 --> 00:10:37.237
the only people who would be saved were followers of Aum Shinrikyo.

00:10:38.307 --> 00:10:42.545
Shoko Asahara, the man at the centre of it all, claimed to be the

00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:47.845
first enlightened one since Buddha, and a modern day Jesus Christ.

00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:52.435
It was only through Aum Shinrikyo, and through Asahara,

00:10:52.865 --> 00:10:55.615
that you could achieve enlightenment and redemption.

00:10:57.035 --> 00:11:00.005
And what did this actually mean in practice?

00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:04.915
There were many elements that are common to almost every cult.

00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:09.145
You needed to cut off contact with everyone from the

00:11:09.155 --> 00:11:13.218
outside world, friends, family, they were all dead to you.

00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:15.321
The cult was your family now.

00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:20.881
Similarly, you needed to hand over all of your worldly possessions to

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:26.261
the cult: property, physical objects, and of course all of your money.

00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:32.611
None of this mattered, and you needed to give it to the cult to fulfil its mission.

00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:38.171
Like in other cults, there were unusual initiation rituals,

00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.451
things that you needed to do to become a member of the cult.

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:48.347
One member would report that they had to pay thousands of dollars in order to drink the

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:55.317
blood of Shoko Asahara, and others would report having to drink tea with his hair inside.

00:11:56.897 --> 00:12:02.477
Like other cults, there were certain expectations placed on its female members.

00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:10.937
Although any form of sexual activity was banned for members of Aum Shinrikyo, female members

00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:17.327
would report going through rituals that involved so-called “energy transfers” with Shoko himself.

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:23.487
And, as a reminder, although all sexual activity was banned by the

00:12:23.487 --> 00:12:28.697
rules of Aum Shinrikyo, its leader, Shoko Asahara had at least six

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:32.877
children himself, so he wasn’t quite practising what he preached.

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:38.327
Now, if you are listening to this and thinking “well this all sounds

00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:42.857
ridiculous, why were so many people falling for it?", that's perfectly fair.

00:12:43.887 --> 00:12:48.377
Drinking someone’s blood or hair-flavoured water, never speaking to your friends or

00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:53.907
family, draining your bank balance and abstaining from all sexual activity, this doesn’t

00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:59.647
sound like so much fun, so how were they able to convince 50,000 people to do it?

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:06.517
Well, clearly, it’s complicated, but perhaps reminding ourselves of

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:10.367
what was happening in Japan at the time might give us some clues.

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:16.917
After the destruction of the Second World War, Japan experienced an economic boom.

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:22.553
It became the world’s second largest economy in 1968, and the

00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:28.193
1970s and 1980s were particular years of growth and prosperity.

00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:35.743
Business boomed, office workers spent more and more time at their desks, and, much like in

00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:40.937
the United States, there were plenty of young people who asked themselves what it was all for.

00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:46.383
What was the point of the TVs, the new cars and material goods?

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:48.963
Was this really the meaning of life?

00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:54.353
In particular among young people, disillusionment was rife.

00:13:55.463 --> 00:13:59.923
Shoko Asahara knew it because he was one of these young people.

00:14:00.363 --> 00:14:04.703
He had tried to make his way in modern Japan, with limited success.

00:14:05.943 --> 00:14:07.533
He had sought answers in religion.

00:14:08.383 --> 00:14:09.103
Had he found them?

00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:15.413
He certainly said that he had, and, if people were prepared to follow his teachings,

00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:21.773
and devote their life to Aum Shinrikyo, they too could discover the path to redemption.

00:14:23.023 --> 00:14:24.463
But there was more.

00:14:25.053 --> 00:14:28.983
The end of the world was nigh, so Asahara preached.

00:14:30.183 --> 00:14:34.243
Channelling his inner Nostradamus, Asahara spoke of an

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:38.313
imminent third world war between Japan and the United States.

00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:44.943
The only people to survive this war, so he said, would be followers of Aum.

00:14:46.493 --> 00:14:50.163
For someone who is disillusioned with the modern world, you can

00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:55.023
understand how this message of divine salvation could be a powerful one.

00:14:56.493 --> 00:15:01.053
This was the carrot, the attraction, but there was also plenty

00:15:01.053 --> 00:15:04.933
of stick, plenty of punishments if you fell out of line.

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:09.863
Like other cult leaders, he backed all of this up

00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:14.653
with threats, bullying, intimidation and even murder.

00:15:16.053 --> 00:15:19.083
Once you joined Aum Shinrikyo, you couldn’t leave.

00:15:19.573 --> 00:15:23.963
Anyone who tried to leave would be beaten and forced to change their mind.

00:15:25.653 --> 00:15:33.153
The group even murdered a lawyer who was investigating the cult, and this was in 1989, the same

00:15:33.153 --> 00:15:38.643
year that it was granted the coveted and protected religious status by the Japanese government.

00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:45.416
And in 1990, Asahara tried to take the cult to the next level.

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:51.546
It was growing in size and popularity, but he wanted political power too.

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:57.816
He instructed twenty Aum members to stand in the Japanese parliamentary elections.

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:03.526
Unfortunately, they all lost; not a single one was elected.

00:16:05.046 --> 00:16:08.016
And this was something of a turning point.

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:14.406
The group started to stockpile weapons, in preparation for this so-called World War Three.

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:22.376
This included traditional weapons, guns and so on, but also chemical and biological weapons.

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:27.206
They acquired chemicals to make Anthrax, the deadly bacteria.

00:16:28.146 --> 00:16:33.666
Members of Aum even travelled to Zaire during an Ebola outbreak in the early 1990s.

00:16:34.266 --> 00:16:40.476
They claimed to be on a humanitarian mission but it's believed that the real objective was

00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:46.246
to collect samples of Ebola to then release it as part of a biological attack in Japan.

00:16:47.582 --> 00:16:50.742
Now, why would the group want to attack its own country?

00:16:51.282 --> 00:16:55.462
Well, the objective was supposedly to trigger this

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:58.505
third world war and apocalypse that Asahara spoke of.

00:16:58.992 --> 00:17:05.292
Perhaps it needed some encouragement, a match to be lit under the bonfire, so Asahara

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:10.122
instructed his followers to launch attacks on their own people to get things moving.

00:17:11.574 --> 00:17:14.854
The group started with some small scale attacks in Japan,

00:17:15.324 --> 00:17:19.264
releasing anthrax from the roof of their headquarters in 1993.

00:17:20.284 --> 00:17:25.714
Fortunately no innocent civilians died, but several members of the cult were injured.

00:17:27.184 --> 00:17:30.464
Shoko Asahara’s delusions of grandeur had been growing,

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:35.051
and he declared himself to be the messiah in 1992.

00:17:36.314 --> 00:17:40.484
And his predictions about the apocalypse, brought about by this American

00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:45.314
attack on Japan, were getting revised, he was bringing them closer and closer.

00:17:46.384 --> 00:17:51.534
The date he set was 1997, only a few years away.

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:56.394
Understandably, the Japanese authorities were getting nervous.

00:17:57.164 --> 00:18:01.984
Not because they really believed the US was about to attack, this was a ridiculous

00:18:01.984 --> 00:18:08.054
idea, but rather what the tens of thousands of Aum followers would do in the lead up to

00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:13.804
this date, or what they would try to do to provoke this apocalypse Asahara preached of.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:20.354
On the 20th of March, 1995, the lengths that the group was prepared

00:18:20.384 --> 00:18:24.804
to go to would, unfortunately, become clear for everyone to see.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:31.465
During the morning rush, five members of the cult entered the Tokyo

00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:36.255
subway system, while another five stayed behind as getaway drivers.

00:18:37.715 --> 00:18:42.745
They entered the subway carriages, placed their bags down in front of them, and

00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:49.025
punctured them with umbrellas, releasing the deadly nerve agent sarin into the air.

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:54.575
Sarin is a horrible chemical weapon that attacks the nervous system.

00:18:55.285 --> 00:19:02.265
It can be fatal if breathed in large amounts, and even a small amount results in serious injury.

00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:07.245
Within seconds, people on the subway started coughing

00:19:07.285 --> 00:19:10.585
and spluttering as the deadly agent got to work.

00:19:11.805 --> 00:19:15.625
The effect was intensified as the doors remained closed,

00:19:15.965 --> 00:19:19.145
creating a lethal gas chamber inside the carriage.

00:19:20.505 --> 00:19:23.685
We won’t go into all of the details of the attack, as

00:19:24.005 --> 00:19:27.393
clearly it is still a painful memory for millions of people.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:33.855
The end result was 14 direct deaths and over a thousand people

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:38.215
injured, many of whom were unable to live a normal life afterwards.

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:42.285
It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Japanese history.

00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:47.248
If there were those who had thought that Aum Shinrikyo was simply a collection of

00:19:47.568 --> 00:19:54.028
unusual, quirky religious fanatics, well it was now clear the threat that the group posed.

00:19:55.338 --> 00:19:58.228
Surprisingly enough though, it took quite some time

00:19:58.378 --> 00:20:01.278
for the guilty parties to be tracked down and arrested.

00:20:02.588 --> 00:20:06.058
The headquarters of Aum Shinrikyo wasn’t raided by police

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:10.338
until May 16th, almost a full two months after the attacks.

00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:16.408
In a small, hidden room, they found the cult leader, Shoko Asahara.

00:20:17.418 --> 00:20:21.568
He was arrested and brought into custody, with the prosecution lawyers

00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:26.498
arguing that he wanted to, and I’m quoting directly, "overthrow the

00:20:26.498 --> 00:20:30.998
government and install himself in the position of Emperor of Japan".

00:20:32.528 --> 00:20:40.238
This was in 1995, and it wasn’t until 2004 that he was sentenced to death, and–as you heard

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:47.618
at the start of the episode, 2018, 23 years after the attacks, that he was finally executed.

00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:53.208
Lawyers for his defence argued that he wasn’t criminally responsible

00:20:53.638 --> 00:20:57.588
as he was insane and he was mentally unfit to stand trial.

00:20:58.918 --> 00:21:02.748
Indeed, during his trial he didn’t say anything in his

00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:06.788
own defence, only talking to himself like a madman.

00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:10.771
Still, the judge didn’t buy it.

00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:16.611
He had been manipulating people his entire life, from his childhood at the school for

00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:21.441
the blind through to forcing cult members to pay thousands of dollars to drink his blood.

00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:27.551
He was guilty, but it took a long time for him to be executed.

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:33.061
This was partly due to the fact that his trial was linked to the trial of other

00:21:33.061 --> 00:21:37.671
members of Aum Shinrikyo, many of whom weren’t arrested until years after.

00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:43.041
It was also a very complex case; the cult was shrouded in mystery,

00:21:43.381 --> 00:21:47.761
and assigning blame directly to Asahara took quite some time.

00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:52.951
During the time that he was in police custody, there were heightened fears

00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:57.071
that members of Aum would continue their attacks, both because this was

00:21:57.071 --> 00:22:01.591
what Asahara had instructed them to do, and because they wanted to free him.

00:22:02.301 --> 00:22:07.071
Indeed, there were several attempted attacks, all of which were thwarted.

00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:14.581
And it might surprise you to learn after all of this that Aum Shinrikyo is still

00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:19.311
around today, although it has gone through a substantial rebranding process.

00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:26.491
It is now called “Aleph”, and although it has a new name and exists without its

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:31.461
charismatic and dangerous founder, much of the original teaching remains the same.

00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:37.731
And it is far from a handful of cult members left over from the 1980s;

00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:43.231
it’s estimated that it has anywhere from 1,500 to 30,000 members.

00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:50.961
Understandably, the Japanese security forces are, to this day, keeping a very close eye on it.

00:22:53.842 --> 00:23:00.996
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Aum Shinrikyo and its dangerous leader, Shoko Asahara.

00:23:01.782 --> 00:23:05.012
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:05.832 --> 00:23:08.272
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this

00:23:08.272 --> 00:23:11.272
episode, particularly if you are one of our Japanese listeners.

00:23:11.902 --> 00:23:14.432
Do you remember the 1995 attacks?

00:23:14.882 --> 00:23:18.102
Do you know of anyone who was a follower of Aum Shinrikyo?

00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:24.092
Where do you think the line should be drawn between religious freedoms and individual protections?

00:23:24.972 --> 00:23:28.192
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:23:28.558 --> 00:23:31.798

Hello, hello hello, and welcome
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.879
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.459
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.959
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.350
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are
going to be talking about measurements.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.860
Why do we use certain universally
agreed upon measurements of length,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.580
weight, and time, where did this all
come from, and what does it mean?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.000
It might sound like a mundane, boring
subject, but in today’s episode we’ll go

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.940
from Ancient Egypt to Medieval England,
we’ll meet French revolutionaries

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.169
with revolutionary ideas about the
weights and dates, we’ll find out

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.679
why shipping containers are in fact
revolutionary, and we’ll learn that

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.819
it’s only by chance that ice doesn’t
freeze at 100 degrees Centigrade.

00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:07.742
OK, then, A Short History of Measurements.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:12.712
Imagine, if you will, a
world without measurements.

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:16.692
No hours, no metres, no
weights, no temperatures.

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:21.972
It would certainly make life somewhat
trickier, somewhat more difficult.

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:27.916
But of course, before humans, there
were no measurements;  every measurement

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.946
is a human invention, these hugely
important parts of everyday life are

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.816
completely man-made, they are artificial.

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:41.906
So, in this episode we are going
to look at two broad categories of

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:43.926
the development of measurements.

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:48.826
Firstly, the creation of
measurements, from length to time.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:54.866
And secondly, the standardisation of these
measurements, because having a measurement

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:59.026
isn’t very useful if there isn’t a
universally agreed-upon definition.

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:05.166
If my kilogramme is twice as heavy
as your kilogramme and half as

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.836
heavy as my neighbour’s kilogramme,
what’s the point of calling it

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:10.206
a kilogramme in the first place?

00:02:11.906 --> 00:02:17.516
So, first off, let’s talk about an
old English measurement of distance.

00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:23.226
To those of you who have been to the UK
and seen signs about something called

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.056
miles, no I’m not talking about that.

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:30.516
I’m actually talking about
something older, a measurement

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:34.846
that you might not have heard of
unless you are a horse racing fan.

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:39.216
And this is the Furlong.

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:44.856
Now, from an etymological point
of view, this word comes from a

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:47.846
combination of two words in Old English.

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:53.426
Furh, the old word for “furrow”,
which is the hollow trench, the

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:59.236
hole, that a plough carves in the
ground, and long, meaning, well, long.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:06.186
A furlong was the distance that a
pair of oxen or working cows who

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.856
were pulling the plough could cover
before they needed to stop for a rest.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:12.986
Clever, right?

00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:15.996
But obviously somewhat inaccurate.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:21.503
If you had two lazy oxen who needed
to rest after 30 seconds, your

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:23.773
furlong would be pretty short.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:29.313
And if you had two super strong
oxen who wouldn’t get tired, well

00:03:29.503 --> 00:03:31.283
a furlong would be quite long.

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:37.663
Nevertheless, the furlong was a common
measurement, and it would go on to be

00:03:37.663 --> 00:03:41.843
a measurement that would be used to
calculate the size of what became the

00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:44.613
English acre, or the size of a field.

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:51.913
Interestingly enough, the furlong was an
official British measurement until 1985!

00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:56.843
By the way, if you’re still wondering
about how long a furlong actually

00:03:56.873 --> 00:04:03.593
is, it is now universally agreed at
201 metres, although if you go to

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:08.943
the UK and you ask someone how many
furlongs it is to a museum, they will

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:10.823
give you a slightly confused look.

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:16.953
Anyway, we’ll see a theme here, that
measurements understandably originate

00:04:16.963 --> 00:04:22.783
from semi-universal activities, activities
that would be the same anywhere, that

00:04:22.853 --> 00:04:28.103
often used physical objects or activities
that everyone would be aware of and

00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:30.513
would be at least somewhat similar.

00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:36.013
Now, let’s move across the English
Channel and look at another

00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:38.113
interesting example from France.

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:43.703
You’ll see that the French approached
a similar problem, of how to

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:48.553
measure distance and the area of
a field, in a very different way.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:56.193
In one part of France - Bourges - land
was measured by how many baskets of

00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:58.843
seeds would be required to sow it.

00:05:00.013 --> 00:05:02.873
This basket size was called a setier.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:08.163
This meant that the agreed unit,
the amount of land that could be

00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:13.083
sown using that amount of seeds,
became known as the seterée.

00:05:14.173 --> 00:05:19.713
Clearly, much like the English example
of lazy or strong oxen creating

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:24.533
different interpretations of a
furlong, a seterée wasn’t an exact

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:28.993
measurement, as everyone would sow
their seeds slightly differently.

00:05:30.183 --> 00:05:35.433
This being said, using this unit was
actually more useful than you might

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:40.583
think, because it did give you - in
some respects - a better understanding

00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:45.803
of how productive a piece of land would
be than simply saying how big it was.

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:52.963
If land was unevenly distributed, or
there were bushes or ponds in the middle,

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:58.183
this seterée measurement took this into
account, while if you were calculating

00:05:58.183 --> 00:06:02.493
the dimensions of the field, this
calculation would be more complicated.

00:06:03.283 --> 00:06:06.793
It was still, however, like
the furlong, imperfect.

00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:13.103
Both the furlong and the seterée were
what we’d call elastic measurements,

00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:16.453
measurements that change depending
on who is doing the measuring.

00:06:17.223 --> 00:06:21.203
As you can imagine, they aren’t
particularly good forms of measurements,

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:26.123
but these elastic measurements have
been the dominant type of measurement

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:28.323
for almost all of human history.

00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:34.433
Now, if we move from the physical
world to the theoretical world, and

00:06:34.613 --> 00:06:39.603
talk about the artificial construct of
splitting time into different units,

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:45.493
for the majority of human history, units
of time have had different lengths.

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:51.473
For example, the ancient Egyptians
simply counted 10 units of daylight,

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:56.843
and added two additional ones for the
early morning and the evening time.

00:06:57.853 --> 00:07:00.853
This worked fine for
the ancient Egyptians.

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:06.733
They were pretty close to the equator, so
the length of a day didn’t vary too much.

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:12.573
But clearly, the further you are away
from the equator, the less useful

00:07:12.683 --> 00:07:14.783
this form of measurement becomes.

00:07:15.783 --> 00:07:19.453
So, take a Londoner
in, say, the year 1500.

00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:25.313
Using a similar form of measurement
their hour could vary from 38

00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:30.673
minutes in the depths of winter to 82
minutes in the middle of summer when

00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:32.323
there were more hours of sunlight.

00:07:33.693 --> 00:07:37.303
At first glance, you might think
that this would've made life very

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:39.663
complicated for our Medieval Londoner.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.053
But, as far as the records show, it
actually wasn’t so much of an issue.

00:07:45.873 --> 00:07:49.473
Thinking of an hour as a
consistent measure simply was

00:07:49.473 --> 00:07:51.353
not part of how people thought.

00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:55.573
The majority of people
worked outside on the land.

00:07:55.723 --> 00:08:00.263
It was second nature to adapt to
the changing rhythm of the season.

00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:05.053
What’s more, church bells would
ring throughout the day to mark

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:09.413
the hours and you would rarely
need to pre-arrange an exact time

00:08:09.413 --> 00:08:11.083
with someone coming from far away.

00:08:11.563 --> 00:08:14.353
So you simply didn’t
need to worry about it.

00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:19.913
Now, we’ve looked at length and
time, and seen some examples how

00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:23.873
this was approached by the English,
the French and the Egyptians.

00:08:24.543 --> 00:08:28.513
It’s now time to move on to the
second section of this little

00:08:28.623 --> 00:08:32.713
exploration, where we look at
attempts to standardise measurements.

00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:39.243
For this, let’s look at perhaps the
greatest and most successful human

00:08:39.243 --> 00:08:43.913
experiment with standardising distance
and weight – the metric system.

00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:48.983
In order to do this I need to
take you back to France in the

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:53.783
early 1700s when the seeds of the
French Revolution were being sown.

00:08:55.133 --> 00:09:00.023
Central to the grievances or complaints
of the French peasants was the way

00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:04.873
in which, when selling their goods
in markets, they often felt cheated

00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:09.353
by merchants and aristocrats who
were in greater positions of power.

00:09:10.243 --> 00:09:14.133
There were literally hundreds of different
measurements across the whole of France.

00:09:14.623 --> 00:09:19.733
The varieties were usually regional,
in other words, they were only used

00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:21.313
in particular parts of the country.

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:27.728
When the national assembly, or the
Estates General, met in 1789 in

00:09:27.887 --> 00:09:32.758
the lead up to the Revolution, a
demand to standardise weights and

00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:35.008
measures was high on the agenda.

00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:40.638
Interestingly, this issue was mentioned
more frequently than complaints

00:09:40.638 --> 00:09:44.658
about the courts or about the
infringement of personal liberties.

00:09:45.578 --> 00:09:48.908
And it’s from here that
the metric system was born.

00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:54.518
It came both from the urgent need to
solve this pressing, practical problem

00:09:54.808 --> 00:09:59.238
and a more idealistic motive which
had to do with the Enlightenment.

00:10:00.158 --> 00:10:04.168
If you know much about The Enlightenment,
or you’ve listened to episode number

00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:10.138
149, you’ll remember that this movement,
which had at its core the idea that

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:14.738
science and reason could solve many
of humanity's problems, the movement

00:10:14.738 --> 00:10:17.428
was particularly strong in France.

00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:23.878
So, French Enlightenment thinkers set
out to create a new system of weights

00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:28.758
and measures which was based not on
the size of a human’s foot or hand

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:34.268
or how far his oxen could plough, but
on proper mathematical principles.

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:38.908
Allied to this system was
the desire to make things

00:10:38.918 --> 00:10:40.928
simpler through decimalisation.

00:10:42.348 --> 00:10:47.908
This movement was spearheaded by
two highly regarded men, astronomers

00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:51.618
with a mission, Jean-Baptiste
Delambre and Pierre Méchain.

00:10:53.018 --> 00:10:58.498
Their heroic task, which began
in 1792, was to calculate the

00:10:58.498 --> 00:11:02.588
Meridian, or the distance from
the North Pole to the South Pole.

00:11:03.498 --> 00:11:03.948
Why?

00:11:04.578 --> 00:11:08.718
Because they had decided that the
metric unit of measurement, the

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:14.034
metre, should be the length of the
Meridian divided by 10 million.

00:11:15.254 --> 00:11:15.754
Simple?

00:11:16.044 --> 00:11:17.224
Well, not really.

00:11:18.204 --> 00:11:22.334
Using the best techniques of measurement
available at the time, which can

00:11:22.334 --> 00:11:25.904
actually be traced back to work of
the Greek mathematician Euclid, by

00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:31.074
the way, these two men set about doing
this through measuring the distance

00:11:31.114 --> 00:11:33.244
of a proportion of the Meridian.

00:11:34.164 --> 00:11:39.024
In practice, this meant calculating
the exact distance from the French

00:11:39.134 --> 00:11:44.224
coastal port of Dunkerque, via Paris,
to the Spanish city of Barcelona.

00:11:45.694 --> 00:11:50.774
They started in 1792, the year
before the luckless King Louis XVI

00:11:50.784 --> 00:11:54.244
was executed, and finished in 1795.

00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:57.704
One went North and the other went South.

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:04.074
After further deliberations and a huge
amount of checking their calculations, on

00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:12.384
the 22nd of June 1799 the definitive metre
length platinum bar was unveiled in Paris.

00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:20.224
They got it almost right, only
miscalculating by 0.02% because

00:12:20.414 --> 00:12:23.312
they hadn’t taken into account
the flattening of the Earth.

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.764
But it’s still pretty
good going if you ask me.

00:12:27.734 --> 00:12:31.954
Now, on to creating the standard
measurement of weight, the kilogramme.

00:12:33.274 --> 00:12:37.644
The kilogramme was originally defined
as being the weight of the volume

00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:40.014
of 1,000 cubic centimetres of water.

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:48.594
Essentially, if you have a box, 10cm by
10cm by 10cm and fill that with water,

00:12:49.064 --> 00:12:51.934
that should weigh exactly one kilogramme.

00:12:53.214 --> 00:12:56.665
Through some pretty complicated
technical calculations, the

00:12:56.665 --> 00:13:01.445
mathematicians eventually arrived
at this common unit of weight, which

00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:05.965
was captured through the original,
exact platinum kilogramme weight.

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:12.245
And the metric system has,
clearly, been an enormous success.

00:13:12.942 --> 00:13:16.761
It's now used by 95% of
the world’s population.

00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:21.691
But not all attempts to make
the system of measurement more

00:13:21.691 --> 00:13:23.711
logical have had the same success.

00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:28.651
After the great success of the
creation of the metric system, the

00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:33.301
French also tried to replicate it
with the system of measuring time.

00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:40.211
On June the 8th of 1794, the influential
French revolutionary, Robespierre,

00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:44.051
celebrated something called the
Festival of the Supreme Being.

00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.161
This was a festival in celebration
of the new way of telling

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.451
the time, the decimal way.

00:13:52.561 --> 00:13:56.631
Gone were the old fashioned
months, based on Roman gods.

00:13:56.991 --> 00:14:01.411
Gone were the illogical 24
hour days and seven day week.

00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:07.111
Instead, we had a calendar based
on the activities for rural France.

00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:11.931
There were 10 months, each
with 3 weeks of 10 days each.

00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:16.561
Every month got a new name, based
on what was happening in France.

00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:20.785
In the Spring there was the
month of flowering, Floreal.

00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:27.381
The hottest month was called Thermidor
and the coldest was called Nivôse, which

00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:29.661
comes from the French word for snow.

00:14:30.831 --> 00:14:35.801
Within each week of 10 days, the
day would be split into 10 hours,

00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:38.611
each of 100 minutes and 100 seconds.

00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:43.781
If you’ve been doing the maths in
your head - firstly, congratulations

00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:48.291
- and secondly, you’ll have worked
out that one second in this system

00:14:48.451 --> 00:14:51.631
was equal to 0.864 seconds today.

00:14:52.361 --> 00:14:57.151
But if this is all giving you a bit
of a sore head and you are wondering

00:14:57.221 --> 00:15:01.071
whether you need to know more about
it if you travel to Paris, fear not.

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:05.891
Although the Revolution and the
introduction of the metric system

00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:10.341
undoubtedly was a massive achievement
for France and the rest of the world,

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:15.301
these plans to make time and weeks
decimal did not have the same effect.

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:20.651
The system of decimal time was
abandoned after two years, and the

00:15:20.651 --> 00:15:22.661
Republican calendar after twelve.

00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:28.481
Now, moving to the present day, it’s
time to talk about an invention that

00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:30.831
has revolutionised global trade.

00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:36.511
And one you might not think about:
the standardised shipping container.

00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:39.201
Now, what is a shipping container?

00:15:39.791 --> 00:15:44.161
Put simply, it's only a steel
box with standard dimensions.

00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:48.281
It’s 8 feet across, or 2.44 metres.

00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:52.411
It’s 8'6" tall, or 2.59 metres.

00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:59.041
And it’s either 20 or 40 feet long,
so that’s 6.10 or 12.2 metres long.

00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:04.841
The dimensions in themselves aren’t
important, but rather the fact that

00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:09.501
practically every shipping container
in the world uses the same ones.

00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:14.761
The reason the standardisation
of the container was so important

00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:19.931
was that it massively reduced the
time required to load and unload

00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.971
goods onto ships and railways.

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:27.821
Before, there was a team of men who
were employed to load and unload

00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:30.431
everything, packing it and unpacking it.

00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:33.461
It took a long time and was expensive.

00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:40.841
In the 1950s, an American entrepreneur
called Malcolm McLean had an idea: to

00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:46.261
create a standard size so that the boxes
could be packed and unpacked away from

00:16:46.261 --> 00:16:49.371
the dock, thereby saving time and money.

00:16:50.662 --> 00:16:53.812
His invention was a rip roaring success.

00:16:54.342 --> 00:16:58.402
The boxes could be packed on top of
each other like Lego bricks, they

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:04.142
could be easily loaded and unloaded,
and to this day these are the standard

00:17:04.142 --> 00:17:06.102
dimensions for a shipping container.

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:12.432
Now, before we end this episode, we
have time for three curiosities, or

00:17:12.542 --> 00:17:15.954
pieces of trivia about measure ment.

00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:20.784
Let me start with one that is particularly
British, but might reveal something

00:17:20.794 --> 00:17:25.874
about Britain, the British people, and
how we aren’t sure exactly what we want.

00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:31.982
In the same way that, as Brexit
showed, Britain has always had an

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:37.294
uneasy relationship with Europe,
so it has an uneasy or ambivalent

00:17:37.304 --> 00:17:39.214
relationship with the metric system.

00:17:40.474 --> 00:17:44.834
Brits will talk quite naturally about
"going for a pint" at the same time as in

00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:47.084
discussing "running the hundred metres."

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:52.924
In British towns, signs indicating
the distance on foot paths tend

00:17:52.944 --> 00:17:57.594
to be in metres, but on the roads,
you talk about miles per hour,

00:17:57.974 --> 00:18:02.034
miles per gallon and how many miles
it is from London to Birmingham.

00:18:03.204 --> 00:18:08.864
Strangely enough, the UK is the only
country that still uses both systems,

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:13.864
although the Imperial system of pounds
and ounces is used less and less

00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:18.784
every year, even if our friends over
the pond still insist on using it.

00:18:20.154 --> 00:18:26.274
Now, for our second curiosity we must
travel to the USA and specifically visit

00:18:26.284 --> 00:18:31.954
the United States' National Institute
of Standards and Technology or the NIST.

00:18:32.954 --> 00:18:36.704
This organisation establishes
the standards for everything

00:18:36.704 --> 00:18:39.244
from peanut butter to cigarettes.

00:18:39.924 --> 00:18:44.464
For example, the standard jar of
peanut butter has exact proportions

00:18:44.464 --> 00:18:50.534
of carbohydrates, proteins, sugars and
fibre that are set down by the NIST.

00:18:50.954 --> 00:18:55.004
Every atom in the jar, including
all the chemical properties and

00:18:55.204 --> 00:18:59.894
trace elements are measured and
established by this organisation.

00:19:01.284 --> 00:19:05.624
The standard cigarette, on the other
hand, which is known by its standard

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:12.974
reference materials or SRM [#1196 in this
case by the way] can be found at NIST.

00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:18.594
You might think that it’s somewhat
unnecessary to have a standard measure

00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:23.334
of cigarette, but it does have its uses
especially when it comes to safety.

00:19:24.384 --> 00:19:29.984
As you may know, cigarettes left on
beds or sofas after the smoker has

00:19:29.984 --> 00:19:34.364
fallen asleep are one of the main
causes of death by fire in the home.

00:19:35.214 --> 00:19:40.764
In order therefore to test the resistance
to fire of mattresses, sofas and sheets

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:43.494
a standard cigarette needs to be used.

00:19:44.304 --> 00:19:50.194
This scientific emphasis on sameness
and consistency may seem a little

00:19:50.194 --> 00:19:55.254
dull, a little boring and unnecessary,
but it is saving lives every day.

00:19:56.334 --> 00:20:01.334
Now, our final curiosity has to do
with temperature - something we have

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:05.104
not covered yet today, but clearly
something we are all aware of.

00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:10.804
Again, our friends in the USA are
slightly strange here, as they are

00:20:10.804 --> 00:20:14.354
one of the three countries in the
world that still uses Fahrenheit.

00:20:15.034 --> 00:20:18.684
If you’re interested, the other two
are Liberia and the Cayman Islands.

00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:24.034
If you’re from a sensible,
Centigrade-using country, it may surprise

00:20:24.034 --> 00:20:28.554
you to find out that the Centigrade
system, which was invented by a Swedish

00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:34.428
scientist called Anders Celsius in 1741,
was originally the other way round.

00:20:35.248 --> 00:20:41.858
In other words, Celsius’ original
scale had 100º C at the bottom for the

00:20:41.858 --> 00:20:48.138
temperature at which water freezes and 0º
C at the top for water’s boiling point.

00:20:49.468 --> 00:20:54.908
No one knows exactly when the scale
was inverted or turned around, but,

00:20:54.948 --> 00:20:58.978
just think, you could just as easily
be talking about winter coming and

00:20:58.978 --> 00:21:01.928
with it the temperature rising to 100*.

00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:07.888
So, there you go, whether you’re buying
vegetables in a supermarket, you’re

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:11.958
wondering how long it will take you to
get to your friend’s house, or you’re

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:16.658
shocked at how much weight you’ve put on
in December, next time you step on the

00:21:16.658 --> 00:21:21.008
scales or get out your measuring tape,
I hope you’ll realise that there’s much

00:21:21.038 --> 00:21:23.228
more to measurements than meets the eye.

00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:29.828
OK then, that is it for today's
episode on A Short History of

00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:33.878
Measurements, this interesting story
of something we can all relate to

00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:36.118
but that has a fascinating history.

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:40.458
As always, I would love to know
what you thought of this episode.

00:21:40.848 --> 00:21:43.448
Can you imagine a world
without measurements?

00:21:43.718 --> 00:21:47.528
What are some other interesting stories
of measurements that we didn’t mention?

00:21:48.198 --> 00:21:52.408
Do you think we’ll ever attempt to move
to a different system of measuring time?

00:21:52.968 --> 00:21:56.368
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

00:21:56.768 --> 00:21:59.368

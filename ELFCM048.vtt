Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by

00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:17.035
Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:22.687
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:29.437
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Spanish Flu.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.257
It is by some measures, the world's most devastating pandemic.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:41.827
And of course, knowing a bit more about it is helpful for understanding some

00:00:41.827 --> 00:00:47.287
of the ways in which we might think about what's going on in the world today.

00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:54.757
As we will talk about, there are lots of similarities, but also lots of reasons

00:00:54.937 --> 00:01:00.497
that we shouldn't pay too much attention to what happened during The Spanish Flu.

00:01:02.087 --> 00:01:09.527
In any case, it is a fascinating story and I'm pretty excited to share this episode with you.

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:17.227
Before we get started though, I just wanted to quickly remind you that you can get a copy of the

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:23.737
transcript and key vocabulary for this episode over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:29.407
The transcript is super helpful for following along and the key vocabulary,

00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:34.087
well, it means that you won't need to pause to look up words and you will

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:39.037
build up your vocabulary much more quickly than you would just by listening.

00:01:40.147 --> 00:01:46.037

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.787
Okay then, The Spanish Flu.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:59.652
Until earlier on this year, The Spanish Flu was something that was somewhat fading

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:07.102
from memory, something that you may have heard about, may have read about, but

00:02:07.162 --> 00:02:12.622
you probably didn't have much of an understanding of what actually happened.

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:21.922
But then of course the world changed and people were scrambling for their history books to see

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:29.362
if there were any lessons from the past that could help us confront the situation we are now in.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:35.562
So let's just start by reminding ourselves of what actually happened.

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:44.492
As we know, in 1914 the First World War broke out in Europe and by

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:51.662
1918 much of the world had been dragged into a nasty and fruitless war.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.519
Large parts of Europe were devastated and countries and their people were worn down,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.469
both physically and mentally, by a war that had dragged on for far longer than anyone had thought.

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:18.909
Then in 1918 a strange flu started appearing and people started getting ill

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:26.393
and dying at rates that had never previously been seen with the normal flu.

00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:37.573
There had been strange cases of a flu even earlier, actually, as early as 1916 but it wasn't

00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:46.813
until 1918 that this new flu really became known and started spreading across the world.

00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:55.164
And over the course of the next year and a half or so, it ravaged the world.

00:03:56.244 --> 00:04:01.829
Around 500 million people, half a billion people, got it.

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.099
We will never know exactly how many people died from it,

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.469
but estimates range from 25 million to a hundred million people.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.079
And it lowered the average life

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.969
expectancy in the United States by more than 12 years.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:31.087
It's still not quite clear though exactly where The Spanish Flu started, but

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:38.707
we know one thing that may just surprise you and that is that it definitely wasn't Spain.

00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:46.207
The reason that it was referred to as 'The Spanish Flu' was because the Spanish

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:52.352
newspapers were the first to report cases of it, the first cases were reported in Spain.

00:04:54.722 --> 00:04:58.652
And it wasn't because the Spanish journalists were particularly

00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:03.422
fast or Spanish doctors were the first to diagnose it.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.628
It was because Spain was neutral during World War One.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.196
And because of its neutrality, its press,

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:18.691
its newspapers were free to publish whatever stories they wanted.

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.617
When there were the first cases in the US, in France, in

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:30.707
Britain, and in Germany, these countries were still right in the middle of war.

00:05:31.637 --> 00:05:39.197
It was important for morale to be kept up and there was the fear that if it became known that

00:05:39.257 --> 00:05:46.562
there was another enemy to fight, another dangerous virus that was killing troops,

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:53.402
then this could be really detrimental for the morale of the troops and also the morale back home.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:58.312
So for quite a while it was kept quiet.

00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:02.603
The Spanish were the only ones to report it because

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:06.773
they were neutral and didn't have to worry so much about morale.

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:12.644
There are all sorts of theories about where the virus

00:06:12.674 --> 00:06:17.324
actually came from, but the evidence for any of them isn't

00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:22.214
actually strong enough for us to spend too much time talking about today.

00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:29.737
What is interesting though, and we can of course, draw the parallels between then

00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:35.573
and now, is what people thought was causing it, where they thought it came from.

00:06:36.838 --> 00:06:41.338
Remember the world had just experienced the First World

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:46.798
War, the first conflict that involved such a large number of different

00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:53.158
countries and a scale of death that hadn't really ever been seen before.

00:06:54.608 --> 00:07:00.263
Those of you who remember the episode on the poets of World War One will remember

00:07:00.293 --> 00:07:06.293
some of the ways in which young British soldiers talked about their experience.

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:12.823
Trench warfare, poison gas, tanks, barbed wire.

00:07:13.213 --> 00:07:20.353
It was a new kind of war, and there was quite a strong belief that The Spanish

00:07:20.383 --> 00:07:25.153
Flu, this new influenza that had never been seen in anyone's

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:31.303
living memory was a sort of divine punishment for what the world had done.

00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:37.351
There was also the theory, which is perhaps slightly more credible,

00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:44.671
or at least based more in the real than the divine, that the influenza had

00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:51.436
been caused by poisonous gases coming from the battlefields in Northern France.

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.606
Well, neither of these was true.

00:07:57.196 --> 00:08:01.914
We understand The Spanish Flu a bit better now, and we now

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:08.394
know that it comes from the same strain of virus, the same family of virus

00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:17.544
as avian flu, H1N1 ,the swine flu that we saw in 2009, ninety years later.

00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:21.916
So what did The Spanish Flu do?

00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:26.236
Well, I think we know broadly the story of that.

00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:33.106
It spread incredibly quickly and infected up to 500 million people,

00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:38.686
a third of the world's population at the time, and killed up to 100 million people.

00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:45.808
On one level, it's quite crazy to think that it spread so quickly

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:53.038
and so widely given that the world was significantly less connected than it is now.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.548
The main theory about why it was able

00:08:56.548 --> 00:09:00.988
to spread so quickly was that it was spread by soldiers.

00:09:01.948 --> 00:09:08.278
Soldiers were always in pretty close proximity, they were close to one another,

00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:14.458
whether that was actually in the trenches or in the barracks, it didn't really matter.

00:09:14.848 --> 00:09:18.808
They lived in close confinement, and this meant that

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.798
the virus spread very easily from soldier to soldier.

00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:28.888
Indeed, one of the first times that the virus was actually

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:35.488
reported was in an army camp in Kansas in the United States.

00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:45.313
In this camp, there were around 50,000 soldiers who were waiting to be shipped to Europe to fight.

00:09:46.603 --> 00:09:52.243
Early one morning in March, 1918, a soldier reported himself

00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:59.015
to the army doctor with an influenza, and by lunchtime, the very same

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:05.343
day the army hospital was completely overflowing with infected soldiers.

00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:13.903
And soldiers were really the only people who were actually traveling at the time.

00:10:15.693 --> 00:10:19.803
On one level this just means that they are the ones who

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:23.403
would be sent to different places taking the virus with them.

00:10:24.483 --> 00:10:27.963
But it's actually more interesting than this.

00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:32.718
One of the main theories about why The Spanish Flu was so

00:10:32.718 --> 00:10:38.388
much worse than other influenzas was precisely because of the way in which

00:10:38.418 --> 00:10:45.468
soldiers were dealt with and how the flu virus normally mutates, how it changes.

00:10:47.723 --> 00:10:52.043
So, as you may be aware, a virus typically mutates,

00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:55.973
it changes as it is passed from person to person.

00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:04.709
With normal life and in a civilian environment, a non-war environment,

00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:10.819
like we are in now, what normally happens is that those people who have

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:17.649
the worse mutations of the virus stay home or are confined to a hospital.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:26.499
So they are relatively isolated and it is less likely that they pass the virus on to anyone else.

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:34.854
And those people that have the more mild versions of the virus tend

00:11:34.854 --> 00:11:39.463
to continue their normal life, and so if they spread

00:11:39.493 --> 00:11:45.043
the virus to others, they are spreading the more mild version of it.

00:11:46.663 --> 00:11:51.903
But with soldiers in World War One things were the opposite.

00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:57.679
The soldiers who had the mild versions of it stayed to fight.

00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:03.034
The army needed every soldier that could fight, and if they had

00:12:03.034 --> 00:12:08.464
a mild flu, well that wasn't bad enough to send them away from the front lines.

00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:19.264
And the soldiers who had the worse, more deadly mutations of it were sent away in packed trains and

00:12:19.264 --> 00:12:27.964
boats back home where they then passed the stronger, more deadly mutation of the virus on to others.

00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:34.628
The result of this was that The Spanish Flu was even more

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:41.348
deadly during the so-called second wave, which occurred during the autumn

00:12:41.348 --> 00:12:47.034
and winter of 1918 after troops had started to be sent home.

00:12:49.974 --> 00:12:55.404
One thing that I found really interesting when researching more about The Spanish

00:12:55.404 --> 00:13:00.894
Flu was how many governments actually did a quite good job of

00:13:00.894 --> 00:13:06.461
containing it and implemented almost exactly the same sort of

00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:12.311
measures as are being done in lots of different countries around the world today.

00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:19.348
It's obviously not revolutionary and doesn't take a PhD in

00:13:19.528 --> 00:13:24.882
epidemiology to figure out, but back in 1918 over a hundred

00:13:24.882 --> 00:13:28.752
years ago, the main way in which governments tried to stop

00:13:28.962 --> 00:13:34.752
the spread of the virus was through what we are now calling social distancing.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:39.642
They had figured out that the virus was transmitted

00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:43.632
through the air, through breathing, coughing, or sneezing.

00:13:44.232 --> 00:13:49.227
And exactly as we are doing now, they had figured out that if you can stop

00:13:49.227 --> 00:13:53.502
people coming into contact with each other, then that is

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:59.922
pretty much the most effective way to squash it, to eradicate the virus.

00:14:01.662 --> 00:14:06.972
And they had to contain it, they had to stop it being passed from person to

00:14:06.972 --> 00:14:12.822
person, as there was another similarity to the situation that we are in now.

00:14:13.572 --> 00:14:16.002
They also didn't have a vaccine.

00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:20.659
But the other thing that they didn't have, which we

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:25.325
of course do have now, is some kind of global health

00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:30.125
authority that can coordinate a response across the whole world.

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:35.595
Back in 1918 it was every country for itself.

00:14:35.786 --> 00:14:42.116
There was no WHO until 1948, and communication and collaboration

00:14:42.116 --> 00:14:48.566
between doctors and health officials was a whole lot more complicated than it is now.

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:57.256
So the response was much more contained on a country or even municipal or city level.

00:14:58.944 --> 00:15:02.910
Different cities in the US would respond in different ways.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.970
There wasn't really a coordinated response whereby every city employed the same

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:14.510
measures, which is another interesting parallel with today's situation perhaps.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.590
But some of the strategies that they

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.490
implemented back then were also quite ingenious.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:28.209
In New York, for example, to cut down the amount of people traveling in

00:15:28.209 --> 00:15:35.034
rush hour they made different types of shops and offices open and close at different times.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.162
Another controversial thing that was done, and it's

00:15:39.162 --> 00:15:42.874
still debated whether this was actually a good policy,

00:15:42.874 --> 00:15:47.734
was that in New York the schools were kept open, they weren't closed.

00:15:49.084 --> 00:15:54.878
The theory behind this was that in New York there was a very

00:15:54.878 --> 00:16:00.813
large immigrant population who lived in very cramped, closed

00:16:00.813 --> 00:16:07.983
conditions, and that the children would be better outside that situation than in it.

00:16:09.423 --> 00:16:15.403
Another reason that they decided to do this was also that the authorities

00:16:15.423 --> 00:16:22.293
could pass messages to the immigrant population about the virus through the children.

00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:29.763
Lots of these immigrants had very poor English, and so their children would learn about the

00:16:29.763 --> 00:16:36.286
latest advice at school, then they would return home and inform their parents.

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:41.776
So that's one quite interesting policy, although, as I

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:45.886
said, it's still debated whether it actually did any good.

00:16:48.016 --> 00:16:52.516
There are, however, a few decisions that cities took back then that

00:16:52.516 --> 00:16:57.466
we can look back at and say, that seemed to work or that didn't work.

00:16:59.026 --> 00:17:04.126
And specifically the cities in the United States that closed down for the

00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:09.496
longest, versus the ones that opened up quickly or didn't really close at all.

00:17:10.673 --> 00:17:14.255
It might not surprise you to find out that the ones that kept

00:17:14.255 --> 00:17:18.165
closed, that kept their social distancing rules for longer,

00:17:18.165 --> 00:17:21.738
such as St Louis, not only lost fewer

00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:26.968
lives, but had a stronger economic recovery in the longterm.

00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:34.858
So, closing down actually helps you bounce back and grow faster afterwards.

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:41.578
This is of course something that public health officials, economists, policy

00:17:41.578 --> 00:17:46.902
makers and politicians in the United States are well aware of, but there

00:17:46.902 --> 00:17:53.037
is an election this year and telling people to stay at home and not allowing businesses

00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:58.676
to reopen, that isn't always a particularly popular decision with people,

00:17:58.676 --> 00:18:05.363
even if our experience of the world's most deadly pandemic suggests that it might be

00:18:05.363 --> 00:18:10.943
the better decision, both from a public health point of view and economic point of view.

00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:17.068
One other fascinating story about The Spanish Flu

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:23.403
with which we will end today's podcast, and I will leave you to draw any parallels

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:30.033
you want with what is going on today, is how all sorts of nonqualified people start

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:38.403
suggesting some very strange cures for it, and they all seem to have an ulterior motive.

00:18:40.233 --> 00:18:45.903
On June the 28th, 1918 there was a notice in the British

00:18:45.903 --> 00:18:52.713
papers that advised readers of the symptoms of the flu and gave them some

00:18:52.713 --> 00:18:57.359
tips and suggestions on things they could do to prevent it.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:05.119
The notice stated that a certain type of mint, a sweet, a candy, was

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:10.492
the best way to prevent the infection, and that everyone, including

00:19:10.492 --> 00:19:16.192
children, should take at least five of these mints per day until they felt better.

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:21.349
However, it turned out that this wasn't an official government notice.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:22.189
Not at all.

00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:27.904
It was actually an advertisement, and advert, by a company called

00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:33.154
Formamints, who surprise surprise, made the mints.

00:19:34.994 --> 00:19:39.044
Well, if I bring it back to what's going on today, I guess you are

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:43.574
probably better off sucking mints than doing some of the other things

00:19:43.814 --> 00:19:47.954
that have been suggested by various people in positions of power.

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.404
I think we both know who I'm talking about here.

00:19:54.547 --> 00:19:59.137
And with that little anecdote comes the end of this introduction

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:03.187
to The Spanish Flu and some of the more interesting stories behind it.

00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:09.577
It is a fascinating period in human history and for obvious reasons it's

00:20:09.577 --> 00:20:13.567
something that policy makers, public health officials and politicians

00:20:13.837 --> 00:20:16.987
have started to pay a lot closer attention to.

00:20:18.187 --> 00:20:23.227
Yes, there are of course lessons that we can learn from history and The Spanish Flu is

00:20:23.227 --> 00:20:28.327
no exception, but we should be a little wary of reading too much into it

00:20:29.752 --> 00:20:35.204
The world was a very different place and we are significantly better equipped now

00:20:35.384 --> 00:20:42.134
to deal with a pandemic than the world was a hundred years ago, after four years of better fighting.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:50.339
But even after all of these scientific and technological inventions, I find it quite

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:56.429
refreshing, in one way, to think about the fact that the guidance on how to beat this

00:20:56.429 --> 00:21:03.779
pandemic, this influenza, is basically exactly the same as it was a hundred years ago, and

00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:09.479
that is stay inside, cover your face and avoid contact with people if you possibly can.

00:21:11.234 --> 00:21:16.214
So I'll just finish by saying that I hope you're keeping well wherever you are.

00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:22.324
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:21:22.594 --> 00:21:28.864
I am Alastair Budge, you stay safe and I'll catch you in the next episode.

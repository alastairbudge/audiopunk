Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:16.142
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:20.142
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:28.622
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about WWE, World Wrestling Entertainment.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:33.362
It might be something you know a lot about, it might be something you know nothing about, but

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:40.632
whatever category you’d put yourself in you can’t deny that the story of WWE is intriguing.

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:46.162
It brings together sport, entertainment, theatre, drugs, murder,

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:51.302
controversy and lots of very muscly men wearing not very much at all.

00:00:51.732 --> 00:00:56.092
So, let’s not waste a minute, let’s get this show on the road, as a

00:00:56.132 --> 00:01:01.252
wrestling promoter might say, and get right into the story of WWE.

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:08.112
For the ancient Greeks, wrestling was the purest form of strength.

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:15.362
Two men, wearing only a small loincloth around their waist, lined up opposite one another in a ring.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:20.742
They would move towards each other, trying to throw the other to the ground,

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:26.132
and score points by holding them there, or forcing them into submission.

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:31.122
There was no cheating allowed - no hitting or punching, no grabbing the

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:36.002
genitals, no biting or putting your fingers in your opponent’s eyes.

00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:39.082
It was all about strength and agility.

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:44.822
It was the most popular sport in Ancient Greece, and it had its fair share of

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:50.642
stars - Milo of Croton and Leontiskos of Messene being two of the best known.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:57.402
And in 708 B.C it was the first non-running sport to be added to

00:01:57.402 --> 00:02:01.092
the Olympics, underlining its status in the minds of the Ancient

00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:06.842
Greeks as a pure and unadulterated expression of physical ability.

00:02:08.222 --> 00:02:13.872
Now, clearly, forms of wrestling have existed in practically every civilisation,

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:18.892
this is by no means me suggesting that it was invented by the Ancient Greeks.

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:24.122
If we stretch the definition of wrestling, you could even argue that this kind

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:28.702
of fighting is what we see happening in the animal kingdom, either with lion

00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:34.452
cubs play fighting or stags, male deer, locking horns to assert their dominance.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:42.162
But we must move forward almost 3,000 years to the 1950s to begin today’s

00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:47.242
wrestling story, which starts with a New Yorker called Vince McMahon.

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:52.062
Vince McMahon was a wrestling promoter, and the force

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.412
behind a company called Capitol Wrestling Corporation.

00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:02.352
In the post-war period, wrestling was just starting to take off in the United States,

00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:08.532
but it was still a localised operation, where promoters in different regions handled

00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:13.092
all of the events, there was no centralised organisation that managed everything.

00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:20.072
McMahon sensed the potential of wrestling - it was fun to watch, it could be done

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:26.742
indoors in a relatively small space, and–importantly–you only needed to have two cameras

00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:32.552
to film it, so it was quite simple and cheap to produce for the growing TV market.

00:03:33.992 --> 00:03:38.762
Little did McMahon know that he would be the start of what would go on to be one

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:44.222
of America’s best known family businesses, and a multi-billion dollar one at that.

00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:49.652
Now, if you are something of a wrestling fan, and you are thinking,

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:55.152
hang on, I know Vince McMahon but I didn’t realise he was that old, this

00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:59.932
Vince McMahon is a different one to the one you are probably thinking of.

00:04:00.862 --> 00:04:07.772
Following the American tradition of parents naming a son after the father, Vincent James McMahon,

00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:15.922
born in 1914, decided to name his second son, a boy who was born in 1945, also Vincent McMahon.

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:20.682
Technically he had a slightly different name, the son was Vincent

00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:24.612
Kennedy McMahon, or Vince McMahon Junior, we could call him.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:31.532
However, a few months after the younger Vince McMahon was born, his parents separated,

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:36.772
and the young boy went to live with his mother and her new husband, his stepfather.

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:39.932
It wasn’t a happy situation.

00:04:40.902 --> 00:04:45.802
McMahon would later reveal that his stepfather was abusive towards him, and

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:50.222
say that he regrets the fact that the man died before he could kill him.

00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:55.552
He lived cut off from his biological father, the elder

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.182
Vince McMahon, not meeting him until he was 12 years old.

00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:06.596
Now, you might wonder why I’m telling you all this, but if you know anything about WWE,

00:05:06.832 --> 00:05:12.572
you’ll know about the importance of backstory, of trying to understand the experiences of

00:05:12.572 --> 00:05:17.642
the characters, understand the problems they face and the struggles they have gone through.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:25.092
The stories in WWE might be scripted, invented for dramatic purposes,

00:05:25.352 --> 00:05:30.362
but the backstory of the McMahon family was no dramatic invention.

00:05:31.252 --> 00:05:35.232
There was Vince McMahon Junior, a young boy who grew up for the

00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:39.652
first 12 years of his life not knowing his wrestling-promoter father.

00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:47.472
When he finally met his father, the pair grew very close, and Junior would later admit to

00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:53.902
idolising his father, and wanting to follow in his footsteps and enter into the world of wrestling.

00:05:55.182 --> 00:06:01.992
His father didn’t allow him to become an actual wrestler, but in 1969, at the age

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:08.142
of 24, Junior was allowed to become a ring announcer and commentator, essentially

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:13.342
the person who stands on the side of the ring announcing the entrance of the stars.

00:06:14.852 --> 00:06:18.192
From his position outside the ring, he grew within

00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:21.332
the company, taking on more and more responsibilities.

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:27.812
Vince McMahon Junior was clearly a talented businessman, but he had had very

00:06:27.872 --> 00:06:31.912
differing views to his father about the direction in which the company should go.

00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:37.872
The older McMahon was more traditional, believing that the role of the wrestling

00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:43.182
promoter was to exist behind the scenes, helping direct and promote the show.

00:06:44.372 --> 00:06:46.822
McMahon Jr’s ambitions were greater.

00:06:47.652 --> 00:06:51.812
He wanted to turn the company into a mainstream sport, something that

00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:56.212
millions of people around the world would watch on live TV, attracting

00:06:56.212 --> 00:07:00.522
the biggest stars, and of course, making lots of money in the process.

00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:08.082
And, in 1982 the younger McMahon bought the company from his father, and it’s

00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:13.922
here that the trajectory of the company, and the sport as a whole, changes.

00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:20.298
Unlike in Ancient Greece, the wrestling that the McMahon family produced was

00:07:20.308 --> 00:07:25.009
already scripted and staged - the wrestlers took turns  to put each other

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:30.419
into different positions, the match is pre-planned, it is more entertainment

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.819
than competitive sport, relying on backstories, and star wrestlers.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:41.019
Even before the younger McMahon took over, the sport had its fair share of stars.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:49.849
There was Andre the Giant, the French wrestler who weighed 220 kilograms and stood 224 cm tall.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.977
And there was Bruno Sammartino, or "Bruno Sammartino", an Italian-American

00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:59.917
wrestler who was given the nickname “The Strongest Man in The World”.

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:06.737
But it would be McMahon Junior who would really sense the star potential of individual

00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:11.937
wrestlers to grow the sport, and after he took over the company from his father

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:17.987
one of his main focuses was to cultivate and develop wrestlers with star potential.

00:08:19.337 --> 00:08:25.947
And there is no better example of a star cultivated by McMahon than Terry Gene Bollea.

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:33.267
Now, if you don’t recognise this name, you probably know him by his stage name, Hulk Hogan.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:39.737
If you can picture Hulk Hogan, you’ll know that he looks and sounds like a showman.

00:08:40.357 --> 00:08:44.197
He is huge, of course, and had trademark blonde hair

00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:47.647
with a little peroxide blonde handlebar moustache.

00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:55.867
He really was a star, and his nationwide appeal helped turn McMahon’s wrestling brand from a sport

00:08:56.007 --> 00:09:02.247
enjoyed by some hardcore fans to one that could be found on American TV several times a week.

00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:11.120
Now, the story of the growth of WWE is full of twists and turns, and rather than going

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.850
through all of the chronological detail, I thought it would be more interesting to focus on

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:24.387
three areas or themes, all of which help us understand the history and development of WWE.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:31.843
First, the scripted element of it, so that’s the extent to which it is entertainment vs.

00:09:31.887 --> 00:09:38.553
sport, and here I’ll introduce you to a fun and unusual English term called “kayfabe”.

00:09:39.723 --> 00:09:44.433
Secondly, wel'll talk about the controversies surrounding it, which we’ll

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:48.113
look at through the lens of one wrestler in particular, Jimmy Snuka.

00:09:49.373 --> 00:09:56.633
And finally, we’ll look to the future of WWE without its talismanic leader, Vince McMahon Junior.

00:09:57.793 --> 00:10:01.493
So, first, as to the question of the extent to which

00:10:01.493 --> 00:10:05.473
WWE is “fake”, this is obviously a popular question.

00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:11.763
If you Google “is WWE fake”, you’ll be presented with 76 million results.

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:16.713
And there is a moment in every young wrestling fan’s life when they are

00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:21.823
told, perhaps by an older brother or friend, that wrestling is “fake”.

00:10:22.853 --> 00:10:29.983
But how fake exactly is it, and how does this tie into an understanding of the history of the sport?

00:10:31.143 --> 00:10:35.883
Well, although professional wrestlers are forbidden from commenting on it, it’s

00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:40.853
well-known that matches are choreographed in advance, they are pre-arranged.

00:10:42.093 --> 00:10:46.963
The wrestlers know what moves they are going to do next, when they supposedly punch each other in

00:10:46.973 --> 00:10:53.333
the face, the blows are deflected and softened, and the winner is decided before the match starts.

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:59.633
Of course, this is not to minimise the athletic ability of the wrestlers.

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:04.383
Sure, some might look like they spend their days sitting at a bar drinking

00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:09.563
beer, but being able to run around a ring, lift other huge men into the air,

00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:15.083
and throw yourself in the air, this all requires some serious physical talent.

00:11:16.283 --> 00:11:21.713
But it is all, almost without exception, staged, pre-planned.

00:11:23.213 --> 00:11:25.763
There is actually a technical term for this.

00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:32.263
It’s kayfabe, which is the presentation of staged performances as genuine or authentic.

00:11:32.813 --> 00:11:38.013
It was first used in the context of wrestling, but it’s actually used to describe

00:11:38.013 --> 00:11:43.853
some social media clips too - for example people on TikTok or Instagram making

00:11:43.853 --> 00:11:48.823
videos about their morning routine which are presented as completely authentic and

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:55.323
genuine, taking place as the person is doing this, but are in fact completely staged.

00:11:56.243 --> 00:12:01.083
Or there are even people who take videos of themselves to make it look like they

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:06.783
are being interviewed on a podcast, but there isn’t any podcast, it’s all Kayfabe.

00:12:08.133 --> 00:12:15.543
Now, to bring this back to WWE, Vince McMahon, unlike his father, realised that people might

00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:22.243
have come to a wrestling match to watch the acrobatics, but the reason they followed, the reason

00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:27.443
they bought all the merchandise, the reason they would pay $50 to watch a match on pay per view

00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:33.303
TV, was because they really wanted to follow the soap opera of what the characters would do.

00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:40.233
McMahon’s WWE focussed on storylines, of feuds and rivalries

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:44.243
between characters, allowing the cameras to go behind the scenes.

00:12:45.423 --> 00:12:51.313
McMahon himself, the very boss of the entire operation, was himself a character.

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:57.353
In fact, McMahon’s ownership of the company wasn’t well-known among fans for many

00:12:57.353 --> 00:13:03.053
years - he presented himself as a commentator, merely another character in the soap opera.

00:13:04.123 --> 00:13:08.343
Now, you might think the storylines in WWE are great,

00:13:08.473 --> 00:13:10.293
you might think they are boring and predictable.

00:13:11.213 --> 00:13:16.423
No matter what you think, it was these storylines that managed to attract a more mass

00:13:16.473 --> 00:13:20.193
market audience than had been attracted to the sport under his father’s stewardship.

00:13:21.783 --> 00:13:26.643
McMahon nurtured huge stars, and gave them all roles to play.

00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:32.003
Some were the bad guys, the wrestlers that fans loved to hate.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:36.273
Others were the good guys, wrestlers that fans could rely on

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:40.363
to play clean and deliver great performances time after time.

00:13:41.813 --> 00:13:47.133
The point was that you might start watching as a child and get hooked by the story.

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:52.763
You would have your favourite wrestler, you would watch their progress, and follow every match.

00:13:53.313 --> 00:14:00.023
So when you found out that it was scripted, it almost didn’t matter, as you had grown to follow

00:14:00.023 --> 00:14:04.513
the characters more than worry about whether or not the wrestler’s head really hit the table.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:11.558
Now, moving on to the controversies of WWE, if you didn’t know so already, it

00:14:11.558 --> 00:14:16.178
will probably not surprise you to find out that the sport has been plagued with

00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:22.635
controversies: sexism, drug abuse, exploitation, sexual misconduct and even murder.

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:32.455
There are too many to mention, but I wanted to explore this angle, this side of the WWE, through the

00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:41.700
story of one man, James Reiher Snuka, who you might know by his stage name, Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka.

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:47.675
Jimmy Snuka had joined WWE, or WWF as it was then called,

00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:52.425
in 1982, just as Vince McMahon took over from his father.

00:14:53.895 --> 00:15:01.025
He was cast as a bad character, a baddie, but he was popular with fans due to his acrobatic style.

00:15:01.865 --> 00:15:04.905
He pioneered the style of wrestling where one wrestler

00:15:05.045 --> 00:15:08.505
would climb up the ropes and jump down on his opponent.

00:15:09.795 --> 00:15:15.165
He also had a long-standing feud with another wrestler called “Rowdy” Roddy

00:15:15.175 --> 00:15:20.395
Piper, who would come into the ring wearing a kilt to the sound of bagpipe music.

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:25.475
He was actually Canadian, but WWE wanted to make the most of his

00:15:25.475 --> 00:15:29.395
Scottish heritage, turning him into a bagpipe-playing Scotsman.

00:15:30.475 --> 00:15:36.205
And in one famous scene, Roddy Piper broke a coconut over Jimmy

00:15:36.205 --> 00:15:40.365
Snuka’s head - the relevance of this will become clear in a minute.

00:15:41.622 --> 00:15:43.552
Now, back to Jimmy Snuka.

00:15:44.052 --> 00:15:47.322
He was a popular wrestler, and a successful one at that.

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:52.792
But beneath the veneer of success, like many WWE

00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:56.872
stars, he was fighting some serious personal demons.

00:15:58.392 --> 00:16:01.522
Like many professional wrestlers, he pumped his body

00:16:01.682 --> 00:16:05.032
full of steroids, of performance-enhancing drugs.

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:11.612
LIke many professional wrestlers, he also turned to drink and drugs, and

00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:15.452
would later admit that he had a serious cocaine and alcohol addiction.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:22.522
But in 1983, remember this is the year after Vince McMahon took over from his

00:16:22.522 --> 00:16:27.922
father, something happened that would make everything else pale in comparison.

00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:33.372
Shortly after filming a WWF match, and back in his

00:16:33.372 --> 00:16:38.162
hotel room, he called 911, he called for an ambulance.

00:16:39.202 --> 00:16:42.792
His girlfriend, another professional wrestler called Nancy

00:16:42.822 --> 00:16:46.902
Argentino, had had an accident and she wasn’t breathing.

00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:50.832
The paramedics arrived to find that she had been

00:16:50.852 --> 00:16:54.762
badly beaten, and hours later she was declared dead.

00:16:56.425 --> 00:17:04.682
Jimmy Snuka was the only suspect, but miraculously, he was let off, he wasn’t charged with…anything.

00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:09.962
It would later be alleged that Vince McMahon had contacted

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:13.572
the police to make sure that his star got off scot free.

00:17:14.392 --> 00:17:19.592
And Snuka himself would later write in his biography that Vince McMahon arrived

00:17:19.592 --> 00:17:25.392
at the police station with a briefcase, and then Snuka was allowed to walk free.

00:17:27.092 --> 00:17:32.412
Nancy Argentino’s family would eventually press charges against Snuka, and in

00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:39.812
1985, three years after her death, Snuka was forced to pay $500,000 compensation.

00:17:40.912 --> 00:17:43.782
However there is no evidence that he paid a penny

00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:46.762
of it, saying that he simply didn’t have the money.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:53.152
I guess if you are feeding a serious alcohol and cocaine addiction, as well as pumping your body

00:17:53.152 --> 00:17:58.902
full of steroids, then no matter how famous you are, you probably don’t have a lot of spare cash.

00:18:00.322 --> 00:18:05.842
And, miraculously, this was not the end of Jimmy Snuka’s pro wrestling career.

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:11.102
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he continued wrestling

00:18:11.102 --> 00:18:14.692
professionally, not always with McMahon’s WWE, it should be said.

00:18:15.922 --> 00:18:21.412
It was almost as if nothing had happened to Nancy Argentino, when what had really

00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:26.322
happened seemed strongly to be that she had been beaten to death by Jimmy Snuka.

00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:31.112
However, justice would eventually come for Snuka.

00:18:31.872 --> 00:18:37.442
In 2015, with Snuka now in his 70s, the case was reopened.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:42.582
He was arrested and charged with murder, but was ultimately

00:18:42.652 --> 00:18:45.882
deemed unable to stand trial because of his mental condition.

00:18:47.332 --> 00:18:51.322
Remember that he was smashed in the head with a coconut and he

00:18:51.322 --> 00:18:55.212
made his name for launching himself from high up onto his opponent?

00:18:56.372 --> 00:19:01.202
His lawyers would contend that his constant head injuries had brought on dementia.

00:19:02.332 --> 00:19:05.792
He never stood trial, and died in 2017.

00:19:07.452 --> 00:19:15.742
Before his death, however, his wife brought a class action lawsuit against WWE, alleging that the

00:19:15.752 --> 00:19:22.382
company was responsible for her husband’s brain damage because it pushed him–and other wrestlers–to

00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:28.542
their physical limits, subjecting them to constant brain injuries in the name of entertainment.

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:34.432
The case was dismissed, but it highlighted the pressure, both

00:19:34.662 --> 00:19:39.022
mental and physical, that their career puts on a wrestler.

00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:46.272
Clearly, this is just one example of the many scandals that have plagued WWE.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:52.742
You might remember Chris Benoit, a Canadian wrestler who killed his wife and son before

00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:58.902
killing himself, or Owen Hart, another wrestler who fell to his death during a wrestling match.

00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:04.602
And in recent years, the greatest scandals for WWE have

00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:08.322
revolved around its talismanic leader, Vince McMahon.

00:20:09.532 --> 00:20:13.692
He has stood accused of everything from covering up the death of Nancy Argentino

00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:18.802
through to sexual assault of employees, and in fact was forced out of the

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:23.402
company when these allegations were at their peak, in the summer of 2022.

00:20:24.732 --> 00:20:28.992
And this takes us to the present day, and even the future.

00:20:30.432 --> 00:20:35.642
Vince McMahon had almost single-handedly turned WWE into

00:20:35.642 --> 00:20:38.682
a household name and a multi-billion dollar company.

00:20:40.162 --> 00:20:44.712
Its corporate website boasts that it creates 7 hours of original

00:20:44.712 --> 00:20:50.732
programming every week, broadcasting to 180 countries in 30 languages.

00:20:51.862 --> 00:20:59.972
Clearly, it is a big deal, but its figurehead, Vince McMahon Junior, is not so junior anymore.

00:21:01.082 --> 00:21:06.328
He was born in 1945, meaning that he’ll be 78 this year.

00:21:07.858 --> 00:21:13.928
He technically retired as CEO of WWE in 2022 after it was revealed that he had

00:21:13.928 --> 00:21:19.638
paid $12 million in hush money to cover up allegations of sexual misconduct.

00:21:21.178 --> 00:21:28.038
His daughter, Stephanie, took over as co-CEO, but her father was still the majority owner,

00:21:28.598 --> 00:21:33.868
leading many to believe that it was still him pulling the strings, he was still in control.

00:21:35.238 --> 00:21:41.288
But he can’t go on forever, so, what happens to WWE when he is out of the picture?

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:47.288
Well, the next plot twist is that McMahon, as of the time of recording this

00:21:47.288 --> 00:21:53.058
episode, has agreed to merge with the owner of UFC, Ultimate Fighting Championship.

00:21:53.648 --> 00:22:01.048
He has agreed to sell WWE essentially, to create a huge company focussed on fighting and wrestling.

00:22:02.338 --> 00:22:07.318
McMahon has said he is going nowhere, but he is no spring chicken.

00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:13.388
Will WWE be able to survive without the force that has powered it for the past 50 years?

00:22:14.498 --> 00:22:19.258
Sure, McMahon has been accused of being old and out of touch,

00:22:19.558 --> 00:22:23.878
recycling the same old tired storylines and character tropes, so much

00:22:23.878 --> 00:22:28.308
so that WWE is already losing its allure with a younger audience.

00:22:28.885 --> 00:22:34.958
And he has been plagued with all sorts of accusations, any one of which could lead to jail time.

00:22:36.038 --> 00:22:41.518
Who knows what will happen, but much like the wrestler who seems to be lying, on the floor,

00:22:41.858 --> 00:22:47.932
out cold, only to jump up and surprise his opponent with a blow from behind, if there’s

00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:54.012
anything we know about Vince McMahon, is that there’s nothing he likes more than a plot twist.

00:22:56.252 --> 00:23:01.175
OK then, that is it for this short exploration of WWE.

00:23:01.732 --> 00:23:05.672
Whether you’re a die-hard WWE fan, or whether it’s something you only

00:23:05.682 --> 00:23:09.092
had a passing awareness about, well, I hope it was an interesting one.

00:23:10.052 --> 00:23:13.192
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:13.942 --> 00:23:18.912
For the WWE fans, past or present, why do you think it is so popular?

00:23:19.242 --> 00:23:21.472
What is it about it that is so appealing?

00:23:22.142 --> 00:23:28.632
And if you aren’t a WWE fan, what do you think the enduring popularity of the genre tells us?

00:23:29.442 --> 00:23:32.512
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

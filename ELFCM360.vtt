Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.000
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.129
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.140
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is the start of another

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.160
three-part mini-series, this time on The Great American Con Artist.

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:34.639
In today’s episode we are going to be talking about a festival that went horribly wrong,

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:40.469
next up we’ll learn about a man who made tens of millions of dollars by convincing his

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.659
followers to follow an ancestral lifestyle, which it turned out he wasn’t following himself.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.469
And in the final episode we’ll meet a young girl from Russia who managed to convince

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.229
the creme de la creme of New York City that she was someone completely different.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.519
These are all wonderful stories where we’ll look closely at what happened, the people who actually

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:09.429
did the conning, and their motivations for it, and look at why so many people fell for it.

00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:16.631
OK then, without further ado, let’s learn about the story of the Fyre Festival.

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:24.901
December 12th, 2016, was an unremarkable day in terms of world news.

00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.061
On Instagram, however, something peculiar happened.

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:37.221
At exactly the same time, 63 people posted exactly the same picture.

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:42.171
The picture itself was unremarkable, it was strange, even.

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.941
It wasn’t even a picture, it was just the colour, orange.

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:53.291
These 63 people weren’t just your random, run-of-the-mill Instagram user.

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.311
They were some of the most glamorous and famous people on the platform.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:04.961
Supermodels like Bella Haadid and Emily Ratajkowski, and celebrity influencers like Kendall Jenner.

00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:14.031
Within 24 hours, these cryptic orange Instagram posts had been seen 300 million times.

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:16.611
What were they all about?

00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:22.301
Well, the picture itself held no clues, it was just an orange square.

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.951
The text, the caption, however, did.

00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:32.041
It announced a festival, “Fyre Festival”, with a link to a website.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.191
On that website was a video with supermodels dancing around on an

00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:41.451
idyllic desert island in the Bahamas, having the time of their life.

00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:48.961
They were all going to Fyre Festival, or so the social media posts would have you believe.

00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.651
But the celebrities weren’t the only attraction.

00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:57.201
There would be amazing music, with Major Lazer and Blink-182.

00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:01.411
There would be celebrity chefs and mouth-watering food.

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:06.441
It would be, so the marketing video claimed, "an immersive

00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:10.251
music festival on the boundaries of the impossible".

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.481
No wonder all of these celebrities were lining up to go.

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:19.141
It was hyper exclusive, but the good news was that you too

00:03:19.401 --> 00:03:24.571
could go to the festival, for as little as $500 for a day pass.

00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:27.731
Sure, that was the cheapest ticket.

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:37.051
Prices got as high as $12,000 for the full VIP experience, but, for a small fee, you too could party

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:42.451
with celebrities and supermodels on this wonderful Caribbean island and have the time of your life.

00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:47.541
As you might expect, it was an attractive proposition,

00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:51.411
and within 24 hours the festival was sold out.

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:57.001
The festival was scheduled to take place at the end of April the following

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:02.021
year, so the organisers had just over four months to prepare for the

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:06.831
most exclusive festival in the world, and deliver on their promises.

00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:12.337
As you might imagine, given that this is a mini-series about

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:16.037
Great American Con Artists, it didn’t quite go to plan…

00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:21.907
Now, before we get into exactly what happened, I must tell you about

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:27.337
the man behind this festival, The Fyre Festival, because, as is so

00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:31.777
often the case, there is one individual at the centre of the con.

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:35.735
This man’s name was Billy McFarland.

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:41.897
He was 25-years-old, and already had a number of entrepreneurial ventures behind him.

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:47.537
When he was 22, he had founded a company that sold an black card

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:51.517
that gave you access to exclusive bars, clubs and restaurants.

00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:58.057
And he had gone on to found another app called Fyre, which allowed people to book

00:04:58.127 --> 00:05:03.807
artists, musicians, directly, without having to go through middlemen or agents.

00:05:04.857 --> 00:05:11.167
And in fact, Fyre Festival was first intended as a way to promote this Fyre

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:16.107
app, but the festival would come to overshadow the app it was meant to promote.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:22.347
The thing to understand about Billy McFarland is that, from an early age,

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:28.037
and for all of his failings, he had a keen understanding of the value of

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:33.014
exclusivity, and he knew how much people were willing to pay to get it.

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:37.777
A key part of this strategy was to involve celebrities.

00:05:38.407 --> 00:05:42.687
You heard at the start about how he used supermodels to announce the festival,

00:05:43.087 --> 00:05:47.677
but he also brought in a celebrity business partner in the form of the

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:52.007
rapper, Ja Rule, who you might remember from hits like “Always on Time”.

00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:59.747
Having celebrity endorsements gave Billy McFarland and the festival credibility and exclusivity.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:05.987
After all, if Ja Rule was involved, the music would be great, and if the most famous

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:11.337
supermodels in the world were going, well it was surely going to be a luxurious experience.

00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:19.277
The problem was, behind the scenes, McFarland didn’t actually have anything organised yet.

00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:23.537
He didn’t, it would later transpire, even have an island.

00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:29.127
He had initially promoted the festival as taking place on a small Caribbean

00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:33.647
island called Norman's Cay, which was where the promotional video was filmed.

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:37.407
Norman's Cay is an idyllic place.

00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:39.957
I mean, it’s a tiny Caribbean island.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:45.297
And he had managed to persuade the owners of Norman's Cay to lease

00:06:45.307 --> 00:06:49.377
him their island for the Fyre Festival, but on one condition.

00:06:50.227 --> 00:06:54.697
See, Norman’s Cay was used as a base by a man called Carlos

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:59.077
Lehder, a business associate of the drug lord Pablo Escobar.

00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:06.535
The owners said, “Billy, you can use the island but you are not allowed to mention this connection”.

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:12.425
But McFarland, as a marketer at heart, couldn’t resist.

00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:18.515
Telling people that they could go to a festival on Pablo Escobar’s private island just sounded

00:07:18.515 --> 00:07:25.785
so good, and marketing materials for the festival continued to mention Pablo Escobar, despite

00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:32.148
the fact that, firstly, Pablo Escobar never actually owned the island and secondly, more

00:07:32.148 --> 00:07:38.648
importantly, that the current owners of the island has expressly told McFarland not to do this.

00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:45.568
The Escobar reference might have sold tickets and helped build up buzz for

00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:50.398
the event, but it meant that the island’s owners simply cancelled the contract

00:07:50.548 --> 00:07:55.008
with the festival, leaving McFarland without an island to hold his event.

00:07:56.298 --> 00:08:01.148
Importantly, McFarland and the festival’s organisers never told any of

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:05.228
the ticket holders about this, and continued to mention Pablo Escobar,

00:08:05.898 --> 00:08:10.258
even when they had no idea where the festival would actually take place.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:16.738
He did eventually manage to find another location for the festival, but it

00:08:16.738 --> 00:08:20.598
was not quite the idyllic desert island that people thought it would be.

00:08:21.728 --> 00:08:25.238
He managed to come to an agreement with the government of The Bahamas

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:29.648
to hold the festival in a part of an island called Great Exuma.

00:08:30.368 --> 00:08:33.168
Now, Great Exuma looks like a lovely place.

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:36.458
I mean, it’s an island in the Bahamas, it has lovely

00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:39.768
beaches, crystal clear waters, and wonderful weather.

00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:42.998
But it’s far from private.

00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:48.648
There are lots of other hotels and resorts, and the only place that McFarland could find

00:08:48.898 --> 00:08:54.379
for his exclusive festival was in an abandoned parking lot on the edge of the island.

00:08:55.499 --> 00:09:00.228
This would only be something that festival-goers discovered after they got there.

00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:06.538
So, McFarland had the location, but how does one actually put on

00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:10.318
a luxury festival in an abandoned parking lot in the Caribbean?

00:09:11.378 --> 00:09:16.508
People were scheduled to be flying in, some had paid $12,000 a

00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:20.738
ticket for luxury accommodation, they would be expecting…something.

00:09:22.148 --> 00:09:28.318
It turned out that actually putting on a festival, building the accommodation, bathrooms, stages,

00:09:28.358 --> 00:09:34.818
all of that kind of boring but necessary stuff, well it was complicated, and it was expensive.

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:39.958
In fact, it was far more expensive than McFarland had planned.

00:09:41.238 --> 00:09:46.048
The festival had sold out in record time, and the tickets were expensive.

00:09:46.588 --> 00:09:48.538
But it was not cheap to organise.

00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:53.308
It would later transpire that the influencers who had posted the cryptic

00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:57.938
orange tile and told all of their followers how excited they were to go

00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:02.088
to Fyre Festival had not done this out of the goodness of their hearts.

00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:05.593
They were paid, and paid handsomely.

00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:14.858
One, Kendall Jenner, was paid $250,000 for that one Instagram post.

00:10:16.128 --> 00:10:21.828
Most of these influencers, in fact, seemed to have no intention of going to the festival.

00:10:22.928 --> 00:10:28.868
But their invoices needed to be paid, and McFarland was running out of money, all

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:33.288
before he needed to figure out how to actually put on this festival he was promising.

00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:38.918
McFarland was told that putting on the festival would cost around $50

00:10:38.918 --> 00:10:44.318
million, but that was far more than he had anticipated and budgeted for.

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:49.418
In fact, perhaps it’s more accurate to say that the organisers hadn’t

00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:53.998
really anticipated anything other than the marketing launch, and one

00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:58.338
report has McFarland figuring out how to rent a stage by Googling it.

00:10:59.248 --> 00:11:03.518
He was scrambling for cash, taking loans from anyone who was prepared

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:07.458
to give him money, at times at extortionate rates of interest.

00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:12.328
By his own omission, he would wake up in the morning and need to get millions

00:11:12.328 --> 00:11:15.658
of dollars into his bank account by the afternoon to cover his costs.

00:11:17.252 --> 00:11:20.592
As the date of the festival approached, McFarland and the

00:11:20.592 --> 00:11:23.992
festival organisers started to get more and more desperate.

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:29.382
The cash was running out, and they still had a luxury festival to organise.

00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:33.402
Budgets were slashed, they were cut dramatically.

00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:39.082
There was originally $6 million earmarked for catering, for food for

00:11:39.082 --> 00:11:43.582
the event, with, and I’m quoting directly, “uniquely authentic island

00:11:43.582 --> 00:11:49.092
cuisine...local seafood, Bahamian-style sushi and even a pig roast”.

00:11:50.572 --> 00:11:55.122
Six million quickly turned to one million as McFarland realised

00:11:55.352 --> 00:11:59.232
there simply wasn’t enough money left to deliver on his promises.

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:03.032
There were suggestions that the festival be postponed,

00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:06.802
pushed back a year, but these plans were rejected.

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:13.822
Fyre Festival would go ahead on the last weekend of April, 2017.

00:12:15.392 --> 00:12:19.532
With two weeks left to go, and the festival’s bank balance hovering

00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:23.822
around zero, McFarland turned to the people who had bought tickets.

00:12:25.142 --> 00:12:29.612
The festival would be "cashless [and cardless]", he informed ticket holders.

00:12:30.102 --> 00:12:35.192
To buy food and drink at the festival, you would need to add money to a digital wallet.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.454
How much money should you add?

00:12:37.914 --> 00:12:45.774
Well, McFarland recommended between $300-$500 a day for every day that they were there.

00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:48.174
A good idea, perhaps?

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.544
Maybe it meant that people could frolic around in the crystal-clear

00:12:51.544 --> 00:12:55.346
water with supermodels without worrying about their wallets getting wet.

00:12:56.196 --> 00:13:02.286
And, of course, this money would be kept safe, deposited in a ring-fenced account so nobody other

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:07.676
than the ticket holder could use it, and anything remaining would be returned to them, right?

00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:10.076
Well, not quite.

00:13:10.386 --> 00:13:16.231
In reality, McFarland was planning on using this money to pay his bills, he was scrambling

00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:22.571
for cash, and it would later transpire that around 40% of all of this money that had been

00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:28.241
deposited by ticket holders went straight into paying McFarland’s bills for Fyre Festival.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.730
This wasn’t the only warning sign, though.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:38.150
In the days leading up to the festival, many ticket holders had got increasingly nervous as there

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.230
was very little information given to them about the festival - no information about when their

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.740
private planes were leaving, no pictures of these luxurious villas they had been promised, nothing.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.690
What’s more, there was no way of contacting the festival organisers.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.600
People who emailed got error messages saying that their email couldn’t be

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.420
delivered, and Fyre Festival turned off all commenting on its social media handles.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.960
One website leaked a picture of what looked like a hurricane tent being assembled on a

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:16.050
rocky beach, and posted an anonymous warning that the festival was going to be a disaster.

00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:22.854
And Blink-182, one of the headline bands of the event, pulled out the day

00:14:22.854 --> 00:14:27.214
before, announcing on their social media that they weren’t convinced that

00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:31.304
they would have what they needed to put on a good performance for their fans.

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:38.694
Yet, there was no announcement from the organisers; the festival would go ahead as planned.

00:14:39.864 --> 00:14:45.514
When the first batch of ticket holders arrived at Miami airport, ready to board their exclusive

00:14:45.514 --> 00:14:51.914
private planes, they found that it wasn’t a private plane, but one large commercial airliner.

00:14:52.694 --> 00:14:58.474
A slight disappointment, perhaps, but it was nothing compared to what was to come.

00:14:59.974 --> 00:15:04.004
When guests arrived at this exclusive island, they firstly

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:06.984
realised that the island wasn’t so exclusive at all.

00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:12.784
It was a large island that was shared with lots of hotels and resorts, Fyre Festival

00:15:12.934 --> 00:15:17.484
was only going to take place in one corner of it, in a deserted development.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:24.194
But they weren’t even allowed to go to the place where the festival was supposedly taking place.

00:15:24.754 --> 00:15:28.414
The first batch of people was sent to a restaurant where

00:15:28.414 --> 00:15:32.064
they were greeted by an open bar, free food and alcohol.

00:15:33.134 --> 00:15:39.124
Great, some might have thought, it’s an amazing start to what will be an unforgettable weekend.

00:15:40.424 --> 00:15:44.204
However, this diversion was not part of the plan.

00:15:45.364 --> 00:15:48.744
The reason the organisers had diverted them to the restaurant

00:15:49.004 --> 00:15:52.694
was because there was no festival, nothing was ready.

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:59.844
In a mad rush to try to get everything sorted in time, the organisers had managed to find

00:15:59.854 --> 00:16:06.394
hurricane tents, the tents used after a natural disaster, and were assembling them on the beach.

00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:12.642
To make matters worse, the night before the guests arrived there had been a

00:16:12.652 --> 00:16:18.012
huge storm, and the mattresses that had been left outside were soaking wet.

00:16:19.502 --> 00:16:22.542
Now, the festival goers didn’t know this yet.

00:16:22.952 --> 00:16:27.532
Many of the guests thought that this first “free bar” stop was simply

00:16:27.702 --> 00:16:31.672
part of the plan, a quick stop before the party really started.

00:16:32.821 --> 00:16:38.611
But they were kept there for six hours, without any information about what was happening next.

00:16:40.061 --> 00:16:45.201
Finally, buses were arranged to take them to the festival, and what they saw

00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:50.061
was perhaps the polar opposite of what they had seen advertised on social media.

00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:56.193
Half-assembled hurricane tents, wet mattresses strewn across the tarmac

00:16:56.193 --> 00:17:02.263
outside, a handful of portaloos and a grand total of zero supermodels.

00:17:03.623 --> 00:17:09.093
What they did see, however, was Billy Mcfarland, the genius behind the entire festival.

00:17:10.103 --> 00:17:15.743
As the sun was going down, he emerged and told people that there had been a bit of a mix

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:21.093
up with the accommodation, and people who had booked a villa could go and grab a tent.

00:17:22.523 --> 00:17:25.683
As you might imagine, chaos ensued.

00:17:26.403 --> 00:17:29.233
People ran to try to grab a tent for the night.

00:17:29.783 --> 00:17:33.063
The lucky ones that managed found that there was basically

00:17:33.063 --> 00:17:36.503
nothing inside, some wet mattresses if they were lucky.

00:17:37.983 --> 00:17:41.713
All of the tents quickly filled up, and by this point

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:46.133
only a third of the total expected guests had arrived.

00:17:46.763 --> 00:17:51.963
It was chaos, complete pandemonium, and if it hadn’t been clear before,

00:17:51.963 --> 00:17:56.463
it was now blindingly obvious that the festival could not go ahead.

00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:03.122
The organisers of Fyre Festival put out a message claiming that, “due

00:18:03.122 --> 00:18:07.262
to circumstances out of our control”, the festival couldn’t go ahead.

00:18:08.492 --> 00:18:14.532
But now there was the not-insignificant question of what to do about everyone who had already come.

00:18:15.522 --> 00:18:19.712
This wasn’t a case of saying, “ok, sorry everyone, it’s time to go home now”.

00:18:20.402 --> 00:18:25.006
They were on a Caribbean island, everyone had been told it was a cashless

00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:29.602
and cardless festival, so many simply didn’t have any money on them.

00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:36.742
What’s more, the festival had been organised during one of the busiest weekends on Great Exuma.

00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:41.412
It was the island's Grand Regatta, meaning that all of the other

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:44.542
hotels and accommodation on the island were fully booked up.

00:18:45.902 --> 00:18:50.272
The organisers managed to get a few hundred people back on a plane to Miami

00:18:50.492 --> 00:18:54.852
at 1.30am, while the remaining ticket holders had to wait until the morning.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:19:00.312
And by this time, much like the festival was originally

00:19:00.322 --> 00:19:04.272
born from social media, it was killed in the same way.

00:19:05.272 --> 00:19:09.852
People were posting pictures of the chaotic situation on the ground, with one

00:19:09.852 --> 00:19:15.372
particularly viral post showing a picture of a very sad looking cheese sandwich.

00:19:16.392 --> 00:19:19.882
Remember, that they had been promised luxury food prepared by

00:19:19.882 --> 00:19:24.042
celebrity chefs, and what they were given was something very different.

00:19:25.472 --> 00:19:30.262
Now, while it is perhaps slightly amusing to think about how so many people

00:19:30.552 --> 00:19:35.012
fell for this, and you might argue that if someone is prepared to pay $12,000

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:39.832
to party with celebrities, then they don’t deserve much sympathy, there were

00:19:39.882 --> 00:19:44.592
plenty of people who were badly impacted by being involved with Fyre Festival.

00:19:46.172 --> 00:19:50.732
Most of all, it was the people of Great Exuma, the locals on the island.

00:19:51.602 --> 00:19:57.722
The organisers hired hundreds of people to put up the tents and build the festival infrastructure.

00:19:58.682 --> 00:20:03.962
They were told that they would be paid after the festival, but they never saw a penny.

00:20:05.022 --> 00:20:09.992
The restaurant where the guests enjoyed their free bar, its owner was also never

00:20:09.992 --> 00:20:15.097
paid, and only managed to recover its losses after a public fundraising campaign.

00:20:16.197 --> 00:20:21.357
And all of the Fyre Festival employees also went without their last paychecks, although

00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:26.327
McFarland informed them that they could continue working without being paid, if they wanted.

00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:32.437
And as for the ticket holders, Billy McFarland and the festival organisers

00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:37.617
promised that everyone who bought a ticket would receive a full refund or they

00:20:37.617 --> 00:20:41.277
could get a VIP ticket to the festival when it took place the following year.

00:20:42.607 --> 00:20:47.525
But, of course, there was no more Fyre Festival, and Billy McFarland

00:20:47.777 --> 00:20:50.917
had bigger problems than trying to organise another festival.

00:20:52.257 --> 00:20:55.787
The following month there was a criminal investigation, and

00:20:55.947 --> 00:21:00.077
both McFarland and Ja Rule were the targets of several lawsuits.

00:21:01.397 --> 00:21:07.177
Ja Rule got off scot free, he wasn’t prosecuted, but Billy Mcfarland was arrested.

00:21:08.077 --> 00:21:12.347
He was charged with wire fraud, for defrauding investors

00:21:12.527 --> 00:21:17.267
out of $26 million, and sentenced to six years in prison.

00:21:18.287 --> 00:21:24.267
He served four years, he was released in 2022, and is now a free man.

00:21:25.387 --> 00:21:32.057
At the start of 2023 he went on something of a publicity tour, going on talk shows, podcasts

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:37.107
and doing interviews, where he portrayed himself as being a young guy who got out of

00:21:37.107 --> 00:21:42.617
control, made a mistake for which he was very sorry, but was not inherently a bad person.

00:21:44.047 --> 00:21:49.017
He is, he says, launching a new venture, a new company, which

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:52.957
will be “Fyre Festival Lite, without the capacity issues".

00:21:54.297 --> 00:21:58.617
Who knows what will come next for Billy McFarland, but his critics have

00:21:58.627 --> 00:22:02.697
pointed out that if he thinks the only thing that went wrong at Fyre Festival

00:22:02.827 --> 00:22:08.117
was “capacity issues”, he may well still have a few more lessons to learn.

00:22:09.647 --> 00:22:13.937
OK then, that is it for Billy McFarland and Fyre Festival.

00:22:14.397 --> 00:22:19.717
As a reminder, this is part one of a mini-series on The Great American Con Artist.

00:22:20.037 --> 00:22:23.877
Next up we are going to learn the story of a man who promised health and

00:22:23.877 --> 00:22:28.947
happiness by returning to a diet of liver and cow testicles, and after that

00:22:29.177 --> 00:22:34.157
we’ll meet a German heiress who, it turns out, wasn’t a German heiress after all.

00:22:35.057 --> 00:22:38.067
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.750
Had you heard the story of Fyre Festival before?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.310
Do you think that Billy McFarland deserves a place in a series on con artists, or do you

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:51.220
think he was just a young entrepreneur who got in over his head, who got carried away?

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.437
If he organised another festival, would you go?

00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:58.167
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

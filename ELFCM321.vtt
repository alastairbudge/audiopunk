Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:16.432
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.832
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:25.502
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two, the follow up,

00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:29.082
of our episode on the Florida & Munich hostage crises.

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:33.402
If you haven’t listened to that one yet, I’d recommend you go back and listen to it,

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:38.972
because today we are going to be talking about the lessons learned from them, how they

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:45.162
are now applied in practice, and look at the 9 principles used in hostage negotiations.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.172
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:55.132
In 1961, 11 years before the Munich disaster, John

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:59.662
F Kennedy said “Let us never negotiate out of fear.

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:02.672
But let us never fear to negotiate.”

00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:08.792
It seemed that this message wasn’t applied to the world of hostage negotiations.

00:01:09.812 --> 00:01:16.342
During the hostage crises in Florida and Munich, the security services barely negotiated

00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:22.402
at all, and when they did they simply didn’t understand what the hostage takers wanted.

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:26.352
And the results were, as you heard, fatal.

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:34.082
As Zvi Zamir, the director of the Israeli intelligence services, would later say about the German

00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:41.532
airfield rescue operation, “There was no rescue plan, no preparations, nothing whatsoever”.

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:47.432
Fortunately, Munich and Florida shocked law enforcement

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:50.402
into taking hostage incidents more seriously.

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:55.762
But as there was no real guidance on what to do in a hostage negotiation

00:01:55.762 --> 00:02:00.922
situation, the procedures for this had to be built up from scratch.

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:08.230
The first agency to take action was the New York Police Department, the NYPD.

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:12.862
In fact, all contemporary principles and practices in hostage

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:17.372
negotiation can be traced back to its work in the early seventies.

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:19.562
So, what did it do?

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:25.392
In late 1972 it commissioned two NYPD officers to

00:02:25.392 --> 00:02:28.492
set up a new hostage negotiation training programme.

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:33.652
One of them was a man called Frank Bolz and the other was

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:38.402
Harvey Schlossberg, who had a doctorate in clinical psychology.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:44.112
The men developed three overarching principles for approaching a hostage

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:49.882
crisis: contain the scene, isolate the perpetrators, and establish dialogue.

00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:54.172
In other words, firstly, make sure that nobody can

00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:57.452
get in or out of wherever the hostages are being held.

00:02:57.962 --> 00:03:00.972
Secondly, that the hostage takers cannot escape.

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:05.992
And thirdly, start talking to them, establish lines of

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:09.902
communication between the hostage takers and the security services.

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:16.512
Very quickly, an opportunity arose to put these principles into action.

00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:23.642
On January the 19th of 1973, a small gun shop in New York called

00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:28.152
John & Al’s Sporting Goods became the scene of a hostage crisis.

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:33.842
Four men had tried to steal guns from the shop, then when the police

00:03:33.842 --> 00:03:37.532
were called they had taken nine people hostage inside the shop.

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:44.812
The NYPD established communication with the hostage-takers, conceding small

00:03:44.812 --> 00:03:49.422
demands for food and cigarettes in return for the release of hostages.

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:55.202
Although the hostage takers sometimes fired, and one policeman

00:03:55.202 --> 00:04:00.152
was unfortunately killed, the NYPD never returned a single shot.

00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:07.182
47 hours after the siege in the store began, all nine hostages

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:12.192
were released, unharmed, and the four hostage-takers were arrested.

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:19.132
Things seemed to be moving in the right direction, and the situation could have been a lot worse.

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:25.032
There was however one critical flaw in the store hostage crisis response.

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:30.712
There were simply too many negotiators, making the communication chaotic.

00:04:32.092 --> 00:04:38.852
Planners decided that from then on, only a select few, highly trained individuals would be chosen.

00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:45.932
To build up a pool of elite negotiators, the NYPD immediately set up the

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:51.242
first training session based on the work of Frank Bolz and Harvey Schlossberg.

00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:58.592
The first NYPD hostage negotiation training session began in April of 1973.

00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:03.432
The course went into great detail about how to interact with

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:07.532
hostage takers, with people in a hostage or kidnapping situation.

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:12.772
Students learned how to buy time and how to bargain in

00:05:12.772 --> 00:05:16.252
ways that would encourage cooperation from perpetrators.

00:05:17.162 --> 00:05:22.212
Bud Teten, an FBI agent with a background in behavioural science,

00:05:22.402 --> 00:05:24.962
was one of those who attended these early training sessions.

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:31.102
Impressed by what he learned, he set up a similar course for FBI agents

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:35.532
and police officers to deal with national-level hostage incidents.

00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:40.452
The FBI Academy’s two-week negotiation course focused on

00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:44.972
abnormal psychology, case studies, and role playing exercises.

00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:52.932
Communication techniques were the focus, it wasn’t about how to attack in a hostage situation or how

00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:59.882
to use weapons to kill hostage takers safely, the objective was to talk them out of the situation.

00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:07.182
For the course, Teten drew up a list of 9 principles for communicating

00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:11.112
with hostage takers which still inform hostage dialogues today.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:16.032
First, Teten said that the negotiating team must

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.582
measure the emotional stability of the hostage taker.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:27.542
In Florida and Munich, there was no attempt to deeply understand the psychological state of the

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:34.592
perpetrators, and, if you remember, Giffe, the main hostage taker in Florida, was mentally ill.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:41.452
Now, the emphasis was on learning as much as possible about the mind of the criminal.

00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:45.918
The first thing that a negotiator must do is to understand

00:06:45.928 --> 00:06:49.858
the subjects’ motivation, goals, and emotional state.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:56.048
Only then could they plan how to convince them not to kill innocent hostages.

00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:03.818
Second, a negotiator must assess how dedicated a hostage taker is to getting their demands met.

00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:09.778
This was another key failure of the German response to the Munich hostage crisis.

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:14.558
The police offered money to the terrorists because they had completely

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:18.268
misunderstood the terrorists’ devotion to their stated goals.

00:07:18.908 --> 00:07:24.408
They offered them today’s equivalent of over $60 million dollars, but if they had understood

00:07:24.408 --> 00:07:29.748
their motivations properly, they would have known that probably no number would have been enough.

00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:35.478
They were dedicated to getting the prisoners out of prison, their motives were not financial.

00:07:36.878 --> 00:07:42.008
The third principle forbade, it disallowed, law enforcement from ever giving

00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:46.388
into one type of demand: the request from a hostage taker for weapons.

00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:50.258
In no situation would the police give the hostage taker weapons,

00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:53.908
absolutely never, for reasons that I imagine will be clear.

00:07:55.068 --> 00:08:01.068
The fourth principle was to stall for time, to buy more time, which is

00:08:01.068 --> 00:08:04.738
one of the most difficult but most important of the nine principles.

00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:12.418
This is because the first 15, even the first 45 minutes of a hostage crisis are the most dangerous.

00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:18.588
It's when nobody outside the hostage room really knows what’s going on inside.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.308
Neither does anyone know the motivations of the

00:08:22.548 --> 00:08:26.048
hostage taker, nor the likelihood that they will kill.

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:33.118
It's paramount that law enforcement push past this highly fraught first stage by

00:08:33.118 --> 00:08:37.938
getting the hostage taker to talk as much as possible, for as long as possible.

00:08:38.898 --> 00:08:46.738
This does two things, first, it buys time, meaning the hostages survive longer and allows a chance

00:08:46.748 --> 00:08:52.218
for the hostage taker to realise there may be non-violent approaches to obtaining their goals.

00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:58.838
Second, more dialogue enables law enforcement to gather as much information

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:03.898
as possible about the situation and lets them plan the best next moves.

00:09:05.388 --> 00:09:11.838
The fifth principle was that law enforcement should never offer suggestions to the hostage taker.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:16.448
The hostage taker must articulate their demands independently.

00:09:17.798 --> 00:09:22.028
By offering things to them, the authorities may give away needless

00:09:22.058 --> 00:09:26.398
concessions and tip the power balance in favour of the hostage taker.

00:09:26.898 --> 00:09:32.258
It’s all about waiting to see what is requested, and only then deciding

00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:36.768
to accept or reject it, never offering something to the hostage taker.

00:09:38.118 --> 00:09:43.308
The sixth principle was that law enforcement should only give a hostage taker something

00:09:43.678 --> 00:09:48.058
if they think they will get something tactically valuable from them in return.

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:53.838
Every concession to the hostage taker must be tactical and it

00:09:53.838 --> 00:09:58.298
should bring the situation a step closer to a peaceful resolution.

00:09:59.568 --> 00:10:04.918
The seventh principle is to keep the perpetrator making decisions constantly,

00:10:05.228 --> 00:10:09.098
weighing up the risks and benefits of the options being presented to them.

00:10:09.948 --> 00:10:15.628
This buys time but it also exhausts the hostage taker psychologically,

00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:19.308
putting them in a position where they may consider surrender.

00:10:20.048 --> 00:10:27.158
Decisions are tiring, especially when life and death might be involved, so the idea behind this is

00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:34.588
to tire the hostage taker out and get them to think that surrendering might not be so bad after all.

00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:40.698
The eighth principle is to always make it clear to the hostage taker that there is the

00:10:40.758 --> 00:10:47.228
potential for ending the hostage crisis, that surrendering does not necessarily mean failure.

00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:52.208
The negotiator must always make clear that there are alternative

00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:56.958
routes out for them to end the siege, there is always a way out.

00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:03.228
The ninth and final principle is to select the negotiator with care.

00:11:03.848 --> 00:11:07.908
This is an important point because although there were many advances

00:11:07.908 --> 00:11:13.328
in formalising procedures around negotiations, the personal intuition

00:11:13.368 --> 00:11:17.618
and skill of the negotiator has remained an important part of the job.

00:11:18.188 --> 00:11:20.208
The person matters hugely.

00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:26.718
The ideal negotiator has to find the perfect balance between emotional detachment

00:11:26.878 --> 00:11:32.178
from the situation they are in and a capacity to build emotional rapport

00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:37.368
with the hostage taker by finding common ground and by displaying empathy.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:44.418
Clearly, it is a very difficult job, and although these guidelines and processes can be

00:11:44.698 --> 00:11:51.128
followed, it is an incredibly skillful role requiring a combination of experience, a deep

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:57.628
understanding of human psychology, and the ability to adapt to the situation as it unfolds.

00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:02.998
And the hardest hostage negotiations tend to be, as you

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:06.998
might imagine, with situations involving terror groups.

00:12:07.898 --> 00:12:13.188
Not only are the motives typically political, and their demands almost never

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:18.638
actually met, but terror groups are likely to be familiar with the psychological

00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:23.808
principles and tactics used by the police and by the hostage negotiators.

00:12:24.508 --> 00:12:29.755
They will be trained to see and interpret what the police are trying to do, and

00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:35.315
they have their own set of techniques to counter those of the hostage negotiators.

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:40.385
And of course, terrorists tend to be more willing to die for their

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:44.095
cause, which makes them particularly tricky to negotiate with.

00:12:45.085 --> 00:12:52.665
So, to recap, these 9 principles were: measure the emotional stability of the hostage taker, assess

00:12:52.665 --> 00:12:59.595
how dedicated they are to their demands, don’t give them weapons, buy time, don’t offer suggestions,

00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:05.935
only give them something if they ask for it, always force them to make decisions, remind them

00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:12.305
that there’s a way out, and choose the person actually doing the negotiating with great care.

00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:18.985
Now, you are probably familiar with hostage negotiation scenarios from films and TV.

00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:24.585
The police surround a building, there are people pointing their guns towards their targets,

00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:31.005
helicopters swirl overhead, a man shouts into a microphone, “COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP”.

00:13:31.885 --> 00:13:37.795
And perhaps you’re wondering where these nine principles of hostage negotiation come into this.

00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:43.415
In reality, they don’t, most modern hostage situations bear

00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:47.035
little resemblance to how they are portrayed in the movies.

00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:52.485
Over hours, days, and sometimes even weeks, the negotiator and their

00:13:52.685 --> 00:13:57.065
back-up team - from intelligence gatherers to the senior coordinator of

00:13:57.065 --> 00:14:02.235
the mission - will act more like psychologists than police officers, trying

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:06.775
to untangle what is actually motivating the people to threaten violence.

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:10.505
And the good news is it works.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:14.925
The vast majority of hostage negotiations are, thankfully,

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:18.375
resolved without a shot being fired by the police.

00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:24.945
By some counts, modern negotiation strategies have a 95 percent success

00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:28.975
rate, meaning that the situation is resolved without anyone dying.

00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:36.775
As we saw in Florida and in Munich, hostage negotiations used to be very different,

00:14:37.075 --> 00:14:42.115
and this “life and death” situation would normally end in death for everyone involved.

00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:44.945
Luckily, it’s not like this anymore.

00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:50.885
And while there are still tens of thousands of hostage and kidnapping situations

00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:56.335
every year, too many, of course, with some big, some small, the good news

00:14:56.335 --> 00:15:01.385
is that never before in human history have we been better at resolving them,

00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:06.405
so that everyone involved has the best possible chance of getting out alive.

00:15:08.815 --> 00:15:14.605
OK then, that is it for today's episode on How To Negotiate With Hostage Takers.

00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:19.935
I guess and hope that you will never have to negotiate with a hostage taker, or be in a hostage

00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:25.065
situation yourself, but I hope it was interesting in any case, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:29.165
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:15:29.575 --> 00:15:34.195
Does your country have much of a problem with kidnapping, and hostage crises?

00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:38.635
Interestingly enough I discovered that Belgium has one of the highest

00:15:38.635 --> 00:15:41.365
kidnapping rates in the world, which was certainly surprising.

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:45.405
Can you think of ways in which you can apply these hostage

00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:48.295
negotiating techniques to other areas of your life?

00:15:48.975 --> 00:15:52.145
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:15:52.455 --> 00:15:55.225

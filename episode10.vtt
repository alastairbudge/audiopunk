Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast.

00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:12.414
It's December the 20th, just five days before Christmas.

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:18.279
And I guess for some of you, this might mean you're scurrying around trying to find last minute

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.544
presents for your loved ones.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.399
So we are going to be talking about something related to buying stuff or related to how people think

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.017
about companies when buying stuff, and talk about one of the things that makes us decide whether to

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:38.062
buy something from one company or from another, from one brand or from another brand.

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:45.188
Before we get right into the heart of the podcast though, I wanted to remind those of you listening

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:51.226
on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or wherever you might get your podcasts, that you can get the transcript

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:55.976
and key vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:01.104
If you're listening to this on the website with the transcript and key vocabulary in front of you,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:05.079
then congratulations, you are one step ahead of the game.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.909
Also at the end of the podcast, I'll reveal how one huge multinational company made a terrible

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.689
mistake with their messaging when they went to China.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:21.949
Okay, so Christmas presents and slogans.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:27.132
I don't need to tell you that Christmas is obviously a big time for shopping.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:33.552
It's boom time for high-street shops as people manically try to find gifts before Christmas Day.

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:41.566
Some retailers, some shops, especially those selling things like games and toys, do about 30% of

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:48.146
their entire sales just in December And companies are doing everything they possibly can to stand

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:52.646
out, to be remembered, to make you choose them over one of their competitors.

00:01:53.751 --> 00:02:00.045
I used to work in marketing, so I've got a bit of experience with how some of this stuff works, and

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.905
it basically boils down to this:

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:07.635
There are a few categories of things in life that you might be tempted to buy - stuff you need,

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:11.985
stuff you want and sort of don't need and stuff you'd really don't need.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:19.290
With all of this stuff, there are normally hundreds or thousands of different companies that can

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.180
sell you basically the same thing.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.280
Maybe it tastes, looks or feels a little bit different.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:33.036
In many cases, yes, you can tell the difference and you prefer a certain kind of bread, shampoo,

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:40.118
clothes, watch, whatever it might be, but in many cases it does basically exactly the same thing.

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:47.198
Especially with expensive branded goods, they are often almost exactly the same as the cheaper

00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:47.588
version.

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:52.988
But you're paying for something intangible, something that you can't feel, something you can't

00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:53.678
sense.

00:02:54.061 --> 00:03:00.061
It's because it makes you feel different, it makes you feel like you're part of something, like

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:03.271
you're buying into something that's bigger than just the products.

00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:06.288
This is all part of what's called branding.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.920
Now, branding is a complicated subject.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.040
I don't claim to be an expert on it at all, and there are thousands of branding agencies that will

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:23.473
charge hundreds of thousands of dollars to help craft a brand, and we may even have a few guests on

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:27.013
the podcast next year to talk about this if it's of interest to listeners.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.906
But today, as we are just five days away from Christmas, I wanted to talk about one tiny slice of

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:38.079
branding, and that's something called a slogan.

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:42.842
Now, perhaps you haven't heard the word slogan before.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:49.381
It's defined - if you look it up in the dictionary - you'll see the definition as 'a short and

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:56.696
striking or memorable phrase used in advertising.' For example, McDonald's - and I choose this one

00:03:56.696 --> 00:04:00.896
because it is translated into lots of languages has - in English.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:08.173
It's I'm lovin' it, Ich Liebe es in German, C'est tout que j'aime in French, Me encanta in Spanish,

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:10.555
or wo jiu xihuan in Mandarin.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:18.728
The idea is that a slogan should be catchy and functional, reminding consumers of why they like a

00:04:18.728 --> 00:04:22.418
brand in a single bite-sized phrase.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:29.320
It should make you as a, as someone who might buy the product, should make you feel that the slogan

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.315
reflects how you feel towards the company or brand.

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:41.025
It's all trying to make what might otherwise seem like a boring and uninteresting product seem more

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.705
interesting and aspirational.

00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:51.683
Today we are going to take a look at three of the most powerful, or at least three of my favourite,

00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:53.573
slogans in history.

00:04:54.023 --> 00:05:00.493
In English, of course, We're going to look at how they work, why they work, and we'll go through any

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:03.253
clever twists on language that they use.

00:05:04.374 --> 00:05:11.304
These three are all very different - in different industries, different countries, and completely

00:05:11.304 --> 00:05:12.354
different products.

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:15.074
One, you definitely would have heard of.

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:19.215
One you might have heard of, although I don't think so.

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:22.335
And one I'm pretty sure you will not have heard of.

00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:27.871
Okay, so let's start with the one you definitely will have heard of.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:33.211
Some of you may even be wearing a t-shirt with this emblazoned on.

00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:34.771
It's Nike.

00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:39.608
Their slogan is, as you may know, Just Do It.

00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:41.078
Just Do It.

00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:48.891
It has been the key message for Nike or Nike, I should say, if I'm American, since 1988 and has been

00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:51.411
going strong for 30 years now.

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:59.793
Nike's brand is all about empowering people to achieve their goals, to not let anything get in their

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:00.363
way.

00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:07.065
And Nike wants to be the tool to allow them to do exactly what they want to, to allow everyone to be

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:07.545
an athlete.

00:06:08.153 --> 00:06:09.552
So let's take a look at this slogan.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.888
We can break down these three words and look at exactly why they work, right?

00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:15.328
The three words are not complicated.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.068
Just Do It.

00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:20.246
So the first word is 'just'.

00:06:21.036 --> 00:06:27.576
When 'just' is used at the start of a sentence before an imperative, it's like an order, right?

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:30.726
It reinforces the need to do something.

00:06:31.487 --> 00:06:33.463
It also adds a sense of urgency.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:39.223
So 'just shut up' means to ask someone to be quiet right now.

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:44.492
You can use 'just' as a term to reinforce an imperative.

00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:48.476
Just shut up, just go away, just give me it.

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:49.526
That kind of stuff.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:53.285
The second word of the slogan is do.

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:54.695
Okay.

00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:58.385
So you know what this word means, it's a, it's an active word.

00:06:58.445 --> 00:07:00.215
Do isn't active term.

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:07.085
It's also the opposite of don't, the negative term you would use when telling someone not to do

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:07.535
something.

00:07:09.372 --> 00:07:12.489
And the final word of the slogan is it.

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:23.401
Using the pronoun it here without having previously referred to what it is means that it can be

00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:24.721
anything you want it to be.

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:33.322
When you put these three words together, Just Do It, you get a term that makes people think that

00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:39.985
they can do whatever they want, and that Nike is the tool to empower them to achieve their goals.

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:41.425
It's clever, right?

00:07:41.665 --> 00:07:42.895
Just Do It.

00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:43.915
Just Do It.

00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:50.934
And for anyone who might be doubting the power of a slogan like this, just imagine two identical

00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:51.754
white t-shirts.

00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:55.851
One is completely blank, just nothing on it.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.032
And the other has the words, Just Do It on.

00:08:00.374 --> 00:08:07.106
Now think of what the price tag might be on each one, and that gives you an idea of the value of the

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.306
brand and of the slogan.

00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:16.135
Secondly, here's one you might have heard of, but unless you're living in the US you probably

00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:16.615
haven't.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:24.041
It's from the American company Dollar Shave Club, which started out making razorblades and selling

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:25.901
them by subscription, by delivery.

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:31.212
The idea was that you could buy a razor blade for a dollar and they will be delivered to your door

00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:32.562
every week or month.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:41.279
It was a slogan that they used in 2015 shortly before they were bought by the Dutch conglomerate

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:44.129
Unilever for over a billion dollars.

00:08:45.727 --> 00:08:51.427
So the slogan is, and listen carefully here, it's shave time, shave money.

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:56.457
That's shave time, shave money with the 'sh' sound.

00:08:57.647 --> 00:08:59.167
Can you see why this one is clever?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.324
Well, it's a play on words, both visually and audibly.

00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:09.341
Meaning that shave sounds very similar to save.

00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:17.437
And also when you see the words written down, the only difference in the spelling is the addition of

00:09:17.437 --> 00:09:19.237
the H in shave.

00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:27.422
Dollar Shave Club is a very playful brand, and this play on words fits right in with the rest of

00:09:27.422 --> 00:09:29.042
their marketing.

00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:32.175
If you haven't seen their launch video yet.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:35.002
The video they made when they launched the brand.

00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:38.927
Just search for Dollar Shave Club on YouTube and have a look.

00:09:39.197 --> 00:09:39.947
It's hilarious.

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:41.537
And you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:50.610
I'll also put a link in the show notes, So shave time, shave money is playful, yet reinforces the

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:57.240
two core benefits of the service, which are that the company helps save you time because they

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.191
deliver it to your door and they help save you money because they are cheaper.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:10.876
Finally, this is one that you probably won't have heard of, but if you are listening in the UK, then

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:11.416
you might have.

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.981
It was one of my mother's favourites when I was growing up.

00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:24.038
It's from the British home and garden goods company, Ronseal Ronseal makes things like varnish,

00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:29.644
sealant, protective things for fences, doors, and that kind of stuff.

00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:37.513
Basically, really boring products that no one would ever have really thought you could build a fun

00:10:37.513 --> 00:10:38.563
brand around.

00:10:38.953 --> 00:10:45.163
There's nothing fun about buying paint for your kitchen floor or garden fence.

00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:48.771
But Ronseal have a pretty fun and memorable slogan.

00:10:49.971 --> 00:10:57.421
Their slogan, which has been in use since 1994 is It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin.

00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.251
So I'll repeat that.

00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.761
It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin.

00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:10.786
It's so well known in the UK that even the ex-Prime Minister David Cameron used it to describe his

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:11.236
government.

00:11:12.946 --> 00:11:18.796
In a world where companies were trying to come up with more and more aspirational slogans and catch

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:22.126
phrases, which their products couldn't really live up to.

00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:29.926
Ronseal decided to go completely the opposite way and create a incredibly simple slogan.

00:11:31.218 --> 00:11:36.426
It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin means only that the product will work in the way that it

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:41.704
says it will, that it will do what it says it will do on the outside of the tin.

00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:48.867
It's hardly the most aspirational claim by a company, but it really appeals to the British sense of

00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:52.272
self-deprecation, of putting oneself down.

00:11:53.082 --> 00:11:53.892
And it worked.

00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:55.482
I mean, it really worked.

00:11:55.902 --> 00:12:03.312
The slogan catapulted Ronseal well above its rivals, and it's now the market leader in the UK for

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:04.302
goods in its category.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.838
If you're in the UK and you hear someone saying It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin, then you'll

00:12:10.838 --> 00:12:12.278
know where this phrase comes from.

00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:20.199
That's sort of the best possible thing that a brand can hope for, that its slogan becomes used in

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:21.879
language and common parlance.

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:29.319
People then just talking between themselves are in effect doing the marketing and doing the

00:12:29.319 --> 00:12:31.599
advertising for a company for free.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.796
Okay, so that is a quick pre-Christmas summary.

00:12:36.932 --> 00:12:42.931
of three of the most successful company slogans of all time Nikes, Just Do It.

00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:50.371
Dollar Shave Clubs, Shave Time, Shave Money, and Ronseal's, It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin.

00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:57.136
Before we go though, I've just got one quick story about a slogan that went wrong.

00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:00.631
Or rather a translation of a slogan that went wrong.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.860
You've actually already heard it right at the start of the podcast.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.410
It's the McDonald's slogan, I'm lovin' it.

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:13.025
In China, it was translated as wo jiu xihuan.

00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:21.510
This technically means something like, I just like it, but the second word 'jiu' is normally used to

00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:26.280
contradict someone who has said something different previously.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:34.199
So the implication is that the person saying the slogan is defending McDonald's food to someone who

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:35.309
has said it's disgusting.

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:40.769
So the English equivalent might be something like, but I like it.

00:13:41.311 --> 00:13:44.761
The idea is that someone said, Oh, why do you eat that disgusting stuff?

00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:46.801
And the slogan is, but I like it.

00:13:48.148 --> 00:13:53.608
In any case, it does sound a bit stupid when it's pointed out, but it hasn't stopped the success of

00:13:53.608 --> 00:13:54.688
McDonald's in China.

00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:57.304
Okay then.

00:13:57.574 --> 00:14:03.334
As always, if you've enjoyed this podcast and you want to give me a Christmas present that will not

00:14:03.334 --> 00:14:08.794
only take you 20 seconds to do, cost you nothing and leave a big smile on my face, then you can

00:14:08.794 --> 00:14:10.324
leave a review of the podcast.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:16.228
Each review helps more people find the podcast, and the more people who listen well, the better

00:14:16.228 --> 00:14:17.728
it'll get for everyone.

00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:23.133
There'll be another podcast coming out next Tuesday, so that's on the 24th where we'll be telling

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:26.883
the story of how one book made Christmas, what it is today.

00:14:27.104 --> 00:14:28.324
And no it's not the Bible.

00:14:28.714 --> 00:14:33.784
The only clue I'll give you is that it was written 160 years ago in Victorian London.

00:14:34.618 --> 00:14:39.299
You've been listening to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.970
I'm Alastair Budge, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

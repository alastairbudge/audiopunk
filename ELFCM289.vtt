Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:15.941
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:20.271
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:24.611
I’m Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.371
about King Leopold II of Belgium, The Butcher of Congo.

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.771
To his people, King Leopold II was much loved.

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:38.051
To the world, he was a humanitarian and a philanthropist.

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.051
It was all a huge lie.

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:47.211
The Builder King of a new, small European country set his sights on the continent of Africa.

00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:53.107
What would follow would be years of exploitation, torture, and death.

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:58.141
So, let’s get started on this dark but important story.

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.951
Before we begin, let’s have a little bit of historical context.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.981
Leopold II was born in 1835.

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:14.171
He was the second son of King Leopold I, but his older brother, Louis Philippe, died

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:20.331
in infancy, before Leopold was born, making Leopold the heir to the Belgian throne.

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:25.791
His father, Leopold I, was the first King of Belgium, after the

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.641
country broke off from The Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815.

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:37.081
So Belgium as an independent country was only 20 years old when Leopold II

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:43.381
was born, and 50 years old when Leopold became king, aged only 30 himself.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:50.201
Belgium as both a kingdom and a country was established as a constitutional monarchy,

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:56.037
meaning that the newly formed monarch was a “sovereign who reigns but does not rule.”

00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:02.327
This meant that the new king and his children acted as non-political

00:02:02.327 --> 00:02:06.457
heads of state, much like Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:13.027
On a practical basis, this meant that the monarch held some power but wasn’t absolute.

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:17.597
So, we have a new, young king, of a new, young country.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:22.017
King Leopold II ‘s early political career had focused on

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:25.787
the development of Belgium and its expansion as a kingdom.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.747
In practical terms, what did expansion mean?

00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:33.897
Well, it meant the acquisition of colonies around the world.

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:39.217
As a young man, Leopold had travelled widely, visiting

00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:42.407
India and China as well as travelling around Africa.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:49.677
After he became king, at the age of 30, his country saw major social and economic

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:55.187
developments that supported the Belgian people; secular schooling for children, voting

00:02:55.187 --> 00:03:00.467
rights for all men, and various laws against child labour were successfully passed.

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:02.655
So far so good.

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:07.195
These progressive improvements endeared King Leopold to his people.

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:09.865
He was much loved and respected.

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:17.755
All the while, King Leopold’s hopes to expand and grow the Belgian Empire continued.

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:23.695
He earned the moniker, the nickname, “the Builder King”, as he commissioned a

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:29.455
large number of public works, buildings, and urban projects throughout the country.

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:37.465
But it is how he funded these projects and beyond, that the legacy of King Leopold II of Belgium

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:45.275
becomes more insidious, more sinister and the effects of his reign still echo even today.

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:53.345
Remember that as a new kingdom, Belgium lacked physical territory outside of the country’s borders,

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:58.505
having lost much of its global connection after it broke away from the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:05.075
Meanwhile countries throughout Europe, like the UK, France, Portugal,

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:09.315
Spain, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands, had hundreds of years to

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:14.245
expand their colonial reach across the world on nearly every continent.

00:04:15.245 --> 00:04:19.125
King Leopold wanted for himself what these countries had.

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:21.525
He wanted more personal power.

00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:27.695
King Leopold II felt that a country without a colony could not achieve historical

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:33.875
significance, or importance, and his country, Belgium, was late to the party.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.855
As the second king of a new country, he felt it was both

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:42.715
his right and his duty to establish his own colonies.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:48.005
In a letter to his brother, he wrote “the country must be strong,

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:52.705
prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm.”

00:04:54.076 --> 00:05:01.336
On at least two occasions, he hoped that Queen Isabella II of Spain would cede, would give The

00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:06.746
Philippines to Belgium, but he lacked both the funds and the support of his own government.

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:08.886
He would have to look elsewhere.

00:05:10.116 --> 00:05:15.486
Like many other European powers, King Leopold set his sights on the continent of Africa,

00:05:15.906 --> 00:05:23.426
with its rich repository of raw materials like palm oil, ivory, diamonds, tin, tea and cocoa.

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:28.816
After the failed attempts to acquire territory for Belgium, King Leopold

00:05:28.816 --> 00:05:34.306
II, ever ambitious, formed a plan to gain control over the Congo.

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:39.676
But this time, he tried a different tactic, removing the need for

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:43.386
his government’s financial support and executive power altogether.

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:50.886
In 1876, he formed a private holding company called the International African Society.

00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:56.646
Publicly, this company was an international scientific and philanthropic

00:05:56.656 --> 00:06:01.746
association, and indeed, the name does sound friendly and innocent.

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:08.296
Its mission pledged to suppress the East African Slave trade, gurantee

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:12.726
free trade with other colonies and encourage humanitarian efforts.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.826
He sold this lie well.

00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:21.316
He used the cover of this private holding company to establish a colony

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:25.316
in the Congo region for his own financial gain and personal power.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:31.706
He wanted his own personal kingdom in Africa, not for Belgium, but for himself.

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:38.216
To get his Congolese Kingdom, in 1879, he contracted the Welsh-American

00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:43.556
explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who used his knowledge of the region and the

00:06:43.626 --> 00:06:48.996
indigenous Congolese culture to convince the Congolese leaders to sign treaties.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:55.686
Through deception, the local leaders signed away their rights and the use of their own land.

00:06:56.556 --> 00:07:03.216
The chiefs did not know exactly what they had signed, but by signing, they accepted the flag of

00:07:03.216 --> 00:07:08.946
something called the Congo Association, an association that was part of Leopold’s holding company.

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:16.026
The names and details aren’t so important, but what Leopold had essentially tricked

00:07:16.156 --> 00:07:21.641
the Congolese leaders into doing was handing over the control of their land to him.

00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:29.746
With that tricky part out of the way, King Leopold’s next step was to legally acquire the Congo.

00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:33.276
He achieved this at something called the Berlin

00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:38.646
Conference, in Germany which was held between 1884-1885.

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:45.956
It’s here that the Western world powers came together to divide up the continent of Africa - without

00:07:45.956 --> 00:07:52.216
the consideration of actual African indigenous peoples, I might add, and to agree that King Leopold

00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:59.176
was recognised as, the sovereign, or supreme ruler, of what was called the “Congo Free State.”

00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:04.866
Of course, this is horrendous in itself, but perhaps it’s even worse

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:08.896
when you consider quite how much land had been given to Belgium.

00:08:09.816 --> 00:08:14.926
Belgium is a tiny European country, just over 30,000 km2.

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:23.186
During the Berlin Conference, King Leopold was awarded a piece of land totalling 2,600,000

00:08:23.196 --> 00:08:29.446
square kilometres, more than 80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people.

00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:35.946
In May of 1885, it became King Leopold’s own private colony.

00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:44.116
King Leopold in all his colonial manoeuvring had convinced multiple imperial powers that he,

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:49.616
not the country of Belgium, should be in personal control of this territory in the Congo.

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:55.116
These powers believed that under his direction, the region would see a

00:08:55.116 --> 00:09:00.286
suppression of the slave trade, and efforts to push humanitarian policies.

00:09:01.446 --> 00:09:06.966
As an added bonus, Leopold would continue to spread Western ideals and Christianity

00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:12.206
to the continent, all starting in what he would call the “Congo Free State”.

00:09:13.566 --> 00:09:18.416
The reality was that the “Congo Free State” was anything but free.

00:09:19.906 --> 00:09:23.646
In the pursuit of financial supremacy, King Leopold

00:09:23.676 --> 00:09:27.366
quickly went to work and raised a private, brutal, army.

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:32.256
Remember the treaties Sir Henry Stanley got signed on his behalf?

00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:39.036
King Leopold controlled the use of the land and forced many Congolese men to work without pay.

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:47.056
Life got significantly worse when in 1887, a Scotsman by the name of John Boyd Dunlop,

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:53.666
improved the pneumatic rubber tire, with so doing creating an international market for rubber.

00:09:54.786 --> 00:10:00.746
King Leopold’s “Congo Free State” had one of the world’s largest supplies of rubber trees.

00:10:01.816 --> 00:10:06.696
If you thought this might have been good news for the Congolese people, because their country

00:10:06.696 --> 00:10:11.746
was rich in this material that was now in high demand, you couldn’t be further from the truth.

00:10:13.085 --> 00:10:17.835
To meet the international market needs and satisfy his own greed, King

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:22.685
Leopold forced the villages to harvest rubber for him, and imposed

00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:27.585
harsh quotas, high targets on what the villages had to produce.

00:10:28.965 --> 00:10:34.555
To harvest the rubber, the Congolese people had to cut the vines of the trees, and then

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:40.955
often cover their bodies with the rubber just to then painfully scrape it off to collect it.

00:10:42.345 --> 00:10:46.115
If villages didn’t meet their quotas, their targets,

00:10:46.352 --> 00:10:50.515
Leopold’s private army would impose horrific punishments.

00:10:51.665 --> 00:10:53.885
They would hold women and children hostage.

00:10:54.165 --> 00:11:01.015
The army would withhold food from children, sexually harrass the woman, and beat, whip and

00:11:01.015 --> 00:11:06.455
mutiliate the village men if they did not harvest enough of the wild plant to meet the quotas.

00:11:07.725 --> 00:11:12.567
In response to the inhuman treatment, there were frequent uprisings by the villagers.

00:11:13.029 --> 00:11:16.079
They fought the soldiers, hid in the forest and would

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:19.279
even destroy the rubber trees, rendering them useless.

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:28.978
But it was to no avail, King Leopold used his private army to suppress any and all rebellions.

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:36.072
Those who refused to work for King Leopold were beaten, mutilated, or even murdered.

00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:41.542
Indeed there is a horrible picture from this time of a poor Congolese man

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:46.322
sitting down looking at a severed foot and hand, a cut off foot and hand.

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:51.562
These belonged to his five year old daughter, and were cut off

00:11:51.792 --> 00:11:55.222
as a punishment for her father not harvesting enough rubber.

00:11:56.762 --> 00:12:02.232
The more exploitation, the more economic gain for King Leopold, the richer he became.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:07.132
For the people he exploited, the opposite was clearly true.

00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:11.997
Life in Congo was upended, it was turned on its head.

00:12:12.787 --> 00:12:18.127
The regime affected agriculture, and caused widespread disease and starvation.

00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:22.927
It's reported that as many as 10 million Congolese people

00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:26.277
died in the Congo Free State under King Leopold’s rule.

00:12:27.627 --> 00:12:33.117
Back in Belgium, with his royal coffers full, with plenty of money in his bank account,

00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:38.457
the Builder King went to work erecting monuments and constructing private estates.

00:12:39.747 --> 00:12:44.787
The Belgian people, blind to the destruction of the Congo, were delighted

00:12:44.837 --> 00:12:51.487
when in 1897 their king shipped 267 Congolese people to Brussels, the

00:12:51.657 --> 00:12:57.147
Belgian capital, to be put on display, in a vile case of a human zoo.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:02.157
King Leopold put Congolese people on display for public viewing

00:13:02.177 --> 00:13:05.787
on his country estate where he built a mock African village.

00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:13.627
During their time, several died of pneumonia and influenza and were buried in unmarked graves.

00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:18.317
This horrendous excuse for entertainment became so

00:13:18.317 --> 00:13:21.317
popular that a permanent exhibition was established.

00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:27.907
Even as late as 1958, when Belgium hosted the World’s Fair, and Congo

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:32.567
was still part of Belgium, Congolese people were again put on display,

00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:36.747
with what is thankfully believed to be the world’s last “human zoo”.

00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:42.307
Although the worst of this brutality was all taking place thousands of

00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:47.697
kilometres away from Europe, and out of sight of European eyes, eventually

00:13:47.757 --> 00:13:52.367
King Leopold’s exploitation of the Congolese people became international news.

00:13:53.537 --> 00:13:59.377
In 1890, a former African-American soldier in the Union Army, turned Baptist

00:13:59.377 --> 00:14:04.057
minister named George Washington Williams made a visit to the Congo Free State.

00:14:04.847 --> 00:14:09.497
He saw the devastation that King Leopold’s private colony had done to the region.

00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:15.687
With his own eyes, he saw evidence of slavery that King Leopold had promised to suppress.

00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:23.023
From the Congo, Williams wrote a letter titled “An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty

00:14:23.023 --> 00:14:27.893
Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo.”

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:34.353
In it he addressed the vast number of humanitarian crimes he had witnessed

00:14:34.543 --> 00:14:38.743
along with the inhumane treatment of the Congolese people by King Leopold.

00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:43.203
In the letter he accused King Leopold of a multitude of

00:14:43.203 --> 00:14:48.523
crimes, including fraud, arson and murder, among many others.

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:53.123
He called out the manipulation by Sir Henry Stanley of the Congolese

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:56.663
leaders and asked the international community to intervene.

00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:02.533
George Washington Williams was just one of many voices in the growing

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:06.873
crowd of critics to the horrific abuses of power in the Congo Free State.

00:15:07.943 --> 00:15:14.423
In 1903, a diplomat by the name of Roger Casement wrote and shared a report that

00:15:14.423 --> 00:15:19.113
described and confirmed the scale of the crimes against the Congolese people.

00:15:20.393 --> 00:15:24.173
He travelled to the Congo and got first hand accounts of the

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:28.123
murder and destruction commited by King Leopold’s private army.

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:33.953
At last, the world was starting to wake up to the horrors of the Congo Free State.

00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:39.833
In 1905, the American Author Mark Twain published a politically

00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:43.223
satirical pamphlet called “King Leopold's Soliloquy.”

00:15:43.893 --> 00:15:50.633
In 1909, British author, Arthur Conan Doyle published a book called the Crime of the Congo.

00:15:51.453 --> 00:15:56.183
Joseph Conrad’s seminal work, or his most famous work, Heart of Darkness,

00:15:56.213 --> 00:16:01.163
which was published in 1899, tells the story of a sailor who works for

00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:05.273
a Belgian trading company as a ferry boat captain somewhere in Africa.

00:16:05.983 --> 00:16:11.213
In it he remarks on the imperialism and racism of the colonisation of the Congo.

00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:16.423
And another notable critic of King Leopold’s regime was a man called

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:21.253
Edmund Dene Morel, a shipping clerk working in Liverpool, in England.

00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:27.313
Liverpool was a major port of call for many shipping companies, including those

00:16:27.313 --> 00:16:32.673
sailing for Belgium and Belgian ships would deliver rubber to Liverpool from the Congo.

00:16:33.962 --> 00:16:38.513
Morel noticed the high volume of rubber being produced and delivered by Belgium.

00:16:39.013 --> 00:16:44.503
He knew that that volume of rubber could not be produced by anything other than slave labour.

00:16:45.643 --> 00:16:49.053
After his own investigation, his suspicions proved correct.

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:56.003
He wrote several anonymous articles, detailing and exposing the atrocities in the Congo Free State.

00:16:57.403 --> 00:17:01.263
He wrote that this was, “the greatest crime that has

00:17:01.303 --> 00:17:03.803
ever been committed in the history of the world.”

00:17:05.183 --> 00:17:09.783
Although he was offered a bribe, a payment, from the shipping company in

00:17:09.783 --> 00:17:15.363
exchange for his silence, he declined, and in 1906 he published a book

00:17:15.423 --> 00:17:20.267
called “Red Rubber”, which was an exposé of the horrors in the country.

00:17:21.697 --> 00:17:26.267
King Leopold pretended to be surprised about this, and responded

00:17:26.287 --> 00:17:29.517
to the international outcry with an inquiry of his own.

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:33.557
He sent his own International Commision to the Congo Free State.

00:17:34.707 --> 00:17:40.927
His idea was to bribe the commission in his favour, but he was foiled, it didn’t work.

00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:47.827
Fortunately, a Christian missionary couple shared hard evidence with King Leopold’s commission.

00:17:48.697 --> 00:17:54.617
The missionaries gathered together victims to share their testimonies of abuse, enslavement,

00:17:54.867 --> 00:18:00.297
mutilation, and murder, all committed on behalf of King Leopold and his private colony.

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:05.877
The Commission was then presented with photographic evidence of the crimes,

00:18:06.247 --> 00:18:11.367
photos which showed the horrors the Congolese suffered under King Leopold’s rule.

00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:16.347
When the commission published and presented King Leopold with its 50

00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:20.647
page report, he knew he had to cover up his crimes as best as he could.

00:18:21.287 --> 00:18:26.947
He ordered that all papers and records detailing anything with the Congo Free State be burned.

00:18:28.037 --> 00:18:29.847
But the damage was done.

00:18:30.487 --> 00:18:34.627
In 1908, the Congo Free State became an official Belgian

00:18:34.627 --> 00:18:39.942
colony - remember, before this it was King Leopold II's personal kingdom.

00:18:41.267 --> 00:18:44.577
Despite the clear evidence against King Leopold, the

00:18:44.577 --> 00:18:48.587
Belgian government bought it from him for 50 million francs.

00:18:49.389 --> 00:18:58.289
One year later, in 1909 and at the age of 74, King Leopold died, a hero in his own country.

00:18:59.399 --> 00:19:03.979
But life as a Belgian colony wasn’t much better than under King Leopold,

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:08.049
and Belgium found more natural resources to exploit than just rubber.

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:14.709
The Belgian government benefited from the Congo’s abundance of diamonds, gold, and

00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:19.809
ivory as all of these resources could be sold internationally for major profits.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:24.669
Now, given his crimes, one might assume that King

00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:27.854
Leopold II would be Belgium’s least favourite monarch.

00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:32.549
During his lifetime, this was certainly not the case.

00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:39.099
King Leopold was a much loved royal during his reign and his big lie about

00:19:39.109 --> 00:19:43.309
his role in the Congo solidified his adoration to the Belgian people.

00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:45.789
He helped suppress the slave trade!

00:19:46.009 --> 00:19:49.569
King Leopold helped to spread Western ideals and Christianity!

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:52.199
King Leopold was a humanitarian!

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:55.399
Or so the Belgian people were told.

00:19:56.489 --> 00:19:59.629
After his death, the government decided to keep King

00:19:59.629 --> 00:20:02.509
Leopold’s legacy clear of his crimes against humanity.

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:09.139
As a new country, the government did not want the outside world or its own people to know

00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:15.859
how far King Leopold’s horrors extended, and the Congo remained a Belgian Colony until 1960.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:22.249
In the last few years, however, Belgium faced a reckoning with King Leopold’s legacy.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:27.239
For decades, history taught the Belgian people that King Leopold

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:31.669
saved the Congo and that without Belgium, the Congo didn’t exist.

00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:38.899
Now though, Belgium’s and King Leopold’s barbarous past is catching up with the times.

00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:43.339
In an acknowledgment of the country's history, many of his

00:20:43.349 --> 00:20:47.189
statues have been vandalised, defaced, or removed altogether.

00:20:48.319 --> 00:20:54.659
Like many countries with histories of brutal colonisation practices, including the UK, of

00:20:54.659 --> 00:21:00.359
course, there are efforts to come to terms with it, and this is very much an ongoing process.

00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:07.079
As far as King Leopold II is concerned, there is no way to whitewash what he

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:12.549
did, no amount of saying “oh it was in the past”, which can explain his actions.

00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:16.969
And, quite rightly, there is nobody more deserving of the

00:21:16.969 --> 00:21:20.939
nickname that he is best known by: The Butcher of Congo.

00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:27.579
OK then, that is it for today's episode on King Leopold II.

00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:33.379
I know it’s a dark subject, but it is an important one, so I hope you found it interesting.

00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:37.139
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:41.679
If you are from Belgium, how did you learn about King Leopold in school?

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:44.119
How has this changed over time?

00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:49.769
For those of you who come from countries with somewhat unpleasant colonial pasts, which–as

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:54.609
an Englishman–I most certainly do, what do you think is the right way to deal with this?

00:21:55.369 --> 00:22:00.329
And if you come from a country that is a former colony, perhaps even if you come from

00:22:00.329 --> 00:22:06.321
Congo, what do you think is the right way to remember, or to not remember the colonial era?

00:22:06.661 --> 00:22:09.121
What do you think is the right way to deal with it?

00:22:09.901 --> 00:22:13.041
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

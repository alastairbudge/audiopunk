Hello.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.730
Hello.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.800
Hello, and welcome to English.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.520
Learning for curious minds by Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.240
and learn weird and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm Allister budge.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.330
And today we are going to be talking about what happens when a language dies.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.890
There are almost 8 billion people on the planet and we speak 7,000 different languages.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.060
Yet languages are dying out fast and linguists believe that half of

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.860
the languages spoken today will not exist by the end of the century.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.890
It is a sad truth.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.970
And today we are going to talk about why languages die,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.320
which languages are dying and what we can do about it.

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.475
Before we get right into the episode though.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:11.085
I just wanted to remind those of you listening to this episode on your favorite podcast

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:17.265
app, that you can get the subtitles transcript and give a Capri for this episode.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:23.895
Plus a load of extra bonus episodes on our website, which is Leonardo in besch.com.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.150
In case you hadn't checked this out yet.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.670
We also do monthly meetups, a Q and a sessions, which are a lot of fun.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.840
We just had the last one last week on accents in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
English and had members joining from all over the world.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.009
So if you would like to improve your English in a more interesting way, then I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.539
definitely recommend checking out the website, which is Leonardo english.com.

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:58.125
Okay, then let's get cracking and talk about dying languages.

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.085
Language is just the most magical thing.

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:05.685
It's what sets us apart from animals.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:09.584
It allows us to communicate with one another, to tell

00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:13.785
stories, to record our history, traditions, and culture.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:19.725
It allows us to express ourselves to show who we truly are.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.200
And as anyone who speaks more than one language knows

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.640
the language you speak is a big part of your identity.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.600
You feel different when you speak a different language.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.360
If English isn't your native language, which I guess

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.330
if you're listening to this podcast, it probably isn't.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.110
Then you feel different when you speak in English, depending on your level and experience.

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:57.299
How you feel might change if you aren't that confident in English, then I imagine

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:06.690
it can feel frustrating, limiting that if you aren't confident in English, then I

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.329
imagine it can feel frustrating and limiting that you can't say the same things in

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.760
English with the same fluency as you would be able to do in your native language.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.060
And even if you are amazingly fluent in English or even bilingual,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.989
the language you speak for most people makes you feel different.

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.750
You behave slightly differently.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.290
You might use one language in one situation or to communicate with one group of people.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.430
No language perfectly translates from one to the other.

00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:52.454
So the language we speak has huge importance over and above it just being a means of communication.

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:58.605
So what happens to people when they can't communicate in the

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:03.584
language, they want to, what happens to the cultures and countries?

00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:09.285
When the original language of its people dies out, what happens

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:15.810
then this, as you may know, Isn't just a theoretical question.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.800
In the past hundred years, the world has lost about one language every three months.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.110
So that's around 400 languages wiped away, disappeared.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.930
And as a population, we are moving away from having this huge variety of different languages.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.380
To having a small selection of languages that are native to a large proportion

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:51.450
of people and understandable to even more indeed, about two thirds of the world.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.289
Indeed, about two thirds of the world's population speaks just

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:05.010
12 languages out of the 7,000 or so different languages spoken.

00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:09.224
Different languages that exist in the world.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:20.474
So almost 70% of the population speaks a total of less than 0.2% of the languages in the world.

00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:24.705
You can probably guess the most dominant languages.

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:29.895
There's Mandarin, Spanish, English, Hindi, Bengali, Portuguese,

00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:35.235
Russian, Japanese, Western Punjabi Mirafi Telegu and will Chinese.

00:05:36.015 --> 00:05:43.275
These languages have come to dominate and endanger the other almost 700 languages.

00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:51.585
You might say, well, it's only natural as more people speak a certain language.

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:53.745
It's understandable that.

00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:56.775
People want their children to speak that language.

00:05:56.864 --> 00:06:00.044
So they stopped speaking their own language at home.

00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:06.825
And thus, these other languages eventually die out as people choose not to use them.

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:12.914
That may be true, but these dominant languages, haven't

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:16.094
only prospered because they have attracted people.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:21.734
There have also been large efforts to crush smaller languages.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.650
From doing things like outlawing the forbidding, the use of non-core

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.810
languages to actively persecuting speakers of different languages.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.310
There has been a lot of activity aimed specifically at killing off less popular languages.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.570
English of course is a prime example.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.590
The British empire, forced people to speak English.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.300
And the fact that the founding fathers of America were native English

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.909
speakers and chose to write the constitution in English meant that

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.010
meant that other native languages were pushed to one side.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.230
And English became the dominant language for the world's dominant power.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.090
If it weren't for things like this, you probably wouldn't be learning

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.650
English as it would never have reached such a globally dominant position.

00:07:38.775 --> 00:07:43.155
But for centuries, the majority of people didn't care about

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:48.545
languages, dying out languages dying when their speakers dying.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:56.315
And so by default, if there aren't speakers, if there aren't any speakers of the

00:07:56.315 --> 00:08:01.505
language left, then there aren't many people that really care about that language.

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:07.875
And globally, we don't seem to really care about the fact

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:12.135
that there are so many endangered languages to be precise.

00:08:12.435 --> 00:08:17.865
According to UNESCO, at least 43 of all languages spoken in the

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:24.075
world are endangered more than half, have fewer than 10,000 speakers.

00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:30.765
A quarter have fewer than 1000 speakers and around 20 languages.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.659
I only have one speaker left.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.950
Now there are five different categories of endangered languages ranging

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.870
from vulnerable, which means that most children can speak the language,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.460
but it's normally restricted to certain situations normally just at home.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.300
And the final category is extinct.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.760
Meaning there are no speakers left.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.910
And the sad thing is.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.530
And the sad thing is that for a lot of these languages

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.750
that are dying out, when the last person dies, that's it.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.630
You can't just turn it back on again.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.460
As fewer and fewer people speak a language, it's

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.740
hard to reverse the decline, fewer children learn it.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.030
And the older people who do speak it won't live forever.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.520
So purely from a.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.410
Sounds of time.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.050
Point of view, this situation naturally means that the number of speakers

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:44.850
reduces and tends to zero, but also the fewer speakers of a language that

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:50.490
do exist, the fewer opportunities, those people have to speak that language.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.780
And as we all know, if you don't actually use a language, you start to speak less fluently in it.

00:09:58.185 --> 00:10:00.795
And do you start to lose the language yourself?

00:10:02.415 --> 00:10:07.365
And if you are the only speaker of a language and you don't have anyone left to

00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:13.785
practice with, well, then that language is quickly on the path to becoming extinct.

00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:23.295
There was a story a few years back about a village in Mexico, where there were only two

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:30.945
speakers left of a language called . So the only people that they could practice with,

00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:39.765
there was a story a few years ago, about a village in Mexico, where there were

00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:47.565
only two speakers left of a language called . So the only people that VA could

00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:54.585
practice, I opened echo with where each other, but they hated each other.

00:10:55.245 --> 00:11:03.165
They had had a disagreement and they weren't speaking so great was the disdain and hatred

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:11.265
that they held for one and not so great was the disdain and hatred that they held for one

00:11:11.265 --> 00:11:19.035
another, that they wouldn't even speak for the sake of practicing this almost extinct language.

00:11:20.235 --> 00:11:24.105
So the telecoms company Vodafone came along.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.739
And help them become friends again, to save the language

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.310
and teach a new generation there's traditional language.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.520
I up an echo, what an amazing story.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.000
Right?

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.079
Unfortunately, it was too amazing to be true.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:47.550
It was proved to be a completely made up story, a complete lie creators to promote Vodafone.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.790
However, the situation it was talking about certainly does exist.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:12:00.720
When people don't have anyone to practice a language with, and if they haven't taught anyone

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.590
else that language, then that language goes to the grieve with the death of its last speaker.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.090
Unless there has been a conscious effort to protect it and to get a generation

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:20.220
of new speakers speaking that language, then this is exactly what happens.

00:12:22.485 --> 00:12:24.885
Then this is exactly what happens.

00:12:26.415 --> 00:12:31.425
And there have been some real success stories of languages that looked

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:36.405
like they were moving towards becoming extinct with the number of speakers

00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:44.625
decreasing every year that have enjoyed a revival or rebirth in the UK.

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:47.775
For instance, you will know that we speak English.

00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:53.175
And it is spoken by 98% of the population, but people

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:58.895
also speak Scotts Welsh, Scots, Gaelic, Irish Cornish.

00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:05.105
There has been a concerted efforts in the UK to promote these languages

00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:11.855
with them being taught in schools, used on road signs and in official

00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:17.045
documentation, which has made available in other languages than English.

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:27.855
And in Hawaii, the local language Hawaiian was almost completely extinct by the end of the 1980s.

00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:34.755
Some schools had banned it and English was strongly encouraged.

00:13:35.925 --> 00:13:39.195
There were only a few hundred speakers left and it

00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:42.555
looked like it was going to die out within a generation.

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:48.875
However, a few good souls decided to do something about it.

00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:53.855
They opened schools and encouraged children to learn Hawaiian.

00:13:55.295 --> 00:14:02.585
There are now about 25,000 fluent Hawaiian speakers, which of course is nothing compared to the

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:10.115
number of English speakers, but it is certainly enough to bring it out of the immediate danger zone.

00:14:12.494 --> 00:14:16.484
But what happens when a language does really die though?

00:14:17.895 --> 00:14:23.025
Well, there is one famous example of a language where all

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:28.755
its speakers did die, but the language today is thriving.

00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:32.324
No, it's not Latin.

00:14:32.775 --> 00:14:35.895
I don't think that people learning it in schools and

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:39.464
speaking it in the Vatican city can be considered thriving.

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:42.105
It is Hebrew.

00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:49.395
The official language of it is Hebrew and official language of Israel.

00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:51.615
Hebrew.

00:14:51.615 --> 00:15:00.285
Hadn't been a spoken language for communication purposes since the second century ed, but had

00:15:00.285 --> 00:15:07.155
been preserved in religious texts and it had been spoken in prayers and religious services.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.720
But that was it.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.780
People didn't speak it in their day to day lives.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.750
Towards the end of the 19th century, there were large efforts to

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.380
revive the language and it is now spoken by 90% of Israeli Jews.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.690
Interestingly enough, when the language was revived.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.640
They had to come up with all these new words for things that just

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:41.760
didn't exist when the language stopped being spoken 1,700 years before.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:49.140
So they had to invent entirely new words for things like the tomato, which

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.580
had only been introduced to Israel after having been brought back from the

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.040
Americas and they had to come up with a word for things like electricity.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.580
Which obviously didn't exist in the second century.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:10.790
So if there is enough, well, for whatever reason, just because a language looks

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:17.410
like it might die out, that process can be stopped and languages can flourish again.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.560
Now.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.170
Now in the modern era.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.930
Now we have a plethora of advantages that previous generations didn't have.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:49.680
It's very easy to record people speaking so we can preserve how to speak a language.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:55.155
And the internet makes it easier than ever for people to connect with each

00:16:55.155 --> 00:17:00.435
other, for speakers of different languages to come together and practice it,

00:17:00.945 --> 00:17:06.555
or at least to help linguists understand how to preserve those languages.

00:17:09.045 --> 00:17:14.685
However, despite all of these advantages, people need to want to do it.

00:17:15.645 --> 00:17:22.635
Without the people that want to preserve the language for future generations, without the people

00:17:22.635 --> 00:17:28.695
that want to preserve the language for future generations, there will be no preserving it.

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:35.625
The majority of the endangered languages are oral languages.

00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:41.205
They often don't have written forms, which makes preserving them even harder.

00:17:42.585 --> 00:17:48.345
If every English speaker on the planet died tomorrow, someone could relatively

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:54.135
easily figure out how to speak English because there is so much written in

00:17:54.135 --> 00:18:01.605
English, but if nothing is written, then the language dies with its last speaker.

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.965
And this isn't a rare occurrence only.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.020
Only around a third of all world languages have written

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.350
systems, a way of actually writing the language down.

00:18:20.879 --> 00:18:24.690
You might be thinking, so what language is dying out?

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.110
It's just a natural part of the life cycle of the world.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.280
Instead of spending money, encouraging people to speak them.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.310
Why don't we invest in schools, hospitals, or teaching people a more useful language?

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.610
Like.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.460
English or Spanish or Mandarin.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.850
It also begs the question.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.360
Why should we actually preserve anything?

00:19:27.705 --> 00:19:29.205
It also begs the question.

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:31.635
Why should we preserve anything?

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.350
It also begs the question.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.660
Why should we actually preserve anything from ancient

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.830
buildings to sculptures, to wildlife, to animals?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.250
Should we interfere with the natural flow of things?

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:58.155
If you are approaching the subjects from a purely utilitarian point of view, Saying

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:03.585
that we should only seek to preserve things that have an immediate use for mankind.

00:20:04.205 --> 00:20:10.325
Then you probably, then you probably, I don't think it's worth battling

00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:15.935
to preserve a dying language, but then you shouldn't let's see any reason

00:20:15.935 --> 00:20:21.605
to protect a beautiful fresco or to stop the pandas from dying out.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.580
Languages, in my opinion, at least give us just the most amazing insights into how

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:37.350
people, cultures and society develops the words and expressions that exist in a language.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.090
Tell us about it's people.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.770
People need words to convey, meaning the words in a language.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.870
Tell us what people need to say.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.800
There's the quotes that you've probably heard a thousand times that

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.140
Eskimos have 50 different words for different types of snow, but

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:03.930
this kind of idea applies to almost every language in your language.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.630
I'm sure there are words and expressions that don't have an exact equivalent in English.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.060
For example, in a situation where in English, you would say.

00:21:15.435 --> 00:21:17.655
How are you in Mandarin?

00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:20.025
You would say, have you eaten yet?

00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:28.455
And in Cherokee native American language, there is no words for goodbye only.

00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:29.655
I'll see you again.

00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:36.885
These might be small differences, but they tell us a huge

00:21:36.885 --> 00:21:40.725
amount about the culture and the people that use the language.

00:21:41.775 --> 00:21:47.535
And when the language dies out, And without any real written or recorded evidence of

00:21:47.535 --> 00:21:53.145
how to use it, so dies an important part of our knowledge of the people that spoke it.

00:21:54.345 --> 00:21:59.565
And I, for one, think we should do everything we can to avoid that.

00:22:02.985 --> 00:22:07.965
And I, for one, think we should do everything we can to avoid that.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.240
Okay, then that is it.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.240
For this episode on endangered languages.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.940
It is a hugely interesting topic.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:23.940
And although English may be a useful language and there are many excellent reasons to learn it.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:29.550
It is just one of nearly 7,000 languages that are spoken around the world.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.790
A world where we all speak.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.800
One of a handful of languages is a less rich, less diverse one.

00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:43.005
But unless there is a conscious effort to protect and encourage the

00:22:43.005 --> 00:22:47.055
speaking of these endangered languages, then that is the direction.

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:53.055
Then that is the direction that we are heading in.

00:22:55.935 --> 00:23:00.865
Then that is the direction that we are heading in as always, I would love.

00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:08.025
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, especially if you speak an

00:23:08.025 --> 00:23:16.335
endangered language, but even if you don't, you can email hi, H i@leonardoenglish.com and on

00:23:21.825 --> 00:23:29.475
to be on Esperanto, a language that is certainly not dead, but was born artificially, I guess.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.570
That will be released exclusively on the website on Tuesday.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.190
So keep a lookout for that one.

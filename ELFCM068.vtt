Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.805
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:20.275
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:29.165
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about what happens when a language dies.

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:36.095
There are almost 8 billion people on the planet, and we speak 7,000 different languages.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.491
Yet languages are dying out fast, and linguists believe that half of

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:48.341
the languages spoken today will not exist by the end of the century.

00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:54.331
It’s a sad truth, and today, we are going to talk about why languages

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:59.191
die, which languages are dying, and what we can do about it.

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:04.701
Before we get right into the episode though, I just wanted to remind those

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:09.181
of you listening to this episode on your favourite podcast app that you can

00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:14.761
get the subtitles, transcript, and key vocabulary for this episode, plus a

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:20.731
load of extra, bonus episodes, on our website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:27.711
In case you hadn’t checked this out yet, we also do monthly meetups, Q&A

00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:32.381
sessions, which are a lot of fun - we just had the last one last week,

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:37.691
on Accents in English, and had members joining from all over the world.

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:42.811
So if you would like to improve your English in a more interesting way, then

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:47.451
I’d definitely recommend checking out the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.951
OK then, let’s get cracking, and talk about dying languages.

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.181
Language is just the most magical thing.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:03.201
It’s what sets us apart from animals, it allows us to communicate with one

00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:08.831
another, to tell stories, to record our history, traditions, and culture.

00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:14.871
It allows us to express ourselves, to show who we truly are.

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:19.261
And, as anyone who speaks more than one language knows,

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.761
the language you speak is a big part of your identity.

00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:27.591
You feel different when you speak a different language.

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:33.621
If English isn’t your native language, which, I guess if you are listening to this

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:39.251
podcast, it probably isn’t, then you feel different when you speak in English.

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:44.891
Depending on your level and experience, how you feel might change.

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.991
If you aren’t that confident in English, then I imagine it can feel

00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:54.901
frustrating, limiting, that you can’t say the same things in English,

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:59.721
with the same fluency as you would be able to do in your native language.

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:05.891
And even if you are amazingly fluent in English, or even bilingual,

00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.841
the language you speak, for most people, makes you feel different.

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.361
You behave slightly differently, you might use one language

00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:20.741
in one situation, or to communicate with one group of people.

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:25.001
No language perfectly translates from one to the other.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:33.981
So the language we speak has huge importance over and above it being just a means of communication.

00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:40.321
So, what happens to people when they can’t communicate in the language they want to?

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:47.811
What happens to the cultures and countries when the original language of its people dies out?

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.101
What happens then?

00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:54.681
This, as you may know, isn’t just a theoretical question.

00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:59.491
In the past 100 years, the world has lost about one

00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:04.101
language every 3 months, so that’s around 400 languages.

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:06.361
Wiped away, disappeared.

00:04:06.921 --> 00:04:12.841
And as a population, we are moving away from having this huge variety

00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:18.331
of different languages to having a small selection of languages that are

00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:23.701
native to a large proportion of people, and understandable to even more.

00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:30.391
Indeed, about ⅔ of the world’s population speaks just 12 languages,

00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:35.951
out of the 7,000 or so different languages that exist in the world.

00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:47.231
So almost 70% of the population speaks a total of less than 0.2% of the languages in the world.

00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:54.451
You can probably guess the most dominant languages - there's Mandarin, Spanish, English,

00:04:54.701 --> 00:05:01.981
Hindi, Bengali, Portuguse, Russian, Japanese, Western Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, and Wu Chinese.

00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:09.701
These languages have come to dominate, and endanger the other almost 7,000 languages.

00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.361
You might say, well, it’s only natural.

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:20.371
As more people speak a certain language, it’s understandable that people want their

00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:25.311
children to speak that language, so they stop speaking their own language at home,

00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:32.121
and thus these other languages eventually die out as people choose not to use them.

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:37.556
That may be true, but these dominant languages haven’t

00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:40.786
only prospered because they have attracted people.

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:48.116
There have also been large efforts to crush smaller languages - from doing

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:54.746
things like outlawing, the forbidding, the use of non-core languages to

00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:59.356
actively persecuting speakers of different languages, there has been a

00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:05.996
lot of activity aimed specifically at killing off less popular languages.

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:13.346
English, of course, is a prime example - the British Empire forced people to speak English,

00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:19.926
and the fact that the founding fathers of America were native English speakers and chose

00:06:19.956 --> 00:06:26.166
to write the constitution in English meant that other, native languages were pushed

00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:32.116
to one side, and English became the dominant language for the world's dominant power.

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:36.206
If it weren’t for things like this, you probably wouldn’t be learning

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:40.576
English, as it would never have reached such a globally dominant position.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:48.016
But for centuries, the majority of people didn’t care about languages dying out.

00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:55.596
Languages die when their speakers die, and so, by default, if there aren’t any speakers

00:06:55.626 --> 00:07:01.156
of the language left then there aren’t many people that really care about that language.

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:05.796
And globally, we don’t seem to really care about the

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:08.746
fact that there are so many endangered languages.

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:17.130
To be precise, according to UNESCO, at least 43% all languages spoken in the world

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.720
are endangered, more than half have fewer than 10,000 speakers, a quarter have

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:32.410
fewer than 1,000 speakers, and around 20 languages only have one speaker left.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.130
Now, there are five different categories of ‘endangered languages’, ranging

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.010
from ‘vulnerable’, which means that most children can speak the language,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.580
but it’s normally restricted to certain situations, normally just at home.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.870
And the final category is ‘extinct’, meaning that there are no speakers left.

00:07:55.465 --> 00:08:00.580
And the sad thing is that, for a lot of these languages that are dying out,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.190
when the last person dies, that’s it, you can’t just ‘turn it back on again’.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:13.580
As fewer and fewer people speak a language, it’s hard to reverse the decline.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:20.360
Fewer children learn it, and the older people who do speak it won’t live forever.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.020
So purely from a ‘sands of time’ point of view, this situation

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:33.070
naturally means that the number of speakers reduces, and tends to zero.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.030
But also, the fewer speakers of a language that do exist, the fewer opportunities those

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:46.950
people have to speak that language, and as we all know, if you don’t actually use a language,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.710
you start to speak less fluently in it, and you start to lose the language yourself.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.360
And if you are the only speaker of a language and you don’t have anyone left to

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.470
practice with, well then that language is quickly on the path to becoming extinct.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:11.020
There was a story a few years ago about a village in Mexico where

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.100
there were only two speakers left of a language called Ayapaneco.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.260
So the only people that they could practice Ayapaneco with were each other.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.180
But they hated each other, they had had a disagreement, and they weren’t speaking.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:36.350
So great was the disdain and hatred that they held for one another that they

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:42.180
wouldn’t even speak for the sake of practicing this almost extinct language.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.670
So the telecoms company, Vodafone, came along and helped them become friends again to

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:55.470
save the language, and teach a new generation this traditional language, Ayapaneco.

00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:58.520
What an amazing story, right?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.100
Unfortunately, it was too amazing to be true.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:09.640
It was proved to be a completely made-up story, a complete lie, created to promote Vodafone.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:17.600
However, the situation it was talking about certainly does exist - when people don’t

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:23.490
have anyone to practice a language with, and if they haven’t taught anyone else that

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:29.620
language, then that language goes to the grave with the death of its last speaker.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.410
Unless there has been a conscious effort to protect it, and to get a generation

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.830
of new speakers speaking that language, then this is exactly what happens.

00:10:42.803 --> 00:10:47.823
And there have been some real success stories of languages that looked

00:10:47.883 --> 00:10:52.223
like they were moving towards becoming extinct, with the number of

00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:57.903
speakers decreasing every year, that have enjoyed a revival, a rebirth.

00:10:58.573 --> 00:11:02.063
In the UK, for instance, you will know that we speak

00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:06.233
English, and it is spoken by 98% of the population.

00:11:06.923 --> 00:11:13.523
But people also speak Scots, Welsh, Scots Gaelic, Irish, and Cornish.

00:11:13.813 --> 00:11:19.003
There has been a concerted effort in the UK to promote these languages,

00:11:19.523 --> 00:11:25.843
with them being taught in schools, used on road signs, and in official

00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:31.003
documentation which is made available in other languages than English

00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:41.158
And in Hawaii, the local language, Hawaiian, was almost completely extinct by the end of the 1980s.

00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:48.028
Some schools had banned it, and English was strongly encouraged.

00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:52.578
There were only a few hundred speakers left, and it

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:55.948
looked like it was going to die out within a generation.

00:11:56.568 --> 00:12:01.148
However, a few good souls decided to do something about it.

00:12:01.548 --> 00:12:05.558
They opened schools and encouraged children to learn Hawaiian.

00:12:06.248 --> 00:12:13.498
There are now about 25,000 fluent Hawaiian speakers, which of course is nothing compared to the

00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:21.078
number of English speakers, but it is certainly enough to bring it out of the immediate danger zone.

00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:25.888
But what happens when a language does really die though?

00:12:26.608 --> 00:12:31.728
Well, there is one famous example of a language where all

00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:37.418
its speakers did die, but the language today is thriving.

00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:42.768
No, it’s not Latin - I don’t think that people learning it in schools

00:12:42.808 --> 00:12:46.628
and speaking it in the Vatican City can be considered ‘thriving’.

00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:50.578
It’s Hebrew, an official language of Israel.

00:12:51.958 --> 00:13:00.488
Hebrew hadn’t been a spoken language for communication purposes since the second century AD, but

00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:08.018
had been preserved in religious texts, and it had been spoken in prayers and religious services.

00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:12.938
But that was it - people didn’t speak it in their day to day lives.

00:13:13.548 --> 00:13:18.228
Towards the end of the 19th century, there were large efforts to

00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:24.798
revive the language, and it’s now spoken by 90% of Israeli Jews.

00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:32.548
Interestingly enough, when the language was revived, they had to come up with all these new words

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:40.078
for things that just didn’t exist when the language stopped being spoken, 1700 years before.

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:47.078
So they had to invent entirely new words for things like the tomato, which had

00:13:47.308 --> 00:13:51.948
only been introduced to Israel after having been brought back from the Americas.

00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:55.463
And they had to come up for a word for things like

00:13:56.073 --> 00:14:00.278
‘electricity’, which obviously didn’t exist in the 2nd century.

00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:07.178
So, if there is enough will, for whatever reason, just because a language looks

00:14:07.178 --> 00:14:13.898
like it might die out, the process can be stopped, and languages can flourish again.

00:14:14.808 --> 00:14:20.978
Now, we have a plethora of advantages that previous generations didn’t have.

00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:27.368
It’s very easy to record people speaking, so we can preserve how to speak a language.

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:32.858
And the internet makes it easier than ever for people to connect with each

00:14:32.858 --> 00:14:38.058
other, for speakers of different languages to come together and practice it,

00:14:38.618 --> 00:14:44.148
or at least, to help linguists understand how to preserve those languages.

00:14:44.948 --> 00:14:50.628
However, despite all of these advantages, people need to want to do it.

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.798
Without the people that want to preserve the language

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.528
for future generations, there will be no preserving it.

00:14:59.258 --> 00:15:04.578
The majority of the endangered languages are oral languages, they often

00:15:04.578 --> 00:15:09.388
don’t have written forms, which makes preserving them even harder.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:15.918
If every English speaker on the planet died tomorrow, someone could relatively

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:22.248
easily figure out how to speak English, because there is so much written in English.

00:15:23.238 --> 00:15:29.108
But if nothing is written, then the language dies with its last speaker.

00:15:30.108 --> 00:15:35.568
And this isn’t a rare occurrence only around a third of all world languages

00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:39.778
have written systems, a way of actually writing the language down.

00:15:40.638 --> 00:15:42.568
You might be thinking, ‘so what?

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:48.918
Languages dying out is just a natural part of the life cycle of the world - instead of

00:15:48.918 --> 00:15:55.168
spending money encouraging people to speak them, why don’t we invest in schools, hospitals,

00:15:55.188 --> 00:16:01.038
or teaching people a more useful language like English, or Spanish, or Mandarin?’

00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:06.718
It also begs the question, why should we actually preserve anything?

00:16:07.608 --> 00:16:12.128
From ancient buildings to sculptures, to wildlife to

00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:16.278
animals, should we interfere with the natural flow of things?

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:24.268
If you are approaching the subject from a purely utilitarian point of view, saying

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:29.678
that we should only seek to preserve things that have an immediate use for mankind,

00:16:30.298 --> 00:16:35.038
then you probably don’t think it’s worth battling to preserve a dying language.

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:39.238
But then, you shouldn’t see any reason to protect a

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:43.638
beautiful fresco, or to stop the pandas from dying out.

00:16:44.388 --> 00:16:52.279
Languages give us just the most amazing insight into how people, cultures, and society develops.

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:59.609
The words and expressions that exist in a language tell us about its people - people

00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:05.309
need words to convey meaning, the words in a language tell us what people need to say.

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:13.619
There’s the quote that you’ve probably heard 1,000 times that Eskimos have 50 different

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:20.389
words for different types of snow, but this kind of idea applies to almost every language.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:24.729
In your language, I’m sure there are words and expressions

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:27.869
that don’t have an exact equivalent in English.

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:32.779
For example, in a situation where in English you would say

00:17:33.109 --> 00:17:37.459
‘How are you?’, in Mandarin you would say ‘Have you eaten yet?’

00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:41.749
And in Cherokee, a Native American language, there

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:46.419
is no word for ‘goodbye’, only ‘I’ll see you again’.

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:51.439
These might be small differences, but they tell us a huge

00:17:51.459 --> 00:17:55.179
amount about the culture and the people that use the language.

00:17:55.909 --> 00:18:01.669
And when the language dies out, and without any real written or recorded evidence of

00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:07.249
how to use it, so dies an important part of our knowledge of the people that spoke it.

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:13.159
And I, for one, think we should do everything we can to avoid that.

00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:19.779
Ok then, that is it for this episode on Endangered Languages.

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:24.549
It’s a hugely interesting topic, and although English may be a useful

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:29.079
language, and there are many excellent reasons to learn it, it is

00:18:29.129 --> 00:18:33.799
just one of nearly 7,000 languages that are spoken around the world.

00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:40.719
A world where we all just speak one of a handful languages is a less rich, less

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:46.719
diverse one, but unless there is a conscious effort to protect and encourage the

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:51.649
speaking of these endangered languages, that is the direction that we are heading in.

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:55.979
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode,

00:18:56.239 --> 00:19:00.209
especially if you speak an endangered language, but even if you don’t.

00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:04.349
You can email hi@leonardoenglish.com.

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:10.899
And on the subject of dying languages, watch out for our next members-only episode, which is going

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:18.599
to be on Esperanto, a language that is certainly not dead, but was born, ‘artificially’, I guess.

00:19:18.959 --> 00:19:23.819
That will be released exclusively on the website on Tuesday, so keep a look out for that one..

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:30.269
And as a final reminder, if you are looking for all of the bonus episodes, plus subtitles,

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:35.649
transcripts, and key vocabulary, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

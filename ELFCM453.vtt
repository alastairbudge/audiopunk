Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.710
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.060
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.290
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.550
three-part mini-series on fertility in the 21st century.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.170
In case you missed it, part one was on the world’s shrinking population, where

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.200
we looked at some of the reasons behind this and its potential consequences.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.970
Next up, in part three, we are going to talk about the future of fertility, and look

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.340
at some unusual theories about how babies might be born in 50 or 100 years from now.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.199
And in part two, in this episode, we are going to look at one of the most important

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:05.370
developments in the history of fertility, in vitro fertilisation, otherwise known as IVF.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.230
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:17.199
On July 25th, 1978, at the Royal Oldham Hospital in Britain,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.929
a young couple waited expectantly to meet their new baby.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.810
The mother, Lesley Brown, was scheduled to go in for a caesarian section.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.490
On the face of it, it was a routine procedure, but nothing about this birth would be routine.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.140
Thousands of reporters had set up camp outside the hospital, there was

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.970
even a camera crew that was allowed into the operating room to capture the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.820
operation, recording the most intimate moments and details of the birth.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.310
See, Lesley Brown and her husband had tried to conceive a child for 9 years, without any luck.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.319
It turned out that Lesley had blocked fallopian tubes, which

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.070
meant that she was unable to naturally conceive a child.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:25.100
9 months beforehand, she had undergone a then untested procedure called “IVF”, where a mature egg

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.162
was removed from one of her ovaries, put in a laboratory dish and combined with her husband’s sperm.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.420
It showed early promise, and the fertilised egg was then put back into her womb.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.130
It looked like a foetus was growing well, and all the frequent tests she underwent

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.739
seemed to suggest that there was a perfectly normal baby growing inside her.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.619
Of course, there was only one way to find out.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.860
And so it was, on July 25th, 1978, with the attention of the world’s media concentrated in

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.850
that small operating theatre in Oldham, the doctors were finally going to see for themselves.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.980
As they removed the baby from her mother’s womb, they discovered a beautiful little baby girl.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.240
She had 10 fingers and 10 toes, two arms, two legs, two eyes, two ears,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.829
one nose, she cried out like every other little baby born that day.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.829
The doctors did over a hundred tests on the newborn child,

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.410
and each one came back saying that she was perfectly normal.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.059
Her parents were, like any new parents, overcome with joy.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.940
They named the girl Louise.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.550
When she was four years old, just before she went to school, her parents told her

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.170
that there was something a bit different about how she was born, and the young girl

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:13.012
soon realised that photographers and journalists seemed to be very interested in her.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.510
They would turn up at birthday parties, they would interview her, and follow her life’s journey.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.280
And what they saw was, with absolutely no offence intended to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.409
Louise Brown, a very normal woman living a very normal life.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.070
She went to school, she got married, and she had two children of her own.

00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:45.088
Although she had no choice in the matter, she was a pioneer; she was the first baby to be born

00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:53.148
using a completely untested and unknown technology called in vitro fertilisation, or IVF for short.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.279
Since then, more than 12 million people have been born using the same

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:04.719
technology, with an average of more than one IVF baby born a minute.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:12.369
I have many friends who are IVF babies, I have friends who have IVF babies, I imagine you know

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:20.179
plenty of IVF babies too, perhaps you are an IVF baby or you have an IVF baby of your own.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.309
The point is, it is now incredibly widespread in many countries, with

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.820
Denmark leading the world with 9% of all new babies born through IVF.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:37.679
So, in this episode we are going to look at this revolutionary medical development.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.729
First, some biology.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:48.189
As you will no doubt remember from school biology lessons, and perhaps pictures in textbooks

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.869
that some of your classmates would snigger over, babies are conceived by sperm fertilising

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.319
an egg, which then implants itself in the uterus, where it can grow and develop into

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:07.689
a foetus, and as if by magic, 40 weeks or so later a fully functioning human emerges.

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:11.939
Of course, it is rarely that simple.

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:13.759
Things go wrong.

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:19.509
Men can have a low sperm count, women can have blocked fallopian tubes,

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:24.649
there may be issues with the production of or quality of the eggs produced.

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.169
All manner of things can go wrong, and it is a biological

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.389
miracle that I am here talking to you and you are listening.

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:39.009
What’s more, time is not on our side.

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:46.999
The females of almost all mammals can continue to have babies until old age, but not humans.

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:54.929
We humans are not so lucky, or to be precise, female humans are not so lucky.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:01.929
As you’ll know, with every year after the age of 30 or so, a woman’s fertility rate

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:08.889
drops, so the longer someone waits to try to conceive, statistically the harder it is.

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:14.019
And, as we talked about in part one of this mini-series,

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:18.269
statistically women are having babies later and later.

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.009
In England and Wales the average age for a woman to

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:28.589
have her first child is 29, up from 24 fifty years ago.

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:35.559
In Italy and Spain it's almost 32, and in Spain 10% of

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:38.949
all births are to mothers who are over the age of 40.

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:45.469
Parents all around the world are getting older, meaning that on average

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:50.539
it is harder and takes longer for people to conceive than ever before.

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:56.223
But, of course, enter stage right, IVF.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:03.419
As a reminder of how IVF works, the basic steps include removing eggs from the

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:09.279
woman, combining them with the sperm of the father in a petri dish so that the

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:15.479
sperm fertilises the egg to create an embryo, then several days later, implanting

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:21.939
the egg back into the uterus, and hoping that it grows to be a full-size baby.

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:30.409
Of course, this is a simplification, and there are other variations on how it works, but the IVF

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:39.399
process in 2024 is broadly the same as the process that resulted in Louise Brown back in 1978.

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:46.019
One area that has improved significantly, however, is how effective it is.

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:55.499
According to a recent Economist report, around 25-30% of each round of embryos transferred

00:08:55.499 --> 00:09:03.457
to a woman now lead to a live birth, which is 4x improvement from what it was in the 1990s.

00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:13.357
And as anyone who has gone through IVF themself will know, this is crucially important, because the

00:09:13.357 --> 00:09:20.817
procedure of taking the eggs and then implanting them back into the uterus is invasive and painful.

00:09:22.117 --> 00:09:26.677
And that’s not to mention the emotional pain and heartache of getting your

00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:31.387
hopes up with every round of IVF, only to have them dashed if you hear the

00:09:31.397 --> 00:09:36.147
fateful words from your doctor of, “I’m sorry, it hasn’t worked this time”.

00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:44.147
So, IVF is getting more effective, but it is still far from perfect.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:51.207
Many couples go through years of IVF only to find that they are not able to conceive.

00:09:52.287 --> 00:10:00.117
It seems unfair, as couples who are more likely to conceive will do so more quickly, and those who

00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:06.537
are unlikely to conceive will go through many cycles of IVF and not have anything to see from it.

00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:13.327
And another element of IVF that is deeply unfair is the cost of it.

00:10:14.737 --> 00:10:20.187
In some countries, such as Denmark and Israel, the cost is heavily

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:24.677
subsidised by the government, meaning that it is free in most cases.

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:30.637
The right to have a child is seen as the fundamental right of any woman, so

00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:36.117
IVF is considered in the same category as any other healthcare procedure.

00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:42.227
But these are anomalies, most countries do not do this.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:47.707
IVF is a complicated procedure, it requires skilled

00:10:47.727 --> 00:10:51.207
medical professionals and a top-quality laboratory.

00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:54.692
As a result, it’s expensive.

00:10:55.542 --> 00:11:02.182
It is expensive in Denmark and Israel, it just so happens that the state pays, not the individual.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:06.352
Elsewhere, hopeful couples aren’t so lucky.

00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:15.872
The cost of a standard IVF cycle varies, but it can reach $20,000 per cycle in the United States.

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:22.642
And when you factor in that many IVF patients, especially those aged

00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:28.692
40 and older, can have to undergo multiple cycles, often 6 or more, and

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:33.982
even then there are no guarantees of success, it can get very expensive.

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:41.122
It probably comes as no surprise that a sort of IVF tourism market has popped

00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:46.152
up, with countries advertising their low cost and high quality IVF clinics.

00:11:47.442 --> 00:11:52.882
Hotspots in Europe include the Czech Republic and Poland, where a cycle can

00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:58.992
be under €3,000, and hopeful parents from more expensive countries fly in,

00:11:59.432 --> 00:12:04.442
crossing their fingers that they will become one of the clinic’s success stories,

00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:09.752
plastered on the wall with a beaming smile and a little baby 9 months later.

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:17.062
Elsewhere in the world, especially in lower income countries, this simply isn’t an option.

00:12:18.492 --> 00:12:25.942
€3,000 might be an amount of money that an average European couple could scrape together if

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:32.902
needs be, but for many people in lower income countries this is more than a lifetime of savings.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:40.811
Again from that same Economist article I mentioned earlier, one study suggested that in lower

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:51.131
income countries a single cycle of IVF costs between 50% and 200% of people’s average annual income.

00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:56.801
And to make matters worse, one of the most common reasons for

00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:01.581
fertility problems is blocked fallopian tubes, which are often caused

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:06.601
by infections suffered more frequently by women in poorer countries.

00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:13.811
In other words, women in poorer countries are more likely to have fertility problems, and

00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:20.101
if they do, they are less likely to have the financial resources to do anything about it.

00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:27.617
But in the countries where IVF is either heavily subsidised by the government or

00:13:27.797 --> 00:13:34.047
relatively affordable privately, it has been a boon for tens of millions of parents.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:38.627
Couples who would, in all probability, not have been

00:13:38.627 --> 00:13:41.867
able to have children, have been able to become parents.

00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:51.887
And if there was something of a taboo in the early days, that is long gone; IVF, and often the pain

00:13:51.887 --> 00:13:57.127
and anguish that comes along with it, is something that people are willing to talk about publicly.

00:13:58.477 --> 00:14:03.897
From celebrities like Michelle Obama and Celine Dion through to my friends and

00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:08.427
perhaps yours, in many developed countries it has become something that people are

00:14:08.437 --> 00:14:13.507
happy to talk about in the same way as they might talk about any other health issue.

00:14:14.847 --> 00:14:22.547
It is a wonderful development, but IVF is not a miracle cure, and it doesn’t work for everyone.

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:29.197
The biggest barrier facing IVF, apart from the cost, that is, is

00:14:29.257 --> 00:14:33.837
the clock; the older the egg, the lower the chance of success.

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:41.857
The statistics show that IVF is much less likely to succeed for a woman in her 40s than

00:14:41.857 --> 00:14:48.797
her 30s, but that is not because of the age of the woman but because of the age of the egg.

00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:56.275
However, as you may know, there is a solution to this: freezing your eggs.

00:14:57.285 --> 00:15:02.415
If a woman decides to freeze some of her eggs when she is, let’s say, in her late

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:09.955
20s, then these can be used for a round of IVF in her 30s or even 40s, and the

00:15:09.995 --> 00:15:16.595
probability of success is similar to that of a woman in her late 20s, not in her 40s.

00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:23.995
Now, freezing eggs is not cheap, but as more women are deciding to put off

00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:30.345
starting a family until later in life, egg freezing has boomed, with the number

00:15:30.365 --> 00:15:38.165
of British women freezing their eggs increasing by 64% from 2019 to 2021.

00:15:38.975 --> 00:15:44.065
Yes, the process of collecting eggs to freeze them is invasive and

00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:49.645
unpleasant, but it is considerably less so than it was in the 1980s.

00:15:50.975 --> 00:15:58.125
If this becomes increasingly more widespread and accepted, if the procedure becomes even less

00:15:58.145 --> 00:16:05.415
invasive and cheaper, and if it becomes a very normal thing for women to freeze their eggs just

00:16:05.415 --> 00:16:12.485
in case, then this could lead to an even greater shift upwards in the average age at birth.

00:16:13.895 --> 00:16:19.745
After all, if people want it and IVF allows it, there is nothing to stop it.

00:16:21.465 --> 00:16:28.374
And if this is the case, it would lead to a large increase in the number of people opting for IVF.

00:16:29.715 --> 00:16:35.665
Globally around 1% of babies are born to IVF, but if Denmark and

00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:41.625
Israel are anything to go by, it could easily go 10%, a 10x increase.

00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:49.385
And although it is now almost universally accepted and acknowledged as an important fertility

00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:56.199
procedure, there are still some critics who argue that it is teetering towards playing God.

00:16:57.605 --> 00:17:03.245
If it becomes a standard thing to freeze your eggs when you are 25 because you know

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:08.645
that you can have a baby at 45, so the critics say, how would this affect society?

00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:16.475
If a woman can have 10 eggs removed, and the process becomes so efficient and advanced that

00:17:16.475 --> 00:17:22.805
a parent can have 10 embryos growing outside the body, potentially choosing which one to keep

00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:28.889
based on certain criteria, then this really would be moving into “creator-like territory”.

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:35.889
And that, my dear friends, is what we will talk about in our next episode, the future of fertility.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.090
OK then, that is it for part two of this mini-series on

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.781
fertility in the 21st century, where we looked at IVF.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.310
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.550
Do you remember the news of the first IVF baby in your country?

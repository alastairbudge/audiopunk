Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:17.056
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:21.146
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:25.776
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is a special episode.

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:29.996
English Learning for Curious Minds is only just a couple

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:34.376
of years old, but it recently passed a million downloads.

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:37.766
It feels strange to say this, but there we go.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:44.136
So I wanted to mark the occasion with an extra special episode where I give

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:49.746
you my best tips and tricks for how to use podcasts to improve your English.

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:57.436
I’ve spent the past two years making podcasts, we are now at almost 250, I’ve

00:00:57.436 --> 00:01:02.546
talked to hundreds of our members, and along the way I’ve learned some of the

00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:06.986
most effective ways to use podcasts to improve your English language skills.

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:10.226
So, that’s what we’ll be talking about today.

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:15.726
We’ll start by talking about how to use them to improve your listening, then

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:20.936
we’ll talk about how to improve your vocabulary, we'll then move on to how to

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:26.546
improve your speaking with podcasts, and finish up by talking about writing.

00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:32.996
In each of these sections you’ll find specific tips and tricks for different

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:37.926
goals and for different difficulty levels, so I hope you’ll find it useful.

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.686
OK then, let’s get cracking.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:45.706
I want to start with a couple of administrative points.

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:51.040
Firstly, no matter whether this is the first time you’ve listened to English

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.090
Learning for Curious Minds or you have listened to every single episode - “that’s a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.910
message to my mother, by the way” - thank you for listening and being part of this.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.860
This show really would be nothing without you, so from

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.460
the bottom of my heart, thanks for your continued support.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:17.020
Secondly, all of the tips I’ll give you today can apply to almost any podcast, not just this one.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.610
In fact, I’d definitely recommend you to listen to different podcasts in English to hear

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.960
different accents, listen to different topics, and listen to people who speak in a different way.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.630
That being said, these tips work particularly well with this podcast, with English Learning

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.550
for Curious Minds, because it comes with all of the learning materials and support that you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.180
need, it has literally been designed from the ground up to help you as effectively as possible.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.960
And thirdly, our final but most important point.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.580
Learning English isn’t a competition.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.570
People have different goals, and different aims.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.320
Maybe you already work in an English-speaking company and you want to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.370
feel more confident and fluent in your conversations with colleagues.

00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:14.097
Maybe you’ve never been to an English-speaking country and

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:17.657
you just like improving your English for your own curiosity.

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:19.847
That’s completely fine.

00:03:20.187 --> 00:03:23.917
Everyone has their own goals, so you shouldn’t feel

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:27.147
like you need to do everything I’m about to suggest.

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:30.377
Think of it like a buffet.

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:37.917
Maybe you’re ready to try the really spicy dish and get hot and sweaty, but you don’t need to.

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:42.747
Feel free to pick and choose depending on your goals.

00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:50.057
The one thing I will assume though, given that you are already listening to a podcast in English,

00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:56.437
is that you want to improve your comprehension of spoken English and improve your vocabulary.

00:03:57.127 --> 00:04:03.237
And for most people this also implies that you want to improve your ability to be

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:10.477
understood, and to improve your productive English skills, either speaking, writing or both.

00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:17.137
So, with that out of the way, let’s start with reminding ourselves

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:21.457
what most people do with a podcast they’re using to learn English.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:24.677
Perhaps this is what you’re doing right now.

00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:27.427
You press play and listen.

00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:35.587
Maybe you pick up a few new words, and there is of course some subconscious learning going on.

00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:39.217
The more you listen, the more you understand.

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:44.097
Now, you might be thinking, “duh, tell me something I don’t know”.

00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:45.957
Bear with me here.

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:52.297
The reason I mention this is because if this is the only way you are using

00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:57.287
English podcasts, then you are missing out on some excellent opportunities

00:04:57.437 --> 00:05:01.847
to improve your grammar, vocabulary, and even speaking and writing.

00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:09.127
For lots of people, especially if you’re the sort of person who listens to a podcast while

00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:15.617
doing something else - walking, running, driving or just doing stuff around the house - it’s

00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:21.317
hard to do something else with the podcasts because, well, you’re already doing something else.

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:24.087
And that’s absolutely fine.

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:29.437
In fact, one of the great things about podcasts, for language

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:33.917
learning, is that you can fit them in alongside other things.

00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:39.727
And if this is you, if you normally put on a podcast on the bus or

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:44.077
on your drive to work in the morning, here’s my suggestion for you.

00:05:44.767 --> 00:05:50.667
It might sound simple, but in my experience remarkably few people do it.

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:56.307
And this is to work on becoming a more attentive listener.

00:05:56.837 --> 00:06:01.677
Try to pay as much attention as you possibly can to both the

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:06.827
sound of the language and the choice of words used by the speaker.

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:11.297
Let’s talk about the sound of the language point first.

00:06:12.047 --> 00:06:16.677
Listening to the sound of a language is incredibly important because

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:21.247
if you can’t tell the difference between how different sounds are

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:25.547
pronounced then you won’t be able to pronounce them correctly yourself.

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:35.147
Not everyone can have native-level pronunciation but the more you pay attention to the exact sounds

00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:40.647
that are being made, the better chance you will have at being able to pronounce them yourself.

00:06:41.977 --> 00:06:49.577
This might sound quite theoretical, so let me give you a concrete, real-life example.

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:53.377
We have lots and lots of listeners from Spain.

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:59.017
Listen to what I just said: “We have lots and lots of listeners from Spain”.

00:07:00.227 --> 00:07:05.397
Spanish speakers often have trouble with words that begin with consonants,

00:07:06.037 --> 00:07:10.667
so a Spanish speaker might have said “ah-listeners” and “eh-Spain”.

00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:13.217
Intead of "listeners" and "Spain".

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:19.017
And listen to the connected speech and intonation in that last

00:07:19.017 --> 00:07:22.737
sentence: “We have lots and lots of listeners from Spain”.

00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:30.937
If you were reading that sentence out loud, you might say “We have lots and lots

00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:39.177
of listeners from Spain”, but when listening to it carefully you see that the word

00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:48.107
“lots” flows directly onto “and”, and that the “d” of the “and” isn’t pronounced.

00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:55.917
I’ll say it again, and listen very carefully: We have lots and lots of listeners from Spain.

00:07:57.427 --> 00:08:03.007
See, you might not have noticed that before, but if you start to train

00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:08.057
yourself to actively listen out for the sounds then you will find it

00:08:08.077 --> 00:08:13.087
much easier when it comes to actually pronouncing these words yourself.

00:08:14.517 --> 00:08:18.997
Now, let’s move onto the next “noticing” bit and talk about

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:23.337
improving your vocabulary by becoming a more attentive listener.

00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:27.107
Exactly the same idea applies.

00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:31.327
The more carefully and critically you listen, the better.

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:38.587
You can certainly use podcasts, just like any source of input, to help you learn completely

00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:45.047
new individual words or phrases, words that you have never seen or heard before, but

00:08:45.407 --> 00:08:51.647
I’d actually think about using podcasts differently in terms of vocabulary building.

00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:57.367
And that’s helping you reinforce words and phrases that you might

00:08:57.407 --> 00:09:02.117
already know, that might already be in your passive vocabulary.

00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:07.897
What I mean by this is words or phrases that you would understand if

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:13.137
you heard or read them, but that you wouldn’t normally produce yourself.

00:09:14.577 --> 00:09:21.067
An example of this might be words, expressions and phrases to move from one point to another,

00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:27.707
the kind of small words or phrases that you might never learn in a textbook or classroom but

00:09:27.987 --> 00:09:35.137
are one of the things that separates natural sounding English from obviously non-native English

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.020
Again, let me give you an example of this.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.790
Well, there you go.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.530
I just used the word “again” to smoothly move from one sentence to another.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.260
And I just said “Well, there you go”.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.780
You probably already know what “again” and “well” mean,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.070
but would you have used them like that in your own speech?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.020
If you would have, congratulations.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.460
But this is the sort of stuff I’m talking about.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.780
Listen out very carefully for these sorts of words and phrases,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.880
notice them, and think critically about how they were used.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.440
This is a great start, and really is about as much as I’d recommend doing

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.320
for those of you who are listening to podcasts while doing other things.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.450
After all, trying to write something down or read a transcript while you’re

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:38.050
running or driving is a mixture of foolish, dangerous and plain illegal, so my

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.720
suggestion here is just to try to improve your “noticing” skills, particularly

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.470
on the construction of different sounds and on how words and phrases are used.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:57.740
But really, where podcasts come into their own, where they really excel, where they are really

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.550
fantastic, is on all of the things you can use them for if you concentrate 100% on them.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.550
In other words, don’t only listen while you’re driving, running, or doing the dishes.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:17.510
Treat them as a learning activity, sit down at a table or desk and really focus on them.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.020
And this brings us to our next section.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:28.080
Now, in this section I will refer to having the transcript and vocabulary lists for a podcast.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.290
In case you were unaware, all episodes of English Learning for Curious Minds, all

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:40.130
episodes of this podcast, come with a transcript and key vocabulary, as well as subtitles.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:46.270
Some other podcasts provide transcripts, but most don’t, and to my

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.650
knowledge there are no other English podcasts that provide subtitles,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.080
transcripts and the key vocabulary in the same way as this one does.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.200
So, you can follow the tips I’m about to provide without these

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.890
learning materials, but you will learn more quickly with them.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.030
So, let’s get into it.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.120
You’re sitting down at your desk or kitchen table, you have

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.530
decided to set aside 30 minutes to actively learn, what do you do?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.060
Well, because we were talking about active listening

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.890
in the first section, let’s continue on that path.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:30.030
As you might expect, if you are fully concentrating, you can do everything

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:35.210
we talked about in the first section but with considerably more success.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.870
Let’s talk first about building your vocabulary, and moving words

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.160
and phrases from your passive vocabulary to your active vocabulary.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.030
Here’s what I’d encourage you to do.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.130
When listening to an English podcast, keep a notebook

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.510
open to write down new and interesting words or phrases.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.580
Now, what does “new and interesting” mean?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.440
The beauty of this is that the choice of what words you want to learn is completely up to you.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:14.090
I remember talking to a member of Leonardo English from Argentina who worked with aeroplanes and

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:21.130
he had a very good English vocabulary when it came to words related to aeroplanes and aviation.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.770
But his day-to-day vocabulary wasn’t nearly as good.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:32.050
The point is that the most useful vocabulary for you depends on, surprise surprise, you.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.060
And for most people, there is little value in learning

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.060
words that you won’t need in your day-to-day life.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:48.400
If you are listening to the episode on “whaling”, for example, you might hear the word “harpoon”.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.750
If you didn’t know what it meant, it was the weapon that was used to hunt whales.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:00.260
But, thankfully, this is a pretty irrelevant word for most people nowadays.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.720
So if I were you, I wouldn’t waste my time and energy trying to remember it.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:12.000
But for words and phrases that you hear and think, “hmm, that’s the kind of thing

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.250
I would say in my own language”, this is where you should focus your energy.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.770
And here’s how I’d do it.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.250
In your notebook, write down the original word or phrase.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.280
Write down how it was used in context, so write down the

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.530
entire sentence or clause, underlining the word or phrase.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.240
If you need to, if it is a particularly new word or phrase, you can

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.570
write down the definition, either in English or in your own language.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.930
Then I’d practice writing a different sentence with it, try to use it in a different way.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.540
There are tools online, such as Ludwig or Sentence Stack,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.790
which will help you see if you have used it in the right way.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.670
And then repeat it out loud, ideally several times.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.110
If you do this you are significantly more likely to actually be able to

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.850
remember the word or phrase when it comes to the time to use it yourself.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.340
And it’s not hard to understand why.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:25.700
If you’re just listening and notice it while you’re doing something else you only hear it once.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.300
If you’re fully concentrating, you write the word down, you write it down

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.150
in context, you write down the meaning, you try using it in a sentence and

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:40.680
you try speaking it out loud, just think of how much more impactful this is.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.800
You haven’t just heard it once, you have interacted

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.270
with the word or phrase an additional five times.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:56.220
Of course, you can combine this with other ways of memorising vocabulary, such as flashcards

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:02.210
or the Gold List method, but the point I’m making is that just by doing this you have

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:07.940
engaged with the word or phrase 5 times more than you would have just by listening.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.280
One member of Leonardo English, an amazing German lady called Isabella, even told me she makes

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:21.570
a little list of new words or phrases she heard in an episode and decided she wants to use,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:27.700
and makes a point of ticking them off as she uses them in her English conversation classes.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.320
The key here, as you have guessed, is to make sure you actually use the new words or phrases you

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.850
are trying to learn, otherwise they will, at best, just continue to sit in your passive vocabulary.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.550
So, that’s improving your vocabulary.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.600
Let's move on to our third and fourth sections.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.410
Speaking and writing.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.550
Now, you might not have thought that you could improve your speaking or writing skills with

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:03.720
podcasts but in the next few minutes I’ll give you some tips on how you can do just that.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.480
First up is speaking.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.750
Here, I’m going to give you an intermediate tip, an

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.400
advanced tip, and–just for fun–a super professional tip.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.210
Our intermediate tip is to get into the habit of recording

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.650
yourself speaking, having used a podcast episode as a prompt.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.010
One of my favourite ways of using podcasts for this

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.020
is to record yourself giving a summary of an episode.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.580
You can use the show notes or transcript as a prompt to

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.958
jog your memory, and try to speak out loud what you heard.

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:50.490
This is a particularly good skill to develop if you work in English, as being able to listen to

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:57.610
extended dialogues and extract the key points is a valuable skill in any business environment.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:04.050
You could also use the podcast as a way to share your thoughts on the topic.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:05.570
What did you think?

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.950
What is your view on what you've just heard?

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.550
I always ask people to share their thoughts in our community,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.420
and we have some really interesting perspectives being shared.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.070
And yes, you can share audio recordings there too.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.830
If you are particularly interested in improving your pronunciation, and you have the transcript

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:32.970
of an episode, you can record yourself actually pretending to be the host of a podcast.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.250
You literally read it out loud, record yourself, and then compare yourself to the original.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.800
You might be thinking…can I just speak out loud?

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.620
Do I actually need to record myself?

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.210
Of course, you can, but recording yourself has several benefits.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:58.760
Firstly, it actually forces you to do it, and do it for a fixed period of time.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.950
Tell yourself that you need to press record and not stop talking until

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:09.410
the timer hits a certain time, perhaps just one minute to start, then two,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.390
and you can work your way up to giving a five-minute uninterrupted talk.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:20.450
Secondly, recording yourself allows you to recognise your mistakes.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:26.290
Recognising your mistakes when you speak live is really hard.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.190
Even if you are speaking with a native speaker they will often not point

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.450
out when you make mistakes, and recording yourself and listening out for

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:41.490
your own mistakes can be an excellent way to get better at self-correction.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.280
And the third reason is that it can be really helpful

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.570
with tracking your progress and staying motivated.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:55.280
If you are the sort of person who is learning independently, outside of

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.950
a classroom, it can be hard to see that you’re actually making progress.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:05.740
If you record yourself then it’s really easy to see how far you have come.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:11.170
And just on a practical level, you don’t need anything fancy.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.860
Just the inbuilt microphone on any mobile phone is perfect.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:22.660
You might also be thinking, “shouldn’t I be speaking to other people, not to myself?”.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.340
Yes, definitely.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:31.440
This shouldn’t be done instead of speaking to other people, but it can be done in addition to it.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:37.630
The reality is that not everyone has the chance to speak to other people in English

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:43.570
all the time, let alone native speakers, so recording yourself speaking to yourself

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.980
can be a great option if you don’t have the opportunity to speak much in English.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:55.660
Ok, our “advanced” technique to improve your speaking skills with podcasts is Shadowing.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.850
If you haven’t heard of Shadowing before, essentially it involves repeating

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:07.150
a piece of text just after the narrator, copying what they said exactly.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.910
It is a technique that almost every successful polyglot and successful

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:18.210
language learner swears by because, well, it is incredibly effective.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.930
We have an extended guide on Shadowing on our blog, so I won’t go

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.990
into it in too much detail, but here’s how I’d use it with podcasts.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:34.950
I’d set aside a small amount of time each day, let’s say 10 to 20 minutes.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:41.540
Find a section of a podcast episode that you want to shadow, that you want to work with.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.470
It should be no more than 5 minutes long.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.870
I would even start shorter - even a minute or two is fine.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.910
Listen to the original audio.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:59.470
Assuming you have the transcript, scan through, look through and see if there are any tricky words

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.110
that you might struggle to pronounce, and listen to how the narrator says them if you need to.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:12.190
Then press play and read the text out loud very shortly after the original.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.120
If you haven’t done it before it will feel strange but if you

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.980
stick with it I’m confident you will see excellent results.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.460
It helps pronunciation, connected speech, word stress and really

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.580
will make you sound like a much more natural English speaker.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.090
Again, there’s a guide on the Leonardo English blog with a lot more information

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.610
on this, so I’d definitely recommend checking that out if you want to do it.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.500
And I said I’d give you a super advanced, professional, even,

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.890
way in which you can use podcasts to improve your speaking.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.460
I actually found out about this after speaking to an amazing member

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.500
of Leonardo English from China who is doing a Masters in interpreting.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:05.000
She listens to a podcast and practises doing simultaneous interpreting,

00:23:05.478 --> 00:23:11.410
imagining that she is having to translate an episode real-time into Mandarin.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.820
Of course, this is a very advanced technique, so it does come with that warning,

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.240
but feel free to give that a go if you would like to give yourself a real challenge.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.130
Right, let’s move onto our last section, writing.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.200
This is a short section because, really, everything I

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.540
spoke about with recording yourself can be done in writing.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.280
You can write down a summary of what you heard, you can write

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.020
your own thoughts and opinions about it and share them online.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.020
And you can even transcribe it, you can try listening to a podcast episode,

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:56.420
writing down what you heard, and comparing that with the original transcript.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:03.080
Of course, these activities develop a different set of skills - your writing skills.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:09.600
And even if you think, “well, speaking is much more important than writing”, I would strongly

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:16.710
advise you to not overlook the power of writing, to not think that writing is unimportant.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.960
Writing is an incredibly powerful skill in terms of

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.560
forming ideas and structuring what you want to say.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.650
Writing also gives you the chance to think more critically about the words and phrases you

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:37.420
want to use, and, perhaps counterintuitively, writing ends up improving your speaking skills.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:44.790
To explain how this works, writing gives you the time to think that you don’t have when speaking.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.060
You can use this to your advantage by choosing different, new words or

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.590
phrases, and because you have started using them in writing, you will

00:24:54.590 --> 00:25:55.323
be more likely to recall, to remember them, when it comes to speaking.

00:25:55.323 --> 00:25:05.450
And if you’ve learned them in a podcast then you will already know how to pronounce them.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:13.850
OK, so those are my top tips and strategies on how to use podcasts to improve your English.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.410
In case you haven’t guessed, I’m a huge proponent, a huge

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.260
believer, in the power of podcasts for learning English.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.610
I’ve spoken to hundreds of you and have seen the impact

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.810
that podcasts have had on your language learning journey.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:36.160
So, whether you are just getting started with podcasts, or you have been listening for a long time

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:43.270
now, I hope these tips will help you become a more confident and more effective learner of English.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:52.580
OK then, that is it for today's unusual episode on how to use podcasts to improve your English.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.290
For those of you thinking “hang on, where have all the curious stories gone”, don’t

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:04.000
worry, this is a one-of-a-kind episode, normal programming will resume in the next one.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.970
As always, and in fact even more than always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.200
How long have you been using podcasts to learn English?

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.880
How have you been using them?

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.500
Have you been using any of the strategies I spoke about in this episode?

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.390
Have you found them to be effective?

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.360
And are there others that I should have mentioned?

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:33.190

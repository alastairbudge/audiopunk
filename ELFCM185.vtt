Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:17.317
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:22.057
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:28.407
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the cult book by J.

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:28.737
D.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.367
Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye.

00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:37.857
It is a book that is consistently considered as one of the finest novels

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:43.697
of the 20th century, but has almost as many critics as it does admirers.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:48.857
It has been called a dangerous book, and is frequently listed

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:53.147
as one of the most banned books in American classrooms.

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:59.467
It is even accused of being responsible for the murder of John Lennon,

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:05.307
of Beatles fame, and of an assassination attempt on a US president.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:13.527
So, in this episode we are going to talk about the book itself, about its author, about why

00:01:13.627 --> 00:01:20.217
it is so important, and we’ll also look at the impact that it has had on the English language.

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:25.237
This is actually a request from a great member of Leonardo English, an

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:29.877
awesome guy from Spain called Pedro, so thank you Pedro for this request.

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:34.827
And, the final administrative point that I should add is that

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:38.217
you don’t need to have read the book to enjoy this episode.

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:44.957
Indeed, if you haven’t read it, I hope listening to this episode might inspire you to do so.

00:01:46.587 --> 00:01:50.017
OK, without further ado let’s get started.

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:58.737
On 6th December 1980, a 25-year-old former security guard named

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:04.177
Mark Chapman took a flight from Honolulu, in Hawaii, to New York.

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:10.937
On the morning of 8th December, he hung around outside the apartment block

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:15.947
where John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, had been renting the penthouse.

00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:24.057
It wasn’t uncommon for fans to wait outside - although The Beatles had broken up 10 years

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:31.317
before, John Lennon was still incredibly famous, and was still mobbed by adoring fans.

00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:39.227
At around 5pm, when Lennon and Yoko Ono were about to head out to the recording

00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:44.127
studio, Chapman approached The Beatle and asked him for his autograph.

00:02:44.817 --> 00:02:48.707
Lennon obliged, he gave Chapman his autograph, he got

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:51.847
into a limousine and went to the recording studio.

00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:58.187
At about 11pm later on that evening, John Lennon and

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:01.877
Yoko Ono returned, tired from a long evening recording.

00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:07.117
As Lennon got out of the limousine, Chapman emerged from

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:11.777
the shadows, pulled out a gun and shot him four times.

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:18.577
Chapman calmly put the gun down as the rock star lay in front of him dying.

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:20.987
He didn’t try to run and hide.

00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:25.297
Instead, he sat down and pulled out a book.

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:30.387
Inside the book, he had written “This is my statement”.

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.167
That book was J.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:33.447
D.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.937
Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye.

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:42.792
Now, there are all sorts of theories about why Mark Chapman murdered John Lennon.

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:48.252
The truth is that nobody seems to know for sure, not even Mark Chapman.

00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:53.972
But this book that he was holding, The Catcher in the Rye, was immediately blamed.

00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:59.452
Since its publication in 1951, 29 years before,

00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:03.662
critics had been saying that this was a dangerous book.

00:04:04.062 --> 00:04:10.462
They had warned that it was dangerous to read, and that it would provoke people to do bad things.

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:15.982
With the murder of John Lennon, their worst fears had come true.

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:20.402
But what, you might be asking yourself, what could possibly

00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:25.122
be so terrible about this book that people feared it so badly?

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:29.902
Well, at first glance, perhaps not so much.

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:34.442
The book is relatively short, it’s a couple of hundred pages long.

00:04:35.112 --> 00:04:40.792
It is written in the form of a diary, narrated by a character called Holden

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:47.032
Caulfield, who is a 16-year-old American boy disillusioned with life.

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:52.812
Caulfield has just been kicked out of an expensive private school.

00:04:53.492 --> 00:05:00.022
He heads to New York and writes down what goes on over the course of a two-day period.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:05.842
It is written in what’s called a “stream of consciousness” style, as if the

00:05:05.982 --> 00:05:10.952
narrator was writing down his exact feelings at the moment he felt them.

00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:18.932
Caulfield is very much an anti-hero - he uses bad language, he lies, he

00:05:18.932 --> 00:05:24.722
is inconsistent, he doesn’t have the traditional attributes of a hero.

00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:30.692
Indeed, almost everything that could possibly go wrong for Caulfield, goes wrong.

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:37.952
And as readers, we aren’t really sure what to make of Caulfield, or of the book.

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:42.922
In much of the previous American literary tradition, it was

00:05:42.922 --> 00:05:46.292
clear how you should feel about the characters in a novel.

00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:49.142
Some were good, and you should support them.

00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:54.822
Others were bad, and the fact that they were bad characters would mean that they wouldn’t succeed.

00:05:55.542 --> 00:06:00.032
Of course, this is a great simplification, but it often holds true.

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:04.642
With The Catcher in the Rye, we aren’t sure what to think.

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:09.892
Some readers might read it and find Caulfield to be a terrible character,

00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:15.162
lying, fake himself, and not someone you would want to spend time with.

00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:19.412
While others might read it and see Caulfield to be the

00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:22.172
only person in the world who is speaking the truth.

00:06:23.532 --> 00:06:27.152
Another interesting aspect of the book is that there really

00:06:27.182 --> 00:06:31.172
isn’t a huge amount of development of Caulfield’s character.

00:06:31.832 --> 00:06:37.582
In the literary tradition of the time there was often the idea that an anti-hero

00:06:37.622 --> 00:06:43.812
type of character would achieve some kind of redemption as the novel went on, that

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:48.542
they would understand the world better, and they would develop as a character.

00:06:49.532 --> 00:06:53.832
But with The Catcher in the Rye, we really are left guessing - it is

00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:58.942
not clear in the slightest - if Holden Caulfield has learnt anything.

00:06:59.992 --> 00:07:07.252
All of this put together beautifully encapsulates the experience of being a teenager, especially

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:14.452
that of a teenager in post-war America, someone who was trying to understand the world,

00:07:14.742 --> 00:07:20.682
struggling with it, and [as the book ends] still hasn’t reached any kind of conclusions.

00:07:22.012 --> 00:07:28.292
The unique narrative style, combined with the fact that it was immediately relatable to

00:07:28.352 --> 00:07:34.862
teenagers, meant that it started to appear in classrooms, as teachers used it with their students.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:40.102
I can remember reading it while at school, and can vividly remember it

00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:44.532
being one of the books that everyone was very happy to read, because

00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:48.812
it was so relatable to the emotions the teenagers were feeling.

00:07:49.742 --> 00:07:54.992
But, not everyone was happy with the fact that it was being taught in schools.

00:07:55.732 --> 00:08:02.672
In 1960, 9 years after it was first published, an Oklahoma school teacher lost

00:08:02.672 --> 00:08:08.462
her job after she refused to stop teaching the book to her class of 16-year-olds.

00:08:09.242 --> 00:08:15.562
She appealed and got her job back, but on the condition that she stopped teaching this book.

00:08:16.852 --> 00:08:17.912
The criticism?

00:08:18.672 --> 00:08:24.752
That Holden Caulfield sets a bad example for teenagers, and that reading The Catcher in the

00:08:24.752 --> 00:08:31.422
Rye might mean that impressionable teenagers would behave in a similar way to the protagonist.

00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:37.062
Holden Caulfield smoked, he tried to order alcohol at a bar, despite

00:08:37.062 --> 00:08:42.212
being underage, he tried to hire a prostitute, he skipped school, he

00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:48.082
lied, he behaved in a way that was contrary to good American values.

00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:55.052
And so, so the argument goes, he was a bad example and teenagers shouldn’t read his story.

00:08:55.692 --> 00:09:02.332
If you have listened to the last episode, episode 183, on Banned Books, you will

00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:07.102
remember that we talked about some of the reasons that books are banned, and

00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:13.512
put it down to four main categories: political, sexual, moral, and religious.

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:20.122
There is, of course, quite a lot of overlap between some of these categories, but

00:09:20.302 --> 00:09:25.232
the book we are talking about today, The Catcher in the Rye, is mostly objected

00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:30.812
to on moral grounds, that it would create a generation of teenagers with the

00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:36.472
moral compass of Holden Caulfield, that is, not much of a moral compass at all.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:41.792
Although the book remained a controversial choice in American schools, it

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:47.602
continued to fly off the shelves, it was sold and read in large quantities.

00:09:48.282 --> 00:09:53.122
And then, in 1980, it was seen as the inspiration for the

00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:56.472
murder of one of the most famous musicians in the world.

00:09:57.452 --> 00:10:02.222
Mark Chapman had said that he was inspired by Holden Caulfield, and

00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:07.182
said he had decided to kill John Lennon because he was a “phoney”.

00:10:07.802 --> 00:10:15.002
A “phoney” is a slang way to say that someone is fake, that they aren’t true to themselves,

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:21.682
and Chapman said he believed that Lennon had turned into a phoney, and by killing

00:10:21.682 --> 00:10:28.042
him, he was preserving the original, non-phoney John Lennon for future generations.

00:10:28.842 --> 00:10:34.082
It wasn’t to be the only time that the book was involved in an assassination attempt.

00:10:34.822 --> 00:10:42.422
A year later, in 1981, a man named John Hinkley Jr tried to kill the American president

00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:49.192
Ronald Reagan, and the police later found a copy of The Catcher in The Rye in his hotel room.

00:10:49.922 --> 00:10:55.072
He admitted that he was a fan of the book, but it was dismissed as

00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:58.892
not having played a role in his motivation to kill the US president.

00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:02.902
After all, it was one of the best known books in the

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:07.182
US, and had been read by tens of millions of Americans.

00:11:07.932 --> 00:11:13.212
If a few people who read the book turned out to have murderous ambitions,

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:17.162
to want to kill people, that surely wasn’t the fault of the book.

00:11:18.082 --> 00:11:21.812
Now, the part of The Catcher in the Rye that we haven’t

00:11:21.822 --> 00:11:25.342
really spoken about at all yet is its author, J.

00:11:25.342 --> 00:11:25.572
D.

00:11:25.572 --> 00:11:26.152
Salinger.

00:11:27.182 --> 00:11:32.522
This is deliberate, I’ve put this part at the end on purpose, because J.

00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:32.732
D.

00:11:32.732 --> 00:11:34.962
Salinger did not enjoy attention.

00:11:35.802 --> 00:11:41.332
Indeed, while other authors might enjoy the fame and fortune that

00:11:41.332 --> 00:11:45.932
writing a bestselling book might bring them, J.D Sallinger did not.

00:11:47.022 --> 00:11:54.262
Shortly after The Catcher in the Rye was published, Salinger essentially withdrew from public life.

00:11:54.482 --> 00:11:59.382
He continued to write, but would very rarely publish his works.

00:12:00.012 --> 00:12:04.352
He reportedly wrote another 15 novels, but decided

00:12:04.352 --> 00:12:07.752
not to publish any of them, writing only for himself.

00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:13.622
He also fiercely resisted allowing anyone to make a film of his book.

00:12:14.242 --> 00:12:18.822
Obviously, this would have been a pretty easy way to earn a lot of money,

00:12:19.162 --> 00:12:24.112
but Salinger said no, he wouldn’t sell, no matter how much he was offered.

00:12:25.402 --> 00:12:30.122
But The Catcher in the Rye is inseparable from the life of J.

00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:30.312
D.

00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:34.572
Salinger, and the links between his own life, the writing

00:12:34.572 --> 00:12:38.242
of the book, and its protagonist, are fascinating.

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:43.302
For starters, it took Salinger over 10 years to write the book.

00:12:44.022 --> 00:12:48.852
He first started developing the character of Holden Caulfield in the

00:12:48.892 --> 00:12:54.262
early 1940s, before he was shipped off to fight in the Second World War.

00:12:55.452 --> 00:13:00.952
Salinger fought at D-Day, when the Allied forces invaded Northern France, and

00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:06.212
he was also part of the liberation groups at the Nazi concerntration camps.

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:12.372
This experience, as one can only imagine, deeply affected him,

00:13:12.682 --> 00:13:17.012
and he spent time in a mental hospital at the end of the war.

00:13:17.872 --> 00:13:23.342
He was probably suffering from what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:28.652
Throughout the Second World War, he kept his notebooks, with what

00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:32.202
was the first draft of The Catcher in the Rye, in his pocket.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:38.822
From rushing onto the beach in Northern France through to liberating Paris, right through

00:13:38.822 --> 00:13:45.122
to walking through the gates of the concentration camp at Dachau and seeing the horrors

00:13:45.312 --> 00:13:51.350
that the Nazis had left behind, he kept his precious manuscript with him at all times.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.840
There are several theories that The Catcher in the Rye reflects the great

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:02.450
sense of loss and alienation that Salinger himself felt during the war.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:09.250
Through Caulfield, the book’s narrator, Salinger is echoing his own feelings,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:14.730
his own confusion about the world, and this is his own way of trying to

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.690
make sense of what he had experienced in Europe during the Second World War.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.430
This is all theory though.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.990
Salinger rarely gave any interviews, and he never talked in detail about Holden Caulfield.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:35.490
Knowing what we now know about his experience during the war, how he kept the

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:41.030
text with him throughout, and how long he spent perfecting the text afterwards,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.890
perhaps it becomes a little more understandable why he was so possessive over

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:52.470
its integrity, never wanting it to be altered or turned into a film or play.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.280
Now, let’s finish this episode by talking about some of the

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.880
influences that this book has had on the English language.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:07.110
It’s worth pointing out that the language that Caulfield uses was the language used by

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:14.350
American teenagers in the 1940s and 1950s - Salinger isn’t thought to have invented words

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:22.090
himself, but rather by becoming the vocabulary of probably the most famous unhappy American

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:28.530
teenager of the 20th century, the language of Holden Caulfield has been immortalised.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.680
For starters, Caulfield swears a lot.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:40.670
He writes “Goddam” 237 times - everything seems to be goddam this and goddam that.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:49.420
He uses “bastard” 58 times, “Chris sake” 31 times and he says “fuck” 6 times.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.450
Especially for more conservative parents, this was

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.270
enough on its own to stop it being taught in schools.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.990
Other than the swear words, he uses the word “phoney” 42 times.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:12.010
To remind you, phoney means fake, not true, but Caulfield uses it in a

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:17.020
more liberal sense, using it to describe almost anyone he doesn’t like.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.180
You might not hear many people using the word “phoney” now, but it is

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.810
a word that will forever be associated with The Catcher in the Rye.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:35.468
And although some of the language and setting does feel a little dated, it does feel a little

00:16:35.788 --> 00:16:42.838
old, how Holden feels is as relevant to teenagers today as it was when it was published in

00:16:42.848 --> 00:16:49.388
1951, and the book continues to be taught in schools throughout the English-speaking world.

00:16:50.238 --> 00:16:55.028
It continues to have its critics, and is added and removed from

00:16:55.158 --> 00:17:00.238
school curriculums depending on how liberal the governing body is, but

00:17:00.258 --> 00:17:04.588
tens of millions of schoolchildren still read it every single year.

00:17:05.468 --> 00:17:13.088
And no doubt it will remain as relevant in 50 or 100 years as it is now, and was 70 years ago.

00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:19.318
As teenagers grow up, become adults and have their own children, they want their

00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:24.048
children to experience the same feelings they had when they read this book.

00:17:24.818 --> 00:17:30.758
No matter whether it’s a Californian in 1951 or a teenager from Madrid

00:17:30.898 --> 00:17:36.308
in 2021, there are many of the same insecurities, the same struggles

00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:39.898
to understand the world, and the same feelings of disappointment.

00:17:40.648 --> 00:17:47.508
For sure, teenagers in 2021 have many different concerns than teenagers did in 1951.

00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:51.028
Whether we are talking about climate change or

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:54.948
navigating the complex world of your own online image.

00:17:55.468 --> 00:18:02.968
And in 1951, teenagers were growing up in a completely new world, a world that had just come

00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:10.898
out of two devastating wars, and was essentially a new slate, a tabula rasa, an open door.

00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:13.718
So, a lot has changed.

00:18:13.858 --> 00:18:15.488
But a lot hasn’t.

00:18:16.238 --> 00:18:22.478
The transition from childhood to adulthood is a confusing time, and when

00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:27.228
it comes to a book that really captures the essence of what it is like,

00:18:27.708 --> 00:18:32.958
it is hard to find one that does a better job than The Catcher in the Rye.

00:18:35.108 --> 00:18:39.158
OK then, that is it for today's episode on J.

00:18:39.158 --> 00:18:39.388
D.

00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:42.398
Salinger’s classic book, The Catcher in the Rye.

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:48.678
If you are up for trying out a cult American book, I would definitely recommend giving it a try.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:55.148
The language is quite colloquial, there is quite a lot of slang in it, but once you

00:18:55.178 --> 00:18:59.588
get the hang of how Caulfield speaks, I think you will find it quite manageable.

00:19:00.918 --> 00:19:04.408
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:08.908
Have you read The Catcher in the Rye, either in English or in translation?

00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:10.728
What did you think of it?

00:19:11.178 --> 00:19:13.148
Does it deserve its high praise?

00:19:13.608 --> 00:19:18.468

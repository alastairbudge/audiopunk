Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:17.501
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:21.671
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:28.321
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Bonnie and Clyde.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.609
They are probably the most infamous criminal couple in history, and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.579
their story of love, robberies, murder and running away from the law has

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.389
been immortalised in books, film, TV series, song, and popular culture.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.839
So, in this episode we are going to tell the real story of Bonnie

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.449
and Clyde - who they actually were, why they turned to a life of

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.569
crime, what they actually did, and how they were eventually stopped.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.749
I should say that this episode is a request from Agnese, an

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.719
awesome member from Latvia, so Agnese, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.659
Ok then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.709
Our story starts at the start of the 20th century, in Texas, in the United States.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.789
Bonnie Elizabeth Parker was born in 1910, and had lived a relatively privileged, middle-class life.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.539
She did well in school, she was a talented actress, she wrote poems

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:41.809
and stories, and her childhood was, by all accounts, a happy one.

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:47.449
She met a boy, Roy Thornton, in her second year of high school,

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.289
and six days before her 16th birthday the pair were married.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.939
Roy Thornton was not a nice man.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.169
He drank heavily, he beat Bonnie, and he would stay away for long

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.769
periods of time, most likely having affairs with other women.

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:13.349
If that wasn’t bad enough, he was also a criminal, and spent much of

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.619
the years immediately after they were married behind bars, in prison.

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.579
Although the marriage was not a happy one, Bonnie never divorced

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.619
him, and wore her wedding ring for the rest of her life.

00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:34.702
It appears that, despite having been a creative, talented

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:39.492
and promising young girl, Bonnie was attracted to bad men.

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:47.532
And in January of 1930, when she was 19 years old, she met a man she immediately

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:53.772
fell in love with and would forever be associated with: Clyde Chestnut Barrow.

00:02:54.915 --> 00:03:00.395
Clyde Barrow had been born into poverty - his family lived under a wagon

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:04.605
for a few months because they didn’t have enough money to stay in a house.

00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:11.595
But he, like Bonnie, was a talented young man, and showed early signs of promise.

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:16.069
He was very musical, and was an excellent guitar player.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:25.629
But, he showed early signs of waywardness, early signs that he wasn’t so keen on obeying the law.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:31.909
The first crime he was caught for, when he was only 17 years old,

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:37.621
had been for taking out a rental car and deciding not to return it.

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.211
Essentially, for stealing a car.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.120
Remember this, as cars, and deciding to separate them from

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.730
their legal owners, will be a theme throughout this story.

00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:55.217
Clyde soon turned to a full-on life of petty crime.

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:59.887
He would steal from shops, he would steal cars, he would commit

00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:05.577
all sorts of relatively small but certainly not victimless crimes.

00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:14.117
And indeed, when he met Bonnie, in January of 1930, he was actually on the run from the police.

00:04:15.267 --> 00:04:19.657
It didn’t take long for the police to catch him, and two weeks

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:24.447
after he had met Bonnie, he was caught and thrown in jail.

00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:32.367
The duo had immediately fallen for each other, it had been love at first sight, and they

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:39.087
continued to write to each other while Clyde was in jail, professing their love for one another.

00:04:40.202 --> 00:04:45.762
Bonnie even managed to smuggle in, to secretly bring in, a pistol to

00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:51.262
Clyde while he was in jail, allowing him to break out and be reunited

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:55.332
with this young girl he had been longing to see again, Bonnie.

00:04:56.272 --> 00:05:00.662
Unfortunately, he was caught shortly after, and sent back to

00:05:00.662 --> 00:05:06.642
prison, this time to the infamously terrible Eastham Prison Farm.

00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:14.392
From here, there was no escaping, and inmates suffered terrible beatings by the guards.

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:20.562
One guard would reportedly even murder inmates, shoot them in cold

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:24.742
blood, and then claim that they had been shot while trying to escape.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:29.042
It wasn’t just the guards that were committing murders.

00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:34.352
While in prison, Clyde also committed his first recorded murder.

00:05:35.172 --> 00:05:40.592
He was being sexually assaulted by another prisoner, and he managed to break free,

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:46.762
pick up an iron pipe and hit his attacker so hard over the head that he died.

00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:54.382
However, another prisoner, one who was already serving a life sentence and who wouldn’t ever get

00:05:54.382 --> 00:06:01.252
out of prison anyway, said that he did it, so Clyde was never actually charged with this murder.

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:07.922
If the beatings and threat of sexual assault weren’t enough, the days

00:06:07.942 --> 00:06:12.762
in prison were spent doing back-breaking hard-labour in the fields.

00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:20.942
It was too much for Clyde, and to avoid being sent out to work he cut off two of his toes.

00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:26.832
Now, it’s not known whether he cut them off himself or if he got another

00:06:27.002 --> 00:06:32.712
inmate to do it for him, but this gives you an idea of quite how much he wanted

00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:38.352
to avoid this work, that he would literally cut off body parts to avoid it.

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:46.152
Little known to Clyde, his mother had been working hard to try to get him released from prison,

00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:53.212
and two weeks after chopping off his toes he was released on parole, he was released from prison.

00:06:54.002 --> 00:06:58.322
There had been no need to injure himself, but the damage was

00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:02.632
done, and Clyde walked with a limp for the rest of his life.

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:10.805
Now a free man, or at least a man on parole, he was able to be reunited with Bonnie.

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:17.705
Reportedly he tried to get his life back on the straight and narrow, he tried to live an

00:07:17.755 --> 00:07:25.295
honest, crime-free life, and did manage to do so for two weeks, but it was impossible.

00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:31.185
He was released in February of 1932, at the middle of the Great Depression.

00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:39.195
A quarter of the country was unemployed, and Clyde was an ex-con, he was a convicted criminal.

00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:44.805
Whenever he got a job, he would lose it, and he decided,

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:48.225
screw it, I’ll just take what I can’t get legally.

00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:54.585
He was also a deeply bitter man after his release from prison.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:58.605
He vowed to get revenge on the guards who had treated him

00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:03.129
so badly, and to get equal with the Texas authorities.

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:10.199
According to one of his fellow inmates, a man who would later join his criminal gang, Ralph

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:17.535
Fults, during his two years in prison Clyde changed “from a schoolboy to a rattlesnake”.

00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:20.945
Their crime spree began.

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:26.846
Initially, Clyde and Bonnie teamed up with Clyde’s fellow inmate, Ralph Fults.

00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:31.485
They robbed shops, gas stations, and small businesses.

00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:36.175
It’s not clear exactly what their motives were.

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:42.325
There is one theory that they were trying to earn enough money to buy guns and launch

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:47.955
an attack on the prison where Clyde had been kept, to get revenge on the guards.

00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:52.845
They certainly weren’t trying to get rich, and the amounts

00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:56.425
of money that they would steal were generally pretty low.

00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:06.605
Over the next 12 months or so, so this is between 1932 and 1933, their gang grew in number,

00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:12.985
and they started to commit their first murders, both of police officers and shop owners.

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:19.555
It should be said that, for all of their criminal career, Bonnie and Clyde appeared

00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:25.405
to try to avoid killing members of the public unless absolutely necessary, although

00:09:25.635 --> 00:09:30.385
they did end up killing at least nine police officers and four members of the public.

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:36.317
For the first 12 months or so of their small-time criminal career,

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:41.117
they went relatively unnoticed, at least by the American public.

00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:47.777
The robberies were small, and they were far from the only criminals who had killed policemen.

00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:52.107
This, remember, was the era of the bank robber.

00:09:53.057 --> 00:09:59.121
John Dillinger, who you can hear about in episode number 222 by the way, John

00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:04.731
Dillinger was in full swing, and there were plenty of hardened criminals robbing

00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:11.181
shops, banks, and all manner of businesses, and killing plenty of cops in the process.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:17.101
So, Bonnie and Clyde were far from the worst, and they went under

00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:22.341
the radar, they weren’t really known about, until March of 1933.

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:26.381
Clyde’s brother and his wife had joined the gang,

00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:30.421
and they were all hiding out in a house in Missouri.

00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:35.182
The gang liked to party, and they would stay up late

00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:38.722
playing cards, making lots of noise, and drinking.

00:10:39.482 --> 00:10:45.042
Now, remember that this was the Prohibition Era, alcohol was still illegal.

00:10:45.422 --> 00:10:48.822
So when neighbours alerted the authorities that there

00:10:48.822 --> 00:10:52.392
was drinking going on, they came to investigate.

00:10:53.824 --> 00:10:59.204
Five officers approached the building, and when the gang got wind of what was

00:10:59.204 --> 00:11:04.324
going on, when they realised that they were in trouble, they fired their guns on

00:11:04.324 --> 00:11:09.524
the police officers, killing one officer outright and fatally wounding another.

00:11:10.414 --> 00:11:14.266
The gang escaped, but left behind all of their possessions.

00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:20.016
When officers later searched the house, they found guns, poetry

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:24.256
that Bonnie had written, and a camera with undeveloped film.

00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:30.766
When they developed the pictures, they were amazed at what they had found, and if you have

00:11:30.806 --> 00:11:37.186
ever seen old black and white pictures of Bonnie & Clyde, they will likely be from this camera.

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:42.616
The pictures showed Bonnie and Clyde holding guns, playing

00:11:42.616 --> 00:11:46.906
around, looking into each other’s eyes lovingly, and kissing.

00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:53.076
The police officers made these photos available to the media, who pounced

00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:58.536
on them, they jumped at the opportunity to create this sensational story.

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:04.571
Here were two beautiful young people, madly in love, with one

00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:08.711
of them, Bonnie, in love with a man who wasn’t her husband.

00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:16.271
They looked like a couple on the most marvelous adventure, but they were murderous criminals.

00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:22.629
In one picture Bonnie is smoking a cigar and has a pistol in her hand.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:26.979
In another, which is actually the image we’ve used for this

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:30.899
episode, she is pointing a shotgun directly at her lover.

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:35.792
It was the kind of story that the media loved, and

00:12:35.992 --> 00:12:39.772
overnight they were catapulted to nationwide fame.

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:43.659
Reportedly, Bonnie loved the fame.

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:47.939
She had always wanted to be a star, to be in the movies, and

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:52.489
to be famous, and now she was, albeit for the wrong reasons.

00:12:53.478 --> 00:12:57.078
The problem was that, now they were famous, they couldn’t

00:12:57.088 --> 00:13:01.328
go anywhere, and their lives were far from glamorous.

00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:06.447
Previously, they had been able to rent houses, to live a

00:13:06.457 --> 00:13:11.037
semi-normal life, at least in terms of going into towns and so on.

00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:15.637
But after their pictures were plastered all over

00:13:15.637 --> 00:13:19.397
the newspapers, they were no longer able to do this.

00:13:19.972 --> 00:13:26.002
They had to live outside, camping in tents, and sleeping in stolen cars.

00:13:26.532 --> 00:13:31.282
They would have to wash in rivers, and eat whatever they could get their hands on.

00:13:32.352 --> 00:13:36.852
The newspapers portrayed them as this young couple of lovers on

00:13:36.852 --> 00:13:42.312
the run living a glamorous life, but the reality was far from it.

00:13:43.262 --> 00:13:45.842
What’s more, it wasn’t just the two of them.

00:13:46.142 --> 00:13:52.532
There was Bonnie, Clyde, but also Clyde’s brother, his wife, and Clyde’s friend, W.D.

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:53.142
Jones.

00:13:54.072 --> 00:13:59.272
Later accounts from Clyde’s sister in law, Blanche Barrow, show quite how

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:03.712
unromantic and stressful life on the road must have been for the gang.

00:14:04.272 --> 00:14:09.440
There were five of them, spending all day together, travelling normally

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.140
just in one car, and they were always looking around them, keeping a

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:19.510
lookout for a suspicious member of the public or, worse, a police car.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.570
The punishment if they were caught would be the electric chair,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.380
understandably something that they all wanted to avoid at all costs.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.170
And they were constantly running out of money.

00:14:33.493 --> 00:14:37.613
See, they were never very good at the actual robbery part.

00:14:38.383 --> 00:14:42.863
They robbed around ten banks in total, but the most that they ever

00:14:42.863 --> 00:14:49.483
managed to take was $1,500, which is about $30,000 in today’s money.

00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:56.153
See, it was the Great Depression, and there simply wasn’t much money going around.

00:14:57.383 --> 00:15:01.533
One time they even tried to rob a bank only to find out

00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:05.313
that it had failed, it had gone bankrupt, the week before.

00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:13.613
There were numerous close shaves, many near encounters, with the police, and indeed in July of

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:21.003
1933 Clyde’s brother was killed and his sister in law arrested after a shootout with the police.

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:30.853
Then at the start of 1934, the tide started to turn against the pair, public opinion shifted and

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:37.453
there was an even greater feeling among the police that Bonnie and Clyde needed to be stopped.

00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:44.823
In January of 1934, Clyde decided to get revenge on Eastham Prison, the prison

00:15:45.003 --> 00:15:49.943
where he had been held, sexually assaulted, and had a miserable two years.

00:15:50.943 --> 00:15:54.173
He managed to get weapons to the prisoners, who promptly

00:15:54.183 --> 00:15:58.063
broke out of prison, killing a prison guard in the process.

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:04.143
This was highly embarrassing for the authorities, and the hunt was now on.

00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:10.663
To make matters worse for the pair, in April of 1934 they shot

00:16:10.733 --> 00:16:15.403
and killed two Texas road policemen who had approached their car.

00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:19.093
The newspapers jumped on the story.

00:16:19.403 --> 00:16:22.673
One of the young policemen who was murdered was about to be

00:16:22.673 --> 00:16:27.373
married, and his fiancée wore her wedding dress to his funeral.

00:16:28.673 --> 00:16:35.093
Eye witnesses later said that Bonnie and Clyde had fired the shots, despite another member

00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:41.493
of the gang, Henry Methvin later claiming that he had fired the first shot, not Bonnie.

00:16:42.423 --> 00:16:46.843
The damage was done, and in the public’s eyes Bonnie and

00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:52.633
Clyde had gone from romantic duo to cold-blooded cop-killers.

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:57.223
What’s more, they were being chased by one of Texas’s

00:16:57.223 --> 00:17:01.233
most notorious policemen, a man named Frank Hamer.

00:17:02.093 --> 00:17:08.039
Frank Hamer had a fierce reputation for catching criminals, and the official records

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:15.369
have him as having killed 53 people personally and having been shot seventeen times.

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:20.259
He had been persuaded to come out of retirement to

00:17:20.259 --> 00:17:24.319
get Bonnie and Clyde, and he was firmly on the case.

00:17:25.364 --> 00:17:30.344
He knew how to use a gun, but he clearly also knew how to use his head.

00:17:31.004 --> 00:17:34.904
He tracked the movements of Bonnie and Clyde, and realised

00:17:35.174 --> 00:17:38.364
that they tended to stay close to the state borders.

00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:42.584
They did this because police officers from one state

00:17:42.904 --> 00:17:45.924
couldn’t follow a criminal from one state to another.

00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:50.894
It was a smart move on Bonnie and Clyde's part, but

00:17:51.134 --> 00:17:55.004
it was predictable, and it was to be their downfall.

00:17:56.074 --> 00:18:00.824
Frank Hamer, the policeman leading the hunt, had identified Henry

00:18:00.844 --> 00:18:05.634
Methvin as a member of the gang, and had approached Methvin’s father.

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:12.121
In exchange for helping the investigation, Hamer would spare his son.

00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:17.711
The elder Methvin agreed to collaborate, and a trap was set.

00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:22.781
They believed that Bonnie and Clyde would be travelling down a

00:18:22.781 --> 00:18:27.341
particular road to meet Methvin’s family on a particular day.

00:18:28.451 --> 00:18:33.521
The elder Methvin agreed to wait on the road in his car with the

00:18:33.521 --> 00:18:38.273
idea that Bonnie and Clyde would see his car and stop to talk to him.

00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:43.898
Meanwhile, Hamer and his team would be hiding in the bushes.

00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:49.710
They waited and waited almost a day, went past with no car.

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:56.370
Then, all of a sudden, they heard the sound of a car screaming down the road.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:02.620
Clyde was behind the wheel, and sure enough he did stop to speak to Methvin’s father.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:09.030
Before he realised that it was a trap and could pull out his gun to defend

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:14.090
himself, the officers jumped out from behind the bushes and opened fire.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.920
Over 130 bullets were fired, and Bonnie and Clyde were

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:25.270
killed instantly, at the ages of 23 and 25 respectively.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.210
When word got out of their death, people flocked to

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.050
the nearest town to try to get a glimpse of the pair.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:41.060
The population of the small town swelled from 4,000 to 12,000 overnight.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.960
People tried to cut off Bonnie’s hair and even cut off Clyde’s

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.580
fingers and ears as a memory, but they were beaten away by the police.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:20:00.280
The legacy and legend of Bonnie and Clyde is, as you may now realise, very different to the truth.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:07.130
They were immortalised in the 1967 film “Bonnie and Clyde”, and the French duo,

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.220
Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot, released a song about them in the same year.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:19.970
Both versions highly romanticise the real story, and have Bonnie and Clyde

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:25.710
living this wonderful adventure and outsmarting the police at every turn.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.520
The reality is, as we’ve just heard, very different.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:38.640
But it was entirely predictable, and both Bonnie and Clyde knew how their story would end.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:46.371
Bonnie, in fact, wrote a poem about it, which was discovered at the same time as the photos.

00:20:47.654 --> 00:20:48.410
The poem read:

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:51.490
Some day they’ll go down together;

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.350
And they’ll bury them side by side,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.060
To a few it’ll be grief—

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.240
To the law a relief—

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.760
But it’s death for Bonnie and Clyde.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.490
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Bonnie and Clyde.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:16.130
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that if you had a

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:22.980
slightly romanticised version of the story in mind, then at least this has put the record straight.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.430
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.860
Is the true story different from what you had thought?

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.240
And as for Bonnie and Clyde, why do you think they did it?

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.070
Did they just start and couldn’t stop?

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.150
Were they victims of their situation?

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:44.403
Hamer Or were they bloodthirsty murderers?

00:21:44.723 --> 00:21:47.863
How should we really remember Bonnie and Clyde?

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:52.583
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

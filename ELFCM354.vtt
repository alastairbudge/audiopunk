Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.629
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.690
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.430
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.840
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.929
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.990
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.510
talking about a scandalous tale of

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.820
expensive tastes, fast cars, gambling,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.240
and a high-flying British aristocrat’s

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.150
involvement in one of Britain’s

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.699
most infamous unsolved murders.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.560
This is the story of Lord Lucan,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.669
the British peer and gambling

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.870
addict who disappeared after his

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.070
nanny was found brutally murdered.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.890
It’s a case and, crucially, a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.119
disappearance, that still fascinates

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.740
people to this very day, and has led

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.960
to countless theories and supposed

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.040
sightings all over the world.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.569
OK then, let’s get into it and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.259
talk about Lord Lucan - the British

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.499
aristocrat suspected of murder who

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:09.989
disappeared, never to be seen again.

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.639
It was a quiet evening on

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.296
the 7th of November, 1974.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.409
London’s Belgravia neighbourhood, one of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.539
the city’s most exclusive, was calm and

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.079
quiet, the rows of whitewashed terrace

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:27.979
houses lit up by lights of activity.

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:31.159
Suddenly, the air was filled

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.204
with frantic breathing and the

00:01:33.204 --> 00:01:35.130
pitter-patter of footsteps.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.239
On Lower Belgrave Street, a woman sprinted

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.229
past, a look of panic across her face.

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:44.889
She was barefoot and covered in blood.

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:47.179
Searching desperately for

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.719
help, the first place she saw

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.969
was a pub, the Plumbers Arms.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.699
She burst into the bar.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.919
“Help me, help me,” she cried.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.919
“I have just escaped from a murderer.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.079
He’s in my house.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.919
He murdered the nanny.”

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.519
As the barman tried to calm the

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:08.083
woman down, the punters, the people

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:10.233
drinking in the bar, turned in

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:11.943
shock at what they were seeing.

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:14.493
This poor woman, they thought.

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:17.973
But little did they know that they

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:20.503
had just witnessed the first step, the

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.623
first clue, in one of the most infamous

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:26.743
unsolved murder cases in British history.

00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:30.693
This woman was no ordinary

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.683
punter, no ordinary lady.

00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:36.513
She was Lady Lucan, the wife of one of

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:39.013
the country’s most flamboyant aristocrats.

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.563
But before we get into the events

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:44.303
of that fateful night, we should

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.533
first consider a bit of background.

00:02:47.593 --> 00:02:50.063
Lord Lucan was born Richard John

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:53.153
Bingham on the 18th of December, 1934,

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.963
in London, to the English-Irish peer

00:02:56.303 --> 00:02:58.983
George Bingham, the 6th Earl of Lucan,

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:01.253
and Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.833
A peer, by the way, is someone in Britain

00:03:04.983 --> 00:03:07.473
with an official title, such as duke,

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:10.893
marquess, earl, viscount or baron.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.479
Though peers can be appointed

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.229
by the government, often these

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.219
titles are hereditary - they are

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.859
passed down from father to son,

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.589
passed down through the family.

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.749
They are, essentially, status symbols

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.669
among the British aristocracy.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.589
And this young Lord Lucan, although

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.019
he wasn’t actually a Lord or a Lucan

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.359
until his father died, this young man

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.939
enjoyed a very privileged childhood.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.369
For the ease of the story, by the

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.759
way, I will refer to him as ”Lord”

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.449
Lucan or simply Lucan throughout this

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.639
episode, so as to avoid using two

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.769
names to describe the same one man.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.239
During the Second World War, Lucan

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.589
and his siblings were evacuated,

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.799
moved to safety, first to Wales and

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.379
then to the United States where they

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.129
stayed with a multi-millionairess

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.469
and continued their lives of luxury.

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.479
When they eventually returned to

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.279
England, however, the young Lord Lucan

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.389
had a bit of a shock at the state of

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.129
post-war England and bomb-ridden London.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.919
But for a young man like Lucan, he

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.609
lived in a completely different world.

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:24.519
He went to school at the prestigious

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:26.539
Eton College, where he mingled

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:28.589
with other society high-fliers and

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.329
developed a taste for, a interest

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:34.109
in, a vice that would remain with him

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.639
for the rest of his life: gambling.

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.859
As a young man, he was known to

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:42.639
be charming, tall, and handsome,

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:44.979
with a rather impressive moustache.

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.729
What’s more, he was very very wealthy.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:52.069
He lived a life of total luxury, and

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:54.459
enjoyed the ‘finer things in life’, we

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.669
might say - fast cars, speedboats, the

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.559
best wines and Russian vodkas, which

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:03.019
were still pretty exotic at the time.

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.829
Or as The New York Times put it, Lucan

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:09.259
was - and I'm quoting directly - a

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:12.109
"dashing British aristocrat… known for

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:14.319
his prowess at backgammon and bridge

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:16.719
and his fondness for vodka martinis,

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.649
powerboats, and Aston Martin cars."

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.059
In fact, Lucan was such a slick

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.019
character that it's believed he

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.399
almost played the role of James Bond.

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.739
He looked a bit like James Bond,

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.849
and it certainly didn’t hurt that

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.119
he was also a close friend of Ian

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.309
Fleming, the author of the books.

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.379
He was also in the army briefly, serving

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.649
in West Germany, where he began playing

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.059
poker and further developed the unhealthy

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.406
gambling habit he had picked up at Eton.

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.739
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his love for

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:54.069
gambling, he would then begin a career in

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:57.729
banking in 1954, when he was 20 years old.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:00.739
And although he was on a very

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.689
healthy salary, and would have

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.949
been a multi-millionaire by today’s

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.499
standards, Lucan increasingly gambled

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:09.510
in his free time, playing lots of

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.670
backgammon and poker in particular.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.170
But he had a bit of a sudden career

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.400
change in 1960, after a huge win

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.040
playing baccarat, a type of card game.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.540
Lucan reportedly won £26,000 in just

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.070
two days, and though that might not

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.240
sound like an astronomical amount,

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.730
especially to someone who already came

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.170
from such privilege, it’s worth almost

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.180
a million Euros in today’s money.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.190
Certainly not bad for two days

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.180
of work, and it was enough for

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.340
Lord Lucan to quit his job in the

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.190
bank and focus on his passion, or

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.780
perhaps his addiction: gambling.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.340
He became a full-time gambler and was

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.160
known as ‘Lucky Lucan’ in the elite

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.550
gambling circles, but he quickly

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.710
transformed into what has been described

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.520
as a ‘compulsive gambler’, spending most

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.010
of his time at the Clermont Club, an

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.460
exclusive gentlemen’s club in Mayfair.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.900
Gambling, to put it bluntly, became his

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.520
entire life, although he would forever

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.600
be chasing a win as large as the one

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.020
that convinced him to quit his day job.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.890
A few years later, in November of

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.000
1963, just before his 30th birthday,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.440
the eligible bachelor married a

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.620
lady called Veronica Duncan in

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.350
a ceremony that was attended by

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.290
minor members of the Royal Family.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.596
But it wasn’t exactly a natural match.

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:44.636
Their honeymoon, which was a trip to

00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:47.546
Istanbul on the exclusive Orient Express,

00:07:47.816 --> 00:07:50.506
ended ahead of schedule because, according

00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:53.056
to Lady Lucan, “there seemed little to

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.356
talk about and I longed to go home”.

00:07:55.986 --> 00:07:58.056
“John,” she said, meaning Lord

00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:00.316
Lucan, “he was lost in thought

00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:02.006
and seemed a little bored.”

00:08:02.926 --> 00:08:05.276
It was certainly an ominous start.

00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:09.296
A couple of months later, in January of

00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:13.396
1964, Lucan’s father died and he formally

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:16.716
inherited the title “Lord” Lucan, and

00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:18.797
along with it around a quarter of a

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:21.077
million pounds, which would be around

00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:23.137
five million Euros in today’s money.

00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:27.277
But the money went out as fast

00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:29.687
as it came in, and he was losing

00:08:29.697 --> 00:08:31.867
vast amounts at the card table.

00:08:32.977 --> 00:08:35.627
On one occasion, he reportedly lost

00:08:35.737 --> 00:08:40.367
£8,000, almost €150,000 in today’s

00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:43.607
money, and this was in a single evening.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.860
A short while later, Lord Lucan, Lady

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.490
Lucan, and their three children, Frances,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.660
George and Camilla, they moved into a

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.750
new house, 46 Lower Belgrave Street,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.520
which, conveniently for Lucan, was only

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.510
a short walk from the Clermont Club.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.350
By this stage, his gambling habit was

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.460
well-known and accepted, and Lady Lucan

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.040
has described her role as one of “a

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.970
gambler’s wife” and of needing to, and

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.670
I’m quoting directly, “help him get out

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.840
of a backgammon game when he was winning.”

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.260
In other words, it was her job to

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.100
try to make sure he quit while he was

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.610
ahead and not lose too much money.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.340
Now, it’s important to note here that

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.320
although Lord Lucan might have had, on

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.630
the surface, an enviable life, everything

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.320
a man could ever want, behind closed

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.380
doors, in private, things weren’t quite

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.930
so rosy, they weren’t going quite so well.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.330
Lucky Lucan, as it turned out, wasn’t

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.750
quite so lucky after all, and was

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.270
amassing enormous gambling debts.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.500
That £8,000 loss in a single night

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.320
wasn’t a one-off, and as he lost

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.680
more and more he was forced to begin

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.260
borrowing money from friends and family.

00:10:07.462 --> 00:10:09.710
Key to understanding this story,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.060
this murder, and this disappearance,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.510
however, is the role of Lady Lucan

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.750
and their deteriorating marriage.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.620
His wife, Lady Lucan, had given

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.990
birth to three children in six years,

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.910
from 1964 to 1970, and had suffered

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.980
from severe postnatal depression.

00:10:30.135 --> 00:10:32.040
Her husband was little help.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.050
He fell deeper and deeper into gambling

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.030
debts, spending more and more time

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.420
at his club and drinking more and

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.110
more, he failed to understand what was

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.627
happening to his wife or support her,

00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:46.710
and the marriage began to fall apart.

00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:51.942
A few years later, by 1973, the marriage

00:10:52.062 --> 00:10:54.792
had collapsed and Lord Lucan had moved

00:10:54.812 --> 00:10:57.272
out of Lower Belgrave Street and into

00:10:57.272 --> 00:10:59.872
a flat on Elizabeth Street, just around

00:10:59.872 --> 00:11:02.562
the corner, and importantly, still a

00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:04.522
short distance from the Clermont Club.

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:08.912
Lady Lucan was in a fragile mental

00:11:08.912 --> 00:11:10.892
state, and was being treated

00:11:10.892 --> 00:11:12.752
with various antidepressants.

00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:16.162
As a result, to help out around the

00:11:16.162 --> 00:11:18.382
house and care for the children the

00:11:18.382 --> 00:11:21.892
following summer she hired a nanny, a

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.742
29-year-old lady named Sandra Rivett.

00:11:25.982 --> 00:11:28.002
But that's when things start to get

00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:30.932
a little nasty, little unpleasant.

00:11:32.022 --> 00:11:33.992
When his wife was given custody

00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:35.842
of the children, Lord Lucan

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:38.492
was outraged and his behaviour

00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:40.862
became obsessive and threatening.

00:11:41.682 --> 00:11:44.522
He hired private detectives to spy on

00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:46.612
his soon-to-be ex-wife, hoping that

00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:48.692
they’d uncover some damaging evidence

00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:51.192
about her mental instability so that he

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:53.432
could win back custody of his children.

00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:56.892
His car was regularly seen outside

00:11:56.892 --> 00:11:58.872
the Lower Belgrave Street home, and

00:11:59.092 --> 00:12:02.042
friends of Lord Lucan even claimed that

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:04.042
he said he was planning to kill her.

00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:07.142
And he thought he would get

00:12:07.162 --> 00:12:08.792
away with it, because of who

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:11.492
he was and his social status.

00:12:12.562 --> 00:12:14.622
So, what actually happened?

00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:16.842
And what has the nanny, Sandra

00:12:16.982 --> 00:12:18.412
Rivett, got to do with all this?

00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:21.612
Well, it's all a little murky, a

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:24.102
little unclear, but here is what

00:12:24.122 --> 00:12:25.892
is believed to have happened.

00:12:26.982 --> 00:12:28.912
Facing growing gambling debts,

00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:31.142
drinking more and more and having

00:12:31.142 --> 00:12:33.092
lost custody of his children, it's

00:12:33.112 --> 00:12:34.942
thought that on the night of November

00:12:34.942 --> 00:12:39.732
7th, 1974, Lord Lucan broke into his

00:12:39.732 --> 00:12:41.982
former home on Lower Belgrave Street.

00:12:43.302 --> 00:12:45.332
At the house were the children, the

00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:48.182
nanny, Sandra Rivett, and Lady Lucan.

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:53.082
Some time around 9pm, after the children

00:12:53.232 --> 00:12:55.452
had been put to bed, Sandra Rivett,

00:12:55.762 --> 00:12:58.272
the nanny, offered to make a cup of

00:12:58.272 --> 00:13:01.402
tea for Lady Lucan, and went down into

00:13:01.402 --> 00:13:03.212
the building’s dimly lit basement.

00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:07.405
Lord Lucan, so the theory goes,

00:13:07.655 --> 00:13:10.045
then sprung out from the shadows

00:13:10.275 --> 00:13:12.085
and beat the woman to death

00:13:12.345 --> 00:13:14.345
with a piece of lead piping.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:18.375
Back upstairs, and wondering why her

00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:20.605
cup of tea was taking so long, Lady

00:13:20.615 --> 00:13:22.875
Lucan eventually went downstairs

00:13:23.075 --> 00:13:25.725
and stumbled upon the bloody scene.

00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:29.195
And as you heard at the start of the

00:13:29.195 --> 00:13:32.225
episode, Lucan then allegedly attacked

00:13:32.225 --> 00:13:34.475
his wife before she managed to escape

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:36.885
to the Plumber’s Arms pub down the road.

00:13:38.115 --> 00:13:40.785
It's generally accepted, believed, that

00:13:40.795 --> 00:13:43.465
Lucan had been expecting his estranged

00:13:43.465 --> 00:13:46.285
wife to come downstairs, not the nanny,

00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:49.265
and that she had been the intended victim.

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:52.255
He had been planning to kill Lady

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:54.945
Lucan, dispose of her body and

00:13:55.155 --> 00:13:57.375
take back the children and house.

00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:01.285
Now, based on what we know of Lucan’s

00:14:01.305 --> 00:14:03.675
mental state at the time, and their

00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:05.795
deteriorating marriage, this certainly

00:14:05.795 --> 00:14:08.065
seems like a plausible theory.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:10.495
So, what happened?

00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:11.775
What did Lord Lucan

00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:13.145
have to say about this?

00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:16.185
Did he deny it, what was his defence?

00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:18.605
Well, he said nothing.

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:21.115
As you might have guessed from the

00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:23.605
title of this episode, Lord Lucan

00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:26.985
disappeared and was never seen again,

00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:29.645
resulting in one of the biggest murder

00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:31.725
mysteries in modern British history.

00:14:33.265 --> 00:14:35.375
We do know something of his movements

00:14:35.405 --> 00:14:37.495
immediately after the murder, however.

00:14:38.515 --> 00:14:41.375
It's thought that he drove 70 kilometres

00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:43.945
to a friend's house in a village in

00:14:43.955 --> 00:14:46.565
Sussex, close to London, but only

00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:48.895
stayed for a few hours and left

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.715
in the early hours of the morning.

00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:54.875
His story, his cover, according to

00:14:54.875 --> 00:14:57.035
friends, was that he had walked in

00:14:57.035 --> 00:14:59.315
on his wife being attacked by another

00:14:59.455 --> 00:15:02.385
mystery man and that he was now hiding

00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:04.765
because his wife had accused him of

00:15:04.765 --> 00:15:07.635
hiring a hitman, a contract killer.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.965
But after that, we know very little.

00:15:12.975 --> 00:15:15.485
Three days later, on November the 10th,

00:15:15.905 --> 00:15:18.945
his bloodstained car was found abandoned

00:15:19.115 --> 00:15:21.225
– with a piece of lead piping in the

00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:23.955
boot – at the port in Newhaven, near

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.915
Brighton, on the south coast of England.

00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:31.225
After that, nobody to this very day

00:15:31.535 --> 00:15:33.525
knows what happened to Lord Lucan.

00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:36.305
Well, nobody publicly

00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:37.625
knows anything about it.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.805
And, as you might imagine, this has led

00:15:41.805 --> 00:15:44.365
to a whole host of theories about what

00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:46.835
happened to him, where he went, and

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:49.655
whether he is, in fact, still alive.

00:15:50.705 --> 00:15:52.805
In fact, over the years there have

00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:55.415
been countless - as many as 70,

00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:57.848
according to some sources - supposed

00:15:57.848 --> 00:16:00.258
‘sightings’ of Lucan around the world

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:03.028
in places as far-flung as Australia,

00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:05.678
India, France, and Mozambique.

00:16:07.138 --> 00:16:10.248
Although in 1999 he was declared

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:13.288
‘legally dead’ and a death certificate

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:17.188
was officially issued in 2016, his body

00:16:17.378 --> 00:16:20.698
has never been found, so nobody can say

00:16:20.698 --> 00:16:22.988
for sure whether he’s dead or alive.

00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:26.828
The first supposed sighting came

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:30.178
in January of 1975, in Melbourne,

00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:32.948
Australia, and he was also allegedly

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.968
seen in northwest France in the

00:16:34.968 --> 00:16:36.678
year or so after the murder.

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:39.598
People also claimed to have seen him in

00:16:39.778 --> 00:16:42.498
Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and there was

00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:45.108
even a theory that he was living in India

00:16:45.258 --> 00:16:47.978
as a beach hippy called "Jungle Barry.”

00:16:49.498 --> 00:16:52.488
Some of the other whacky theories include

00:16:52.488 --> 00:16:55.168
that Lord Lucan was held to ransom by the

00:16:55.228 --> 00:16:58.328
Irish Republican Army and, incredibly,

00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:01.348
that he had shot himself and his remains

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.858
were fed to the tigers in an English

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:05.748
zoo immediately after the murder.

00:17:07.268 --> 00:17:08.248
And there’s more.

00:17:08.618 --> 00:17:10.558
Police have investigated fingerprints

00:17:10.588 --> 00:17:12.588
on beer glasses in South Africa,

00:17:12.838 --> 00:17:14.438
and tracked money moving to

00:17:14.448 --> 00:17:16.218
bank accounts in Latin America.

00:17:16.988 --> 00:17:18.988
People have claimed to see Lucan at

00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:22.128
an ex-Nazi colony in Paraguay, living

00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:24.268
in a car in New Zealand, and even

00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:26.478
working as a waiter in California.

00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:29.338
And the mystery of Lord Lucan

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.798
continues to this very day,

00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.868
almost 50 years after the murder.

00:17:34.998 --> 00:17:37.588
In 2022, a facial recognition

00:17:37.618 --> 00:17:40.258
specialist claimed that a photo of

00:17:40.258 --> 00:17:42.058
an elderly man living in Australia

00:17:42.268 --> 00:17:45.068
is an exact match for Lord Lucan.

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.638
Could he have escaped and been

00:17:47.638 --> 00:17:49.448
living in Australia all these years?

00:17:50.768 --> 00:17:52.668
Using artificial intelligence to

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:55.268
cross-reference photos of Lord Lucan

00:17:55.528 --> 00:17:58.468
with this old man in Australia, the

00:17:58.628 --> 00:18:00.928
specialist concluded that, and I’m

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:03.398
quoting directly, “they produced a match.

00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:05.108
This isn’t an opinion, it’s

00:18:05.108 --> 00:18:07.048
science and mathematical fact”.

00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:10.662
Some say, however, that the most

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:12.952
likely scenario is that he took a

00:18:12.962 --> 00:18:15.447
ferry from Newhaven just days after

00:18:15.582 --> 00:18:17.692
the murder, jumped off the boat,

00:18:17.892 --> 00:18:20.422
committing suicide, and his body was

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:23.572
lost at sea, forever consigned to Davy

00:18:23.572 --> 00:18:25.802
Jones’ Locker, as a sailor might say.

00:18:27.002 --> 00:18:29.062
The only truth of this murder mystery,

00:18:29.202 --> 00:18:31.472
of this ‘whodunnit’, as we say in

00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:33.462
England, is that nobody knows for

00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:35.662
sure what happened to Lord Lucan.

00:18:36.452 --> 00:18:38.882
It was a real-life murder mystery,

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:41.602
a real life game of Cluedo, complete

00:18:41.602 --> 00:18:43.592
with “lead piping”, one of the murder

00:18:43.592 --> 00:18:45.602
weapons used in the game of Cluedo.

00:18:46.307 --> 00:18:48.587
As a quick reminder, or if you didn't

00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:51.227
know, Cluedo is a popular board game

00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:53.297
where players try to solve a murder

00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:55.937
mystery by guessing the character, murder

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:58.247
weapon and room where the crime occurred.

00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:02.016
And in fact, the parallels between

00:19:02.046 --> 00:19:04.136
the real-life case of Lord Lucan and

00:19:04.136 --> 00:19:06.096
the game of Cluedo aren’t limited

00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:08.226
to the discovery of the lead piping.

00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:12.366
Incredibly, in what seems like fiction

00:19:12.376 --> 00:19:15.366
but was in fact real life, in 2022

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:17.976
it was reported that investigators

00:19:18.176 --> 00:19:20.146
didn’t only find the lead piping

00:19:20.276 --> 00:19:21.826
in Lucan’s car in Newhaven.

00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:24.396
According to the British press,

00:19:24.636 --> 00:19:27.326
investigators also found cards

00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:29.716
from the game of Cluedo in the car.

00:19:31.146 --> 00:19:32.646
And it gets weirder.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.816
Which cards did they find?

00:19:35.856 --> 00:19:37.646
Colonel Mustard, a lead

00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:39.256
pipe, and the hall.

00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:43.866
And why is this particularly strange?

00:19:44.436 --> 00:19:46.836
Colonel Mustard is a dashing military

00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:48.856
character with a large moustache,

00:19:49.116 --> 00:19:51.226
not too dissimilar to Lord Lucan’s

00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:53.686
own; his weapon was exactly the

00:19:53.686 --> 00:19:56.916
same; and the ‘hall’ location is the

00:19:56.926 --> 00:19:58.896
closest to the cellar in the game.

00:20:00.446 --> 00:20:03.256
In a further twist, police revealed that

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:06.016
these three cards were also found to

00:20:06.016 --> 00:20:08.866
be missing from Lucan’s own Cluedo set.

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:12.076
So, what does this all mean?

00:20:12.466 --> 00:20:15.496
Was it Lord Lucan taunting, or mocking,

00:20:15.636 --> 00:20:17.436
the police before making his escape?

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.386
Was he framed by someone else?

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:21.946
Or was someone trying

00:20:21.946 --> 00:20:23.766
to play a “funny” trick?

00:20:25.206 --> 00:20:27.406
It seems quite clear that the murder

00:20:27.516 --> 00:20:30.166
was committed by this man, by Lucan,

00:20:30.556 --> 00:20:32.906
and an innocent young life was taken.

00:20:33.886 --> 00:20:36.086
If he wasn’t the killer, then his

00:20:36.086 --> 00:20:38.456
disappearance is most suspicious.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:42.626
But as to what happened next, and to the

00:20:42.626 --> 00:20:45.336
question of what actually happened to Lord

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:48.246
Lucan, well unless something drastically

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:50.936
changes, then this is a mystery that

00:20:50.946 --> 00:20:53.996
will most likely forever remain unsolved.

00:20:56.236 --> 00:20:59.086
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:01.276
on the disappearance of Lord Lucan.

00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:02.976
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:04.896
and whether you knew the story

00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:06.766
before, or this was the first time

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.516
you’d ever heard anything about Lord

00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:11.140
Lucan and this murder mystery, well

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:12.406
I hope you learned something new.

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:14.666
As always, I would love to know

00:21:14.666 --> 00:21:16.066
what you thought about this episode.

00:21:16.426 --> 00:21:18.106
Had you heard about Lord Lucan before?

00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:20.156
What do you think really happened

00:21:20.336 --> 00:21:22.146
that night in Lower Belgrave Street?

00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:24.366
And where do you think he went?

00:21:24.956 --> 00:21:26.856
I would love to know, so let’s

00:21:26.856 --> 00:21:28.236
get this discussion started.

00:21:28.616 --> 00:21:29.616

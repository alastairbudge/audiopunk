Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:16.968
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.128
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:27.228
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part mini-series

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:32.068
on troubled but iconic American musicians of the 1950s and 60s.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:38.438
In part one we talked about the amazing and unlikely life of Ray Charles, and

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:43.978
learned how he went on to achieve great influence and success, despite all the odds.

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:50.968
In part three, we’ll talk about Elvis Presley, the King of Rock & Roll, and how he went from

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:57.308
relative obscurity to being an object of desire for tens of millions of teenage Americans.

00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:03.828
And in today’s episode, part two, we’ll talk about The Man in Black, Johnny Cash.

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:08.758
He went from picking cotton during the Great Depression to being one

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:13.568
of the most successful country musicians in history, with his deep and

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:17.998
instantly recognisable voice and traditional “all in black” outfit.

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:24.668
But his story is, again, tragic and unlikely, and on our journey we’ll meet

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:31.818
the FBI, hard drugs, childhood tragedy, love, divorce, forest fires and prison.

00:01:32.668 --> 00:01:36.038
We have a lot to get through, so let’s not waste a minute.

00:01:37.588 --> 00:01:42.978
Johnny Cash was born on February 26th of 1932, a year and

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:46.952
a half after Ray Charles and three years before Elvis.

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:52.562
He was actually not born “Johnny Cash” - he was born J.R.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.162
Cash.

00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:57.322
His mother wanted to call him John, his father wanted

00:01:57.322 --> 00:02:01.742
to call him Ray, so they settled on calling him “J.R”.

00:02:02.862 --> 00:02:09.662
Like Ray Charles, J.R Cash grew up in the deep south of America during the Great Depression.

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:14.142
As a young boy he would work in the cotton fields with

00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:17.282
his parents, and they would sing songs while they worked.

00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:23.742
Life was not easy for the young J.R, and his family was

00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:26.802
constantly struggling to put enough food on the table.

00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:32.372
And like Ray Charles, who was growing up at the same time three states

00:02:32.372 --> 00:02:37.942
to the east, the young J.R experienced deep tragedy at a young age.

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:45.066
When he was 12 years old, he saw his older brother, Jack, have a terrible accident.

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:51.116
Jack would cut wood for his family using a table saw.

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:58.366
One day, as he was cutting wood he was pulled into this saw, and it almost cut him in half.

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:04.556
The poor boy survived for a week afterwards, but then died of his wounds.

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:10.086
And the young Johnny Cash, J.R, was right there when it happened.

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:17.531
As one would expect, this experience left a profound mark on the young Johnny.

00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:25.181
Before he had been a happy-go-lucky kind of kid, always fooling around and making jokes.

00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:30.181
Afterwards the jokes and laughs stopped, and he

00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:33.681
preferred to spend time on his own reading or drawing.

00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:39.822
He turned further to music, and started writing his own music when he was 12.

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:43.171
He had been brought up in a Christian environment.

00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:48.841
He went to church, and it was gospel music that was what he was most familiar with.

00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.941
As was required of men of his age, Cash joined the

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:58.751
armed forces in 1950, shortly after his 18th birthday.

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:05.381
A little bit of trivia about this time, a funny story about this time, was that he

00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:11.131
actually travelled to West Germany and was an incredibly talented interpreter of

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:17.551
Morse Code, and reportedly was the first person to interpret a coded message that

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:24.161
the Soviets sent on March 5th, 1953, which announced the death of Josef Stalin.

00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:30.481
But Johnny Cash had bigger dreams than working as a military interpreter.

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:37.401
After four years working in the army he was allowed to leave, and he returned to civilian life.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.020
Success and fame weren’t to come immediately though.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.290
First, he worked as a door-to-door salesman to make ends meet, but hated

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.680
it - he felt like he was tricking people into buying things they don’t

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.350
need, and said “I used to worry about people puttin' themselves into debt.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.209
I'd say, 'You don't want any of this, do you?' They'd say, 'Hold on there, what are you selling?'”

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.379
By this time he had got married.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.969
He had met a 17-year-old Italian-American girl called Vivian Liberto at a

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:19.024
roller disco in 1951, they dated for three weeks before Cash was sent to

00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:24.464
Germany for three years, and one month after he returned the pair were married.

00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:30.907
Cash tried to get his big musical break, but didn’t have much luck.

00:05:31.527 --> 00:05:37.727
He sang gospel music, but gospel was on the out; it wasn’t what the public wanted to hear.

00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:45.997
One producer even reportedly told him "go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell".

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:51.837
Well, sinning wasn’t to prove to be a problem for Johnny Cash.

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:59.957
He adjusted his tone, and swapped a more traditional gospel style for a deep, rocking style

00:05:59.957 --> 00:06:06.607
of country music, often about dark subjects, including murder, drugs, and all sorts of crime.

00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:11.939
The song that really catapulted him to fame was Folsom

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:17.119
Prison Blues, which he wrote in 1953 and released in 1955.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:24.029
It got to Number 1 in the Country Music charts, number 5 in the nationwide charts.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.719
Famously, he even performed it and recorded a version of

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:34.009
this live at the prison, in front of the inmates in 1958.

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.859
Cash was fast becoming a national star, and followed up this hit with

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:47.049
Walk The Line a year later, and Big River the year after that, in 1959.

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:56.339
By this time he was on a semi-permanent national tour, playing up to 200 concerts every year.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:01.399
He had cultivated a particular image as well.

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:04.619
Firstly, he always wore black.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:09.797
Black shoes, black trousers, a black jacket, and normally a black shirt.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:15.787
There are several theories about why he did this, and he even wrote a song

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:20.387
called “Man in Black” in which he suggests the reasons he always wore black.

00:07:21.477 --> 00:07:26.277
One is in solidarity with the poor, oppressed and disadvantaged.

00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:31.684
Another theory has it that black was just a lot easier to clean than any other

00:07:31.824 --> 00:07:36.144
colour, and when you are travelling around the country playing two hundred

00:07:36.144 --> 00:07:40.844
shows a year, well, having black clothes probably does make a lot of sense.

00:07:42.414 --> 00:07:46.404
Or there’s another theory that he wore it out of solidarity

00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:49.894
for the American soldiers who had died in the Korean war.

00:07:51.414 --> 00:07:57.214
Or it might well have been because of black’s association with sin and bad behaviour,

00:07:57.974 --> 00:08:02.884
and sin was something that Johnny Cash was becoming increasingly familiar with.

00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:09.584
By the time he was on tour, he was deeply addicted to prescription drugs - both

00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:14.574
amphetamines to speed things up and barbiturates to slow things down.

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:20.944
He would take up to 100 pills a day, all washed down with crate-loads of beer.

00:08:22.274 --> 00:08:27.454
To say that Johnny Cash was out of control is probably an understatement.

00:08:28.594 --> 00:08:33.874
There are stories of him from this time of his band members finding

00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:38.434
him passed out on the floor with no pulse, with his heart stopped.

00:08:39.064 --> 00:08:45.514
And instead of taking him to hospital they simply picked him up, threw cold water over him and

00:08:45.784 --> 00:08:51.844
hit him about the head until he woke up, until he came to, and dragged him to the next concert.

00:08:52.894 --> 00:08:56.824
Indeed, it was a badly-kept secret that Johnny Cash

00:08:56.854 --> 00:09:01.154
was a complete liability, he was a trainwreck of a man.

00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:05.681
He was an incredibly popular artist at this time though,

00:09:05.781 --> 00:09:08.744
and tickets to his concerts would always sell out.

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:14.764
But promoters wouldn’t know whether he would be sober enough to actually perform.

00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:22.144
Much like Ray Charles, who remember was a heroin addict for much of his career, Johnny Cash

00:09:22.314 --> 00:09:28.084
managed to remain very productive from a songwriting point of view, and wrote some of his

00:09:28.084 --> 00:09:34.844
most successful music while completely strung out on, while completely addicted to hard drugs.

00:09:36.344 --> 00:09:41.984
While he might have been able to continue to draw the crowds and write music, it turns out

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:48.324
that maintaining a hard drug addiction and leading a normal life isn’t a great combination.

00:09:49.783 --> 00:09:53.244
Cash’s behaviour was taking a toll on his marriage.

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:57.914
He was away from his wife and young family for the majority of the year,

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:02.574
and when he returned home he would bring his drugs and drink with him.

00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:06.384
That was only one half of the problem though.

00:10:06.994 --> 00:10:14.704
While on tour, Cash had come across another band called The Carter Family, an American folk band.

00:10:15.754 --> 00:10:21.694
Of particular interest to Johnny Cash was one member of the band, June Carter.

00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:29.284
Cash became infatuated with June Carter, he was completely in love with her, and they

00:10:29.284 --> 00:10:34.604
started a passionate love affair, despite both of them being married with children.

00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:38.234
Cash made no secret of the affair.

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:43.834
The pair toured together, they released singles together, they were inseparable.

00:10:45.174 --> 00:10:48.554
It might have been cute to see their romance blossom,

00:10:48.874 --> 00:10:52.244
but it certainly wasn’t cute for Johnny Cash’s wife.

00:10:53.584 --> 00:11:01.084
She filed for divorce in 1966, after 12 traumatic years of dealing with a drug-addled husband

00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:06.654
who was off on tour for most of the year and having a public affair with another woman.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:11.174
He had numerous close shaves with the authorities as well,

00:11:11.664 --> 00:11:15.284
all of them due to his reckless drinking and drug taking.

00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:22.654
In June of 1965 he took his nephew on a camping trip in a national

00:11:22.654 --> 00:11:27.924
park in California, and ended up causing a forest fire that burned down

00:11:27.984 --> 00:11:34.104
two square kilometres of forest and drove away 53 endangered birds.

00:11:35.164 --> 00:11:39.314
When he was brought into court in front of a judge, he said that his

00:11:39.314 --> 00:11:45.224
camper van had malfunctioned and caused sparks to set fire to the grass.

00:11:45.784 --> 00:11:50.434
But the judge didn’t believe him, and thought it was much more likely

00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:55.504
that Cash had taken a load of pills and drunk a load of beer, started

00:11:55.504 --> 00:12:00.954
a fire to try to stay warm, then the fire had blown out of control.

00:12:01.384 --> 00:12:06.254
And Cash, in his drunk and drugged-up state, hadn’t been able to stop it.

00:12:07.504 --> 00:12:13.344
It didn’t help Cash’s case that he turned up to court completely off his face, completely

00:12:13.594 --> 00:12:18.964
comatose on drugs, and told the judge “I don't care about your damn yellow buzzards.”

00:12:19.894 --> 00:12:22.124
Buzzards are a type of bird, by the way.

00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:28.524
The judge made him pay $82,000, which would be around

00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:31.314
three-quarters of a million dollars in today’s money.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:37.444
This wasn’t the first or the last time he would get in trouble with the law.

00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:43.514
Probably his most famous encounter with the law was to come later that year.

00:12:44.794 --> 00:12:50.244
He was in Dallas, Texas, and was scheduled to fly out to Los Angeles.

00:12:50.964 --> 00:12:57.474
Instead he jumped on a plane to El Paso, Texas, knowing that it was just a 45-minute drive

00:12:57.624 --> 00:13:03.784
over the border to Mexico, where the kind of drugs Cash was after were readily available.

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:10.394
After arriving in El Paso he jumped into a taxi, and gave the driver a mission.

00:13:11.094 --> 00:13:12.774
Pills, and lots of them.

00:13:14.234 --> 00:13:18.194
Before long the driver had returned with over a thousand

00:13:18.224 --> 00:13:21.754
pills, a mixture of amphetamines and tranquilizers.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:26.904
Cash proceeded to stash them in his guitar case, and

00:13:27.134 --> 00:13:30.664
instructed the driver to head back north across the border.

00:13:31.814 --> 00:13:35.504
But he was a drug addict well-known to the police.

00:13:36.054 --> 00:13:39.744
Before he could do anything he was stopped by a narcotics squad,

00:13:39.744 --> 00:13:43.814
who thought he was trying to smuggle heroin across the border.

00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:51.171
When they searched him they didn’t find heroin, but they did find 688

00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:57.464
Dexedrine pills and another 475 Equanils hidden in his guitar case.

00:13:58.584 --> 00:14:02.234
He was arrested, but was never sent to prison as the drugs

00:14:02.234 --> 00:14:07.174
he had were prescription pills instead of illegal narcotics.

00:14:08.354 --> 00:14:12.614
If you thought this close-shave with the law would be enough

00:14:12.614 --> 00:14:16.924
to persuade him to mend his ways, you would be mistaken.

00:14:17.494 --> 00:14:21.434
He went straight back to the drink and drugs, and it wasn’t until two

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:27.484
years later, after a near-fatal car accident in 1967, that he first

00:14:27.514 --> 00:14:31.364
managed to get clean, that he first managed to get off the drugs.

00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:37.654
Another motivation for getting clean was June Carter, who he proposed

00:14:37.674 --> 00:14:42.954
to on stage in February 1968, and they were married a week later.

00:14:44.474 --> 00:14:49.664
Although his heyday, and the period which he produced his most famous work

00:14:49.784 --> 00:14:56.194
came from the mid 1950s to the late 1960s, Johnny Cash continued to write and

00:14:56.194 --> 00:15:01.614
perform for the next four decades, writing over a thousand different songs.

00:15:03.084 --> 00:15:06.924
The last song he released is one you may be familiar

00:15:06.924 --> 00:15:10.834
with - it’s a cover of the Nine Inch Nails song, “Hurt”.

00:15:12.094 --> 00:15:17.704
Cash performed his own version in 2002, just months before the love

00:15:17.714 --> 00:15:23.064
of his life, June Carter was to die, and while Cash himself was dying.

00:15:24.434 --> 00:15:30.644
Cash completely reinterpreted the song - the original version is about a young man

00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:37.714
spiralling out of control, but Cash’s version is about an old man reflecting on his life.

00:15:38.514 --> 00:15:44.674
When you know that Cash was that man himself, the song becomes particularly poignant.

00:15:45.764 --> 00:15:49.144
Johnny Cash finally died after complications from

00:15:49.154 --> 00:15:54.374
diabetes on September 12th, 2003, at the age of 71.

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:58.894
The years of hard-living had taken their toll on him.

00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:03.914
Parts of his stomach had had to be removed, and he was in a very bad way.

00:16:05.074 --> 00:16:09.114
Really, given all of the times that he was close to death,

00:16:09.474 --> 00:16:12.354
it is a miracle that he managed to live as long as he did.

00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:18.084
In terms of the legacy that he left behind, there are few people who

00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:22.474
have done so much to bring country music to the masses as Johnny Cash.

00:16:23.244 --> 00:16:27.884
He certainly had his fair share of demons, and his personal life

00:16:27.884 --> 00:16:33.264
was chaotic, often illegal, and at many times very dark indeed.

00:16:34.064 --> 00:16:41.054
But he was a champion of the underdog, a champion of anyone cast out and neglected by society.

00:16:41.894 --> 00:16:47.114
He was a man who was certainly deserving of the nickname “The Man in Black”.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:55.654
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Wild Life Of Johnny Cash.

00:16:55.921 --> 00:16:59.866
Whether you are a die-hard Johnny Cash fan or you didn’t know that much

00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:03.371
about the man before this, well I hope it's been an interesting one.

00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.821
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:08.231 --> 00:17:12.281
For the Johnny Cash fans out there, what are your favourite of his songs?

00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:16.501
If you ask me, it has to be Folsom Prison Blues or Big River.

00:17:16.711 --> 00:17:18.841
But tell me, what are yours?

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:24.071

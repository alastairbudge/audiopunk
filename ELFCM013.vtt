Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:08.392
English.

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:10.042
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:17.737
Today, it's December the 31st, New Year's Eve, and I'm sure you no doubt have more pressing concerns

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.957
than listening to an English podcast.

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:27.187
So today's one will be a little shorter than most, but will leave you with some food for thought and

00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:34.492
even perhaps a conversation starter for this evening for those of you lucky to be off to an exciting

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:35.512
New Year's party.

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:41.842
I'll be celebrating New Year with my almost three month year old baby in a slightly different way

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:42.502
than usual.

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:48.732
He is normally up at midnight though, so I guess we will be bringing in the New Year and the new

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:49.522
decade together.

00:00:51.142 --> 00:00:56.182
If this is the first time you're listening to the podcast, then you can grab a copy of the

00:00:56.182 --> 00:01:02.002
transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:07.942
If you've already got the transcript and key vocabulary in front of you, then congratulations.

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:10.762
You are one step ahead of the pack.

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:13.417
Right.

00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:19.657
So today we are going to be talking about something very topical, something very timely.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.777
We are going to be talking about New Year.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:27.307
Specifically, why is New Year, New Year?

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:35.017
Tonight, the sun will set or depending on when you're listening to this, maybe it is already set and

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:37.537
it'll seem like an evening like any other.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:43.687
And tomorrow the sun will rise and new day will start and it will look a lot like today, and a lot

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:44.707
length of the day after that.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:48.307
But it's not, at least from a calendar point of view.

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:55.567
Today is December the 31st, which means that it's the last day of the last month of the year, which

00:01:55.567 --> 00:02:00.337
makes it the last day of the year, at least in the calendar observed by most of the world.

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:04.496
So tomorrow, January the first is New Year's day.

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:08.006
It's the first day of the New Year in the Gregorian calendar.

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:12.329
But have you ever wondered why this is the day that the year starts?

00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:17.444
Yes, January is the first month, but why is it the first month?

00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:23.987
Why does New Year start on the day we call January the first, not on the one that we call January

00:02:23.987 --> 00:02:27.797
the 14th or July the seventh or October the eighth?

00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:31.683
So today, this is what we are going to talk about.

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:35.712
So the concept of the New Year isn't new at all.

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:43.092
The earliest recorded New Year's festivity goes back to ancient Babylon around 4,000 years ago.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.400
For the Babylonians of ancient Mesopotamia, the first new moon following the Vernal Equinox, that's

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.532
the day in late March with the equal amount of sunlight and darkness, marked the start of a New Year

00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:02.952
and represented the rebirth of the natural world.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:10.179
Humans had the concept of the year, but relied on the stars and the moon, not their phones as we do

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.489
today, to calculate when it was.

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:19.583
The Romans, as well, used to celebrate the New Year and did so at a similar time to the Babylonians

00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:20.813
in late March.

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:29.665
Their calendar only had 10 months or 304 days, and so it was constantly falling out of sync with the

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.642
solar calendar, which, as you will know, has 365 days.

00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:36.438
So they constantly had to add more days to the year.

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:42.983
Julius Caesar, when he became emperor, decided that he wanted to fix this.

00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:49.763
So he consulted the, the wise man at the time and they came up with the idea of the Julian calendar,

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:52.543
which is based on the solar year.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.240
The Julian calendar is pretty similar to the calendar we use now, the Gregorian calendar, and it was

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.130
the first calendar to use January the first as the first day of the year.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.010
But why January the first?

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.015
Well, the concept of the month of January existed in the Julian calendar and the God after whom

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:19.875
January was named was Janus, the two faced God, the God of change.

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:28.023
The Romans decided that Janus, who looked both forward and backwards because he had two faces, was a

00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:36.548
good symbol of the New Year, where you would look both forward to the future and past over the

00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:37.488
previous year.

00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:41.598
So they decided that January the first was to be the New Year.

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:49.728
All throughout Roman times January the first was a big celebration where people celebrated the

00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:54.888
successes of the previous year and toasted in a new one, much like you might be doing tonight.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:05:02.742
But this switch to the Julian calendar wasn't particularly easy because the year was so out of sync

00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:03.642
with the solar calendar.

00:05:04.212 --> 00:05:05.742
So, what happened?

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:13.715
Well, the Romans had to add extra days to the year 46 BC when the Julian calendar was implemented.

00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:20.495
But the Roman calendar was so out of sync with the Julian calendar that the Romans had to add some

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:23.779
extra days to the year to put it back into sync.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.691
And it wasn't just a few extra days and it wasn't just like we do now with having a leap year, they

00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:39.241
actually had to add three entire months, meaning that the year 46 BC had 445 days.

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:40.411
Amazing, right?

00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:44.761
Imagine just adding an extra three months to the year.

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:52.764
It became known as the 'annus confusionis', the year of confusion, for reasons I guess you might be

00:05:52.764 --> 00:05:53.364
able to imagine.

00:05:54.482 --> 00:06:01.101
But the good news was that after that the years returned to their normal 365 day amount.

00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:04.431
So is that the end of the story?

00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:10.251
Have things just been the same since Julius Caesar declared January the first to be the first day of

00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:10.851
the New Year?

00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.391
Well, no, the story does not quite end there.

00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:21.951
In the middle ages, medieval Europeans considered the celebrations to be pagan and not befitting of

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:22.891
Christian values.

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:31.416
Indeed in 567 AD the Council of Tours abolished January the first as the first day of the year,

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:36.410
replacing it with dates that were more closely associated with Christian holidays.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:44.597
For example, December the 25th or March the 25th the birth of Jesus or the Annunciation, But they

00:06:44.597 --> 00:06:50.763
did give January the first another honour, another role, deciding that it was the feast of the

00:06:50.763 --> 00:06:54.993
circumcision, as they said it was eight days after the birth of Christ.

00:06:55.263 --> 00:07:00.963
So according to the Jewish tradition, it would have been when Jesus was circumcised.

00:07:01.912 --> 00:07:07.325
Despite the fact that New Year was celebrated on different dates, the Julian calendar was still the

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:12.845
main calendar throughout Europe for quite a long time, another thousand years or so.

00:07:13.848 --> 00:07:22.604
Then in 1582 Pope Gregory the 13th, after the creation of the Gregorian calendar, re-established

00:07:22.814 --> 00:07:28.124
January the first as New Year as the date that New Year was celebrated.

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:35.800
As the Pope was a Catholic, obviously, Protestants in Europe were a bit reticent to adopt this new

00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:38.614
Catholic calendar, but gradually they did.

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.539
It was pretty gradual though.

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:48.419
It wasn't until 1752, almost 200 years later, that the British adopted the Gregorian calendar.

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:55.149
Before then the whole of the British empire, which included the American colonies at that time, a

00:07:55.149 --> 00:08:02.106
lot of what we know is the USA today, used the Julian calendar and used to celebrate the New Year in

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:02.676
March.

00:08:03.558 --> 00:08:07.558
So yes, humans have been celebrating the New Year for millennia.

00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:13.708
It's a great party all over the world, and if the history of mankind tells us anything, it's that

00:08:14.128 --> 00:08:16.318
partying certainly isn't a modern invention.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:24.785
But January the first as New Year as the day that the year changes is actually quite a modern

00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:30.055
custom, only just over 250 years old in Britain or in the US.

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:36.127
Of course, one big thing I've neglected here is that we've just been talking about New Year in

00:08:36.577 --> 00:08:40.617
Western countries and the Gregorian and Julian calendar new year.

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:46.627
It's celebrated in a myriad of different ways all over the world on different dates according to the

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:49.747
sun, stars and all manner of different things.

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:56.107
But as it's December the 31st in the Gregorian calendar, and as that's the one that this podcast

00:08:56.107 --> 00:08:58.627
works to, and I'm sure that you probably have.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:04.255
New Year's celebrations to be getting to yourself, I hope you will forgive me skipping over the not

00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:06.385
so small issue of the rest of the world.

00:09:07.696 --> 00:09:14.510
Right with this episode comes the last episode of the podcast for this month, for this year, and

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.070
also for this decade.

00:09:17.087 --> 00:09:18.499
It's been an absolute pleasure.

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:23.599
I hope you have a great New Year and I will catch you in 2020.

00:09:24.204 --> 00:09:29.630
You've been listening to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English with me,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.470
Alastair Budge.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.000
Happy New Year.

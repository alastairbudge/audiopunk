Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:16.173
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:20.833
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.013 --> 00:00:28.853
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Mao Zedong, Chairman Mao, the

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:36.163
founding father of the People’s Republic of China and its leader until his death in 1976.

00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:44.623
Now, I should start by saying that trying to cram the entire life of Mao into 20 minutes is a

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:51.473
difficult task, so this will evidently not be the conclusive guide to the life of Chairman Mao.

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:58.853
But, what I do hope is that this will give you an idea about the man, his life, and his legacy,

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:04.613
and by the end of this episode you will know a little bit more about him than you do now.

00:01:05.913 --> 00:01:10.213
I’ll also say that the pronunciation of Mao Zedong is more like Mao

00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:15.163
Zedong, but we’ll stick with the English version for this podcast - Mao

00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:19.423
Zedong - apologies to any Mandarin speakers that may be listening.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:24.823
So, without wasting one more minute, let’s get started.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:31.663
The name Mao Zedong probably conjures up all sorts of ideas in your mind.

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:35.443
You might think of him as a great leader, a man who

00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:39.233
managed to unite China and fight off imperial forces.

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:43.783
But unless you’re listening to this episode from within

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:46.663
China, you probably have a different view of him.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:52.043
You might think of him as a dictator, you might think of the Cultural

00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:56.803
Revolution or of the millions of people who died under his leadership.

00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:02.233
One thing is for sure though, he is an interesting character,

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:06.103
he had a fascinating life and changed the world forever.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:13.793
Mao Zedong was born in a village in Hunan province, in south central China, in 1893.

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:21.983
As a young boy he was a voracious reader, and a keen student of history.

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:29.843
As he was growing up, at the turn of the 20th century, China was in a pretty poor position.

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:35.823
It had suffered humiliation during the Opium Wars, and the Qing dynasty,

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:40.703
the ruling dynasty, was on its last legs, it was about to collapse.

00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:47.113
As a student, Mao developed an admiration for foreign revolutionary

00:02:47.113 --> 00:02:52.423
leaders, people such as George Washington and Napoleon, and developed

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.943
a belief that China needed to be restored to its former glory.

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:04.203
When Mao was a young man, China grew more and more chaotic, overrun by foreign

00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:10.473
powers and a far cry from its previous position as a world power to be reckoned with.

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:16.053
Its last emperor was overthrown in 1911, and it became

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:19.143
a republic, governed by a man called Sun Yat-Sen.

00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:23.623
Sun Yat-Sen didn’t govern for long, handing over power

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:27.593
to another man, Yuan Shikai, shortly after taking power.

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:35.923
Yuan Shikai promoted himself from President to Emperor of China, but only managed to hold onto

00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:43.543
power for 83 days before the country was plunged into a civil war that lasted for 10 years.

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:48.153
Long story short, China was in crisis.

00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:53.863
This experience, and the view that China needed to regain its

00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:58.503
rightful place in the world defined the ideology of young Mao.

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:03.823
Of course, it wasn’t just in China that empires were crumbling

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:07.553
and new political systems were rising from the ashes.

00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:14.333
In neighbouring Russia, in 1917, Lenin’s Bolsheviks had overthrown the

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:19.393
monarchy, the people had seized power from the out of touch Russian tsars.

00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:27.063
Encouraged by the success of the Bolsheviks, Communist sympathies started to develop in China.

00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:34.483
The Chinese Communist Party was formed in 1921, and Mao was a founding member.

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:41.343
The communists didn’t have any real power at this time, though, and actually supported

00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:49.193
another political party, the Kuomintang, which in effect took over the rule of China in 1926.

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:55.823
Now, I’m going to skip over quite a lot here, but the period between the Kuomintang

00:04:55.863 --> 00:05:03.683
taking power in 1926 and the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 is

00:05:03.683 --> 00:05:10.313
full of power struggles, internal fighting, the war with Japan, and civil war in China.

00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:17.943
It was during this period that it’s believed that Mao started to develop his ideas about

00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:24.203
the power of the Chinese peasant class, that a Chinese revolution wouldn’t come from

00:05:24.203 --> 00:05:30.073
the cities, like it had in Russia, but rather from the countryside, from the peasants.

00:05:31.343 --> 00:05:37.953
Mao started to loathe, to hate, urban intellectuals and elites, believing

00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:42.663
them to be out of touch with the real people of China, the peasants.

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:47.843
And it was the peasants who would fight the revolution and

00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:52.013
transform China, not the urban proletariat, like in Russia.

00:05:53.183 --> 00:06:00.083
Landowners, people who owned land, also became a target of Mao’s, and he believed that the

00:06:00.103 --> 00:06:07.183
peasant class had been exploited, both economically and politically by those who owned the land.

00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:12.653
After these internal struggles within the Communist party, turning on the

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:17.813
Kuomintang and starting a civil war, then chasing the Kuomintang out of China

00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:23.353
and causing them to flee to Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party was the most

00:06:23.373 --> 00:06:28.583
powerful force in China, and Mao Zedong found himself at the head of it.

00:06:30.053 --> 00:06:36.123
So, on the 1st of October 1949, he proclaimed the establishment

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:40.193
of the People’s Republic of China - China, as we know it today.

00:06:41.683 --> 00:06:47.823
He was almost 55 at the time, so certainly no spring chicken, not a young man.

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:55.873
Now, we have sped through the first part of his life, but it really is after the formation of

00:06:55.873 --> 00:07:01.603
the PRC, of the People’s Republic of China, that things start to get even more interesting.

00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:07.903
Mao Zedong was the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, the only real party in China.

00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:14.523
He was the ruler of the country, but his power was by no means secure.

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:21.853
The infighting of the previous 30 years had taught him that people can fall just as

00:07:21.853 --> 00:07:28.863
quickly as they can rise, and so he embarked on a series of campaigns to solidify

00:07:28.863 --> 00:07:34.463
his power, campaigns which never really stopped for the duration of his rule.

00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:39.343
These campaigns would target people in society that were

00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:43.413
considered to pose a threat to Mao and the communist party.

00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:49.753
Initially the campaigns started by targeting previous Kuomintang members and

00:07:49.993 --> 00:07:55.053
anyone who had questioned the authority of the communist party, but they were

00:07:55.103 --> 00:08:00.893
later expanded to include everyone from public intellectuals to landowners.

00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:06.983
Not a huge amount of proof was required, and being accused of

00:08:07.013 --> 00:08:11.183
being a counter-revolutionary was often enough to be punished.

00:08:12.413 --> 00:08:17.603
During just the first one of these campaigns, the Campaign to Suppress

00:08:17.653 --> 00:08:24.813
Counter-revolutionaries of 1950, 2.6 million people were arrested, 1.3 million

00:08:24.813 --> 00:08:30.773
people were imprisoned, and 712,000  people were executed, they were killed.

00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:36.143
And these are the official statistics from the Chinese Communist Party, and

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:41.023
it’s believed by many historians that the real numbers are a lot higher.

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:49.523
With some of the more immediate threats to power out of the way, Mao sought to transform the country

00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:56.973
from an agricultural, peasant-based economy to a communist, centrally run, industrial economy.

00:08:57.813 --> 00:09:05.293
As the Russians did, Mao decided to implement a series of 5-year plans, plans for what the

00:09:05.293 --> 00:09:11.343
country needed to achieve in 5 years in order to reach the next level of its development.

00:09:12.683 --> 00:09:17.603
China at this time was still a pretty weak, poor country.

00:09:18.213 --> 00:09:25.063
It was growing apart from its more powerful communist neighbour, Russia, and it also feared an

00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:31.523
attack from the west, which was not keen on the idea of a strong and powerful communist China.

00:09:32.423 --> 00:09:37.993
Mao sought to radically transform the country, improving its military capabilities,

00:09:38.253 --> 00:09:44.353
but also by industrialising the economy so that it no longer needed to rely

00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:48.713
on aid and protection from its communist big brother, the Soviet Union.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:56.063
How this was to be achieved was by transforming peasant communities into something called state

00:09:56.123 --> 00:10:03.113
collectives, or communes, so that instead of peasants just farming their own smaller pieces of

00:10:03.113 --> 00:10:09.913
land, they would pool them together and production and distribution would be centrally controlled.

00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:15.503
In addition to this, Mao encouraged these communes to start making

00:10:15.723 --> 00:10:21.793
steel for industry, and small, makeshift steel furnaces were created,

00:10:22.053 --> 00:10:27.783
with peasants melting their metal agricultural tools to make steel.

00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:35.493
Unfortunately these plans did not turn out to be the resounding success that Mao had hoped for.

00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:38.533
And that’s a little bit of an understatement.

00:10:39.523 --> 00:10:42.943
You might have heard of The Great Leap Forward, which was

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:47.993
the second of the five year plans, and started in 1958.

00:10:49.103 --> 00:10:54.893
The main objective of The Great Leap Forward was to increase agricultural and industrial

00:10:54.913 --> 00:11:01.203
production in these communes, and to transform the way in which China fed itself.

00:11:02.373 --> 00:11:06.843
Previously, as we said, the peasants had grown food for themselves.

00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:10.843
They might have sold some excess rice, some rice that they

00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:15.053
didn't need to eat themselves, but it was all pretty local.

00:11:15.953 --> 00:11:21.233
Mao’s idea for this new Chinese economy was centrally planned, so food

00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:26.023
would be produced in these large communes according to centrally set

00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:31.583
targets, then it would be redistributed based on where it was required.

00:11:32.873 --> 00:11:39.873
That all sounds ok in theory, but in practice these new communes, these new collectives,

00:11:40.063 --> 00:11:45.223
were under increasing pressure to report higher and higher numbers of food production.

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:49.573
The more food that a commune reported producing, the

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:53.043
better example it was that Mao’s ideas were working.

00:11:54.203 --> 00:12:01.503
Commune leaders, eager to please their superiors and not seem lazy or ‘counter-revolutionary’,

00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:07.073
would report that their communes had produced far more than they had done.

00:12:07.953 --> 00:12:13.553
Because the economy was centrally planned,  and food was redistributed between

00:12:13.553 --> 00:12:18.833
communes, they would have to send their ‘excess food’ away to be redistributed.

00:12:19.943 --> 00:12:26.573
But the problem was that in many cases there wasn’t excess food, they had just reported

00:12:26.753 --> 00:12:32.133
excess food to not seem anti-revolutionary and to keep up with their neighbours.

00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:38.843
Whatsmore, in many communes the peasants had religiously followed the guidance of

00:12:38.843 --> 00:12:45.493
Chairman Mao and melted their metal tools to create steel, which would be sent away

00:12:45.493 --> 00:12:51.403
to create industrial equipment, so they had nothing left to actually farm with.

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:57.903
So, not only did the peasants on these communes have to send away large

00:12:57.923 --> 00:13:02.113
amounts of their crops, of their rice, of their food, but they had

00:13:02.123 --> 00:13:07.443
destroyed large amounts of their tools that they would normally use to farm.

00:13:08.723 --> 00:13:11.893
The result of all of this chaos was horrific.

00:13:12.713 --> 00:13:17.283
Millions of people starved to death, and the Great Leap Forward is

00:13:17.283 --> 00:13:22.873
believed to have caused the deaths of anywhere from 18 million to 45

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:27.933
million Chinese, and making this the largest famine in human history.

00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:33.863
Although there aren’t many historians who would argue that this was actually

00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:39.883
Mao’s intention, there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that he became aware of the

00:13:40.873 --> 00:13:45.563
inefficiencies that this system caused, and the millions of deaths that were resulting

00:13:45.563 --> 00:13:52.063
from it, but accepted this as a necessary evil for the industrialisation of China.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:57.823
By 1962, thankfully, the Great Leap Forward was over.

00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:04.143
It hadn’t industrialised China and turned it into a power to be reckoned

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:09.923
with, and apart from some token self-criticism, some admitting of

00:14:09.923 --> 00:14:14.363
mistakes, nobody really took responsibility for what had gone wrong.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:20.863
Indeed, there was only one minister, one senior party official, who did

00:14:20.933 --> 00:14:25.793
criticise the Great Leap Forward, and he was quickly dismissed, he was quickly

00:14:25.793 --> 00:14:31.303
sacked, and replaced by someone more loyal to the party, and more loyal to Mao.

00:14:32.563 --> 00:14:40.133
Mao had started cultivating a cult of personality from the early 1930s, but it wasn’t

00:14:40.163 --> 00:14:46.733
until the late 1950s and early 1960s that it was really taken to the next level.

00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:53.703
Posters, big signs, with quotes from Chairman Mao started to be put up all around the

00:14:53.703 --> 00:15:00.043
country, the Little Red Book with quotations from Chairman Mao was published in 1964.

00:15:01.103 --> 00:15:06.083
Saying anything other than complimentary things about the Chairman was a quick

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:11.003
way to be labelled a rightist, to be called a rightist and counter-revolutionary,

00:15:11.373 --> 00:15:16.393
to probably be sent to do hard labour in the countryside, or worse.

00:15:17.843 --> 00:15:22.083
Then in 1966 Mao launched the Cultural Revolution,

00:15:22.383 --> 00:15:26.753
an all-out assault on any anti-communist elements.

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:31.923
He encouraged schoolchildren to report on their teachers and

00:15:31.923 --> 00:15:37.003
parents, to denounce each other, and to generally cause chaos.

00:15:38.213 --> 00:15:43.323
It was also during this time that there was huge damage done to lots of

00:15:43.323 --> 00:15:48.803
China’s cultural heritage, destroying temples, churches, and burning books.

00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:53.933
These were all considered part of China’s ancient history; they

00:15:54.093 --> 00:15:58.193
were part of the past and had no present in the future of China.

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:04.133
The Cultural Revolution lasted from 1966 until 1976,

00:16:04.783 --> 00:16:08.643
and turned into something even beyond Mao’s control.

00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:16.643
It became a way for old grievances to be settled, for old rivalries to be played out.

00:16:17.763 --> 00:16:22.083
People would denounce their neighbours, schoolchildren would denounce

00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:26.263
teachers they didn’t like, and these people would be sent away for

00:16:26.523 --> 00:16:31.953
re-education at best, or in many cases, just beaten to death, killed.

00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:38.473
Within the upper echelons of the communist party, at the top of the party,

00:16:38.703 --> 00:16:44.543
it also became a way for people to jostle for power, to fight for power.

00:16:45.603 --> 00:16:52.823
Mao’s fourth wife, a lady called Jiang Qing, formed a political faction called the Gang of Four,

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:59.213
and they were considered responsible for really pushing the Cultural Revolution to its extreme.

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:08.173
Then on September the 9th, 1976, at the ripe old age of 82, Mao Zedong died.

00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:13.813
He was embalmed, and left lying in state in Beijing.

00:17:15.093 --> 00:17:17.543
Indeed, you can still visit him today.

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:23.453
His mausoleum is in Tiananmen Square, a few hundred metres away from the

00:17:23.483 --> 00:17:27.863
balcony from which he declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

00:17:29.303 --> 00:17:35.173
Now, that is very much a whistlestop tour through the life and times of Chairman Mao.

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:40.863
What I want to talk about now is his legacy, which is certainly a complicated one.

00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:48.883
If you go to China now, you’ll find Mao’s face on every banknote, you’ll see his painting hanging

00:17:48.893 --> 00:17:55.143
over Tiananmen Gate, and you won’t find a person in China who doesn’t at least know who he is.

00:17:56.363 --> 00:18:01.033
It hasn’t even been 50 years since he died, and there are still

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:05.263
hundreds of millions of people in China who lived under his rule.

00:18:06.243 --> 00:18:10.723
For them this isn’t history, as such, it was part of their life.

00:18:11.963 --> 00:18:18.693
And, unlike countries that lived under such a powerful, authoritarian leader, whether that’s the

00:18:18.693 --> 00:18:25.733
Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, or Fascist Italy, there was never really a proper break with Maoism.

00:18:27.063 --> 00:18:33.043
It’s the same country, the same party that is in power, and indeed Xi

00:18:33.173 --> 00:18:38.243
Jinping, the current president of China, is the son of a man called Xi

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:42.453
Zhongxun, a famous communist revolutionary and close colleague of Mao’s.

00:18:43.553 --> 00:18:49.223
The official Chinese Communist Party's position is that overall Mao Zedong

00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:54.143
had a great, positive impact on China, but that he made some mistakes.

00:18:54.953 --> 00:19:00.433
In my experience when talking to Chinese people when travelling around the country,

00:19:00.713 --> 00:19:06.513
this does seem to be the official line - The Cultural Revolution was a mistake, but Mao

00:19:06.513 --> 00:19:12.343
put China on the course back towards greatness and was overall a good thing for China.

00:19:13.603 --> 00:19:22.333
The Chinese even quantify it, they put a number on this, saying that Mao was 70% good, 30% bad.

00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:26.393
Outside China, he has left a huge legacy.

00:19:27.283 --> 00:19:33.293
Maoism, Mao Zedong thought, has created political groups all over the world, from the Shining Path

00:19:33.293 --> 00:19:40.913
in Peru to the Communist Party of Angola, who were all inspired to certain degrees by Mao Zedong.

00:19:42.053 --> 00:19:49.263
In the West, he is often simplified as a brutal dictator, someone who cared little for the Chinese

00:19:49.263 --> 00:19:55.943
people, killed tens of millions of people and is in a similar category to Hitler and Mussolini.

00:19:57.263 --> 00:20:03.153
Although there’s no denying that tens of millions of people died and were persecuted under his

00:20:03.153 --> 00:20:12.173
rule, portraying him as a mere mad dictator is a bit of a simplification, and there are multiple

00:20:12.173 --> 00:20:18.923
successes that one can point to, several positive developments that happened under his rule.

00:20:20.213 --> 00:20:25.993
The levels of literacy, the amount of people who could read, improved drastically.

00:20:26.513 --> 00:20:30.533
When he took power 80% of the population was illiterate,

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:35.483
they couldn't read, and by his death only 7% was.

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:42.493
Life expectancy in China doubled under his rule, and the country was dragged out

00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:48.283
of being an agrarian economy to something approaching an industrialised country.

00:20:49.593 --> 00:20:54.753
China remained a unified country, and the fact that the country has remained

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:59.793
united to this day, when almost every other communist country has either

00:20:59.853 --> 00:21:05.743
collapsed or is in a pretty bad condition, is something that is often pointed at.

00:21:05.743 --> 00:21:12.223
But the question still stands: did this transformation require Mao?

00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:16.603
Could all of this have been achieved without the deaths of tens, or

00:21:16.613 --> 00:21:21.293
hundreds of millions of people, and could China have actually developed

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:25.263
more quickly and more sustainably with a different leader to Mao?

00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:31.893
This is of course a question that historians inside and outside of China have been grappling

00:21:31.903 --> 00:21:38.923
with for almost 50 years now, and I’m sure will grapple with for far more than 50 years to come.

00:21:40.063 --> 00:21:43.883
It’s a complicated legacy, and it’s certainly a little

00:21:43.883 --> 00:21:48.333
more complicated than just saying 70% good, 30% bad.

00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:56.733
OK then, that is it for this little look at the life and times of Mao Zedong.

00:21:57.283 --> 00:22:03.813
I imagine there are podcasts in China that go on for hours, days and weeks about all the details

00:22:03.813 --> 00:22:09.723
of his life, and this has been a very quick trip through his life, his impact, and his legacy.

00:22:10.383 --> 00:22:14.043
But I hope it has given you a little bit of an idea about the man.

00:22:15.493 --> 00:22:18.703
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:19.173 --> 00:22:24.323
I’ve had a request for more episodes about East Asian history, so if there is a particular

00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:30.243
part of the life of Mao Zedong, or Chinese history that you would like me to make, I’ll do it.

00:22:30.693 --> 00:22:34.083
Luckily I spent many years reading about Mao Zedong, so

00:22:34.393 --> 00:22:37.043
it is a subject I’m quite knowledgeable about already.

00:22:37.763 --> 00:22:39.303
So, do let me know.

00:22:39.573 --> 00:22:44.563

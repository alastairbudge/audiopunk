Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.570
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.870
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.530
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part mini-series,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.840
this time on troubled but iconic American musicians of the 1950s and 60s.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.840
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll talk about the man they called The Genius, Ray Charles.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.430
His is an amazing story of escaping from dire poverty and tragic circumstances as a boy

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.650
through to becoming one of the most successful musicians of his time, against all the odds.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.780
Then, in our next episode - which will be one of our member-only

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.070
ones -  we’ll talk about Johnny Cash, "The Man in Black", another man

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.830
who grew up in poverty yet became a defining voice of his generation.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.600
And to finish it off we’ll learn about the life of the man they called “The

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.360
King”, Elvis Presley, someone who was considered “average” by his teachers

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.150
as a boy but went on to really create the category of rock and roll.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.875
In these three stories to different degrees, we’ll meet adversity, we’ll learn

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:39.755
about America in the 1950s, we’ll come up against near death experiences, there

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:45.375
will be sex, drugs, rock and roll, and plenty of personal demons to battle with.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:51.895
All three of these episodes have been a huge amount of fun to make so I hope you’ll enjoy them.

00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:59.533
Ok then, the Amazing Life of Ray Charles.

00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:04.833
It is hard to imagine many people who have had a tougher

00:02:05.013 --> 00:02:08.333
start to life than the subject of today’s episode.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:15.003
Ray Charles Robinson was born on September 23rd, 1930,

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:18.823
in Georgia, in the deep south of the United States.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:24.543
His mother, Aretha, was 15 years old when she fell pregnant with him.

00:02:25.143 --> 00:02:31.963
His father left before Ray really knew him, and he was brought up by his devoted young mother.

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:38.403
He had a younger brother, George, who was born before Ray’s first birthday.

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:44.023
Yet nobody seemed to know who his father was, and he certainly wasn’t around.

00:02:44.923 --> 00:02:49.903
So, while she was still a teenager herself, Ray Charles’ mother

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:54.543
was busy looking after two young boys, trying to make ends meet.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.033
They lived in abject poverty.

00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.293
They were dirt poor.

00:03:00.152 --> 00:03:04.788
What's more, the country they lived in, and in particular the area

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:10.068
of the country, the deep south of the United States, was very racist.

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:15.588
This was still the era of the Jim Crow laws, where black people

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:19.078
were not allowed to sit in the same places as white people.

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:23.608
So, we have this brave young mother trying to bring

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:27.428
up two children in an institutionally racist country.

00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:33.208
And this family, given their poverty and lack of a father figure, were

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:37.658
at an even greater disadvantage than most African Americans at the time.

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:44.158
In his autobiography, Ray Charles would later write "Even compared to other

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:48.788
blacks we were on the bottom of the ladder looking up at everyone else.

00:03:49.338 --> 00:03:51.408
Nothing below us except the ground".

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:58.955
Ray Charles was also to experience deep personal tragedy and huge trauma when,

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:04.015
as a four year old, he saw his young brother drowning to death in the bath.

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:12.315
As if the cards weren’t already sufficiently stacked against him, as a young black boy

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:16.979
who had lost a brother, growing up poor with a teenage mother in an institutionally

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.389
racist America, the young Ray Charles was starting to lose his sight, he was going blind.

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:30.639
He suffered from something called glaucoma, a condition that damages the optic nerve

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:38.209
and can cause blindness, and by the time he was 7 years old he was completely blind.

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.579
His mother tried her hardest to find a school that would take a young, blind black boy with no money

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:54.379
to his name, and eventually found one in Florida, where Ray Charles went when he was 7 years old.

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:59.389
It was to be here that the young Ray Charles started to

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.629
develop a great talent for music, in particular, on the piano.

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.599
He had begun playing music when he was a much younger boy, at even three

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.009
years old, but it was here at this school that he really started to excel.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.769
Now to state the obvious that piano is not an easy instrument to play

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:24.945
if you are blind, especially when you are first learning how to play it.

00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:29.925
If you watch famous pianists now, their hands move up

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.735
and down the keyboard and they barely need to look.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:37.675
But that is the product of tens of thousands of hours of practice.

00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:44.625
Because he was blind, Ray Charles needed to use braille music, music

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:49.005
specifically designed to be read by blind people with their hands.

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:54.655
He would learn the notes that needed to be played by the left hand by

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:58.945
using his right hand to touch and read the music, then he would learn the

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:03.775
right hand movements by using his left hand to touch and read the music.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:09.495
And then, of course, he would have to memorise the music to play it together.

00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:15.212
Learning the piano when you are blind is certainly no mean feat.

00:06:16.112 --> 00:06:22.882
Now, although by all accounts Ray’s time at the school for the blind was a happy one, further

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:31.142
tragedy was to befall him when in 1945 his devoted mother died before her 30th birthday.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:36.882
Aged 14, he was now completely alone in the world.

00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:40.572
No brother, no mother, and he had never known his father.

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:47.036
This tragedy caused Ray Charles to drop out of school, and go and join

00:06:47.046 --> 00:06:51.666
a friend of his mother’s in Jacksonville, the largest city in Florida.

00:06:52.896 --> 00:06:56.926
He managed to get some work playing piano, but it was

00:06:56.946 --> 00:07:01.076
incredibly low paid, and he barely made enough money to eat.

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:07.326
Ray Charles had bigger hopes and dreams than playing in someone else’s band, though.

00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:14.636
He wanted to write his own music, to create his own songs, to carve his own path in the world.

00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:21.826
The musical expectations at this time in the United States were clearly fixed.

00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:26.533
There were clearly defined genres, and expectations of the kind

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:30.293
of music someone would make based on the colour of their skin.

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:35.793
And if you were black, the expectation was that you’d play jazz music.

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:43.303
The most successful jazz musician at the time that Ray Charles was growing up was Nat King Cole.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:50.479
When Ray Charles started to write his own music, it was really in the style of Nat King Cole.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.769
It’s slow, soulful jazz music.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:08:00.449
In 1948, three years after Charles had left school, and

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:04.419
when he was not yet 18 years old, he moved to Seattle.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:09.929
The story goes that he asked a friend what city in the United

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:14.429
States was furthest away from where he was, in Tampa, Florida.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:20.129
His friend took out a map and drew a line all the way across,

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:24.099
getting to Seattle, on the far north-west of the country.

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:30.989
He made the 5-day bus journey across the country, finally arriving in this new city.

00:08:32.436 --> 00:08:39.081
It was here that he met another ambitious boy, a 15-year-old called Quincy Jones, a

00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:44.511
man whose career would go on to include working with Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.

00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:51.491
In Seattle he had his own apartment, he lived independently, and he started

00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:56.923
to make a name for himself as “Ray Charles, the blind singing sensation”.

00:08:58.043 --> 00:09:03.433
His big break was to come four years later, in 1952, when

00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:07.323
he was signed to a record label called Atlantic Records.

00:09:08.413 --> 00:09:14.463
This finally gave him the distribution that he so badly needed, and success came

00:09:14.463 --> 00:09:21.053
quickly after with the release of “Mess Around” in 1953, and then the following year,

00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:28.045
in 1954 with the song that really catapulted him to nationwide fame: “ I got a woman”.

00:09:29.445 --> 00:09:36.085
When it comes to the evolution of the musical style of Ray Charles, you can clearly hear

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:43.023
that he has moved away from the slow jazz, the Nat King Cole style what’s called “ crooning”.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:50.373
And by now he has mixed, he has fused together a variety of different styles

00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:55.763
of music - there is jazz in there, but he has combined it with blues and

00:09:56.103 --> 00:10:01.353
even gospel, the style of music popular in churches in the American south.

00:10:02.673 --> 00:10:06.123
This was something that people simply didn't do.

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:11.199
Gospel music was holy, it was music that was sung in church.

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:17.289
Blues, on the other hand, was sexual, it was smooth, it was the opposite of gospel.

00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:23.549
By blending the two styles Ray Charles was putting a type of music

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:30.459
associated with sin and debauchery together with music sung in church.

00:10:31.909 --> 00:10:36.439
He would also use gospel lyrics and switch parts of them.

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:43.341
For example, in “I’ve got a woman” he takes a gospel song called “This little light

00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:50.011
of mine” but switches “light” for “girl”, and he really, he is sexualising a hymn.

00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:55.131
And there were large parts of black America that reacted

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.431
badly to it - they didn’t like what Ray Charles was doing.

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:07.111
He was even accused of sacrilege by gospel pastors, who accused him of bastardizing the hymns.

00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:14.651
There was little that could stop Ray Charles though, and he continued to have hit after hit.

00:11:15.854 --> 00:11:18.994
He was becoming such a star that he was even offered a

00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:23.304
new, incredibly generous contract by another record label.

00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:32.444
In 1959 he switched from Atlantic Records to ABC records when he was offered a $50,000

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:38.614
annual advance, which was about half a million dollars per year at the time, plus

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:44.407
ownership of all of his records - this would have been an incredible deal for the period.

00:11:45.547 --> 00:11:50.157
Ray Charles, alongside being a bold and incredibly talented

00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:55.747
musician, was also a shrewd negotiator and an excellent businessman.

00:11:56.887 --> 00:12:01.747
He would negotiate his own contracts, he owned his own music, he had

00:12:01.747 --> 00:12:06.487
his own music studio, he later on even started his own record label.

00:12:07.357 --> 00:12:12.557
He was blind, but he saw more clearly than most the commercial advantages of

00:12:12.557 --> 00:12:17.587
having control over your own music and your own destiny - at the time most

00:12:17.647 --> 00:12:22.017
other musicians would have had their record labels manage all of this for them.

00:12:23.007 --> 00:12:27.607
And although he was completely blind, and his eyes had literally

00:12:27.607 --> 00:12:32.001
been removed from his body, he was incredibly independent.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:37.311
He never used a stick and he never had a dog to guide him.

00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:43.261
He walked on his own, confidently, feeling his way over to where he needed to go.

00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:48.371
So much so that people would often doubt that he was really blind at all.

00:12:49.921 --> 00:12:53.871
This bravery is believed to have partly come from his

00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:57.901
mother, who would tell him “you’re blind, you ain’t stupid”.

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:04.491
From a young age, Ray Charles was taught that there was no point feeling sorry for yourself.

00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:08.741
Yes, he had had a very tough start to life - he had

00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:12.891
grown up poor, blind, and black in a racist country.

00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:17.791
But this shouldn’t stop him from doing anything he wanted in life.

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:25.291
And by the mid 1960s, Ray Charles was certainly a huge success by anyone’s standards.

00:13:26.031 --> 00:13:31.536
However, there was a darker element to his life that was of his own making.

00:13:32.776 --> 00:13:36.726
He had been addicted to heroin since he was 18 years old.

00:13:37.926 --> 00:13:42.556
Obviously, being addicted to hard drugs is not a sensible life choice for

00:13:42.566 --> 00:13:48.386
anyone, but in the late 1940s and 50s, especially in the circles he was

00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:53.980
in, of jazz and blues musicians, it was nothing completely unordinary.

00:13:55.016 --> 00:13:58.267
Other jazz musicians took heroin very happily,

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:01.177
including lots of people that Ray Charles looked up to.

00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:05.737
He thought it was a way of relaxing and it helped

00:14:05.797 --> 00:14:10.357
creativity, and he had been a full-on addict since he was 18.

00:14:11.487 --> 00:14:17.267
Although he was deeply addicted to the drug, he managed to function semi-normally.

00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:22.587
It was still an illegal drug though, and after being arrested several times

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:29.067
in the 1950s for possession, and then finally again in 1964, he decided

00:14:29.097 --> 00:14:33.777
to go to rehab and he managed to kick his addiction once and for all.

00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:40.432
There was one more addiction, another vice, or perhaps we should just say

00:14:40.602 --> 00:14:45.652
another part of Ray Charles’ character, that he never really managed to overcome.

00:14:46.432 --> 00:14:47.922
His love of women.

00:14:49.002 --> 00:14:55.752
He was married twice, for a total of 23 years, but had numerous other relationships and is

00:14:55.752 --> 00:15:01.012
known to have fathered 12 different children, only three of whom came from his marriages.

00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:07.442
He would sleep with his band members, with fans, with women he met on his tours.

00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:12.372
And there was no shortage of women who were attracted to Ray Charles.

00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:21.022
Despite not being able to see, Ray Charles was reportedly a keen admirer of female physical beauty.

00:15:21.842 --> 00:15:27.032
When he met a woman he would take her hand and arms, run his hand over

00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:31.202
them, to get a feel of whether this was a woman that he was attracted to.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:38.952
You can perhaps tell this from Ray Charles’ music, but he was an incredibly sensual person.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:44.322
Of course, if you do not have the luxury of being able to see, your other

00:15:44.332 --> 00:15:49.692
senses become heightened, and it seems that for Ray Charles it was his

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:54.762
sense of touch and of hearing that compensated for the lack of vision.

00:15:55.992 --> 00:16:00.972
Musically, he went on to become a national and global sensation.

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:06.512
He made more than 60 albums, won countless awards, and has had a

00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:10.782
profound influence on the generation of musicians who followed him.

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:19.562
He died at his home in Beverly Hills in 2004, aged 73, after complications from liver

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:26.838
surgery, leaving behind an incredible back catalogue and a completely new and unique sound.

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:32.279
Despite all of the odds, despite the deck being stacked against

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:37.219
him, he went on to be one of the defining voices of his generation.

00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:44.069
He never felt that people should be sympathetic towards him, or that he was unlucky in life.

00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:48.139
He never let his blindness stop him from doing anything,

00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:52.669
he was a truly determined and evidently a very brave man.

00:16:53.919 --> 00:17:00.209
And perhaps there is no greater compliment of Ray Charles than how another musical icon,

00:17:00.518 --> 00:17:06.928
Frank Sinatra was to describe him - he called him “The only true genius in our business”.

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:14.698
OK then, that is it for today’s episode, The Amazing Life of Ray Charles.

00:17:14.998 --> 00:17:19.678
As a reminder, this was part one of a three-part mini-series.

00:17:19.978 --> 00:17:26.558
Next up will be Johnny Cash, The Man in Black, then part three is going to be on Elvis Presley.

00:17:27.658 --> 00:17:31.238
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:36.418
For the Ray Charles fans out there, what is your favourite of his songs, and why?

00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:40.748
Where else can you see the influences of Ray Charles?

00:17:41.098 --> 00:17:46.938
And what other examples can you think of people who did not let obstacles get in their way?

00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:48.888
I would love to know.

00:17:49.138 --> 00:17:52.428

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.329
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.429
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.750
talking about a tiny Mediterranean island called Malta.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.110
It is a place I called home from 2017 to 2024, so you could say that this

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.079
is the result of 7 years of research, conversations and observations.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.220
There is so much to say that I’ve actually split this into two episodes.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.249
In part one, in this episode, I’ll talk about Malta in general

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.919
and in particular, what it is like as a place to learn English.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.889
And in part two,  I’ll go a lot deeper into some of the things that you probably

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.670
wouldn't notice as a tourist, and talk about my experiences on everything from government

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.400
corruption, Malta’s relationship with the EU, and the concept of Maltese identity.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:19.233
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk about Malta.

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:26.243
In December of 2016, my then fiancée got a job offer.

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:29.983
It was for a job at the University of Malta.

00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:35.143
Neither of us knew much about Malta, or had ever been there.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:41.613
All I knew was that it was very hot, a boy from my school used to go on holiday there,

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:48.233
and that it had become a destination for British stag dos and school leaving parties.

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:54.833
My fiancée knew it was just south of Sicily, and her mother was worried that we

00:01:54.833 --> 00:02:00.623
would be living in some deserted dusty village, surrounded by only goats for company.

00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:07.313
The contract was only for one year, but we both thought, why not?

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:11.953
A year is only a year, if it is a total disaster then we

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:15.363
can return to London, and you never know, it could be fun.

00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:23.063
This was almost 8 years ago now, and a few months ago we left Malta for good.

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:30.383
So, I thought it could be interesting for me to tell you about my observations and reflections on

00:02:30.393 --> 00:02:36.793
life in Malta, and how the country has changed even in the relatively short time that I was there.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:42.013
After all, I get emails all the time from people who are considering

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:46.362
going to Malta to learn English, or even moving to Malta.

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:52.893
So, if you are that kind of person, I hope that this will be helpful, and if you

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:57.643
are listening to this in Malta, or if you have already spent time in the country,

00:02:57.983 --> 00:03:01.873
well perhaps it will be interesting for you to hear someone else’s point of view.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:07.793
Of course, this all comes with the caveat that it is based on my experience.

00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:13.953
Malta might be a small place, but it is varied, and everyone will have different experiences.

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:22.163
Now, for those of you who know absolutely nothing about Malta, let me start with a few basic points.

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:30.043
Malta is a tiny country in the Mediterranean, about 100 kilometres south of Sicily.

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:36.413
Contrary to what many people think, it isn’t part of Italy, nor is it

00:03:36.413 --> 00:03:42.023
part of the United Kingdom, although it was under British rule until 1964.

00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:47.673
One of the main relics of British rule is the reason that you might have heard

00:03:47.673 --> 00:03:54.863
of Malta, or have been there: English is an official language, and there are 35

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:59.633
English schools in Malta, welcoming tens of thousands of students every year.

00:04:00.693 --> 00:04:04.203
So, to answer a question that I receive almost on a

00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:08.273
weekly basis, “should I come to Malta to study English?”

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:14.923
Clearly, the answer is “it depends”, but here are some things to consider.

00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:21.208
There are broadly three categories of people who come to Malta to learn English.

00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:28.281
Firstly, the largest category is of the French, Italian or German teenager who

00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:33.421
comes for a week or two in the summer as part of a large language group, and

00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:40.001
returns home with a sore head, some serious sunburn, perhaps some formative romantic

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:45.931
experiences and an ever-so-slightly improved understanding of what a phrasal verb is.

00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:52.761
This is the largest category in terms of student numbers, making up almost 50% of all

00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:59.131
students coming to Malta, but it is especially concentrated in the summer, so outside

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:04.341
of July and August, you will be unlikely to find these types of students in your class.

00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:10.601
The second category is people who are studying at an English school for purposes of

00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:16.701
immigration, with most of these students coming from South America, predominantly Colombia.

00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:23.581
The primary purpose for most of these students is to emigrate and live in an

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:29.181
EU country with better economic opportunities, so most will come, study English

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:34.011
at a school for a few months and then get a job working in a bar or a cafe.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.731
If you are from Colombia, you probably know already that Malta is a big

00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:44.401
destination for Colombians, but if you didn’t, it might surprise you if

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.601
you arrive in Malta and hear Colombian accents on every street corner.

00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:55.751
In fact, there are so many Colombians now that at some English schools they are not allowing

00:05:55.751 --> 00:06:01.221
more Colombian students, so that there is a proper mix of nationalities in the classroom.

00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.041
I have a good friend in Malta who runs a business exclusively for Colombians

00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:12.011
coming to Malta to study English, and I can tell you firsthand, it is a

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.381
big business - there are lots of Colombians studying English in Malta.

00:06:17.971 --> 00:06:23.691
And then the third category of learner that you will find is the adult learner who is

00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:29.451
taking a course for an extended period for work or professional reasons, someone who

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:35.291
needs to quickly upskill their English, and is often being sponsored by their employer.

00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.091
There are lots of people from places like Japan, Korea and Turkey in this

00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:45.401
category, people who will take a career break to focus on their English.

00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:49.881
And these kinds of people, in my experience at least,

00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:53.411
are by far and away the most dedicated students.

00:06:54.561 --> 00:07:01.591
Clearly, not everyone fits neatly into these three categories, but this is a helpful way of

00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:06.641
thinking about the different types of people that you might encounter in an English school in Malta.

00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:11.691
So, what factors should you take into consideration if you

00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:14.631
are thinking about whether to come to Malta to learn English?

00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:21.241
If you are looking for an “immersion English” experience, and you want to speak English

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:26.471
from the moment you wake up until the moment you go to bed, then Malta is a good option.

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:33.381
Of course, you can also have this in somewhere like London or Oxford or New York or Boston or

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:40.171
Sydney, but those places might be a long way from home, and they are certainly more expensive.

00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:47.071
The cost of learning English tends to be lower in Malta than in the UK, North

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:53.011
America or Australia, so if price is an important factor, if you are paying

00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:57.531
for it yourself, rather than your employer, Malta could be a sensible choice.

00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:04.941
And another perhaps blindingly obvious thing to mention is that Malta is a Mediterranean

00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:10.841
island, and if you like the sun and lying on the beach, Malta ticks a lot of boxes.

00:08:12.151 --> 00:08:17.251
The official tourist board boasts that the island has 300 days of sunshine,

00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:22.371
and this is not a lie; for much of the year, it is simply glorious.

00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:29.791
Summers are incredibly hot, too hot for my taste, and the winters are cold because most houses

00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:36.501
have no heating, but outside those periods you will be blessed with blue skies and wonderful warm

00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:43.361
sun, and because it is such a small place you will never be much more than 20 minutes from the sea.

00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:50.881
The third factor to consider, which might be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending

00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:56.041
on what you are looking for, is that Malta is, as I’ve said already, a tiny island.

00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.521
It is 316 kilometres squared, and although it is

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:04.931
incredibly densely populated, it has a small-town feel.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:11.491
There is a lot to do for a small island, but at the end of the day it is a very

00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:17.461
small place and if you are looking for a vibrant cultural scene with different plays

00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:22.531
and shows to go to every single evening, and opportunities to go on expeditions

00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.431
in the country every weekend, Malta probably isn’t the right place for you.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.651
But, one of the benefits of it being this small, and of having

00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:35.261
such a high concentration of foreigners and people learning English

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:39.591
is that it is incredibly easy to meet people and make friends.

00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:45.731
There are meetups, sporting clubs, and in my experience at least it is pretty easy

00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:51.291
to take part in almost any activity you like, and make new friends along the way.

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:56.841
It's also very easy to get to almost any European destination, there are

00:09:57.081 --> 00:10:01.831
cheap flights all over Europe, so that is a major advantage especially for

00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:06.471
non-Europeans, whose study visa would allow them to travel all over Europe.

00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:13.451
So, to summarise, if you want an international atmosphere, reasonable prices and like the

00:10:13.451 --> 00:10:19.321
idea of spending time on a Mediterranean island, or even using it as a launchpad for exploring

00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:24.071
the rest of Europe, then I’d definitely recommend you consider Malta as a place to study.

00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:30.531
Now, what about Malta itself, from a non-English student perspective.

00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:35.891
The first thing to mention is that Malta has been experiencing an economic

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:40.601
boom over the past 15 years or so, created principally through attracting

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:44.541
online gambling companies to the island, as well as selling citizenship.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:51.358
I’ll tell you a bit more about my opinions on this and experiences of it in part two, but

00:10:51.628 --> 00:10:57.548
from a practical point of view this has resulted in the country developing at breakneck speed.

00:10:58.588 --> 00:11:04.478
It's very noisy, there is constant construction, a lot of traffic, horns beeping, and

00:11:04.738 --> 00:11:10.708
especially if you come from a more rural environment, you will probably be struck by how

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:16.528
many people there are, especially in the main tourist areas, and how crowded it feels.

00:11:17.358 --> 00:11:20.258
And one thing that might surprise you, coming to

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:24.238
Malta, is how few Maltese people you might come across.

00:11:25.108 --> 00:11:29.488
The population of the country, according to official statistics, is more than

00:11:29.498 --> 00:11:35.788
one quarter non-Maltese, so there is one foreigner for every 3 Maltese people.

00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:42.728
This is especially noticeable in touristy areas, where you can easily go from

00:11:42.788 --> 00:11:47.958
cafe to supermarket to shop to hairdresser to restaurant to bar and not a

00:11:47.988 --> 00:11:53.518
single person will be from Malta, or will be able to speak a word of Maltese.

00:11:54.928 --> 00:11:57.418
So, where are all these foreigners from?

00:11:58.278 --> 00:12:02.808
Historically most foreigners in Malta used to be from the UK and

00:12:02.898 --> 00:12:08.168
Italy, but in recent years Brits and Italians have been overtaken.

00:12:09.078 --> 00:12:13.838
There are still plenty of British and Italian people, but now three

00:12:13.838 --> 00:12:18.638
quarters of all new immigrants to Malta are from non-EU countries.

00:12:19.963 --> 00:12:24.638
These tend to be people from places like India, Pakistan, and the Philippines,

00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:29.848
who have often been drawn to the country to work in hotels or restaurants or

00:12:30.068 --> 00:12:35.808
in construction by the promise of a simple visa process, decent wages, a good

00:12:35.808 --> 00:12:40.198
work-life balance, and the possibility of sending money home every month.

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:47.588
The reality is that Malta simply doesn’t have enough Maltese people who are prepared to do

00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:54.328
this hard, manual labour, and so the country has turned to imported labour to fill the gap.

00:12:55.498 --> 00:13:05.398
And as a result, the population has increased dramatically, increasing by 34% between 2002 and 2022.

00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:08.138
Now, what does this mean?

00:13:09.058 --> 00:13:13.238
On a practical basis, along with very favourable legislation that

00:13:13.238 --> 00:13:17.458
encourages people to buy apartments to rent out, the price of rent has

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:22.088
shot up, more than doubling even in the 7 years that I lived there.

00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:26.308
And now, Malta is quite an expensive place to live.

00:13:27.138 --> 00:13:34.208
In a desirable area it would not be so unusual to pay €2,000 a month for a two bedroom apartment,

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:40.178
and it is very hard to find an apartment anywhere on the island for less than €1,000 a month.

00:13:41.558 --> 00:13:44.278
And salaries have barely increased.

00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:50.695
The minimum wage is just under €900 a month  so for people employed

00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:55.245
in low-skilled jobs, the situation is not particularly rosy.

00:13:56.305 --> 00:14:01.415
And this is especially true for foreigners, who are more likely to pay rent

00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:06.995
than Maltese people, so the result is that many foreigners simply…leave.

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:14.445
According to a recent report, half of all foreigners who come to live in Malta leave within a year.

00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:19.985
And, as you’ve heard by now, I have also left, although I

00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:24.745
did stay 7 years, 6.5 years more than the average foreigner.

00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:27.625
So, do I regret it?

00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:29.085
Not at all.

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:32.055
Like any country, there are plenty of things to

00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:36.155
complain about, but overall, Malta has many advantages.

00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:41.955
It has great weather, beautiful villages, the sea, the sun, very friendly

00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:46.095
and welcoming people, and I am incredibly grateful for having had the

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:50.955
opportunity to call it home for a not insignificant period in my life.

00:14:51.695 --> 00:14:56.495
So if you have the chance to visit Malta, or even to study English there,

00:14:56.915 --> 00:15:01.355
my advice to you would be the same as I thought over seven years ago now:

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:06.345
just do it, it’s a Mediterranean island, what’s the worst that could happen?

00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:12.235
OK then, that is it for this little taster of what it

00:15:12.235 --> 00:15:15.105
is like to live and perhaps study English in Malta.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.465
There was far too much to put into one episode, so keep a lookout

00:15:19.465 --> 00:15:23.335
for part two, where I am going to go a level deeper, and talk about

00:15:23.335 --> 00:15:28.475
political corruption, fraud, the EU, and what it means to be Maltese.

00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:34.625
And if you haven’t had enough Malta yet, we do have other episodes on this unusual little country.

00:15:35.095 --> 00:15:43.695
Episode number 143 is on the Great Siege of Malta, and episodes 306 to 308 are a three-part

00:15:43.695 --> 00:15:50.995
mini-series on the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and episode 358 is on how Malta became an

00:15:51.025 --> 00:15:56.985
online gambling hub, so if you haven’t listened to those yet, well they are there waiting for you.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:16.915
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:21.185
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:26.695
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about someone you’ve

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:32.975
almost certainly heard of - Michael Jackson, “The King of Pop”, or simply “MJ”

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:38.585
He was a child prodigy that became a teen idol, and then went on

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:42.055
to become one of the biggest selling music artists of all time.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:46.755
But, as you will know, his later life was plagued with

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.415
controversy and allegations of the most heinous kind.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:55.575
So that is what we are going to be talking about today, the Troubled Life of The King of Pop.

00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:00.215
This episode does come with a slight warning that we will be talking

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:03.885
about some of the crimes that Michael Jackson was accused of, so

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:07.405
if you would rather not listen to that, please stop listening now.

00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:13.901
OK then, let’s get into it and talk about the life of Michael Jackson.

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:19.241
Michael Joseph Jackson was born into a working-class

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:25.681
African-American family in Gary, Indiana, on August the 29th of 1958.

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:32.491
He grew up in a modest two-bedroom house along with his eight siblings - quite the

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:38.671
squeeze, two parents and 9 children, 11 people in total, in only two bedrooms..

00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:45.241
His father, Joe Jackson, worked for U.S Steel and was a tough

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:50.661
man, a former boxer who also played guitar in a local RnB band.

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:56.111
And Jackson’s mother, Katherine Esher Jackson, worked in the

00:01:56.111 --> 00:02:00.591
department store Sears, and also played piano and clarinet.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.801
Music, clearly, ran in Jackson's blood.

00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:12.491
And the father, Joe, pushed all of the children in a musical direction from an early age.

00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.071
The first band was called the Jackson Brothers, which,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.661
unsurprisingly, consisted of the young Jackson boys.

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.971
Michael joined the group when he was only six years old.

00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:33.281
Despite being an otherwise timid, shy boy, Michael was a natural on stage

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.871
and it quickly became clear that he was a very talented singer and dancer.

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:45.971
He became the group’s frontman, and soon enough, the Jackson Brothers were playing live

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:51.761
shows in strip clubs and burlesque bars - the only places that would have them in Gary.

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:59.854
They rehearsed relentlessly, and Joe Jackson was a hard man, a disciplinarian

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:05.624
who ruled the family - and the band - with fear, with a rod of steel.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:13.374
The Jackson boys were allowed few friends, and they were forced to rehearse well into the night.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:20.234
Later in his life, Michael Jackson would state that his father beat them for making

00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:26.824
minor mistakes in rehearsals, and that he became so terrified of his father that, in

00:03:26.824 --> 00:03:32.144
his words, "there were times when he'd come to see me and I would start to be sick."

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:39.934
In fact, Joe Jackson would often sit with a belt in hand as the Jacksons rehearsed, ready to

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:46.664
punish any mistakes, and beat the children fiercely when one slipped up, when one made a mistake.

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:54.401
Worse still, it would be claimed that the father, Joe, would sexually abuse his children.

00:03:55.821 --> 00:04:01.311
That childhood trauma would live with Michael for the rest of his life, and it's often

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:06.791
raised when trying to make sense of the actions and controversy of his later years.

00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:13.251
In 1964, the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:20.196
A year later, in 1965, the group won a talent show, and they were on the way up.

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:30.086
From 1966 to 1968, the Jackson 5 began touring the Midwest, playing mainly in black bars and clubs.

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:36.446
And let’s remember here that Michael hasn’t even celebrated his 10th birthday

00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:42.036
- almost his entire life so far has been spent rehearsing and playing music.

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:48.786
Although the Jackson boys initially performed covers, their versions of other

00:04:48.786 --> 00:04:55.586
people’s songs, in 1968 the Jackson 5 recorded their first original record for a local

00:04:55.606 --> 00:05:01.646
Indiana label, Steeltown Records, and their first single, "Big Boy", was released.

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:06.396
That same year, a Canadian singer discovered the group and

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:10.088
brought them to the attention of the famous Motown Records.

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:16.686
After their audition, Motown president Berry Gordy was so impressed with the

00:05:16.686 --> 00:05:23.033
Jackson 5 that he immediately signed them, and armed with an experienced group of

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:29.953
songwriters, The Jackson 5 managed their first big hit in 1969 with “I Want You Back.”

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:35.133
One influence you might not be aware of on the Jackson

00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:39.633
5’s early career is another legendary singer, Diana Ross.

00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:44.513
She played an important role helping them after the entire

00:05:44.513 --> 00:05:48.813
Jackson family decamped from Indiana and moved to California.

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:55.163
She presented them to important figures in the music industry, and in August

00:05:55.313 --> 00:06:01.247
of 1969 the Jackson 5 opened for Diana Ross & the Supremes in Los Angeles.

00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:05.827
They made their first TV appearance that same year, performing at

00:06:05.847 --> 00:06:09.797
the Miss Black America pageant with a cover of "It's Your Thing".

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:15.537
Following the show, the influential Rolling Stone magazine described

00:06:15.597 --> 00:06:22.217
Michael, in particular, as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts."

00:06:23.357 --> 00:06:27.732
Michael Jackson’s life was never - could never - be the same again.

00:06:28.642 --> 00:06:33.282
Yet, though he would later admit that he was unhappy, lonely, and

00:06:33.642 --> 00:06:38.411
overworked, the successes kept coming for Michael and the Jackson 5.

00:06:39.278 --> 00:06:44.788
And in early 1970, "I Want You Back" reached number one in the US Billboard

00:06:44.818 --> 00:06:50.508
Hot 100 - their first number one hit and the first of many in Jackson’s life.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.208
They quickly went on to top the charts with other

00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:57.398
well-known classics like "ABC" and "I'll Be There."

00:06:58.028 --> 00:07:04.135
And let’s remember here, in 1970, when the Jackson 5 had their first number

00:07:04.135 --> 00:07:09.705
one, Michael Jackson was only 11 years old, he was still a young child.

00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:17.101
But as the Jackson 5 grew in fame and popularity, Michael emerged as the

00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:23.171
star of the family, and moved from being a child prodigy to a teen idol.

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:30.061
A teen idol, by the way, usually means an artist or actor with a big teenage

00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:36.554
fanbase, but in this case it was both as Michael was himself also still  a teenager.

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:40.304
Or you could say, Michael wasn’t even a teenager yet.

00:07:41.354 --> 00:07:47.244
Despite his young age, he was a trailblazer, someone who forges a new path.

00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:53.392
His performance on the group’s record "Dancing Machine" popularised the robot dance.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:58.054
And it was in the late-1970’s that Michael really began

00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:01.624
to break away from his brothers, to break out on his own.

00:08:02.444 --> 00:08:07.554
In 1978, he made his film debut as the Scarecrow in a

00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:11.354
remake of The Wizard Of Oz, with Diana Ross playing Dorothy.

00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:17.694
Then a year later, aged still only 21, Jackson recorded the iconic

00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:22.264
solo album Off The Wall, which brought him his first Number one solo

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:26.197
singles with " Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Rock With You".

00:08:27.287 --> 00:08:31.237
And the commercial and critical successes only grew.

00:08:31.897 --> 00:08:39.347
A year after that, in  1980, he won his first Grammy Award for Best R&B Male Vocal Performance, and

00:08:39.517 --> 00:08:46.921
in 1982 he released Thriller, which had a staggering seven singles from the album in the top 10,

00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:53.361
including some you probably know well, such as "Billie Jean," "Beat It," and, of course, "Thriller."

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:58.831
And you may also know that Thriller wasn’t famous only for its music.

00:08:59.721 --> 00:09:05.681
Thriller might be the most famous music video of all time, where Jackson, who had

00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:11.231
become a werewolf in the video, first unveiled his signature dance move, the moonwalk.

00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:18.691
By now Michael was the biggest pop star in the world - he was the King of Pop.

00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:23.271
He was rich beyond his wildest dreams, and it seemed that

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.581
practically everything he released went to Number one.

00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:32.521
His personal life, however, was becoming a bit… well, strange.

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:37.981
In the 1980s, Jackson became somewhat of a recluse - someone

00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:41.171
who lives a withdrawn life and avoids other people.

00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:47.094
He was also developing a reputation as a little eccentric, or weird.

00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:53.924
In 1984, he moved to a 1,100 hectare ranch in California called

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:59.328
Neverland, where he had an amusement park, zoo, and a Ferris wheel built.

00:09:59.983 --> 00:10:05.643
And in January of that year, Michael and some of his siblings filmed an advert for

00:10:05.843 --> 00:10:13.103
Pepsi, but as he was dancing the pyrotechnic effects set his Afro hair on fire.

00:10:14.173 --> 00:10:18.123
Unaware of what was happening, he kept dancing, continuing with

00:10:18.123 --> 00:10:21.953
his routine until someone grabbed him and put the fire out.

00:10:23.273 --> 00:10:29.913
The accident left Jackson with second-degree burns to his scalp, and he had treatment

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:35.873
- including a nose job - to hide the scarring, to hide the damage from the burns.

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:42.733
It was around this time that rumours began to swirl around Hollywood that Jackson was

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:48.683
lightening his skin through chemical treatment, that he was changing the colour of his skin.

00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:54.203
Michael Jackson was, as you will know, African American, he was

00:10:54.373 --> 00:10:59.413
black, but throughout the 1980’s his skin started becoming paler.

00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:07.873
This change in appearance, Jackson claimed, was due to a skin condition known as vitiligo.

00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:14.953
Vitiligo is, of course, a real skin disorder, but there were other changes in

00:11:14.953 --> 00:11:20.233
Michael Jackson’s appearance that have nothing to do with vitiligo, and everything

00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:24.473
to do with someone trying to change their appearance through plastic surgery.

00:11:25.243 --> 00:11:30.233
His nose was bleached, his lips were thinned, and his chin reshaped.

00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:34.733
He looked, as you will probably know if you have seen pictures

00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:39.243
of him as a child and then as a man, like a different person.

00:11:40.503 --> 00:11:46.693
But while his appearance may have changed completely, the quality of his music did not.

00:11:47.553 --> 00:11:51.013
After a few years without releasing an album, Jackson’s

00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:55.663
highly anticipated next release, “Bad”, was a huge hit.

00:11:56.643 --> 00:12:04.683
In August of 1987, this album, "Bad" became the first album to produce five US number-one singles.

00:12:05.243 --> 00:12:10.233
The album was also the first to be number 1 in 25 countries and

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:16.117
was the best-selling album around the globe in both 1987 and 1988.

00:12:17.267 --> 00:12:23.127
Now Jackson was not just the King of Pop, he was head and shoulders above

00:12:23.137 --> 00:12:27.457
anyone else - breaking records and dominating the charts around the world.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:34.207
But behind all the success, behind the Number 1 albums and moonwalks

00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:38.407
and music videos, there was a darker side to Jackson’s life.

00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:42.787
Now, we get to the other part of Michael Jackson.

00:12:42.977 --> 00:12:44.947
The more uncomfortable part.

00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:51.147
The aspect of his life that is, unfortunately, inseparable from the amazing

00:12:51.147 --> 00:12:56.458
music that he created, and for some people outweighs his enormous success as

00:12:56.458 --> 00:13:01.848
a musician and for others is so great that they refuse to listen to his music.

00:13:03.038 --> 00:13:10.658
In August of 1993, reports emerged that the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating Jackson.

00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:20.865
The police had received that he molested, abused, four children, including a 13-year-old boy.

00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:28.255
After searching his Neverland ranch, the police failed to find any incriminating evidence.

00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:35.265
But in September of that year, one of the families filed a lawsuit against Jackson,

00:13:35.745 --> 00:13:41.325
alleging that he "repeatedly committed sexual battery" on their 13 year old son.

00:13:42.835 --> 00:13:49.985
Defenders of Jackson, and his legal team, claimed the allegations were a way of extorting

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:54.655
the star for millions of dollars, they were trying to get money out of the pop star.

00:13:55.785 --> 00:14:00.995
Many years later, however, it was revealed that Jackson privately settled the

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:06.775
lawsuit for more than 20 million dollars, though he denied any "wrongful acts."

00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:12.485
It seems that some of the parents of the children also refused

00:14:12.525 --> 00:14:17.021
to believe that anything untoward, anything dodgy, had happened.

00:14:18.231 --> 00:14:22.961
In 1993, one of the mother’s spoke publicly about her child's

00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:26.111
"slumber parties" with the singer at the Neverland ranch.

00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:30.621
"They play so hard, they fall asleep, they're exhausted," she told the

00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:35.451
interviewer, seemingly unable, or unwilling, to accept the allegations.

00:14:36.081 --> 00:14:37.531
"There's nothing more to it than that."

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:42.411
It seemed that prosecutors were also struggling to pin

00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:45.981
anything on Jackson, to find him guilty of any crimes.

00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:53.481
In September of 1994, after a year of trying, prosecutors announced that they could not

00:14:53.491 --> 00:14:58.871
make criminal charges against Jackson because the key victim didn’t want to testify.

00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:03.811
Jackson had got away with it, or so it seemed.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:08.761
But then, in December of that year, Jackson’s sister

00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:13.161
La Toya publicly said that the claims were true.

00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:18.171
"This is very difficult for me," she said in a press conference.

00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:19.791
"Michael is my brother.

00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:24.821
... But I cannot, and will not, be a silent collaborator

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.311
of his crimes against small, innocent children."

00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:33.991
She also claimed that she knew of ‘hush money’ paid out

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:37.391
to the families of young boys going back to the 1980’s.

00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:44.901
Hush money, by the way, is money paid to someone to stop them from disclosing damaging information.

00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:51.762
Other members of the Jackson family, including his mother, defended him, but the

00:15:51.762 --> 00:15:57.222
rumours and allegations dogged, they followed, Jackson for the rest of his life.

00:15:58.432 --> 00:16:04.708
While all this was all going on, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis’s daughter, in May

00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:11.978
of 1994, but the marriage only lasted a couple of years, the pair divorced in August of 1996.

00:16:12.998 --> 00:16:19.478
Jackson then married a lady called Debbie Rowe, his dermatologist’s assistant, on November the

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:26.538
13th of 1996, and the pair had two children before they divorced less than three years later.

00:16:27.648 --> 00:16:32.208
Rowe would later claim that she and Jackson never actually had

00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:36.368
sex, the children were conceived through artificial insemination.

00:16:37.798 --> 00:16:41.928
Rumours of Jackson’s sexuality and private life, including

00:16:41.928 --> 00:16:46.208
the accusations of child abuse, showed no signs of dying down.

00:16:47.028 --> 00:16:51.908
Then, in November 2003, Jackson was arrested on charges of

00:16:51.988 --> 00:16:56.648
child molestation after police again raided his Neverland ranch.

00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:04.588
After posting $3 million dollars in bail and giving up his passport, Jackson was indicted on, he

00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:12.068
was formally accused of 10 criminal charges, including child molestation and false imprisonment.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:18.258
In February of 2005 the case went to court, with the whole world watching.

00:17:19.608 --> 00:17:24.258
Among those defending Jackson in court was the child actor Macaulay Culkin.

00:17:25.153 --> 00:17:31.097
In court it was established that Culkin and other underage boys regularly slept

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:36.747
with Jackson in his bed, but Culkin denied that Jackson ever acted inappropriately.

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:40.807
Rather, he described Jackson as a ‘special friend.’

00:17:42.077 --> 00:17:46.747
The alleged victim in this case, however, claimed in court that Jackson

00:17:46.907 --> 00:17:51.947
sexually abused him, plied him with alcohol and showed him pornography.

00:17:53.127 --> 00:17:57.647
A former member of Jackson's housekeeping staff at his Neverland ranch

00:17:57.937 --> 00:18:02.397
testified that she had seen the singer taking a shower with a young

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:07.457
boy, and that her own son alleged that Jackson also molested him.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.177
As you might imagine, given Jackson’s fame, the trial was

00:18:13.187 --> 00:18:17.317
a media frenzy and developed a circus-like atmosphere.

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:23.987
Some in the press felt that Jackson didn’t take the allegations against him, or the trial in

00:18:23.987 --> 00:18:30.986
general, seriously, and on one occasion Jackson arrived late to the courtroom still in his pyjamas.

00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:38.196
Yet despite the terrible claims against him, on June the 13th of 2005, Jackson

00:18:38.316 --> 00:18:43.526
was acquitted of all criminal charges, he was off the hook, he was free.

00:18:44.776 --> 00:18:49.116
According to media reports at the time, some jurors appeared

00:18:49.136 --> 00:18:52.816
to blame the alleged victim's mother, rather than Jackson.

00:18:53.786 --> 00:18:56.626
"What mother in her right mind would allow that to happen?"

00:18:56.996 --> 00:18:59.016
one female juror reportedly asked.

00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:04.636
Indeed, a few months later, prosecutors would charge one of the

00:19:04.636 --> 00:19:09.696
alleged victim's mothers with perjury, in other words, lying in court.

00:19:11.006 --> 00:19:16.226
Now, although Jackson was acquitted of all criminal charges, the court of public

00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:22.386
opinion wasn’t so kind to him, and rumours that he was a child sex abuser continued.

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:27.226
But then something even more unexpected happened.

00:19:27.976 --> 00:19:34.536
On June the 25th, 2009, Jackson was found unresponsive at his home.

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:40.056
At a mere 50 years old, The King of Pop was dead.

00:19:41.286 --> 00:19:46.336
Although it was initially believed by the Jackson family that he had died of cardiac

00:19:46.346 --> 00:19:53.046
arrest, of a heart attack, in November of 2011 a doctor, Conrad Murray, was found

00:19:53.056 --> 00:19:59.026
guilty of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson a deadly dose of an anaesthetic.

00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:06.627
Jackson, it would be revealed, was heavily addicted to prescription drugs, and it seems that

00:20:06.637 --> 00:20:13.217
this time his doctor had got the doses wrong, and given him so much it put him to sleep forever.

00:20:14.287 --> 00:20:19.672
Now, in terms of his legacy, there are few individuals who can claim to

00:20:19.672 --> 00:20:23.922
have had a greater impact on the world of pop music, and certainly few

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:27.962
people who have lived more of their life on stage than Michael Jackson.

00:20:29.522 --> 00:20:35.732
For over five decades, Michael Jackson, dominated the music scene with relentless number

00:20:35.732 --> 00:20:42.302
one hits, his signature dance moves, groundbreaking music videos and unrivalled showmanship.

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:48.382
Yet the second half of his career was dogged by allegations of child abuse.

00:20:49.432 --> 00:20:53.812
Some of his die-hard fans still refuse to believe the accusations,

00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:58.012
arguing that he was targeted by people wanting to get money out of him.

00:20:59.172 --> 00:21:05.872
Some accept them but point to his own childhood trauma as justification, arguing

00:21:05.872 --> 00:21:10.702
that he was never allowed to be a child himself, that he had been abused by his

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:15.852
father, and it is ridiculous for anyone to have expected him to behave normally.

00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:21.962
Others simply refuse to listen to his music, disgusted by the accusations

00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:26.432
of the atrocious acts he is alleged to have committed against children.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:33.004
No matter your opinion on Michael Jackson “the man”, it’s undeniable that

00:21:33.004 --> 00:21:38.474
he had a huge impact on music and defined what it meant to be a pop star.

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:44.804
Perhaps, when thinking about Michael Jackson, we are presented with the same question

00:21:45.015 --> 00:21:50.321
as when thinking about the violent but brilliant Renaissance painter, Caravaggio, the

00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:56.011
artist Pablo Picasso, who has been accused of being a misogynist and once said “women

00:21:56.051 --> 00:22:01.581
are machines for suffering” or any public figure who has created something wonderful

00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:06.041
but has views we don’t agree with or who has been accused of something terrible.

00:22:07.131 --> 00:22:11.181
And that is the question of whether we can ever really

00:22:11.301 --> 00:22:16.261
separate the musician from the music, the artist from the art?

00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:22.661
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Michael

00:22:22.671 --> 00:22:26.501
Jackson, the child star who became the King of Pop.

00:22:26.931 --> 00:22:31.011
A man who had, to say the very least, an unhealthy interest

00:22:31.011 --> 00:22:34.631
in young boys and died in mysterious circumstances.

00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:38.811
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Michael

00:22:38.811 --> 00:22:42.811
Jackson and his life before today, or this was the first time you’d

00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:46.161
really heard anything about him, well I hope you learned something new.

00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:50.551
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:51.031 --> 00:22:54.301
Do you think Jackson was guilty of the accusations against him?

00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:57.901
Do you think we can ever separate the man from his music?

00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:02.551
If you’re a Michael Jackson fan, what’s your favourite song, and why?

00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:06.461
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

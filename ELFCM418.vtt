Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.008
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.978
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:26.248
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the race to the South Pole.

00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:30.968
It is the most amazing story of success, failure against

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:36.378
the odds, bravery, bad luck, honour, courage and exploration

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:41.198
.
OK then, The Race To The South Pole

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:48.328
On the 16th of January, 1912, a group of five men pushed

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:52.648
forward, their snowshoes crunching on the ice below.

00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:57.548
They were in Antarctica, at the bottom of the world, and

00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:02.138
despite it being “summer” the weather was particularly bad.

00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:10.558
Temperatures had got to minus thirty, and the blistering wind made it feel even colder.

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:14.108
What’s more, the men were exhausted.

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:18.768
They had been trudging across Antarctica for two and a half months,

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:24.218
their supplies were running low, and luck had not been on their side.

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:29.418
But in the distance, one of the men spotted something.

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:33.878
It was simultaneously exactly what they were looking

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:38.088
for and the thing they feared most in the world.

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:43.188
They saw a flag fluttering in the distance.

00:01:44.198 --> 00:01:50.268
It was the South Pole, the point of the map that these five men had risked their lives to reach.

00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:55.788
But the very existence of a flag in this most pristine and

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.548
untouched corner of the world made their stomachs sink.

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.611
Someone had got there first.

00:02:03.798 --> 00:02:08.158
The men pressed forward, and a day later they reached the pole.

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:13.138
They unzipped a tent that marked the spot, and in it

00:02:13.368 --> 00:02:17.278
they found a letter addressed to the King of Norway.

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:23.768
The letter was from Roald Amundsen, the explorer the men had been racing to the pole.

00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:30.118
In the letter, Amundsen politely asked the party leader of his opponents,

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:34.438
Captain Robert Falcon Scott, to deliver it to the Norwegian king.

00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:39.478
Scott would later write in his diary “Great God!

00:02:39.878 --> 00:02:43.228
this is an awful place and terrible enough for us to

00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:46.118
have laboured to it without the reward of priority.

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:51.648
Well, it is something to have got here, and the wind may be our friend to-morrow.

00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:55.678
Now for the run home and a desperate struggle.

00:02:56.088 --> 00:02:57.658
I wonder if we can do it.”

00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:04.468
The British had been beaten by the Norwegians, against all the odds.

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:11.308
But, perhaps surprisingly, the team that came in second place would be remembered

00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:17.628
as brave and heroic explorers, while the victors would be called cheats and frauds.

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:23.498
Now, you might have already known that the Norwegians won the race, but

00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:28.318
the story of how and why is far more interesting than the end result.

00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:31.968
So, let me start with some brief background.

00:03:33.448 --> 00:03:39.548
Antarctica, as you will know, is the vast icy continent at the bottom of the world.

00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:47.758
It has a landmass of 14 million kilometres squared, so it’s about 40% larger than Europe.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:56.398
And in the coldest months of the year, the sea around the landmass also freezes, more than doubling

00:03:56.428 --> 00:04:04.298
the size of the ice, and covering up to 34 million kilometres squared, an area larger than Africa.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:11.258
The point is, in case you didn’t know, Antarctica is absolutely vast.

00:04:11.948 --> 00:04:18.368
But as to the question of how vast it was, well people simply didn’t know.

00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:21.108
They didn’t even know that it existed.

00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:28.548
Going back thousands of years, philosophers and geographers have hypothesised about the existence

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:35.278
of some large cold continent, a frozen land that “balanced” the warmer areas of the world.

00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:41.787
But until 1820, there is no record of anybody having seen it.

00:04:42.857 --> 00:04:49.217
Even getting close was a dangerous affair, with the 18th century British explorer Captain

00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:54.847
James Cook writing “I will not say it was impossible anywhere to get in among this ice,

00:04:54.977 --> 00:05:01.017
but I will assert that the bare attempting of it would be a very dangerous enterprise”.

00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:07.687
But “dangerous enterprise” would be no obstacle for many 19th century explorers.

00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:14.687
Indeed, if it wasn’t dangerous, it almost wasn’t worth doing, to some kind of explorers at least.

00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:21.037
And efforts to explore the Antarctic started in the early 20th century.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:29.897
French, British, German and Swedish parties all set foot on the icy continent, but the missions were

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:36.647
primarily scientific, for information-gathering purposes rather than to make it all the way across.

00:05:38.217 --> 00:05:43.777
One mission, which took place between 1901 and 1904, was

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:47.397
led by a British explorer called Robert Falcon Scott.

00:05:48.177 --> 00:05:53.847
It was literally called "Discovery Expedition", which gives you some idea of its purpose.

00:05:55.297 --> 00:05:59.957
As a quick side note, one of the men on this mission was Ernest Shackleton,

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:05.657
whose attempt to cross Antarctica you can learn about in episode number 398.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.440
This Discovery Mission would be cut short, but a decade

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.580
later, and fully prepared, Scott was ready to try again.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:26.193
Robert Falcon Scott was an accomplished explorer, and he had managed to secure a grant of £20,000,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.220
partially from the British Royal Geographical Society and partially from private institutions.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.748
Adjusted for inflation, this is over €2 million in today's money.

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.779
And he put all the money to use.

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.599
He bought motorised sleds, which were completely

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:50.599
state of the art and untested equipment at the time.

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:57.219
He also brought 19 Siberian ponies with him, as these beasts would be

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.119
charged with pulling the sleds containing all of the party’s supplies.

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:08.059
He brought a lot of stuff, and even before he got to Antarctica, he realised that

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:13.019
he might have overpacked somewhat, he might have brought a bit too much stuff.

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:21.329
The ship the party travelled in was so crowded and overladen that it almost capsized multiple

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:27.349
times, with the weight of the ponies and all the supplies causing it to sway from side to side.

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:34.099
The ship had set off from Britain, in June of 1910, with a planned stop

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:38.619
in Australia before heading further south and landing in Antarctica.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:46.339
Unfortunately, when Scott arrived in Australia, he found some bad news waiting for him.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.529
This bad news came in the form of a telegram.

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:53.289
It read:

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:55.269
"Beg leave to inform.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:57.209
Fram heading south.”

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:02.039
The telegram was simply signed with the surname: “Amundsen.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.469
Scott’s heart sank.

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:11.499
The author of the telegram, Roald Amundsen, was a Norwegian explorer who was

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:16.349
famous in his own right for having successfully navigated the Northwest passage,

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:21.689
the bit of the Arctic Circle that connects the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.

00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:24.609
Fram was his ship.

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:30.239
And Scott knew that “heading south” could only mean one thing.

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:33.869
Amundsen had his sights on the South Pole.

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:41.869
This came as quite a surprise to Scott, as he thought that Amundsen was heading to the North Pole.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:49.199
In fact, the decision to head south, not north, also came as a surprise to the

00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:55.229
men on Amundsen’s boat, as they too had thought they were heading north not south.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:02.189
Amundsen had initially planned to go north, and had raised a not insignificant

00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:06.679
amount of money to try to reach the North Pole, but as he was on his

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:11.169
way he had received news that an American party had got there first.

00:09:12.359 --> 00:09:15.789
By the way, if you’d like to listen to that story, about the race to the

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:20.029
North Pole, we covered that in our last episode, and if you haven’t listened

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:24.149
to that one yet, that story is just as interesting and exciting as this one.

00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:29.749
Anyway, when Amundsen heard that someone had already got to the North Pole,

00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:35.889
he immediately changed tack, quite literally, and headed south instead.

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:38.579
The race was on.

00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:44.339
But it wasn’t quite a case of racing to Antarctica and then racing to the pole.

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:49.860
The competing parties both arrived in January of 1911.

00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:56.279
January might be a mild month by Antarctic standards, but the groups

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:59.599
knew that it could take several months to get to the pole and back.

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:05.139
Even if they were ready to go immediately when they arrived in January, which they weren’t,

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:11.889
this would have meant risking returning in the depths of Antarctic winter, and you don’t need

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:17.429
to be an Antarctic explorer to know that this was a bad idea if you wanted to get back alive.

00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:25.379
The groups set up their camps, and by September of the following year, they were ready to go.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:32.839
At least, Amundsen was ready to go, and his party left on September 8th of 1911.

00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:40.129
But the Norwegians had jumped the gun, they left while it was still bitterly cold,

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:46.079
and they were forced to return back to base and wait for the temperature to rise.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:52.179
It took more than a month, and on October 19th, with four

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:56.769
sledges and fifty two dogs, the Norwegians set off south.

00:10:58.169 --> 00:11:01.882
Scott, on the other hand, waited until November 1st.

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:08.509
Now, it’s worth spending a moment talking about the two approaches, as the British

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:14.159
and the Norwegians took different routes and employed very different strategies.

00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:19.699
They both set off from a similar kind of area, the

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:23.239
Ross Ice Shelf, which is to the south of New Zealand.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:27.479
Well, it’s about 3,500 kilometres from New Zealand,

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:31.159
but New Zealand is the closest sizable piece of land.

00:11:32.489 --> 00:11:39.449
The major difference in terms of route was that Scott’s team took a slightly longer route, but a

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:46.229
route that was partially known, as Scott had experience of this area from his earlier expedition.

00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:52.879
Amundsen, on the other hand, planned to take a shorter but untested route.

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:59.649
Yes, they might get there faster, but they had no idea what they might come across on their way.

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:07.932
In terms of their approaches, on paper, in theory, Scott was much better prepared.

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:11.969
He had raised much more money, he had expensive equipment,

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:16.159
and he enjoyed the full support of the British government.

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:22.329
Amundsen, on the other hand, had raised a relatively small amount of money.

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:30.639
He had no fancy equipment, his strategy was centered on one thing and one thing only: dogs.

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:35.489
Or rather, 100 dogs, which would be used to pull the sleds.

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:40.469
And if you’re thinking, hang on, didn’t you say “52 dogs” a few minutes ago,

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:44.609
yes, I’ll get to the reason why those two numbers are different in a minute.

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:54.349
Scott’s idea was to use ponies, horses, and as you heard, he brought 19 of them on his expedition.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:13:01.059
Clearly, on normal terrain, a horse will prove more useful than a dog.

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:06.039
It’s stronger, it can carry more and it can walk for longer distances.

00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:13.769
But Antarctica is the opposite of “normal terrain”, and Scott soon came to regret his decision.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:18.999
He found that his ponies were a lot slower, and their

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:22.189
weight meant that their hooves got stuck in the snow.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:28.999
To try to counter this, Scott’s party travelled at night, when the temperature dropped and the

00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:36.029
snow was icier and stronger, but clearly travelling at night comes with its own share of problems.

00:13:37.289 --> 00:13:41.229
And what of the three motorised sleds that Scott had brought with him?

00:13:42.099 --> 00:13:47.939
One had fallen into the ice when it was being unloaded from the ship, and the other two

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:54.689
proved to be unreliable, actually slowing down Scott’s party instead of speeding it up.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:59.541
Amundsen’s choice to use dogs was simple and smart.

00:14:00.644 --> 00:14:05.689
Dogs' paws didn’t sink into the snow, they were well-used to these conditions.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:11.659
Dogs were also much more self-reliant; in the evenings they would

00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:15.679
huddle down together, so the Norwegian party didn’t need to build

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:19.709
shelters for them, unlike Scott’s party had to do for his horses.

00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:23.839
Dogs were also much easier to feed.

00:14:24.849 --> 00:14:31.939
They ate whatever meat the men gave them, seal, canned meat, and even…each other.

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:39.889
Now, this might sound a bit grisly, but let me tell you another one of the advantages of using dogs.

00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:47.059
When a dog got tired or sick, instead of carrying it or even leaving it

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:53.089
to die, Amundsen’s party would shoot it, chop it up and feed it to the

00:14:53.089 --> 00:14:57.329
other dogs, who would wolf down their former companion without complaint.

00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:03.769
In fact, of the 100 dogs that set off to Antarctica, only 19 remained,

00:15:04.339 --> 00:15:08.129
the others returned but only in the bellies of their colleagues.

00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:14.779
Even Amundsen’s favourite dog, Helga, was not spared this fate, although

00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:18.979
it was allowed to limp on to the South Pole, so it got the glory of

00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:23.009
reaching that destination before being shot and fed to its companions.

00:15:24.369 --> 00:15:30.189
And if you might be thinking that this is some kind of cruel behaviour that was unique to

00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:36.689
Amundsen and the Norwegians, Scott and his crew did exactly the same thing to their dogs, the only

00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:41.979
reason that fewer dogs died in the British party was because they had fewer dogs to start with.

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:48.009
And if you are wondering whether Scott’s ponies might have escaped this treatment, nope,

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.269
they were shot when the party arrived at a tall glacier that the ponies were unable to climb.

00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:59.099
Moving on to a less grisly topic, another advantage that Amundsen’s

00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:05.079
party had was that everyone in his group was an excellent skier, so

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:10.219
they were both able to go faster and use less energy than going by foot.

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:18.670
As a result, the Norwegians arrived at the South Pole on December 14th, 1911, a

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:24.170
mere 56 days after they set off, or 98 days if we’re counting the false start.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.530
It was a very business-like affair.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.700
Get to the pole as quickly as possible, raise the Norwegian

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.120
flag, take a photo, shoot the favourite dog, and then hurry back.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.050
Even though the Norwegians were relieved to have won the race to the pole, they

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.060
were still concerned that the British might get to the pole and then return

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:51.280
to their ship first, potentially even casting doubt on the Norwegian claims.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.700
Fortunately, or unfortunately if you’re on Team GB

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.340
here, the British had been making very poor progress.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.510
They had stopped off to try to take scientific measurements

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.950
and even collect the egg of an emperor penguin.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:15.400
Supplies were running low, morale was low, and to make matters worse, several

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:20.070
team members were starting to experience the symptoms of what looked like it

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:25.890
might be scurvy, the disease you get that’s caused by a deficiency in vitamin C.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.180
In fact, the Norwegians had nothing to worry about.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.350
When the British explorers did arrive at the pole and see the Norwegian flag,

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.400
the Norwegians were practically back at their boat, ready to sail home again.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:47.620
Of course, Scott and his crew had no way of knowing this, but what they did

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.810
know was that they now had to make the 1,500 kilometre or so return trip.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.630
They managed to travel a few hundred kilometres and get off the Antarctic continent,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:07.010
but as soon as they got back onto the Ross Ice Shelf, things turned from bad to worse.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.950
A man called Edgar Evans, who was considered to be

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.100
the strongest by Scott, was the first to get scurvy.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.780
Combined with the frostbite that was affecting all five

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.430
of the men, the last of Evans’ strength disappeared.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:31.310
He collapsed, and was left behind by the men while they pushed ahead to the next supply depot.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:37.110
The four others returned to find him, but Scott would

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.120
write that he found Evans with a “wild look in his eyes”.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:47.040
Evans knew that death was swiftly approaching, and later

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.960
that evening, on February 17th, he took his last breath.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.910
The five were down to four, and they still had several hundred

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.820
kilometres to go in one of the most inhospitable climates in the world.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.350
The four remaining men pushed on, but one member, Captain

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.180
Lawrence Oates, was suffering terribly from scurvy.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:19.620
The deficiency in vitamin C was causing an old war wound in his leg to open up.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.820
He was in agony, and he knew that his chances of returning home alive were minimal.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:33.130
On the evening of March 17th, on his 32nd birthday, in

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.790
the middle of a huge blizzard, he stepped out of his tent.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.060
Scott would recall that his last words to his team mates

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.510
were “I am just going outside and may be some time”.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.550
Of course, the three remaining explorers knew what Oates was doing, he

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.930
was sacrificing himself so that he would not be a burden to the others.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.330
They did not try to stop him, and the body of Captain Oates has never been found.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.800
Five were now three.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.760
They were getting closer to home.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.530
In fact, they were only 18 kilometres away from the next supply depot.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.820
But those 18 kilometres must have felt like an eternity, an

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.350
impossible distance for three men who were at their physical limit.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:33.560
On March 29th, 1912, they got into their sleeping

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.580
bags in their tent, and wrote their final goodbyes.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.490
Scott’s last diary entry read:

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.600
“We shall stick it out until the end, but we are

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.100
getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.250
It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more.”

00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:00.980
And in a letter that was addressed to the British public, he wrote “Had we

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:06.510
lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.340
courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.360
These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale.”

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.360
End quote.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:26.140
It’s believed that the three explorers closed their eyes that evening, and never opened them again.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.760
Their bodies were discovered, one next to the other, in

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.000
November of that year, 7 and a half months afterwards.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.928
In the meantime, Roald Amundsen had returned and won fame and

00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:43.016
glory for becoming the first person to reach the South Pole.

00:21:44.216 --> 00:21:47.836
In fact, this was just one of Roald Amundsen’s achievements.

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:52.196
The others included the navigation of the Northwest Passage, the Northeast

00:21:52.216 --> 00:21:57.006
passage, then floating over the North Pole in an airship in 1926.

00:21:58.329 --> 00:22:05.439
And he too, like Scott in 1912 and many more before and after them, he too would

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:11.599
die an icy death, his plane disappearing in the freezing Barents Sea in 1928.

00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:16.099
So, there you go, the Race to the South Pole.

00:22:16.989 --> 00:22:20.309
On some level, Scott should have easily won.

00:22:20.969 --> 00:22:24.499
He set off first, he was much better funded, he had

00:22:24.499 --> 00:22:27.799
the full apparatus of the British state behind him.

00:22:28.949 --> 00:22:34.809
Amundsen, on the other hand, wasn’t even meant to be there, but he still got

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:40.799
there first, planting his flag and claiming the title for himself and his country.

00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:48.549
There are no doubt many lessons one can take from this, but the one perhaps lighthearted

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:54.909
one that I’ll leave you with is this: never bet against a Norwegian on skis.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:01.544
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the Race to the North Pole.

00:23:01.834 --> 00:23:04.934
I hope it's been an interesting one, and even if you knew

00:23:04.954 --> 00:23:08.500
about this story before, well I hope it was fun to revisit it.

00:23:09.314 --> 00:23:12.084
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:15.074
We do actually have a fair share of listeners in Norway,

00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:18.774
so tell me, what is the modern legacy of Roald Amundsen?

00:23:19.644 --> 00:23:23.754
Oh, and if you liked this episode and you would like some more on Arctic

00:23:23.754 --> 00:23:28.974
or Antarctic exploration, be sure to check out episode number 398 on Ernest

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:34.464
Shackleton and the one before this, episode 417 on the race to the North Pole.

00:23:35.154 --> 00:23:38.844
And if you want some African exploration, check out the mini-series

00:23:38.844 --> 00:23:42.124
we just made on the quest to find the source of the River Nile.

00:23:42.844 --> 00:23:47.444
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:23:48.004 --> 00:23:53.304
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:17.606
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:21.636
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:28.236
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the War of the

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:35.046
Currents, an epic battle to standardise the electricity system in 19th century America.

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:40.146
Now, you might not have woken up this morning and thought “I want to know about

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:46.076
electrical currents”, but stick with me, this story is anything but boring.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:53.656
We’ll encounter brilliant geniuses, vicious rivalries, huge fortunes, the creation of

00:00:53.656 --> 00:01:00.106
the electric chair and why you didn’t want to be a stray dog in 19th century America.

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:07.196
OK then, let’s plug ourselves in to the story of the War of the Currents.

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:15.986
Before we get started with the story, I’d like to quickly go over DC and AC, as these are

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:22.526
two terms that you’ll be hearing a lot, and are vital for an understanding of the story.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.936
DC stands for direct current.

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:32.976
It's a unidirectional, one directional flow of electrical charge.

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:38.426
AC, on the other hand, stands for alternating current.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:43.106
AC changes directional multiple times every second.

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:49.616
Today, AC is what you get out of your power sockets at home, whereas

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:55.466
DC is generally used for batteries and sensitive electronics.

00:01:56.546 --> 00:02:04.576
To transform AC to DC, for example for smartphones and laptops, you need a transformer.

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:09.576
You may not have noticed this before, but if you have a laptop, you

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:14.906
might see that the wire goes through a box - in there is the transformer.

00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:22.736
Now, we don’t need to have a detailed knowledge about the science behind all of this, the important

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:30.826
thing to remember is that AC and DC are fundamentally different ways of transporting electricity.

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:39.666
With that clarification out of the way, we can get on with our story, which starts in 1870s America.

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:48.446
This period was known as the Gilded, or Golden Age - a period of economic boom and industrial

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:55.236
and technological growth that took place after the end of the American Civil War in 1865.

00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:01.776
While the Gilded Age was a period of prosperity, growing fortunes,

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:07.256
leaps in technology and opportunity, it was also tainted by political

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:12.666
corruption and the accumulation of huge amounts of wealth by a handful of

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:18.056
industrialists, politicians and bankers at the expense of the working classes.

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:25.636
The War of the Currents was not just a battle to electrify America, it also pitted

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:31.976
some of the century’s most excellent minds against one another and exposed the darker

00:03:31.986 --> 00:03:38.856
side of the Gilded Age - avoidable deaths, smear campaigns and political corruption.

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:43.636
So, let’s take a look at how the War of the Currents got

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:48.346
started and find out more about the key figures involved.

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:54.556
Now, before electricity, life was obviously very different.

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:59.306
Perhaps one of the most visible differences, or you could say

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.716
invisible differences, was how people would light the world.

00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:09.236
The options available to provide light were candles, oil and gas.

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:12.826
Essentially, burning something to create light.

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:18.976
After the discovery of electricity in the early 1800s, the race

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:24.166
was on to find a way to channel this new, amazing technology.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:29.696
The first popular electric light was invented by an Englishman called

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:34.983
Humphry Davy, a man who was from Cornwall, the county of Southwest

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.693
England, which you may remember from our episode on smugglers.

00:04:40.457 --> 00:04:46.067
Davy wasn’t a smuggler, but he did invent a form of lighting called “arc

00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:50.757
lighting”, which was very different from the light bulbs we think of today.

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:58.357
Arc lighting uses a special bulb in which two carbon electrodes are placed close together.

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:05.217
When the bulb is supplied with electricity, the current passes through the air between

00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:10.841
the two electrodes creating an electric arc which gives off a very bright light.

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:17.717
The problem was that arc lighting required a very high voltage, over

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:23.607
3,000 volts, to work properly, making it very dangerous to work with.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:29.937
For reference, today’s standard supply voltage is between 220

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:35.627
and 240 volts for most of the world and 120 volts in the USA.

00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:41.587
To top it off, this arc lighting also required regular

00:05:41.587 --> 00:05:46.767
maintenance, it buzzed constantly and it was a major fire hazard.

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:48.187
Pretty scary stuff.

00:05:49.357 --> 00:05:54.947
As you can imagine, arc lighting was unsuitable for indoor

00:05:54.947 --> 00:06:00.217
use and was mainly used for street lighting and factory yards.

00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:08.877
Clearly, arc lighting was not going to replace indoor gas lights, oil lamps or candles anytime soon.

00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:13.587
The race to invent and manufacture an electrical light

00:06:13.587 --> 00:06:17.857
bulb for indoor use had been ongoing for over 50 years.

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:25.437
While breakthroughs had been made, it wasn’t until 1789 that a 31-year-old inventor by

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:31.577
the name of Thomas Edison found a practical solution, with his incandescent light bulb.

00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:38.327
Edison will appear a lot in this story, but if you’re interested in learning more about

00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:45.067
his life, our last member-only episode, number 257, goes into that in great detail.

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:49.317
If you haven’t listened to that one, Edison was already

00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:53.317
a well-known inventor and a rich man by this time.

00:06:53.887 --> 00:06:59.797
He had already invented an almost magical-seeming device that could record and

00:06:59.817 --> 00:07:05.427
playback sound called the phonograph, but then he set his sights on something bigger.

00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:12.067
The big, hairy, almost holy goal of lighting every house in America.

00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:19.057
He started with the actual light itself, and invented and patented an electric

00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:23.457
light bulb that was suitable for indoor use - the incandescent light bulb.

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:30.707
Incandescent, by the way, means something that emits, or gives out, light when it is heated.

00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:36.777
Edison’s light bulb was by no means the first incandescent light bulb but

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:41.697
it was the most practical that had ever been made, as it was relatively

00:07:41.737 --> 00:07:48.607
inexpensive to produce and it had a long burn time of over 1,200 hours.

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:56.267
It’s important to note that Edison’s light bulb ran at a low voltage of 110 volts

00:07:56.347 --> 00:08:02.017
on a direct current supply, the direct current part is very important for our story.

00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:09.557
Now, a light bulb is great, but it’s pretty useless unless you have electricity to power it.

00:08:10.397 --> 00:08:17.087
So, Edison set himself the task of building the infrastructure to get electricity

00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:22.747
into people’s houses, so that they could buy and then power his light bulbs.

00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:30.147
As his bulbs were made to run on DC current, he developed a DC supply

00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:34.987
system complete with electric meters to measure his clients’ usage.

00:08:35.827 --> 00:08:41.627
Edison had a huge incentive to ensure that DC, not AC,

00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:45.447
was adopted as the standard current across the country.

00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:49.947
Just think about the scale of things for one moment.

00:08:50.357 --> 00:08:53.707
Edison owned the patents for the incandescent light

00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:57.287
bulb that was initially designed to run on DC power.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:04.657
He also sold his DC systems to cities to power these lights and he held all of the

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:11.317
key patents for DC power distribution and he controlled all technical development.

00:09:12.107 --> 00:09:14.894
One word springs to mind: a monopoly.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.630
Edison stood to make billions upon billions as the country, and indeed

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:27.660
the entire world, began to electrify its houses, workplaces and streets.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:33.640
And all of this money depended on his patented direct current system being

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.870
standardised, being adopted as the standard current for electricity supply.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:46.240
Imagine if there was one individual who would profit from every part of the creation of artificial

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.340
light, and this gives you an idea of the scale of what Edison was on the cusp of achieving.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.160
This point is important to bear in mind as it will go some way to explaining the

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.634
dishonourable tactics that Edison would later use to discredit his competitors.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:11.680
The reality was that DC, direct current, simply wasn’t up to the task, it wasn’t suitable.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.390
When transmitted over distances longer than one and half

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.580
kilometres, substantial amounts of energy were lost.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.770
And if you want to transmit power across the third largest

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.350
country in the world, this is evidently a bit of a problem.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.230
For Edison’s dream to come true, there would need to be power stations in

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.980
every town on every street corner, and this simply wasn’t a possibility.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.420
Another problem with DC, with direct current, was that

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.560
it was not easily converted to higher or lower voltages.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.280
As DC ran at a constant rate, if another voltage supply

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.130
was required, separate lines would need to be installed.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:05.800
While Edison never lost faith, at least publicly, in the superiority of his DC

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.400
power supply system, he did become aware of some of the limitations quite early on.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:18.100
These faults inspired Edison to offer a substantial financial reward to any

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.670
of his employees who could improve upon the performance of his DC machinery.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.350
And it’s here that we’ll meet another character whose name you

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.920
may well have heard of, and one who will be central to our story.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:41.090
He was a young Serbian genius who had just moved to America, the legendary inventor Nikola Tesla.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.410
By the way, our next member-only episode is going to be a deep dive on the life

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.720
of Nikola Tesla, that’s going to be episode number 259, so do give that one

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.920
a listen if you’d like to know more about this eccentric but brilliant man.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.680
Tesla had been fascinated with electricity since he was a child, and had long

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.280
been working on a plan to improve the DC motors that he had studied at university.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.750
He was a bit younger than Edison, 9 years younger to be precise, and had started working

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:23.350
for Edison’s company first in Paris, and then when he emigrated to America as a 28-year-old.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:31.880
Tesla, as an Edison employee at the time, shared his plans for an AC motor that was far

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:38.800
superior to Edison’s DC ones, and he was hopeful for the reward that Edison had promised.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:45.740
Unfortunately for Tesla, and you could say unfortunately for Edison, he wasn’t given the reward,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.720
and was instead told that the prize money was a joke, and he didn’t understand American humour.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.240
Understandably annoyed at being turned down by Edison, Tesla

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.550
promptly left Edison’s company and started up his own company.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.560
What Edison perhaps didn’t realise, though, is that

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.890
Tesla was onto something with his ideas for an AC motor.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.740
Alternating current, or AC, didn't have the same problems as DC.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:26.080
AC could be transmitted over long distances then transformed with very little energy loss.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.790
This meant fewer power plants would be needed, saving a huge amount of money.

00:13:33.031 --> 00:13:38.430
What’s more, AC used thinner copper lines, saving even more money.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.360
AC, put shortly, was far more efficient and cheaper.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.510
It could, in theory, supply rural areas and small towns, all of the

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.660
places where it was just impossible to supply DC and still make a profit.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:00.365
Plus AC could also be stepped up or down to other voltages

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.920
as needed without the need for separate supply lines.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.240
However, AC still needed some innovations and improvements to enable it

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.940
to work as a functioning electrical supply and a direct competitor to DC.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.580
What’s more, Tesla may have been a genius, but at the time he was a young, unconnected

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:29.690
immigrant without the funding or business knowledge to market and produce his AC motor.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.870
This is where we meet our third and final character, a certain George Westinghouse.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:44.450
George Westinghouse was a Pittsburgh industrialist and a savvy businessman who had made his

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:51.562
fortune in the railway industry but was now trying his hand at the next big thing: electricity.

00:14:52.298 --> 00:14:57.518
He was quite a discrete character, unlike his soon-to-be rival Edison who

00:14:57.658 --> 00:15:02.368
enjoyed his time in the limelight, and his status as a celebrity inventor.

00:15:03.348 --> 00:15:09.728
Westinghouse was a little bit of a latecomer to the electricity sector, but with his

00:15:09.728 --> 00:15:17.178
good business head, he soon realised the advantages of AC over DC for power supply.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:23.680
Plus, with some modifications, incandescent lighting, Edison’s

00:15:23.708 --> 00:15:28.478
indoor lighting, could be made to run off either AC or DC.

00:15:29.818 --> 00:15:33.908
In short, Westinghouse realised that he could build a truly

00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:39.508
competitive AC system rather than simply copying Edison’s DC system.

00:15:40.448 --> 00:15:44.058
Doing so would have been barely competitive and would have

00:15:44.058 --> 00:15:48.388
still needed various patents to get around Edison’s monopoly.

00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:55.048
What’s more, as Edison was struggling to build enough power plants and could only connect

00:15:55.078 --> 00:16:01.618
properties within a one-and-a-half kilometre radius from his plants, Westinghouse could easily

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:09.278
supply all of Edison’s unsupplied city customers, as well as those in small towns and rural areas.

00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:12.888
It was a big and bold idea.

00:16:13.488 --> 00:16:19.238
To make it come true, Westinghouse had the cash, investors and the business skills.

00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:25.348
But to create and develop the AC motors and generators necessary to get his

00:16:25.488 --> 00:16:31.308
project off the drawing board and make it a reality, he needed Tesla’s AC motor.

00:16:32.438 --> 00:16:36.188
Tesla and Westinghouse came together after Tesla left

00:16:36.198 --> 00:16:39.998
Edison’s company, after he was refused the bonus.

00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:44.558
Westinghouse went on to licence Tesla’s patents for

00:16:44.558 --> 00:16:48.548
his AC system, pitting him directly against Edison.

00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:54.968
In 1886 the Westinghouse Electrical Company had built the first

00:16:55.078 --> 00:16:59.598
commercial AC power system in America, in Buffalo, New York.

00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:05.428
By the end of 1887, just one year later, Westinghouse had

00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:12.128
68 AC power stations compared to Edison’s 121 DC stations.

00:17:13.448 --> 00:17:19.438
Remember, AC stations could supply many more customers over a greater area.

00:17:20.528 --> 00:17:26.163
To make matters worse for Edison, another electrical supply company, Thompson-Houston,

00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:33.750
had also muscled in on the scene with 22 power stations supplying both AC and DC.

00:17:35.307 --> 00:17:39.237
Other smaller companies also got involved in supplying electricity,

00:17:39.557 --> 00:17:44.077
resulting in numerous legal battles with Edison over his patents.

00:17:45.547 --> 00:17:50.507
Mired in legal battles and struggling to make any significant improvements

00:17:50.507 --> 00:17:56.497
to his DC distribution system, Edison was losing out on power and profits.

00:17:57.317 --> 00:18:02.447
However, having built up his lighting company and light bulbs to be mutually

00:18:02.487 --> 00:18:09.347
inclusive, he was understandably reluctant to admit defeat and switch to AC power.

00:18:10.807 --> 00:18:15.997
As the inventor of the light bulb that all of these other companies were vying to supply

00:18:15.997 --> 00:18:22.397
with power, as well as being considered a veritable “magician” by the public thanks to his

00:18:22.397 --> 00:18:29.327
inventions and research laboratory, Edison did not feel compelled to back down, to give in.

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:36.987
He firmly stood his ground, insisting that DC was better and safer than AC.

00:18:37.877 --> 00:18:39.347
But, he was wrong.

00:18:40.017 --> 00:18:48.067
And as AC continued to grow in popularity, and Edison sensed he might not be able to win the battle

00:18:48.097 --> 00:18:55.487
if he competed fairly, he started to play dirty, his tactics becoming increasingly underhand.

00:18:56.807 --> 00:19:02.747
His primary tactic was to make the public think that AC, the electricity

00:19:02.747 --> 00:19:07.897
system proposed by Westinghouse, was so dangerous that it would kill you.

00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:14.297
In 1886, he publicly declared that Westinghouse would kill someone

00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:20.127
within six months due to the high voltages used in his AC power lines.

00:19:21.137 --> 00:19:27.077
But not content with simply hoping that someone would eventually get electrocuted

00:19:27.287 --> 00:19:34.297
and killed, he wanted a way to demonstrate publicly how dangerous AC electricity was.

00:19:35.437 --> 00:19:39.177
And what better way to do this than getting the US

00:19:39.207 --> 00:19:43.267
government to kill someone with Westinghouse’s electricity?

00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:50.187
How Edison did this was both cunning, clever, and horrible at the same time.

00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:55.127
He managed to persuade politicians that using electricity would be

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:59.677
a more effective way of conducting the death sentence than hanging.

00:20:00.687 --> 00:20:06.137
There was already some knowledge that electricity could kill, because people working

00:20:06.137 --> 00:20:12.277
with electrical wires would sometimes die in an instant after touching a live wire.

00:20:13.487 --> 00:20:17.617
After reports of a drunken man being killed by a live

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:22.077
electricity generator, a New York dentist called Alfred P.

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:27.107
Southwick became interested in the idea of using electricity to kill,

00:20:27.337 --> 00:20:32.257
even publicly electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs to prove his point.

00:20:33.147 --> 00:20:37.057
So politicians thought that electricity could be an

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:41.597
alternative to hanging, and wanted to explore this idea.

00:20:42.657 --> 00:20:46.747
Naturally, they consulted, they asked, the electricity

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:50.397
experts of the day, including Westinghouse and Edison.

00:20:51.407 --> 00:20:57.227
Westinghouse said that he wanted nothing to do with it, as he didn’t agree with capital punishment.

00:20:58.327 --> 00:21:03.037
Edison, on the other hand, recommended that Westinghouse’s AC system

00:21:03.037 --> 00:21:08.267
was used and even came up with the term “Westinghoused” to refer to a

00:21:08.287 --> 00:21:13.077
person who was intentionally or accidentally killed with electricity.

00:21:14.017 --> 00:21:18.767
The government made up its mind, and it was decided to test using

00:21:18.807 --> 00:21:24.217
electricity as opposed to hanging as a way to conduct the death penalty.

00:21:24.857 --> 00:21:28.217
You probably know what I’m talking about: the electric chair.

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:36.517
Westinghouse had refused to sell his AC generators to be used to kill, but Edison made sure

00:21:36.647 --> 00:21:42.737
that a Westinghouse AC generator was used when the first electric chair was being designed.

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:49.627
Edison was secretly paying an electrical engineer called Brown, who would organise the

00:21:49.847 --> 00:21:55.477
purchase of Westinghouse's generators specifically for use with the electric chair.

00:21:56.677 --> 00:22:02.407
Horrified that his electrical machinery was going to be used to kill someone, Westinghouse

00:22:02.457 --> 00:22:08.627
even paid a substantial amount for the chosen convict’s, the criminal’s, appeal.

00:22:09.387 --> 00:22:13.306
This was all to no avail, it had no impact.

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:18.666
William Kremmler, a man convicted of killing his wife, became

00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:23.316
the first person executed by the electric chair in 1890.

00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:30.436
Now, you probably know that even now an electric chair is considered to be a horrific

00:22:30.506 --> 00:22:37.016
and inhumane way to kill someone, but the first execution using it was even worse.

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:44.196
I will spare you the worst details, but suffice it to say that it took ten minutes

00:22:44.366 --> 00:22:49.326
and Westinghouse later commented "They would have done better using an axe".

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:55.606
While Edison was adamant that AC was more dangerous due to the high

00:22:55.606 --> 00:23:00.756
voltages used, both types of current can cause severe injury and death.

00:23:01.836 --> 00:23:08.056
And although Westinghouse’s AC system was forever associated with the electric chair

00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:14.626
in the public’s mind, this didn’t really stop its ascent, stop its rise to the top.

00:23:15.516 --> 00:23:19.576
As AC continued to spread, Edison’s profits fell

00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:23.776
while his legal costs and the copper prices went up.

00:23:24.406 --> 00:23:28.996
Remember DC lines needed more copper than AC ones.

00:23:29.996 --> 00:23:33.646
Given the increasingly gloomy outlook, some of Edison’s

00:23:33.686 --> 00:23:39.316
investors and engineers attempted to convince him to consider AC.

00:23:40.176 --> 00:23:43.826
However, their concerns fell upon deaf ears.

00:23:44.336 --> 00:23:51.736
Edison, not used to being wrong, was adamant that his DC system was superior and he

00:23:51.736 --> 00:23:57.826
was determined to succeed even if it meant continuing to play even dirtier than before.

00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:04.696
He put out adverts and newspaper articles, blamed accidents where workmen were killed by

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:11.396
electricity on Westinghouse, and did anything he could to discredit his rival’s system.

00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:18.676
Despite all of the bad publicity and attacks, the spread of AC couldn’t be stopped.

00:24:18.846 --> 00:24:20.706
It was more efficient and cheaper.

00:24:21.576 --> 00:24:26.626
Westinghouse, and his more cost-efficient AC, won the contract to

00:24:26.626 --> 00:24:32.456
supply electricity to the 1893 World Fair in Chicago, which provided

00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:37.286
an impressive showcase for Tesla and Westinghouse’s AC supply system.

00:24:38.396 --> 00:24:44.256
This was one of the largest displays of electrical power ever created, with hundreds

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:49.666
of lights illuminating, lighting up, the lake and the purpose-built neoclassical

00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:54.456
buildings, while brightly coloured searchlights dazzled across the night sky.

00:24:55.236 --> 00:25:00.586
That very same year the Niagara Falls Power Company awarded Westinghouse the

00:25:00.586 --> 00:25:06.366
contract to generate power from the Niagara Falls with Tesla’s AC induction motor.

00:25:07.196 --> 00:25:12.846
This achievement was largely considered to represent the end of the War of the Currents

00:25:12.956 --> 00:25:19.196
and confirmed AC’s position as the dominant current in the electricity supply industry.

00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:23.006
However, DC didn’t die out completely.

00:25:23.346 --> 00:25:28.326
In fact, DC has been gaining ground in recent years, being better

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:33.450
suited for use with batteries and other sensitive electronic appliances.

00:25:34.645 --> 00:25:41.775
Today, DC is used for electric vehicles, computers, solar panels and LEDs, for example.

00:25:42.705 --> 00:25:46.155
Methods have also been developed to enable us to

00:25:46.365 --> 00:25:50.455
more easily convert DC to higher and lower voltages.

00:25:51.705 --> 00:25:56.465
Thanks to advances in high voltage DC, companies are finding new

00:25:56.465 --> 00:26:01.325
ways to transmit DC over long distances with less energy loss.

00:26:02.135 --> 00:26:07.735
So, while AC may have been declared the winner of War of the Currents at

00:26:07.735 --> 00:26:13.955
the turn of the last century, it looks like DC is here to stay and perhaps

00:26:14.145 --> 00:26:18.725
it may go on to play an even more important role in the years to come.

00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:26.645
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the War of the Currents

00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:31.465
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned a little bit about the history of

00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:37.325
lighting and electricity, as well as some of the people whose inventions have changed the world.

00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:41.245
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:26:41.565 --> 00:26:45.625
Do you think Westinghouse was unfairly targeted by Edison?

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:49.105
Could you imagine living in a world without electricity?

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.800
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.800
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of a three-part

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.195
mini-series on the uncomfortable but important topic of slavery.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:34.515
In part one, in case you missed it, we looked at slavery in antiquity, in the ancient world.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.995
In part three we’ll take a look at modern slavery,

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.345
how slavery in different forms still exists today.

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:47.725
And in this episode, part two, we’ll be talking about the bit in between, perhaps the period in

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:54.585
history most synonymous with the barbarity and inhumanity of slavery: the transatlantic slave trade.

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:59.775
We have a lot to be dealing with in this episode, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:07.505
On the 8th of June, 2020, a small group of people gathered in the English city of Bristol.

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:15.185
They crowded around a bronze statue of a man called Edward Colston, shouting and jeering.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:19.815
They fastened ropes around the statue, which had been standing

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:24.655
in the same place since 1895, and pulled it to the ground.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:31.185
Immediately, people started jumping up and down on the statue, they painted it red,

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:36.355
and then dragged it to the water’s edge, whereupon it was thrown into the river.

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:43.995
Edward Colston, the man in question, had been a celebrated philanthropist, he had given

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:50.175
today’s equivalent of tens of millions of Euros to help the poor in and around Bristol.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:57.015
He was something of a Bristolian hero, and, until recently at least, if you wandered

00:01:57.025 --> 00:02:02.465
around Bristol you would find Colston Tower, Colston Hall, and Colston Street.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:09.035
What a kind man he must have been, you might be thinking, to give all of this money away.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:14.045
But, as you can probably guess, it wasn’t this simple.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:20.405
Colston made his money, a large part of it at least, through trading humans.

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:24.835
He was a member of something called the “Royal African Company”.

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:30.205
Despite its innocent-sounding name, its business was far from it.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:37.225
The Royal African Company, or RAC for short, was a slave trading company.

00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:48.765
Between the years of 1672 and 1731, the RAC made 653 trips across the

00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:53.505
Atlantic, from the west coast of Africa to the British colonies in America.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:03:00.325
On these ships were people ripped from their homes, and sold as slaves.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.165
The numbers here are quite astounding.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:15.705
A total of 187,697 people got on to the ships of the RAC, with 38,497

00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:21.915
of those dying en route, so more than 1 in 5 not surviving the journey.

00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:26.645
Of those that were lucky enough to survive, they would

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.885
find a life of backbreaking labour ahead of them.

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:35.495
No doubt for many, there were times that they wished they had not survived the trip.

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:43.025
It was from the trade of these people, African slaves, that Colston’s riches originated.

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:49.655
The money might have eventually flowed towards so called “good” causes, in terms

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:54.715
of hospitals and dwellings for the poor, but the fact that it had come from

00:03:54.715 --> 00:04:00.645
this most inhumane of businesses meant that it was forever tainted, stained by

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:05.245
the blood and suffering of those who had been sold into slavery to create it.

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:13.095
Now, Colston is just one slave trader, today’s episode isn’t only about him, nor

00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:17.095
is it about Britain’s struggle to deal with its history of people like Colston.

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:24.272
Instead we are going to explore the transatlantic slave trade more broadly, how did it get

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:31.102
started, how did it work from a practical basis, and what finally brought it all to an end.

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:36.384
As to the question of how it got started, as you will know already,

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:41.074
and as we spoke about in part one of this mini-series, the practice of

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:45.924
slavery has been in existence since the most ancient of civilizations.

00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:52.784
But it tended to be relatively localised: invade a neighbouring city and take its

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:58.384
citizens slaves, rack up large debts and have to sell yourself into slavery, and so on.

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:05.444
It was a fundamental part of many ancient civilisations, it kept the wheels turning,

00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:11.454
but it was not industrialised, it was not its own multi-billion dollar industry.

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:19.844
And moving forward into the Middle Ages, the period of European history that is defined as widely

00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:27.204
as being from 500 AD right through to 1500, slavery in Europe at least took a different shape.

00:05:27.924 --> 00:05:33.764
Or rather, slavery gave way to the feudal system, a system in which there were lords and

00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:41.234
peasants, not masters and slaves, but on a day-to-day basis the reality wasn’t so different.

00:05:42.744 --> 00:05:46.294
While all of this was happening, there was another area of the

00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:49.724
world where the slave trade was really just getting started.

00:05:50.714 --> 00:05:57.254
Arabs from North Africa had started to travel south, across the Sahara, and had found a new

00:05:57.254 --> 00:06:02.824
source of people that they could take back with them to be sold as slaves in the Middle East.

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:10.454
African tribes, from East to West, realised that they could attack a nearby tribe, take its people

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:16.544
prisoner, and sell these captives to Arab slave traders from the north for a healthy profit.

00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:20.644
And we are talking in huge numbers here.

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:27.754
One historian, a man called Paul Lovejoy, estimates that 6 million Africans were

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:33.304
sold into slavery and transported across the Sahara by Arab slave traders between

00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:39.424
the years 650 and 1500, before the transatlantic slave trade really got started.

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:46.814
Now, we aren’t talking about the Arab slave trade today, but the reason to mention it is

00:06:46.814 --> 00:06:52.454
to underline that the practice of Sub Saharan Africans being sold into slavery, often by

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:58.454
their own fellow men, dates back far longer than some people are aware of, or care to admit.

00:06:59.754 --> 00:07:04.204
So, what was it that really caused the transatlantic slave trade to start when it did?

00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:09.884
The unfortunate reality is that the transatlantic slave trade was first and

00:07:09.884 --> 00:07:14.714
foremost a question of economics, it is a story of commercial interests.

00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:21.304
Humans were treated as commodities, goods to be bought and sold, their price

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:26.534
based on how much value someone could extract from them before they died.

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:31.774
It is clearly horrific to put it in these terms, but it does help

00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:36.574
explain how and why the transatlantic slave trade took place when it did.

00:07:37.914 --> 00:07:40.524
It was a solution to a commercial problem.

00:07:41.684 --> 00:07:49.224
European countries had goods to sell: textiles, clothing, manufactured goods, guns and rum.

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:56.624
Their colonies in the new world also had goods to sell: mainly sugar, tobacco, and coffee.

00:07:57.674 --> 00:08:00.664
The problem was that the colonies in the new world

00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:04.124
didn’t need what the European countries wanted to sell.

00:08:05.264 --> 00:08:08.364
What they needed was people, workers.

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:14.284
The crops that they were growing: sugar, tobacco, coffee, and later cotton,

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:19.324
were all very intensive crops, they required a lot of manual labour.

00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:23.404
There weren’t enough European settlers who were prepared to do this work,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.410
and the indigenous population had been decimated by the European settlers,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.120
so there was a serious labour shortage in these new world colonies.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:39.340
So, what the European countries needed was to find someone they could trade their goods

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.970
with, and in exchange, they would receive something the new world colonies needed.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.530
They needed to find a source of people.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.160
It just so happened that Sub Saharan Africa, after centuries of local

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.330
rulers attacking rival tribes and selling their people into slavery

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.200
to Arabs from the north, they were well-practised in the slave trade.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.730
So, a sort of three-way trade system was set up, a “triangular trade route”.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.730
Ships set sail south from Europe, to the west coast of

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.710
Africa, full to the brim with textiles, guns and rum.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:24.161
These goods would be traded for slaves, who would be packed into ships and sent across the Atlantic.

00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:31.031
Upon their arrival in the Americas, the ships would be unloaded, those lucky enough to

00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:35.271
survive the trip would be sold to work in the sugar, tobacco and coffee plantations.

00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:41.261
And the money made from the sale of the slaves would go into buying sugar, tobacco, and

00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:46.721
coffee, which would be loaded onto the ship, and taken back to Europe to be sold at a profit.

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:52.881
Of course, this is a gross simplification, and we’ll go into some of

00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:58.201
the nuances in due course, but the point is to demonstrate how various

00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:02.411
intertwined economic interests drove the transatlantic slave trade.

00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:08.321
Textiles, guns and rum from Europe were traded with slaves, which were traded with sugar,

00:10:08.321 --> 00:10:13.021
tobacco and cotton, which were brought back to Europe, and the vicious circle continued.

00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:18.660
Now, let’s focus on the so-called “Middle Passage” of this

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.850
trade, the transport of slaves from Africa to the Americas.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.900
And let’s first talk about where exactly these slaves came from.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.500
Geographically, we are talking about Sub Saharan Africa,

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.540
and principally the Western part of Sub Saharan Africa.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.480
Modern day Nigeria, Gambia and Ghana, but slaves were

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.120
taken from almost every region of west and central Africa.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.330
Warring tribes would take people from the losing tribe as prisoners, sell them

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.580
to slave traders, who would march them to the coastal ports, where they would

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.690
be sold to the European traders, who would pack them off to the Americas.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.500
While originally people might have been captured and sold into slavery

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:11.050
as a byproduct of wars and local rivalries, as the demand for slaves

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:17.030
increased, the capture of slaves became a major driver for war and conflict.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.600
And while there is debate among historians about whether African kingdoms actually

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.430
went to war with each other for the express purpose of capturing slaves, the fact

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.030
that going to war might mean that you had the double advantage of removing your

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:39.360
rivals by literally sending them thousands of kilometres across the oceans AND that

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.540
you could get paid well from it, well this certainly changed the regional dynamics.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.160
And to make matters worse, one of the goods that the

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.940
Europeans would sell in exchange for slaves was guns.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.760
The region was flooded with powerful weapons, which changed

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.570
regional dynamics and made the capture of slaves even easier.

00:12:03.073 --> 00:12:07.683
Now, once they were captured, slaves were often forced to march hundreds,

00:12:07.803 --> 00:12:12.523
even thousands of kilometres towards the sea, their hands and necks bound.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:19.293
When they arrived at the coast, like animals waiting to be sold at market, they would be

00:12:19.293 --> 00:12:25.323
held in large forts, sort of open air prisons, waiting to be sold to the highest bidder.

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:31.073
And sold they would be, and packed onto large slave ships that

00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:34.413
would then make the treacherous journey across The Atlantic.

00:12:35.933 --> 00:12:41.133
Now, the journey itself wasn’t treacherous for the ship; technological

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:45.783
developments had meant that crossing The Atlantic was pretty safe, and there

00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:49.953
was little danger of the ship getting lost or capsizing in the high seas.

00:12:50.983 --> 00:12:55.833
The danger was for the slaves on board, who were packed into the tightest of

00:12:55.833 --> 00:13:01.663
spaces, normally clapped up in irons, and given precious little to eat or drink.

00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:08.493
It is no surprise that one in five died during the six to eight week journey.

00:13:10.063 --> 00:13:15.283
Now, I imagine that you will be familiar with lots of the horrors of this trip, and of what

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:21.763
life as a slave was like, so instead of repeating general points I’m sure you already know,

00:13:22.173 --> 00:13:26.313
we are going to talk about some lesser known elements of the transatlantic slave trade.

00:13:27.863 --> 00:13:32.763
Firstly, it is a common misconception, perhaps given the relatively high

00:13:32.763 --> 00:13:35.923
proportion of the population that can trace their families back to people who

00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:40.523
were enslaved, that most slaves were sent to what is now the United States.

00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:48.493
In fact, only around 5% of all slaves were sent to the modern day United States.

00:13:49.603 --> 00:13:55.493
The remainder were split between the Caribbean and Brazil, with the lion’s share going to Brazil

00:13:56.813 --> 00:14:02.323
But if up to 33% of the total population of America were slaves, which

00:14:02.463 --> 00:14:07.143
it was in 1750, you might be thinking something doesn’t add up, right?

00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:14.623
Well, this is due to the fact that life as a slave in the American colonies was slightly better,

00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:21.563
or perhaps I should say not quite as absolutely terrible, as it was in the Caribbean or in Brazil.

00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:27.583
For a slave sent to Brazil, it was almost a literal death sentence.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:35.803
The average slave who ended up in Brazil lasted only between 4 and 7 years, meaning

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:41.593
that the life expectancy for a Brazilian slave was a miserable twenty three years.

00:14:42.773 --> 00:14:47.413
In the plantations of Brazil, slaves were literally worked to death

00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:52.133
and then replaced, bought, forced to work until they dropped, and

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:55.913
then replaced by another unlucky slave who would face the same fate.

00:14:57.483 --> 00:15:01.613
In North America, life for a slave was slightly better,

00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:05.693
in that the average slave lived to their 33rd birthday.

00:15:07.383 --> 00:15:11.773
This was not necessarily out of some great compassion on the part of

00:15:11.773 --> 00:15:16.403
their owners, but rather that slaves were business assets to be protected.

00:15:17.213 --> 00:15:21.523
It didn’t make good business sense to replace them every few years if you

00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:24.863
could treat them slightly better and they would continue to live for longer.

00:15:26.223 --> 00:15:29.553
What’s more, if they didn’t die, they might reproduce,

00:15:29.863 --> 00:15:32.943
have children, meaning that your investment would multiply.

00:15:33.813 --> 00:15:36.653
And this is what happened in America.

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:42.413
Soon enough, the slave population was self-sustaining, meaning that,

00:15:42.913 --> 00:15:46.933
unlike in Brazil, new batches of slaves didn’t need to be imported

00:15:46.933 --> 00:15:51.313
every week, as new young slaves-to-be were being born in the country.

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:57.853
Now, I hope you will forgive me for talking in such inhumane terms, but this

00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:02.923
was the reality of how slave traders and slave owners thought about the people

00:16:02.923 --> 00:16:08.433
that they were buying, selling, and then controlling: they were goods, assets to

00:16:08.433 --> 00:16:13.263
be put to work, not human beings with a heart, a soul and a mind of their own.

00:16:14.823 --> 00:16:18.383
Of course, this dehumanisation of tens of millions

00:16:18.383 --> 00:16:21.923
of people was underpinned by racism and prejudice.

00:16:22.623 --> 00:16:26.713
Racism was both a cause and a consequence of the slave trade.

00:16:28.173 --> 00:16:33.643
Black Africans were seen as inferior to their white masters, lower in the racial

00:16:33.643 --> 00:16:40.023
hierarchy, and like Plato in Ancient Greece, it was “natural” for them to be enslaved.

00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:47.923
And as millions of Black Africans were enslaved, and countries like the USA developed with

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:53.833
this shared memory of slavery, this perpetuated racial prejudice that still exists today.

00:16:54.483 --> 00:16:57.343
So, both cause and consequence.

00:16:58.783 --> 00:17:05.053
Now, clearly, this is an incredibly complicated and sensitive topic, still raw

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:09.603
because of the scale of the slave trade, the fact that tens, hundreds of millions of

00:17:09.603 --> 00:17:14.773
people even, can trace their family lines back to people who were slaves, millions

00:17:14.773 --> 00:17:20.383
more can find evidence of ancestors who owned slaves, and the fact that the world

00:17:20.383 --> 00:17:25.383
we live in today still bears the signs and effects of the transatlantic slave trade.

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:34.213
It is a topic that is easy to simplify, but when we look closer it is full of contradictions.

00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:40.093
Yes, people like Edward Colston made fortunes buying and

00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:43.793
selling slaves, but so did many African tribal leaders.

00:17:44.623 --> 00:17:49.593
Yes, by some estimates over 10 million Black Africans were sold into

00:17:49.593 --> 00:17:54.773
slavery and transported over the Atlantic, but almost as many went

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:58.853
north, sold to Arab slave traders, destined for the Middle East.

00:18:00.593 --> 00:18:06.163
And hundreds of years before the first ship set sail across the Atlantic, and more than 100

00:18:06.183 --> 00:18:11.913
years after the last ship left, slavery was still going on in a range of African states.

00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:16.233
In fact, slavery wasn’t made a criminal offence in

00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:22.253
Mauritania until 2007, after the first iPhone was released.

00:18:23.823 --> 00:18:29.093
The point is that the transatlantic slave trade is incredibly complicated, a mishmash of

00:18:29.113 --> 00:18:34.723
economic interests combining with racism, exploitation, and an utter lack of humanity.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:41.368
What is unfortunately incredibly simple is the huge human cost.

00:18:42.608 --> 00:18:48.418
An estimated 12 to 15 million people ripped from their homeland and transported

00:18:48.438 --> 00:18:53.278
across the ocean, one in five of whom would die on the journey across.

00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:59.178
For those who made it, a short, miserable life awaited them, in the worst of

00:18:59.178 --> 00:19:04.038
cases, no more than three years, with practically every waking minute of that

00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:09.498
short time filled with backbreaking labour under awful conditions, for no pay.

00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:15.398
It is hard to find a darker stain on humanity than the transatlantic slave trade.

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:22.010
And perhaps an even more tragic aspect to consider is that a significant driver of

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:28.278
it was the European pursuit of commodities like coffee, tobacco, and sugar – luxuries

00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:32.798
that, while they make our lives a bit more pleasurable, are certainly not essentials.

00:19:34.058 --> 00:19:41.081
But in the grand houses of London or Paris or Amsterdam, the ladies and gentlemen sipped their

00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:47.101
coffee and smoked their cigars, and enjoyed sugar from the Caribbean plantations, harvested

00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:52.841
thanks to the backbreaking unpaid labour of African slaves, with the final product enjoyed

00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:58.681
without a thought spared for the blood, sweat and injustice that went into producing it.

00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:05.091
OK then, that is it for part two, today's episode on the

00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:08.631
sensitive but important issue of transatlantic slave trade.

00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:12.801
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that even though I’m sure this is something

00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:16.611
that we all know quite a bit about already, well I hope you've learnt something new.

00:20:17.481 --> 00:20:22.001
As a reminder, this was part two, so keep a lookout for part three on this mini-series,

00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:26.631
where we will be looking at the important and current issue of modern day slavery.

00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:32.151
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:37.351

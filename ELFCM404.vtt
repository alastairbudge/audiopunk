Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.119
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.969
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:26.657
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a family called the Vanderbilts.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.989
It’s a story of how one family went from almost literal slavery

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.349
to being the richest in the world, before losing it all.

00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:41.442
OK then, the rise and fall of the Vanderbilts.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:47.528
In 1650, a Dutch farmer set sail across the Atlantic,

00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:52.238
hoping to find a new life in the so-called “New World”.

00:00:53.298 --> 00:00:55.288
His name was Jan Aertson.

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:59.798
In all probability, he didn’t pay for his boat ticket.

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:06.538
Instead, he would have signed a contract to work for free for a few years when he got there.

00:01:07.498 --> 00:01:10.988
In exchange, he would have been given a ticket to a new

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:16.108
life, but only after paying off his debt in blood and sweat.

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:23.628
He was what’s called an indentured servant, he was only one rung up from a slave.

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:29.938
He settled in New Amsterdam, the city that would come to be called New York.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:38.158
He lived a humble life as a farmer, and it’s believed that he died in around 1705.

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:40.658
Not much more is known about him.

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:49.208
As he lay on his deathbed, having lived a relatively long but impoverished life in “New

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:55.248
Netherland”, one imagines his thoughts might have turned to his children and grandchildren.

00:01:56.778 --> 00:01:58.298
What kind of lives would they lead?

00:01:58.878 --> 00:02:01.588
Would they find the riches and prosperity in the

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.758
New World that their father and grandfather had not?

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:11.138
Little did Jan know that his decision to cross the Atlantic

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:15.158
would result in the creation of the richest family in America.

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:20.048
Or at least, the richest family in America at one point in

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:24.548
time, as it was a family that would go on to lose it all.

00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:29.788
This wealth creation all got started with Jan’s

00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:35.838
great-great-great-grandson, Cornelius Vanderbilt, who was born in 1794.

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:42.548
He left school when he was a mere 11 years old, and started to work with his

00:02:42.548 --> 00:02:47.498
father, who had a small boat that transported passengers around New York harbour.

00:02:48.978 --> 00:02:54.828
As with many other American tycoons of the 19th century, it didn’t take long for

00:02:54.858 --> 00:03:01.858
Cornelius Vanderbilt to branch out into business on his own, and he started his own ferry

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:08.238
service at the age of 16, transporting passengers between Staten Island and Manhattan.

00:03:09.768 --> 00:03:14.928
He was reportedly so hard-working and enthusiastic that the people working

00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:20.658
on other boats called him “The Commodore”, which is a high rank in the navy.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:25.238
It was meant to be a bit of a joke, but the nickname

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:29.098
stuck; he would be known as The Commodore his entire life.

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:36.098
Now, we could go through The Commodore’s business career in intricate detail, going through

00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:41.548
how he built his empire, but we’re not going to do that, as there are much more interesting

00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:46.888
things to talk about than the chronology and the ins and outs of how he made his millions.

00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:55.092
Long story short, this 16-year-old boy proved to be a shrewd and cut-throat businessman.

00:03:55.862 --> 00:03:59.552
He worked extremely hard, was not afraid to hammer the

00:03:59.552 --> 00:04:04.252
competition, and, like the subject of our previous episode, J.D.

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:10.862
Rockefeller, he used all of the profits his businesses made to reinvest and grow his operations.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:20.222
His business was transport, essentially, first boats and then much later on expanding into railways.

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:26.652
He offered low-cost fares to passengers, would undercut his competitors,

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:31.342
and always made sure that his boats delivered great value for money.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:37.702
He was, of course, also very much in the right place at the right time.

00:04:39.052 --> 00:04:43.842
The expansion of his business coincided with the California gold rush,

00:04:44.182 --> 00:04:49.432
and a huge migration of people from the east to the west coast of America.

00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:58.432
Yes, it was possible to go overland, but it was much easier, quicker and cheaper to go by boat.

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:03.222
Cornelius Vanderbilt, or should I say “The Commodore”,

00:05:03.682 --> 00:05:06.942
was perfectly poised to take advantage of this.

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:14.112
His ships would take people to Panama or Nicaragua, where they would cross on land or

00:05:14.282 --> 00:05:19.322
up small rivers, then there would be another ship waiting for them on the other side.

00:05:20.832 --> 00:05:25.792
Although he made a fortune with his shipping company, it would be in an adjacent

00:05:25.812 --> 00:05:31.562
industry that he turned this fortune into, by some measures, the largest in the world.

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:38.532
Starting in the late 1840s, Vanderbilt began buying up railway companies.

00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:47.662
And by the time of his death in 1877, it’s estimated that he owned 40% of the railroads in America.

00:05:49.172 --> 00:05:53.852
As you might expect, this turned him into a very rich man.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:57.692
In fact, the richest man in America at one point.

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:06.572
By one estimate, he was worth $105 million, which is about $3 billion in today’s money.

00:06:07.472 --> 00:06:13.152
Now, in the modern era of billionaires being two a penny, of there being a lot of them,

00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:18.852
$3 billion dollars might not sound like that much, but let’s look at it in another way.

00:06:20.332 --> 00:06:26.032
At the time of his death, Vanderbilt was worth over 1% of US GDP.

00:06:26.842 --> 00:06:32.560
If someone today controlled that much, they would be worth around $300 billion.

00:06:33.482 --> 00:06:39.072
It’s not as much of a fortune as JD Rockefeller would go on to accumulate, but it is

00:06:39.112 --> 00:06:44.312
pretty substantial, so much money that it would be literally impossible to spend it all.

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:48.532
Actually, we’ll see in a minute whether that last part is true.

00:06:49.672 --> 00:06:51.372
So, what happened next?

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:55.562
Well, let me first tell you a little bit about what we know

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:59.082
of the character of Cornelius Vanderbilt, of The Commodore.

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:06.072
This is important as you might be able to make some guesses about how this impacted

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:11.542
his children and grandchildren, and it’s also a fun thought exercise to think

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:16.212
about what he might have thought about the subsequent actions of his descendents.

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:25.252
Despite his huge wealth and riches, Cornelius Vanderbilt lived a relatively modest life.

00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:31.642
He worked very hard, and the only luxury he allowed himself was racehorses.

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:37.162
He was also, by all accounts, not a particularly nice man.

00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:42.542
He married his cousin and they went on to have thirteen children, but

00:07:42.802 --> 00:07:47.452
he would reportedly frequently cheat on his wife with prostitutes, and

00:07:47.522 --> 00:07:52.162
he even sent her to a mental asylum when she refused to move house.

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:59.182
For most of his life he was utterly uninterested in his children, especially his daughters.

00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:06.962
He also had little time for his sons, considering them to be too stupid to have any involvement

00:08:06.962 --> 00:08:13.172
in his business, and it was only later in life that he came to have any trust in their abilities.

00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:18.168
It was his oldest son, William, or “Billy” for short,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.002
that he ended up trusting to take over from him.

00:08:22.412 --> 00:08:29.142
And in his will he left 95% of his wealth to Billy, leaving the rest to be

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:34.382
distributed between the 10 other surviving children, one son and 9 daughters.

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:43.529
Although 5% of $105 million is still a pretty sizable inheritance, understandably, the

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:50.309
children who had to fight over this last slice were a little miffed, confused and upset.

00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:55.069
They even tried to contest the will, saying that their

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:57.849
father had not been mentally fit when he made it.

00:08:59.098 --> 00:09:04.119
It didn’t work, and the family’s riches passed to Billy and his children.

00:09:05.349 --> 00:09:11.589
Now, Billy, although he was initially criticised as being slow and unintelligent

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:16.539
by his father, he proved to be quite the opposite after his father’s death.

00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:24.429
He made some savvy investments, he wasn’t initially a lavish spender, and by the time of his

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:31.149
death a mere 9 years after his father, he had managed to turn his $100 million inheritance

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:38.059
into $200 million; which is something like six and a half billion dollars in today’s money.

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:40.729
Not bad going at all.

00:09:42.109 --> 00:09:46.809
Billy was good at making money, but he was also pretty good at spending it.

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:53.419
He was an avid art collector, and he built himself a huge mansion in Manhattan.

00:09:54.909 --> 00:10:00.939
Merely the construction of this mansion cost around $70 million dollars in today’s money.

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:08.189
It was vast, 58 rooms in total, and it was furnished to an unbelievable

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:13.779
level of luxury - there were even doors inspired by the baptistry in Florence

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:18.661
that cost a reported three quarters of a million dollars in today’s money.

00:10:20.051 --> 00:10:23.411
Billy perhaps subscribed to the view that, try as he might,

00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:27.031
there was no possible way his bank balance could go down.

00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:33.171
He had splurged on all these luxuries, but he had still managed to double his fortune.

00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:39.961
On Billy’s death, the by now $200 million Vanderbilt fortune

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:43.531
was divided between his eight living children and his wife.

00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:50.061
And it’s here that things really started going downhill for the Vanderbilt family.

00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:55.621
Billy had clearly allowed himself some luxuries - he was one of the

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:59.301
richest people in the world, after all - but it would be his children

00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:03.691
that would take luxury and opulence to an entirely different level.

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:09.991
His eldest son, Cornelius II, built a huge house in Manhattan.

00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:16.771
It was at the time, and still is, the largest private house ever built in New York City

00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:23.411
.
To give you some idea of the scale of it, it was six floors, not including the basement,

00:11:23.831 --> 00:11:32.861
it had 154 rooms, and required 40 servants to attend to its owners every whim and wish.

00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:38.001
And this was only one of Cornelius II’s residences.

00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:42.851
Others included a supposed “cottage”, his summer

00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:46.661
residence, called The Breakers with a mere 70 rooms.

00:11:48.071 --> 00:11:55.051
However, what The Breakers lacked in size, it made up for in style; it was built in the style of an

00:11:55.071 --> 00:12:02.411
Italian Renaissance palace, featuring opulent interiors, intricate woodwork, marble and gold leaf.

00:12:03.631 --> 00:12:10.881
The cost to build it, according to one report, was over $250 million in today’s money.

00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:16.361
And pretty much all of the children did this, with some even building

00:12:16.371 --> 00:12:22.581
bigger and more ostentatious residences than Cornelius II’s 157-room palace.

00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:27.341
The third son, George Washington Vanderbilt, ordered the

00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:32.871
construction of a 250-room mansion in North Carolina.

00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:40.951
But, try as they might, and despite all of this vast wealth and gargantuan

00:12:40.951 --> 00:12:46.741
residences, the Vanderbilts were looked down on by much of American “high society”.

00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:53.101
The Commodore had been known as rude and foulmouthed, and the Vanderbilt

00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:58.271
family was seen as having accumulated a lot of money in a short period of time.

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:06.691
They might have been filthy rich, but they were considered “new money”, not having real “class”.

00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:12.551
Contrast this to the “old money” of New York, money that had been passed

00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:17.491
down from generation to generation, and the Vanderbilt family found

00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:22.151
themselves looked down upon by more established American family dynasties.

00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:30.181
But, money has a great way of fixing problems, and in one famous incident from

00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:37.391
1883, George Washington Vanderbilt’s wife, Alva, decided to put her money to work.

00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:44.061
The Vanderbilt family had been spending like crazy, but Alva Vanderbilt

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:48.521
still couldn’t get an invite to the most sought after party in New York

00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:54.271
society, an annual party held by a socialite called Caroline Astor.

00:13:55.821 --> 00:14:00.641
Every year, 400 people were invited to this party, and if

00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:04.461
your name wasn’t on the list you were not part of “society”.

00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:09.401
And Alva’s name, well, it wasn’t on the list.

00:14:10.611 --> 00:14:19.631
So, Alva Vanderbilt decided to throw her own party, but this time 1,200 people would be invited.

00:14:20.581 --> 00:14:24.211
It was a costume ball, and no expense was spared.

00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:28.873
The event cost today’s equivalent of $6 million.

00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:34.171
As the great and the good of New York high society received

00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:38.561
their invitations, Caroline Astor’s was nowhere to be seen.

00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:43.891
Of course, there was no way that Caroline Astor was not going

00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:48.951
to this party, so she was forced to pay Alva Vanderbilt a visit.

00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:56.811
In typical fashion, Alva said of course she had wanted to invite Caroline Astor, but she had

00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:01.721
never been invited to the Astor residence, so she didn’t know the address to send the invitation.

00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:09.501
No doubt terrible fake smiles were exchanged, but Alva Vanderbilt’s plan had worked.

00:15:10.271 --> 00:15:14.781
The party was the talk of the town; it was a huge success.

00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:18.271
$6 million dollars very well spent.

00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:22.151
The Vanderbilts were now officially part of society.

00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:28.851
As you might have guessed by now, The Commodore’s descendants were more concerned with

00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:34.321
building vast residences and throwing lavish parties than growing the family business.

00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:40.921
After all, they had vast amounts of money, a pot that seemed like it would never run out.

00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:43.411
Or so they thought…

00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:46.141
So, what happened?

00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:51.881
Well, a combination of poor planning, bad investment decisions, massive

00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:56.601
spending, lots of children, and inheritance tax chipped away at the

00:15:56.601 --> 00:16:00.841
fortune every time it was passed from one generation to the next.

00:16:02.281 --> 00:16:05.711
The Great Depression didn’t help things, and when the Vanderbilts

00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:10.211
realised quite how dire their situation was, it was too late.

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:17.601
Just 50 years after The Commodore’s death, in 1877, the fortune

00:16:17.891 --> 00:16:22.911
he had built up was practically gone, evaporated into thin air.

00:16:24.218 --> 00:16:29.404
By the 1940s, the vast residences that the Vanderbilt family had built

00:16:29.414 --> 00:16:34.134
for themselves were either crumbling or being knocked down and sold.

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:39.544
There was simply no money left to pay for the huge maintenance costs.

00:16:40.644 --> 00:16:46.144
Houses, yachts, paintings, statues, vases and racehorses had to be sold.

00:16:47.724 --> 00:16:49.544
What would The Commodore have thought of it all?

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:53.064
Well, it’s hard to imagine he would have been impressed.

00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:59.154
Many of the Vanderbilts’ offspring drank and gambled their way through their

00:16:59.154 --> 00:17:04.214
inheritance, others squandered it on parties and ostentatious projects.

00:17:05.574 --> 00:17:12.714
After William, after Billy, pretty much nothing was done to grow the empire, and there seemed

00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:18.124
to be no acknowledgement or understanding of the fact that the money would eventually run out.

00:17:19.264 --> 00:17:23.854
Still, there are plenty of traces of the Vanderbilt legacy that are still around today.

00:17:24.964 --> 00:17:28.874
If you have heard the name “Vanderbilt”, it might well be because of Vanderbilt

00:17:28.884 --> 00:17:34.964
University, the university formed after a $1 million donation from Cornelius Vanderbilt.

00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:42.364
You can go and visit Biltmore Estate, the 250-room mansion built by George Washington Vanderbilt.

00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:47.514
And if you visit New York City by train, you might well pull into

00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:51.294
Grand Central Station, which was built by the Commodore himself.

00:17:52.414 --> 00:17:56.944
Still, it is a remarkable feat to go from all the riches of the

00:17:56.944 --> 00:18:01.284
world down to zero, especially in such a short period of time.

00:18:02.254 --> 00:18:07.964
So, to finish this episode about one of the most extreme stories of squandered

00:18:07.964 --> 00:18:12.094
riches in history, I will leave you with the words of the once great Egyptian

00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:18.134
pharaoh, Ramesses II, as imagined in the famous poem from Percy Bysshe Shelley:

00:18:19.624 --> 00:18:22.534
"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:26.014
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

00:18:26.714 --> 00:18:28.474
Nothing beside remains.

00:18:28.754 --> 00:18:30.004
Round the decay

00:18:30.284 --> 00:18:33.394
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:38.004
The lone and level sands stretch far away."

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:46.304
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Rise And Fall Of The Vanderbilts.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.974
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:54.124
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:54.544 --> 00:19:00.204
Are there any similar families in your country that have gone from huge riches and then lost it all?

00:19:00.904 --> 00:19:03.744
Is it possible to have any sympathy for the Vanderbilts?

00:19:04.284 --> 00:19:07.354
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:19:07.854 --> 00:19:10.384

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.972 --> 00:00:16.312
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:23.049
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English I'm

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:29.424
Alastair Budge, and today we are going to tell the story of a scandal that rocked Italy.

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:37.487
It involves the Vatican City, the Pope, a Turkish ultra-nationalist organisation,

00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:42.937
an organised crime ring and an unfortunate girl called Emanuela Orlandi.

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:48.347
This podcast is actually a request from one of our members, a lady

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:53.807
from Argentina, in fact, who had asked for more episodes of true crime.

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:58.247
So Karen, this one is for you, if you're listening, I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.568
As a quick reminder, as a member of Leonardo English, you can submit requests

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:09.818
for episodes, just log in, and there is a request episode button right there.

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:13.238
And as this episode shows, we do actually make them.

00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:17.923
Just as a quick warning before we get fully into the

00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:21.793
episode, it is about the disappearance of a young girl.

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.153
So if this is something that you don't want to listen

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:28.723
to, then now is probably the time to press pause.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.013
Okay, then let's get started.

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:38.173
Our story starts in the Vatican city in 1983.

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:46.092
For those of you who haven't ever been there, the Vatican city is a strange place.

00:01:47.392 --> 00:01:53.092
You know it's small, but you probably don't realise quite how small it is.

00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:57.502
It is 0.49 kilometres squared.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:04.852
And to put that in perspective, Disneyland Paris is 19 kilometres squared.

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:09.662
So the Vatican City is almost 40 times smaller.

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:10.922
It's tiny.

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:18.877
Ercole and Maria Orlandi worked and lived in the Vatican city with their five children.

00:02:19.687 --> 00:02:25.507
The Orlandi children were free to roam around the Vatican gardens as they pleased.

00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:29.329
It was almost like it was their own garden.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.490
Their fourth child, Emanuela was 15.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.720
She was a talented flautist, she played the flute very well, and she would take lessons three

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.680
times a week at a school, a bus ride away from the Vatican city, which was where she lived.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:56.980
On Wednesday, the 22nd of June, 1983 Emanuela Orlandi was getting ready to leave to go to class.

00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:01.448
She tried to get her older brother, Pietro, to give

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:05.178
her a ride to the school, but he said he was busy.

00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:11.618
They had a row, they had a fight, and she ran out, slamming the door.

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:19.738
She arrived at the music lesson, but then left 10 minutes earlier than normal.

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:25.484
Outside the school, she phoned her sister from a public phone box to tell

00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:31.874
her that the bus wasn't coming and that she had been approached by a man in

00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:38.654
a green BMW, an expensive car, who had offered her a job selling cosmetics.

00:03:39.711 --> 00:03:44.590
She said that the man had offered to pay her today's equivalent of

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.350
around 500 euros for a few hours work promoting a cosmetics brand.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
Her sister warned her against accepting it and said

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.330
she should come home to talk it over with her mother.

00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:06.029
Emanuela then went to the bus stop to go home with two other friends from her

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:13.769
course, and reportedly also told them about this strange job opportunity, but

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:19.079
said that she would have asked her parents' permission before doing anything.

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.159
Her two friends got on the bus, but it was crowded.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:31.509
Emanuela said that she would wait for the next one, so she didn't accompany her friends home.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:38.959
And that is the last thing that we know for sure about Emanuela Orlandi.

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:43.795
She disappeared into the night, never to be seen again.

00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:48.805
And to this day we still don't know what happened to her.

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:54.153
The events immediately after her disappearance are mysterious

00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:59.617
and this has added to the intrigue surrounding her vanishing.

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:05.407
She was last seen on Wednesday, the 22nd of June.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:11.227
When she didn't return home, her father and brother contacted the

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:15.577
music school to ask if anyone knew anything about where she was.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.859
The master of the music school said she was probably

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.422
just out with friends and to not worry too much yet.

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:31.402
Nevertheless, Ercole Orlandi, the father, was understandably incredibly worried.

00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:36.322
He went to the police station to report her as a missing person.

00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:40.012
Yet the police told him to wait until the following

00:05:40.012 --> 00:05:44.662
day to report her missing, to file an official report.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.757
When she still didn't arrive home the next day, she was officially reported as a missing person.

00:05:53.077 --> 00:05:57.367
The day after that, two local newspapers published the story,

00:05:57.787 --> 00:06:03.487
appealing for information, in the hope that someone knew where she was.

00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:10.637
Then the day after, so two days after she went missing, on

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:15.737
June the 25th, the family received a mysterious phone call.

00:06:17.027 --> 00:06:23.897
It was from a young man who said that his name was Pierluigi and that he was 16 years old.

00:06:24.832 --> 00:06:32.095
He said that he had met two girls in Rome's Campo dei Fiori, a famous square in Rome.

00:06:32.905 --> 00:06:37.181
They were selling cosmetics and one called herself Barbara.

00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:42.411
Barbara matched the description of Emanuela Orlandi.

00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:47.801
She had a flute with her and when Pierluigi asked her to play it for him,

00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:53.231
she said she wouldn't, because she needed to put on her glasses and she

00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:57.431
didn't like wearing glasses, she was embarrassed to wear her glasses.

00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:02.662
But then Pierluigi hung up the phone, and the call ended.

00:07:03.832 --> 00:07:06.352
Three hours later, he called back.

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:15.160
He added that the glasses were to correct an astigmatism, a particular type of vision problem.

00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:19.005
The family had fresh hope.

00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:21.825
Emanuela did play the flute.

00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:24.825
She was embarrassed about wearing her glasses.

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:30.255
She did have an astigmatism and Pierluigi knew about the cosmetics.

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:36.865
These weren't all things that were in the public sphere, they weren't public knowledge.

00:07:37.105 --> 00:07:42.955
So this gave the family hope that Pierluigi had actually seen Emanuela.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.910
They asked to meet him, but he declined; he said he wouldn't meet the family.

00:07:50.143 --> 00:07:53.720
The following day, the family received another call.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:02.730
This time, the call was from someone who said that he was the owner of a bar in Rome.

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:09.199
It was a man, and he said he was 35 years old and called Mario.

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:19.389
He said that he had seen a man and two girls come into his bar, the girls were selling cosmetics.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:25.859
One of the girls claimed to be from Venice and to be called Barbarella.

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:34.709
When he was asked how tall Barbarella was, he hesitated as if he couldn't remember exactly.

00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:39.374
He just responded by saying, well, she was pretty tall.

00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:43.288
This was again, a positive sign to the family.

00:08:43.868 --> 00:08:50.308
Emanuela was indeed tall for her age, at one metre sixty, or around five foot two.

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:54.448
But something seemed a little bit strange about this phone call.

00:08:55.168 --> 00:09:01.228
When Mario had been asked how tall Emanuela was, there was the sound of another man

00:09:01.488 --> 00:09:06.258
who was with Mario in the background, who said, 'no, no, she's taller than that'.

00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:12.078
So it was as if there was another person on the call with Mario.

00:09:13.412 --> 00:09:15.233
This was another hot lead though.

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:16.673
It seemed genuine.

00:09:17.983 --> 00:09:23.643
Mario called back later, and said that this Barbarella had told him that

00:09:23.643 --> 00:09:28.623
she had run away from home because she was bored, but she was planning

00:09:28.623 --> 00:09:33.843
to come back home at the end of the summer for her sister's wedding.

00:09:35.343 --> 00:09:36.873
This did seem credible.

00:09:37.293 --> 00:09:41.463
Her sister was getting married and potentially this could

00:09:41.463 --> 00:09:45.337
have been something that Emanuela Orlandi could have done.

00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:52.562
But still, they were no closer to actually locating the girl.

00:09:53.552 --> 00:09:54.862
The search continued.

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:59.732
There were other sightings of girls who matched Emanuela's description.

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:05.102
A policeman said he had seen a girl matching her description

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:10.022
with a man who was around 35 years old in a green BMW.

00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:19.610
They managed to locate the BMW, and found that it had been recently repaired in a garage.

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:24.550
When the police went to the garage to see what they could find out

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.620
about the car, the owner of the garage said that the car had been

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.884
brought in by a blonde woman and had some very strange damage to it.

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:44.474
The inner right window had been smashed, but, unlike normal breakages where the window

00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:51.224
is smashed from the outside, this window appeared to have been smashed from the inside.

00:10:52.362 --> 00:10:56.508
They managed to track down the blonde woman yet she said she knew nothing.

00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:05.258
On the 3rd of July, 10 days later, Pope John Paul II mentioned Emanuela Orlandi

00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:12.008
during prayers, appealing for any information surrounding her disappearance.

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:18.775
Then two days later, the Vatican's press office received a phone call.

00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:24.802
This time, it was from an anonymous man with an American

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:29.352
accent who was given the nickname, the American, 'l'Americano'.

00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:37.002
He claimed to be holding Emanuela hostage, and said that Pierluigi and Mario, the two

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:43.452
men who had previously called the Orlandi family, were also part of his criminal gang.

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:50.320
In exchange for Emanuela, he demanded the release of Mehmet Ali Ağca a

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.394
Turkish man who attempted to assassinate the Pope a couple of years beforehand.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:03.401
This man said that they had until July the 20th, 15 days time,

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:08.471
to free Mehmet Ali Ağca, otherwise Orlandi would be killed.

00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:15.547
An hour later, he called again, this time to the Orlandi residence and

00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:20.257
played a tape of a young girl's voice, reportedly the missing girl's.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:28.271
The American called a total of 16 times providing different pieces of evidence,

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:34.751
yet none of them were considered believable enough to properly take seriously.

00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:40.485
And since then, since 1983, there have been multiple

00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:44.935
new leads, supposed sightings of Emanuela Orlandi.

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:48.290
Yet her whereabouts are still a mystery.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:56.780
At various points over the years, there have been the discoveries of bones within the Vatican

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:03.860
City, which at least gave hope to the family that there would be some sort of closure.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.580
Of course it would be horrible to know that she wasn't alive,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.460
but it would provide some kind of closure on the event.

00:13:14.106 --> 00:13:18.511
It would allow the family, at least to a certain degree, to move on.

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:28.254
Most recently, in 2019, the lawyer representing the Orlandi family received a note containing

00:13:28.254 --> 00:13:36.594
a photograph of a tomb below the Vatican, and directions to 'look where the angel is pointing'.

00:13:38.494 --> 00:13:43.984
There was, in the crypt that housed the tomb in the photo, there

00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:48.394
was a marble angel who was pointing in a particular direction.

00:13:49.744 --> 00:13:54.244
Was this the final clue of the whereabouts of Emanuela Orlandi?

00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:57.394
She was buried in the Vatican all the time?

00:13:58.654 --> 00:14:02.914
The tip-off was considered serious enough to get the attention

00:14:02.914 --> 00:14:07.114
of top Vatican officials who said that they would look into it.

00:14:08.017 --> 00:14:10.567
And sure enough, they did actually look into it.

00:14:11.377 --> 00:14:16.689
The tomb in question, the tomb that was in the photo, was the

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:21.429
resting place of two princesses who had died 200 years before.

00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:27.701
When they looked at the tomb, it became clear that it had been opened recently.

00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:31.841
There were even the remains of flowers at the site,

00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:34.981
which indicated that people had been visiting it.

00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:41.981
So in July, 2019, the Vatican agreed to open it up.

00:14:43.224 --> 00:14:49.244
When they opened the tomb, they didn't find any evidence of Emanuela Orlandi.

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:54.469
But mysteriously, they found no evidence of the

00:14:54.469 --> 00:14:58.579
princesses who had been originally buried there either.

00:14:59.478 --> 00:15:00.918
Very suspicious, right?

00:15:01.188 --> 00:15:04.308
What happened to the remains of the two princesses?

00:15:05.058 --> 00:15:08.388
And why had the tomb been opened so recently?

00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:11.998
There were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.

00:15:13.973 --> 00:15:19.203
There is still no conclusive evidence of what happened to Emanuela Orlandi.

00:15:19.653 --> 00:15:22.343
But there are plenty of theories.

00:15:23.737 --> 00:15:29.765
One theory is that she was kidnapped by this Turkish terrorist group called The

00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:36.513
Grey Wolves in an attempt to free Mehmet Ali Ağca, but that she hadn't actually been

00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:43.893
killed, and instead was living in an integrated Muslim community, probably in Paris.

00:15:45.363 --> 00:15:52.123
Ağca the terrorist for whom the swap had been proposed, claimed that he knew she

00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:58.003
was safe and well, but he didn't have any evidence to prove it; he just knew it.

00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:05.249
Ağca was released in 2010, and shortly after his release, he claimed

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:10.709
that Orlandi was living as a Catholic nun in a country in central Europe,

00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:16.109
and that her family could actually see her as frequently as they liked.

00:16:17.599 --> 00:16:21.229
But with no evidence to support this, his claims have

00:16:21.229 --> 00:16:24.529
been rubbished; they haven't been considered believable.

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:29.157
There are several other more unpleasant theories.

00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:34.977
Firstly, that she had been kidnapped by an organised crime gang.

00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:43.857
The theory goes that Orlandi's father, who some people say worked within the Vatican bank had seen

00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:52.827
evidence of wrongdoing by the president of the bank, an American Archbishop called Paul C Marcinkus.

00:16:54.207 --> 00:16:58.895
In order to stop the clerk speaking, Marcinkus had got a gangster, Enrico

00:16:58.895 --> 00:17:05.627
de Padis, who was actually from a famous Italian organised crime gang

00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:11.267
called Banda della Magliana, he had got her to take Orlandi hostage.

00:17:12.227 --> 00:17:17.657
If Emanuela Orlandi's father knew that his daughter's safety was at stake,

00:17:17.987 --> 00:17:23.537
he would keep silent about the things that he had seen going on at the bank.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:31.923
Another theory again, involving this gangster, de Padis, suggested that they

00:17:31.923 --> 00:17:38.183
had kidnapped Emanuela Orlandi as a way of extorting money out of the Vatican.

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:43.493
There was a bank called Banco Ambrosiano, which had lent

00:17:43.553 --> 00:17:47.693
a lot of money to the Vatican, but had then collapsed.

00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:55.206
A large amount of this money that was lost reportedly came from organised crime gangs.

00:17:56.256 --> 00:18:00.666
They wanted a way of getting their money back, so they kidnapped

00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:04.866
this girl as a way of forcing money out of the Vatican.

00:18:06.592 --> 00:18:11.715
De Padis, the gangster had reportedly confessed to a girlfriend that

00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:17.100
he had kidnapped Emanuela Orlandi, and they even opened up De Padis'

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.520
tomb to look for DNA evidence that would link him to the crime.

00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:25.051
But none was found.

00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:32.186
And there are other theories too, the most scandalous, and also the most

00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:38.906
unpleasant, is that there was a sort of sex ring in the Vatican and that young

00:18:38.906 --> 00:18:45.146
girls were brought to parties for the pleasure of older men living in the Vatican.

00:18:46.766 --> 00:18:55.946
This theory exists because a Roman priest who was an exorcist for 60 years actually claimed in

00:18:55.946 --> 00:19:04.226
2012, that Orlandi was taken by the Vatican secret police for a sex party and then murdered.

00:19:05.306 --> 00:19:09.806
He also claimed that officials from an unnamed foreign

00:19:09.806 --> 00:19:14.846
embassy knew what had happened, but no evidence was provided.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:25.481
In 2020, 37 years later, the family of Emanuela Orlandi is really not much closer to the truth.

00:19:27.161 --> 00:19:31.631
There are, of course, people who know and although many

00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:35.801
have now died, some of them are probably still alive today.

00:19:37.241 --> 00:19:43.551
Emanuela's older brother, Pietro, is still fighting for the truth, and he certainly

00:19:43.551 --> 00:19:49.521
thinks that the secret, the truth, lies within the walls of the Vatican city.

00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:58.701
He said "from John Paul the second to Ratzinger and Pope Francis, they all know what happened.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:05.021
But due to this being so damaging to the image of the church they've

00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:10.781
been doing all they can to ensure that the truth doesn't come out."

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:19.177
Okay then,that is it for this story of the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:24.947
It is of course a sad story, even if Orlandi is living a

00:20:25.127 --> 00:20:28.667
happy life in some convent or large house in central Europe.

00:20:29.927 --> 00:20:35.897
But one thing that is hard to deny is that it is intriguing; the Vatican,

00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:41.147
organised crime, terrorists, it all makes for a pretty interesting story.

00:20:42.717 --> 00:20:46.017

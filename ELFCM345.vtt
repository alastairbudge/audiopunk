Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.140
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.330
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.380
The show where you can listen to

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.959
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.166
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.426
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.616
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.946
talking about a particularly gruesome

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.726
phase of American history, a period

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:32.346
that caused panic and paranoia across

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:34.816
the country, and even changed the

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:36.866
way Americans lived their lives.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.096
A seemingly nonstop series of murders

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:42.256
that could, and likely would have,

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.051
continued if not for advances in

00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:47.721
technology and crime scene investigation.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:50.668
Yes, today we are going to be

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:53.548
talking about the thirty or so year

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.648
period between the 1970s and the

00:00:56.648 --> 00:01:00.108
2000s - the so-called “Golden Age” of

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:02.408
serial killers in the United States.

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.189
This episode does come with a “parental

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.549
guidance” warning, a warning that we

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.109
are going to be talking about some

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.239
nasty people who did nasty things, so

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.189
if you don’t want to listen to that,

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.839
well, I’d suggest you press pause now.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.819
So, let's get right into it

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.149
and talk about the golden age

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.389
of the American serial killer.

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:31.939
It was August 1985 in east Los Angeles.

00:01:32.438 --> 00:01:34.789
For the last year, the city had

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.139
been terrorised by a serial killer

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.699
known as the ‘Night Stalker.’

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.649
The Night Stalker randomly picked

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.809
houses to break in to, and raped,

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.959
shot, strangled, stabbed, bludgeoned

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.419
and mutilated women to death after

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.869
killing any men in the house.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.619
He even cut out one of his

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.709
victim’s eyes, and sometimes carved

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.039
satanic symbols into the body.

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.179
Understandably, the city was gripped

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.439
by fear, but by August of 1985 the

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.039
police were hot on the Night Stalker’s

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.329
trail - that's to say, they were

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.979
getting closer to catching him.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.519
Police were pretty sure they had

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:22.639
their man, and the newspapers

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.944
finally had a name and photograph

00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:29.704
of the suspect: Richard Ramirez.

00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:32.774
On the morning of August the 31st,

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:35.774
Ramirez, who was unaware that his

00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:37.914
face was on the front cover of

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:40.154
almost every newspaper in the United

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:42.714
States, went into a liquor store.

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:46.814
He picked up a newspaper, and was shocked

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:50.444
to see his own face staring back at him

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:53.651
with the headline: The Night Invader.

00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:56.201
Slowly, the other

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:58.221
shoppers noticed Ramirez.

00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.431
They looked down at the newspapers,

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.171
and looked up at Ramirez, to see the

00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.911
very same face looking back at them.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.851
“It’s the killer!” someone screamed.

00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:11.751
Richard Ramirez - the Night

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.181
Stalker - had been identified.

00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.371
He ran out of the store in a panic,

00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:19.571
sprinting across the passing traffic.

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.831
As he tried to carjack a woman on

00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:25.121
the Santa Ana Freeway, Ramirez was

00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:27.001
attacked by the lady’s husband.

00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:30.031
He escaped into a residential

00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:31.221
neighbourhood, where a

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:32.721
group began to chase him.

00:03:33.188 --> 00:03:35.268
“ It’s the killer!” people shouted.

00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:39.048
More and more people gave chase,

00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:41.928
the crowd building in size.

00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:45.568
One of them hit Ramirez over the head with

00:03:45.568 --> 00:03:48.388
a metal bar, and he fell to the ground.

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:51.426
They beat him, kicking and

00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:53.636
stamping on him, and the crowd

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:55.390
grew to several hundred people.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.780
Trying to protect himself, he

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.790
shouted in Spanish: “It’s me!

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.350
It’s me!

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.790
It’s me!

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.170
I’m lucky the cops caught me.”

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.170
The police were called to the scene.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.470
When they arrived Ramirez was severely

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.970
beaten and bleeding, and if the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.410
police officers had arrived just a few

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.010
minutes later, it’s likely the crowd

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.920
would have beaten the man to death.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.420
After a year of terror, the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.650
Night Stalker had been caught.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.110
But he was just one of many

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.530
during what has been called the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.610
Golden Age of serial killers.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.170
Now, some background.

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:37.065
Serial killers are, according to

00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:40.425
the FBI, killers who commit ‘a

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:42.665
series of three or more killings’.

00:04:43.565 --> 00:04:47.261
As such, the FBI estimates that less than

00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:49.681
1 percent of all murders in the United

00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:52.161
States are committed by serial killers.

00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:55.011
They might feature frequently on the

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.991
news, or in movies, but the reality

00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:00.051
is that most murders are committed

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.921
by people the victim knows, sadly,

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:06.690
friends or family, and more than 90%

00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:09.271
of these murders are committed by men.

00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.751
The term itself - "serial

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.871
killer" - was only coined, it

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.941
was created, in the early 1980s.

00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:21.931
Serial killers have always existed,

00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:24.371
of course, and there are many gruesome

00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.441
examples of people who’ve murdered three

00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:28.921
or more people from throughout history.

00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:31.911
You might already know about Jack the

00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:34.091
Ripper, or perhaps you’ve listened

00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:36.141
to Episode number 30, where we

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.501
looked at his grisly life and crimes.

00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:42.691
But there had never, and have never,

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.421
been as many serial killers operating

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.230
in the same place at the same time

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.630
as there were in the United States

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.890
between the 1970s and the 2000s.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.790
Indeed, criminal experts believe

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.388
that more than 80 percent of all

00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:02.258
known American serial killers

00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:05.636
operated between 1970 and 1999.

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:10.796
And how many did this 80% actually

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:12.826
equate to, you might be wondering?

00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:15.176
Well, it's thought that as many

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:18.856
as 770 active serial killers

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.776
were operating in the U.S.

00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:22.786
in the 1980s, and just

00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:25.566
under 670 in the 1990s.

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:29.116
That figure fell to below 400

00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:32.146
in the 2000s and, as of late

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:35.616
2016, thankfully just over 100.

00:06:36.386 --> 00:06:38.556
I don’t think the idea of having 100

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.876
serial killers on the loose makes anyone

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.306
particularly comfortable, but at least

00:06:43.376 --> 00:06:45.346
it’s better than almost a thousand.

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:48.886
So, in this episode, we’ll look at

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:52.096
why there were so many of them, or

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:54.406
at least, some of the theories about

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:56.836
why this was, and look at some of

00:06:56.836 --> 00:06:59.556
the worst serial killers of the era.

00:07:00.526 --> 00:07:02.546
Now, assuming that you are not

00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.716
a serial killer, it might seem

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.956
inconceivable, completely impossible

00:07:07.976 --> 00:07:10.296
to understand, why someone would

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.660
decide to go on a killing spree.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.620
So, before we get into some of the

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.740
stories of the killers themselves,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.930
let’s look briefly at some of the

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.940
theories that would cause these men, and

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.650
it’s almost exclusively men, to kill.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.250
Experts believe that serial killers

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.830
develop a murderous personality and

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.410
compulsion long before they start

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.160
killing, often during their childhoods.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.300
By the time they’re 14, this murderous

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.990
compulsion is fully-formed, fully

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.410
developed, but most will only

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.360
start killing in their twenties.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.880
So, if the psychological damage occurs

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.910
in childhood and makes serial killers the

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.400
way they are, what was going on in America

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.424
when killers like Jeffrey Dahmer, John

00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:04.278
Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy were children?

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.449
There is a simple answer, perhaps: war.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.743
In cases like Dennis Rader, who was known

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.718
as the BTK killer and killed 10 people

00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:20.173
in Kansas in the 1970s and 1980s, as well

00:08:20.173 --> 00:08:22.773
as the Torso Killer, Richard Cottingham,

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:25.903
a man who killed 12 women and girls in

00:08:25.903 --> 00:08:28.193
New York and New Jersey in the 1960s and

00:08:28.213 --> 00:08:32.183
1970s, their fathers were soldiers who

00:08:32.183 --> 00:08:34.533
returned from the Second World War with

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:38.533
PTSD - post traumatic stress disorder.

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:42.063
These boys, who would go on to become

00:08:42.073 --> 00:08:45.083
serial killers grew up in violent,

00:08:45.253 --> 00:08:47.893
abusive or unstable households,

00:08:48.003 --> 00:08:50.123
often with traumatised fathers.

00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:54.693
And in some cases the violent horrors of

00:08:54.693 --> 00:08:57.163
war could have also helped create serial

00:08:57.163 --> 00:09:00.263
killers in another, more direct way.

00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:04.123
Whereas some killers grew up with former

00:09:04.123 --> 00:09:07.043
soldiers for fathers and inherited their

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.253
trauma, some younger serial killers

00:09:10.353 --> 00:09:14.133
also saw combat themselves, in Korea

00:09:14.383 --> 00:09:16.973
and Vietnam, and returned home with a

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.693
murderous impulse they couldn’t turn off.

00:09:21.113 --> 00:09:23.533
There are countless Vietnam veterans

00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:25.723
who went on to become serial killers,

00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:28.863
including, just to name two, Joseph

00:09:28.863 --> 00:09:30.973
James DeAngelo, who was known as

00:09:30.973 --> 00:09:33.613
the Golden State killer, and Gary

00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:36.013
Ridgway, the Green River Killer.

00:09:37.073 --> 00:09:39.524
In addition to this, experts also

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.789
believe that head injuries in

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:44.339
childhood can make it more likely.

00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:47.489
Richard Ramirez, for example, the

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:50.179
man who we heard being captured at

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:52.559
the start of the episode, suffered a

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:55.259
frontal lobe injury as a two-year-old

00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:57.709
when he fell from a chest of drawers.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.829
Medical experts and psychologists now

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.159
understand that head injuries, and

00:10:04.359 --> 00:10:06.639
frontal lobe injuries in particular,

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:09.819
can cause serious behavioural problems

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:12.519
such as ‘injury-induced psychopathy'.

00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:16.469
For that reason, frontal lobe injuries

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:18.659
are quite common in the childhood

00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:20.789
backgrounds of serial killers

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:23.219
from this so-called Golden Age.

00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:27.449
So, these are some explanations for

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:29.369
why experts believe people might

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:31.959
develop the motivation to kill.

00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:35.422
There are also a few changes in

00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:37.902
American society that made it much

00:10:37.912 --> 00:10:40.182
easier for these serial killers to

00:10:40.192 --> 00:10:42.602
kill and keep on killing, for them

00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:45.202
to evade capture from the police.

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:50.749
Firstly, in the 1960s and 1970s, as

00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:52.969
perhaps you may even remember from

00:10:52.969 --> 00:10:55.609
your own childhood, society tended

00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:57.879
to be a lot more open and trusting.

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:00.959
It was common for people in the American

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.499
suburbs and smaller towns to leave their

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:06.529
doors unlocked overnight, something that

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:09.539
might seem unthinkable to you or me today.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:12.399
The world of security systems and

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:15.209
street-facing cameras was decades away,

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:18.859
and breaking into homes and literally

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.509
getting away with murder was much easier.

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:25.909
Secondly, hitchhiking, that is, travelling

00:11:25.909 --> 00:11:28.769
around by asking strangers for a lift,

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:31.449
in their car, usually by standing

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:32.939
on the side of the road with your

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:36.029
thumb out, was also much more common.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:39.479
Many of the most murderous men of the

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.413
Golden Age preyed on, or targeted,

00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:44.930
innocent hitchhikers, not only because

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.500
they knew that it was unlikely anybody

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.580
else knew where the hitchhikers were

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.320
headed but also because luring them into

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.668
their cars was relatively straightforward.

00:11:56.948 --> 00:11:58.816
And still on the subject of the

00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:01.386
roads, the development of America’s

00:12:01.606 --> 00:12:04.096
interstate highway system gave killers

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:07.526
a wider geographical area to roam and

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:10.076
kill, and crucially, made it easier

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:12.246
to disappear into the next state

00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:15.026
and between legal jurisdictions.

00:12:16.256 --> 00:12:18.306
Another explanation for the

00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:20.666
Golden Age is to do with law

00:12:20.846 --> 00:12:22.416
enforcement, with the police.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.776
In this period, police forces

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:27.986
didn’t have the national computer

00:12:27.986 --> 00:12:29.716
systems and databases that could

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.636
help them link crimes together

00:12:31.926 --> 00:12:34.526
and develop patterns of behaviour.

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:38.497
Similarly, at the crime scenes themselves,

00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:41.517
police forces were fighting an uphill

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:43.757
battle, the odds were against them,

00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:47.187
because DNA technology was incredibly

00:12:47.187 --> 00:12:49.977
new and wasn’t even used for forensic

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:52.457
crime purposes until the mid-1980s.

00:12:53.447 --> 00:12:55.297
And there was another important

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.429
societal reason, one that provided easy

00:12:58.449 --> 00:13:01.039
victims for serial killers to prey on.

00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:03.959
People were moving around the

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:06.234
country more than ever before,

00:13:06.544 --> 00:13:08.424
whether this was looking for work,

00:13:08.694 --> 00:13:10.984
new starts or anything in between.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.934
As such, it was much more common to find

00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:18.004
single men and women who would move into

00:13:18.004 --> 00:13:20.354
a new community without knowing anyone,

00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:22.814
without anyone who would check up on

00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:24.954
them if they went missing, or didn't

00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:27.124
come back home at night, which made them

00:13:27.194 --> 00:13:30.139
ideal targets to be taken advantage of,

00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:32.824
by these bloodthirsty serial killers.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.860
So, who were these people, these

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.930
800 or so known serial killers?

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.580
Well, two of the most famous

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.510
and most notorious were Ted

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.924
Bundy and John Wayne Gacy.

00:13:49.004 --> 00:13:52.054
In recent years these two killers have

00:13:52.054 --> 00:13:54.444
gained particular notoriety because

00:13:54.444 --> 00:13:57.404
their crimes and stories have captivated

00:13:57.434 --> 00:14:00.744
audiences in dramas and podcasts, so

00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:03.464
these are the two we’ll focus on now.

00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:07.784
The first is Ted Bundy, a man who was a

00:14:07.794 --> 00:14:10.534
little different to most serial killers.

00:14:11.144 --> 00:14:14.334
He was university educated, known to be

00:14:14.584 --> 00:14:17.154
charming, well-dressed, and handsome.

00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:21.134
But behind the smooth persona was an

00:14:21.234 --> 00:14:24.824
incredibly cold and calculating man who

00:14:24.844 --> 00:14:27.514
often pretended to be injured in order to

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:30.304
gain the trust of his unsuspecting victims

00:14:30.517 --> 00:14:33.034
- who were all young, attractive women.

00:14:34.234 --> 00:14:37.644
Bundy then used his charm to ask for help

00:14:37.664 --> 00:14:40.394
with something, such as carrying things

00:14:40.394 --> 00:14:43.574
to his car, before attacking, handcuffing

00:14:43.794 --> 00:14:45.484
and pushing them into the vehicle.

00:14:46.504 --> 00:14:48.304
He even removed the passenger

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.014
seat so he could hide them

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.884
more easily when driving away.

00:14:53.284 --> 00:14:58.114
Between 1974 and 1978, Bundy murdered

00:14:58.134 --> 00:15:01.284
at least 30 women in this way but

00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:03.584
as more and more of his victims were

00:15:03.584 --> 00:15:06.784
discovered, people began suspecting him.

00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:09.834
He was reported to the police but the

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:12.404
officers, who were given the very best

00:15:12.404 --> 00:15:14.614
of Bundy’s charm and manipulation,

00:15:15.074 --> 00:15:17.774
saw a well-dressed young man and

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:21.484
repeatedly ruled him out as a suspect,

00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:23.804
they didn't believe it was him.

00:15:24.894 --> 00:15:28.404
That was until 1975, when he was stopped

00:15:28.434 --> 00:15:31.004
by police and found with handcuffs,

00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:34.384
rope, masks and a crowbar in his car.

00:15:34.954 --> 00:15:36.364
The serial killer’s

00:15:36.434 --> 00:15:37.814
starter kit, if you will.

00:15:39.024 --> 00:15:42.294
In 1977 police charged Bundy with

00:15:42.304 --> 00:15:44.804
murder and he defended himself in

00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:47.524
court - meaning, he was his own lawyer.

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:52.084
He even escaped from custody twice, and

00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:54.634
continued killing until he was finally

00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:57.924
caught again in February of 1978 after

00:15:57.934 --> 00:16:00.644
being pulled over for a traffic violation.

00:16:01.814 --> 00:16:04.247
He was sentenced to death and eventually

00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:07.409
executed by electric chair in 1989.

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:12.249
As to why he did it, well some people

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:15.189
- including Bundy himself - have suggested

00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:18.289
that his murderous impulses began when

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:20.859
he was rejected by a college girlfriend.

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.679
Indeed, many of his victims fit a

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:28.409
particular profile - young, attractive,

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:31.539
white, college-aged women who looked

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:33.469
like the woman who rejected him.

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:37.659
Similarly to how Bundy used his charm

00:16:37.659 --> 00:16:40.269
to disarm people, the next killer,

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:43.279
John Wayne Gacy, also had a way of

00:16:43.289 --> 00:16:45.849
putting people at ease - in a rather

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:48.039
creepy, nightmarish way, in fact.

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:51.589
In public, Gacy was thought

00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:53.139
of as a friendly man.

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:56.709
He even dressed up as a clown to entertain

00:16:56.709 --> 00:16:58.849
local children at birthday parties.

00:16:59.469 --> 00:17:01.989
He was a respected and well-liked member

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:04.669
of his community, but behind closed

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:08.399
doors, in secret, Gacy was a truly

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:11.419
vile individual, he was a monster.

00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:14.409
He raped and murdered at least

00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:17.429
33 young men and boys and buried

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:19.279
most of them beneath his house.

00:17:20.149 --> 00:17:23.099
Often, Gacy would lure his victims to

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.209
the house before tricking them into

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:28.079
wearing handcuffs as part of his clown

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.599
routine - claiming it was part of a

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:33.499
magic trick - before he killed them.

00:17:34.699 --> 00:17:36.739
Fortunately, however, the police

00:17:36.769 --> 00:17:38.049
eventually caught up with him.

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:42.589
Gacy was arrested in 1978, and claimed

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:44.629
he was legally insane in order to

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:46.579
try to avoid the death penalty.

00:17:47.689 --> 00:17:50.619
It didn’t work, and after a decade

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.699
on death row - where they keep

00:17:52.719 --> 00:17:54.219
prisoners who are waiting to be

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:58.209
executed - in May of 1994 Gacy

00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:00.476
was executed by lethal injection.

00:18:01.606 --> 00:18:04.286
By then the horrors of his crimes

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:06.246
had become well-known, as had

00:18:06.246 --> 00:18:07.826
his former role in the community,

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:10.126
which led to the nightmarish

00:18:10.126 --> 00:18:12.176
nickname of the ‘Clown Killer’.

00:18:13.306 --> 00:18:15.556
Experts believe that Gacy displayed

00:18:15.576 --> 00:18:18.006
behaviour consistent with antisocial

00:18:18.006 --> 00:18:20.796
personality disorder, a condition that

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:23.336
can be triggered by childhood abuse,

00:18:23.566 --> 00:18:25.986
which was something Gacy suffered at the

00:18:25.986 --> 00:18:28.706
hands of his alcoholic war veteran father.

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:31.861
True to form, he never showed

00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:33.911
any remorse for his crimes.

00:18:35.061 --> 00:18:37.911
Now, Bundy and Gacy are just a handful

00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:40.441
of examples of hundreds of serial killers

00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:43.661
during this so-called Golden Age, and

00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:45.881
I have actually spared you the worst

00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:48.451
of the details about their vile acts.

00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:51.501
Fortunately, the particular set

00:18:51.581 --> 00:18:54.071
of conditions, or circumstances,

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.011
that allowed them to flourish

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.991
during this Golden Age is no more.

00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:02.641
Firstly, the era of an entire

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.166
generation of men returning from

00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:07.925
traumatic wars is over, and there

00:19:07.925 --> 00:19:09.937
are better safety nets in place to

00:19:09.937 --> 00:19:12.120
catch children who might be growing

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.820
up in abusive or traumatic households.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.080
So, at least in theory, there

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.810
will be fewer children who grow up

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.470
wanting to commit these vile acts.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.360
And secondly, much of Western society at

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.760
least is much less trusting of strangers.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.770
People lock their doors at night and

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.100
don’t accept lifts from strange men.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.890
Of course, there are some

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.360
disadvantages to this, but making

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.580
life harder for potential serial

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.580
killers certainly isn’t one of them.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.490
What’s more, law enforcement is simply

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.150
much better at catching criminals.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.640
Modern technology and crime

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.080
scene investigation techniques

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.070
mean that it’s now harder than

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.751
ever to get away with murder.

00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:02.751
Unfortunately, history suggests that there

00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:05.641
will always be damaged people who make up

00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:08.111
their minds and decide that the only way

00:20:08.111 --> 00:20:11.321
to fulfil some warped desire is through

00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:13.481
ending the life of an innocent stranger.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:17.191
And it seems that never before have

00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:19.611
there been more of these people wandering

00:20:19.611 --> 00:20:22.651
the streets than in 1970s America.

00:20:24.041 --> 00:20:27.851
Thankfully, this era, this “Golden Age” of

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.211
the American serial killer, is long gone,

00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:33.161
these bloody three decades of history

00:20:33.371 --> 00:20:35.931
are behind us, and one can only hope

00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:39.309
it’s a chapter never to be opened again.

00:20:42.129 --> 00:20:44.379
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:20:44.399 --> 00:20:46.319
episode on the “Golden Age”

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:48.019
of the American serial killer.

00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:50.609
A bit of a gruesome topic, I know.

00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:53.089
I hope it was an interesting one in

00:20:53.229 --> 00:20:55.579
any case, and whether you’re a True

00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:58.119
Crime aficionado and you knew a lot

00:20:58.139 --> 00:21:00.489
about serial killers already, or this

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.859
was the first time you’d heard anything

00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:05.149
about this so-called “Golden Era”,

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:07.099
well I hope you learned something new.

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:10.119
As always, I would love to know

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:11.609
what you thought about this episode.

00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:14.219
Which of the reasons do you think

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:16.259
best explains the Golden Age?

00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:17.996
Do you think this is an era that

00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:19.966
will truly never be repeated?

00:21:20.386 --> 00:21:22.066
Are there any gruesome tales of

00:21:22.256 --> 00:21:24.236
serial killers from your country?

00:21:24.746 --> 00:21:26.736
I would love to know, so let’s

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:28.256
get this discussion started.

00:21:28.606 --> 00:21:29.706

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:31.636

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to yet another episode of

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:13.967
English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English, the show where you

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:17.622
can listen to fascinating stories and learn interesting

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:22.332
things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:28.392
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to talk about the Taliban.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:32.832
Now you probably know a bit about the Taliban.

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:39.702
When you hear the term 'the Taliban', you might imagine all sorts of things the war in

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:48.342
Afghanistan, terrorists, Shariah law, men with big beards and rocket launchers hiding in caves.

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:56.922
While these are not necessarily incorrect, in this episode we are going to go a little deeper.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:03.762
We'll explain who the Taliban are, how they came to be, how they manage

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:10.722
to seize power, how they have never really lost power, and we'll end

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:15.282
with a few ideas about what the future might look like for the Taliban.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.683
And in the next 20 minutes or so I'm confident that you'll emerge with a much

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:27.608
better idea, and a much more rounded understanding of a group that has had a

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:33.878
huge impact on the balance of power in the region and the world more widely.

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:40.718
But before we get right into it this is my chance to remind those of you who

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:46.028
haven't yet seen the light, that you can grab a copy of the transcript and key

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:51.503
vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:56.993
If you are wanting to improve your English listening skills, then there aren't

00:01:56.993 --> 00:02:01.673
many better ways than to listen to a podcast with the transcript in front

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:05.673
of you and having the key vocabulary there means that you

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:10.803
can build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:13.473
So go and check that out.

00:02:13.653 --> 00:02:16.013
It is at leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:20.110
Right then, the Taliban.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.650
To get one small point out of the way before we start:

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.770
this is obviously not some kind of advert or endorsement of the Taliban.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.000
They are a nasty group with some views that this podcast

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.256
certainly doesn't condone, doesn't agree with.

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:44.286
But just because you don't agree with something, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:51.516
learn about it and just thinking that something is bad without properly understanding it and the

00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:58.116
circumstances that have allowed it to flourish is certainly not something that we would encourage.

00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:06.816
So that's why we are taking on the Taliban, taking on at least from an informational point of view.

00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:12.120
Let's start with a linguistic point, as this

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
is after all, a podcast about improving your language skills.

00:03:18.353 --> 00:03:21.863
The Taliban means 'students' in Pashto,

00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:25.313
one of the two official languages of Afghanistan.

00:03:27.283 --> 00:03:32.113
The group came to power in Afghanistan after the Afghan civil war.

00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:41.348
And from 1996 to 2001 they held power over about three quarters of the whole of Afghanistan.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:48.842
After the Americans invaded Afghanistan in 2001, after the September the 11th

00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:54.055
attacks, the Taliban lost power, at least from a governmental point of view.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.638
But slowly, slowly in the almost 20 years since

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:04.738
the Americans first invaded, the Taliban have been regaining power.

00:04:06.291 --> 00:04:13.060
By 2016 it was estimated that the Taliban held about 20% of

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.269
Afghanistan, and even in 2019 President Trump had said that he

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.734
was planning to invite the Taliban to Camp David, the US presidential retreat.

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:34.074
So this group has never really disappeared and has been lurking in the shadows,

00:04:34.194 --> 00:04:40.464
hiding in the shadows, a constant presence in the country and the region more widely.

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:47.571
Afghanistan is a hugely interesting country with a fascinating past.

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:56.616
So it's tricky to explain everything in one short, 20 minute podcast, but let's talk about some of

00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:06.516
the main factors that help us understand the how, the who, the what, and the why of the Taliban.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:13.969
Firstly, how did the Taliban seize power and who exactly are they?

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.809
Well, as it often is, the Cold War was a big factor here.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:24.855
Afghanistan was one of the countries where the

00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:30.435
proxy war between the Soviet Union and the United States was fought.

00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:37.141
The Soviet Union, the USSR, wanted to support the failing communist

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:43.271
government and sent in troops to the country to prop it up, to support it.

00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:49.058
This started the Afghanistan war, which ran from

00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:57.308
1979 to 1989, with the Americans secretly supporting the Mujaheddin,

00:05:57.638 --> 00:06:00.668
the jihadists who were fighting against the Russians.

00:06:02.223 --> 00:06:09.077
Long story short, after 10 years of fighting, then after the Russians left, five

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:17.747
more years of mismanagement by the new rulers, and civil war, the Taliban managed to seize power.

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:26.387
They proposed stability, stamping out corruption, and ensuring the rule of law,

00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:36.107
which, for a country that had been deeply lawless and under a state of foreign occupation and civil

00:06:36.107 --> 00:06:44.777
war for a lot of recent living memory, that was understandably quite an attractive proposition.

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:54.887
But with this rule of law came a lot more, the Taliban came with lots of strings attached.

00:06:57.152 --> 00:07:02.162
The Taliban, as I said, meaning 'the students', had emerged from the

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:08.312
madrassas, the religious schools in southern Afghanistan and also Pakistan.

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:14.738
They followed and enforced a very strict version of Shariah

00:07:14.738 --> 00:07:20.479
law, and introduced punishments like public executions of

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.558
convicted murderers and adulterers, and amputations, the

00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:33.148
cutting off of hands and feet for those found guilty of theft, of stealing.

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:38.286
Men had to grow beards and women had to

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:42.276
wear burqas, the dress that covers their entire body.

00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:48.781
And TV, cinema, lots of music, it was all banned.

00:07:49.473 --> 00:07:54.453
And it was a deeply chauvinistic society that they were trying to create.

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:58.059
As you probably know, women were treated

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:03.699
horribly, girls were forbidden from getting a proper education.

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:10.719
Obviously, these are things that most people across the world now would

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:18.639
consider pretty barbaric and inhumane and things that civilisations in lots of

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:23.889
the rest of the world stopped thinking were acceptable several centuries ago.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:32.859
And despite people in the West who knew about what was going on in Afghanistan

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:39.429
being quite horrified about the behaviour that they saw on display from the Taliban,

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:45.365
there was not really a huge amount that was done to stop it.

00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:54.775
These things were going on within Afghanistan, to the Afghan people, and despite the fact that

00:08:54.775 --> 00:09:00.475
another country didn't agree with it, there was little that they could actually do about it.

00:09:02.545 --> 00:09:07.895
And there were also a few complications relating to international

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:13.235
diplomacy, international relations, with the Taliban and with Afghanistan.

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:18.026
Firstly, the Taliban government of

00:09:18.056 --> 00:09:22.886
Afghanistan was only recognised by three countries.

00:09:24.556 --> 00:09:29.656
Can you guess which they might be and why they would have recognised it?

00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:36.621
Well, it was naturally the countries that had the most to gain by supporting

00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:40.521
Afghanistan, the ones that wanted to keep The Taliban

00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:45.861
government friendly because of the other regional rivalries.

00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:53.131
So firstly, their neighbour, Pakistan, which is actually

00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.981
where it's thought that a lot of the Taliban studied.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:02.488
Then also Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the United Arab Emirates,

00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:07.833
who were very keen to have an influence in the region, especially if it meant

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:14.953
being able to influence things with their mutual local rival, archrival, Iran.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:20.732
In any case, the rule of the Taliban, despite being

00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:27.482
evidently pretty barbaric was largely ignored by Western powers.

00:10:28.912 --> 00:10:33.772
Afghans, as a generalisation, suffered greatly under the

00:10:33.772 --> 00:10:37.912
Taliban rule in the nineties, especially the female population.

00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:43.816
It truly did seem like a throwback to the Middle Ages.

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:49.768
But in 2001 things all changed again,

00:10:50.548 --> 00:10:54.568
and Afghanistan was thrown back into a state of war.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:11:00.281
However, this time it wasn't because of the terrible things that

00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:06.391
the Taliban were doing to its own people or the general barbarity of the regime.

00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:10.611
This was tolerated by other world powers.

00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:15.949
It was, technically at least, only because the

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:22.785
Taliban had harboured, they had hidden, the Saudi, Osama Bin Laden,

00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:27.255
who you will know as the architect behind the September 11th attacks.

00:11:29.168 --> 00:11:34.718
And when the US invaded Afghanistan, less than a month after September

00:11:34.718 --> 00:11:41.018
the 11th, the Taliban were no match for the well trained and well equipped US army.

00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:47.258
The Taliban government fell within a week of the invasion,

00:11:47.258 --> 00:11:53.558
at least they fell from official power, but as I'm sure you know, just because a

00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:58.418
group isn't officially in power, it doesn't mean that they have lost all their power.

00:12:00.048 --> 00:12:03.738
The senior leaders went to the ground, they went into

00:12:03.798 --> 00:12:08.328
hiding, and many weren't captured for many years.

00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:14.498
Lots returned, reportedly, I should say, to the Pakistani

00:12:14.498 --> 00:12:19.268
city of Quetta, and they managed things remotely from there.

00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:27.331
And as the British found when they went to war in Afghanistan in the 19th century,

00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:31.031
and as the Soviets found when they went to war

00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:36.290
in Afghanistan in the 20th century, the Americans were also to

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:43.610
find that Afghanistan is not an easy place to win a war when they went there in the 21st century.

00:12:44.971 --> 00:12:49.215
The combination of a difficult landscape and different

00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:55.125
cultural and ethnic groups mean that fighting in Afghanistan is

00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:59.235
fraught with difficulties, it's filled with lots of difficult aspects.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:09.630
And how this helps the Taliban is of course, that they have a big advantage over any invaders.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:16.740
They know the terrain, they know the geography, and they know the cultural and

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:22.080
ethnic differences and how to manage them, at least better than any invader would.

00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:29.133
The other advantage that the Taliban had over the Americans and the

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:37.473
NATO forces, and the advantage that they still have in fact, was, and still is time.

00:13:38.913 --> 00:13:40.593
They could afford to wait.

00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:46.953
They could bide their time and continually attack the invading troops from the

00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:53.763
shadows with bombs, suicide attacks, and other classic terrorist activities.

00:13:55.059 --> 00:14:00.448
And this is exactly what has been going on off and on ever since

00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:07.078
the Americans first put boots on the ground in Afghanistan in October, 2001.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:13.618
The Taliban can continue to fight and continue to wait it out, partly

00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:18.778
because they are very well financed, they are a group with quite a lot of money.

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:24.368
It's thought that they make as much as one and a half billion dollars a year.

00:14:25.718 --> 00:14:30.758
A large part of this is through drugs: heroin, and opium.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:37.543
If you weren't aware, Afghanistan is the world's largest opium producer.

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:43.963
Over 90% of the world's opium comes from Afghanistan, and most of

00:14:43.963 --> 00:14:49.633
the opium growing areas are held by the Taliban, or at least the

00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:55.933
Taliban can extract some kind of taxes, money, from the opium farmers.

00:14:57.448 --> 00:15:04.018
So this is obviously a super lucrative source of income for the group.

00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:11.237
The great irony here is that some of the Taliban's biggest markets and

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:17.867
biggest customers are the drug addicts, the citizens of countries that have invaded them.

00:15:19.552 --> 00:15:25.042
The war on drugs is definitely a topic for another podcast, but if you are thinking

00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:30.622
about the flow of money, specifically related to the Taliban, the

00:15:30.622 --> 00:15:36.352
Taliban produces drugs that are consumed by people all over the world, but a large

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:43.582
part are consumed by Americans and there is actually a double cost for the US for

00:15:43.582 --> 00:15:52.422
this: both the cost that heroin addiction has on US society, and the fact that American

00:15:52.422 --> 00:15:59.082
customers are helping keep the Taliban in business, helping finance the Taliban.

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:03.852
But as I said, we'll go into that in more detail another day.

00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:11.242
So the Taliban has continued to be a well-financed group operating from

00:16:11.242 --> 00:16:19.527
the shadows and biding their time and time was, and is, on their side.

00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:25.707
Of course, American and NATO troops couldn't stay forever.

00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:33.815
NATO announced that it was pulling troops out of Afghanistan in 2014 and since then

00:16:34.055 --> 00:16:40.325
the number of foreign troops based in the country has been going down and down almost every year.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:49.980
From a political point of view in the West, in America, and in Europe, the war in

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:57.450
Afghanistan is generally relatively unpopular, and of course has been hugely expensive.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.660
It's thought that it has cost the US almost a trillion dollars.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.320
And the Taliban knows this.

00:17:06.855 --> 00:17:13.935
It is sitting, waiting, gradually regaining territory, continuing attacks from the sidelines,

00:17:14.415 --> 00:17:21.045
knowing that unless it does something that really aggravates the US, which it would be pretty

00:17:21.045 --> 00:17:26.715
foolish to do, then it's unlikely that the US will send any more troops to the country.

00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:33.465
And despite the fact that the Taliban isn't officially in power in

00:17:33.465 --> 00:17:39.795
the country, and it is still sort of a fringe movement, a sideline

00:17:40.005 --> 00:17:47.475
group, experts say that it's now stronger than at any point since 2001.

00:17:49.313 --> 00:17:54.683
It's thought to have 60,000 full time soldiers and to be

00:17:54.683 --> 00:17:59.663
in control of just under 20% of the administrative regions.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:07.310
It's clear that the Taliban isn't just going to disappear, and this has meant

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:14.630
that politicians both within Afghanistan and abroad have had to actively engage with it.

00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:18.645
Afghans have accepted this too.

00:18:19.338 --> 00:18:26.358
A survey last year found that 64% of people said that some sort of agreement

00:18:26.358 --> 00:18:31.401
with the Taliban was possible and what was needed to move the country forward.

00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:41.481
And then in February of this year, of 2020, the US and the Taliban signed an agreement to try

00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:49.281
to end the war that's been going on for almost 20 years, and to find a path towards peace.

00:18:51.227 --> 00:18:56.007
Skeptics say that this is just a cynical ploy, a trick,

00:18:56.337 --> 00:19:00.187
from the Taliban to push the US out of the country

00:19:00.547 --> 00:19:05.587
and bring things back to how they were when they first took power.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.286
And the fact that it's clear that the Taliban want to establish

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:18.186
an Islamic Republic and abolish the current system of universal suffrage, where

00:19:18.186 --> 00:19:24.666
everyone gets a vote, this is clearly something that is quite scary to lots of

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:30.803
Western leaders who have ISIS in relatively recent living memory.

00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:35.966
So what is next for the Taliban?

00:19:37.456 --> 00:19:42.916
Well, with the world currently grappling with a global health problem,

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:51.169
and attentions certainly diverted away from the region, most experts imagine

00:19:51.349 --> 00:19:56.547
that the Taliban will be plotting their next move, but whether that is

00:19:56.547 --> 00:20:04.422
something more active or it's just 'sit and wait', well, I think that is anyone's guess.

00:20:05.781 --> 00:20:09.295
Okay then that is it for the Taliban.

00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:16.175
Obviously it is a barbaric group that has done many abhorrent things,

00:20:16.445 --> 00:20:20.045
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to understand more about it.

00:20:21.247 --> 00:20:26.107
So I hope that this 20 minute or so introduction has been enlightening.

00:20:27.717 --> 00:20:32.007
I've also got a few little pieces of news for you and some reminders.

00:20:32.547 --> 00:20:38.427
Firstly, if you are a Spanish or Portuguese speaker, you're in luck because

00:20:38.427 --> 00:20:42.717
the Leonardo English website is now available in Spanish and Portuguese.

00:20:43.227 --> 00:20:48.267
Just go to leonardoenglish.com there's a little language switcher button

00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:53.397
in there and you can switch everything over to Spanish or Portuguese.

00:20:54.117 --> 00:20:57.177
And we will of course have more languages coming soon.

00:20:58.485 --> 00:21:03.157
We also have a load of new interesting blogs and guides on the website.

00:21:03.487 --> 00:21:09.457
Things like how to create your own immersion English course or why you shouldn't learn English

00:21:09.487 --> 00:21:13.804
in the classroom, which is 'a confessions from an English teacher' article.

00:21:14.604 --> 00:21:17.851
So go and check those out, those are well worth a read.

00:21:19.006 --> 00:21:22.726
And as you probably already know, the website is where you can find the

00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:28.186
transcript and key vocabulary for all of the podcasts and also all the bonus episodes.

00:21:28.456 --> 00:21:33.736
So if you haven't checked those out already, then that is definitely worth having a look.

00:21:35.316 --> 00:21:39.216

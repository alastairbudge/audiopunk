Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:16.931
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:21.121
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:27.081
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Titanic.

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:33.971
On the evening of April 14th 1912, passengers of all nationalities and

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:38.791
classes were settling down for another night on the largest ship ever built.

00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:45.301
However, after four days of straightforward voyage, the truly unthinkable happened.

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:48.991
The legendary ship struck a giant iceberg.

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:54.271
Water started pouring on board, and the vessel sunk to the bottom of

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:59.801
the Atlantic Ocean, taking over 1,500 passengers and crew down with it.

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.961
So, let’s get right into it, and tell the story of The Titanic.

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:11.763
The start of the 20th century saw great competition between industrialists.

00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:18.421
The Industrial Revolution had seen great factories built, trains, and machines of all sorts.

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.201
Buildings grew taller.

00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:28.971
The Flatiron Building in New York turned heads when, in 1903, its 22 floors towered over the city.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.221
And boats, of course, were no exception.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:38.591
There was a rush to build the biggest and most spectacular vessels to have ever been put to sea.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:45.891
Britain was one of the great shipbuilding nations, and two companies, Cunard and White

00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:51.601
Star Line, were in fierce competition to build the biggest and most impressive ships.

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:56.821
At the turn of the century, Cunard launched the fastest passenger

00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:01.031
ships ever, transporting passengers between Britain and North America.

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:08.331
In response, White Star Line wanted something that would blow the competition out of the water.

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:14.581
So, it commissioned a Northern Irish shipbuilding company to build three new

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:20.501
Olympic-class ocean liners, instructing the company to spend whatever was required.

00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:26.521
As far as the construction of these ships was concerned, money was no object.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:34.001
All three ships were given names appropriate to their owner’s ambitions and loyalties.

00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:40.771
The first was called Olympic, the third Brittanic, and the second, well, you’ve

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:47.101
probably guessed, it was the Titanic, or RMS Titanic to give it its full name.

00:02:48.145 --> 00:02:54.301
RMS, by the way, means Royal Mail Ship, it means that the ship is registered to carry letters

00:02:54.441 --> 00:03:00.501
for the postal service, and these ships would carry mail between the UK and the United States.

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:07.921
The Titanic took three years to build, and cost around €200m in today’s money.

00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:12.451
By the time she was ready to launch, to take what’s

00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:16.531
called her “maiden voyage”, the world was captivated.

00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:21.161
Now, let me quickly interrupt this story to tell you something that might

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.601
surprise you, and it’s that most people think that English doesn’t have

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:30.941
genders, that a table isn’t masculine or feminine, it’s just “a table”.

00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:35.101
And that is right, but there are some objects in

00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:38.971
English that do have genders, and a ship is one of them.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.861
A ship is technically always feminine, so you should refer to

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:48.081
one as “her”, although it’s not really wrong if you call it “it”.

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:54.901
OK, with that grammar point out of the way, let’s talk a little bit more about this beast.

00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:58.481
By 1911, she was ready.

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:03.641
She was the largest moving object ever built, her anchor alone

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:08.481
weighed 16 tonnes and required 20 horses to transport it.

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:13.091
She was 270 metres long and 53 metres high.

00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:19.381
There were even doubts over whether she would fit in ports, with the New York Tribune

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:24.561
writing, “How can we dock this marine monster when she reaches the port of New York?”.

00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:30.901
It wasn’t just the size and luxury that attracted press attention either, which

00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:35.771
brings us onto one of the most infamous marketing claims to have ever been made.

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:44.761
In a fatal foreshadowing, a hint of what was to come, the vice-Chairman of White Star Line claimed.

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.961
“We are perfectly satisfied that the Titanic is unsinkable”.

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.851
Of course, this was partially to try to get people to buy

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.041
tickets, but White Star Line did have reason to believe it.

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:05.821
Architects and engineers had installed 16 water-tight compartments across

00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:11.581
the hull, the bottom part of the ship, and the idea was that even if many of

00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:17.091
these did flood, did take on water, the Titanic would be able to stay afloat.

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:24.141
So, the ship was built, the route from Southampton to New York was planned, and the

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:30.611
proud passengers arrived, eager to get onboard the world’s most luxurious ocean liner.

00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:35.321
Who better then, to captain her maiden voyage than the

00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:38.981
so-called ‘Millionaires’ Captain’ himself; Edward Smith?

00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:43.841
The 62-year-old Smith was a distinguished Captain,

00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:48.191
and this was to be his final voyage before retirement.

00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:51.801
So, who was actually travelling on this ship?

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:53.771
Who managed to get a ticket?

00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:57.521
Well, the very fact that it was the biggest ship in

00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:01.001
the world made it a luxurious and special experience.

00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:05.131
But how special it was depended on how much you were

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.651
prepared to fork out, how much you paid for a ticket.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:14.611
Ticket prices for the trip were surprisingly similar to today’s rates.

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:21.661
The cheapest option was a third class ticket costing around €500 in today’s

00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:28.811
money, with second class costing €1500, and first class costing €4500.

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:33.711
But White Star Line wasn't satisfied with leaving it there.

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:39.161
The wealthiest passengers, like billionaire John Jacob Astor,

00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:44.951
bought luxury suites for today’s equivalent of well over €70,000.

00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:51.211
For this you would have enjoyed two luxurious bedrooms, a sitting room,

00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:56.021
private bathroom, servants and the latest trend, a private balcony.

00:06:57.391 --> 00:07:01.281
The standards on the Titanic were so high that even 2nd

00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:04.851
class was like 1st class on pretty much any other ship.

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:11.651
For the most expensive sections of the boat, the public areas were modelled on The Ritz

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:18.667
Hotel in London and stylish Parisian cafes, with a Grand Staircase as the centrepiece.

00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:26.021
The facilities included a heated swimming pool, a squash court, a gym, a barber shop, bands,

00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:32.111
dancers and the largest dining room ever seen on a ship, serving only the very best food.

00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:40.441
To feed all these hungry passengers, the kitchen store rooms contained 35,000 eggs, 34

00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:47.531
tonnes of meat, and 15,000 bottles of ale - this was a floating hotel like no other.

00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:54.891
But if you had bought the cheapest ticket, third class, it wasn’t such a luxurious experience.

00:07:55.781 --> 00:08:01.611
Of the approximately 2,000 passengers, 700 travelled in third-class.

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:07.731
This meant that the rooms had bunk beds, beds on top of each other, there wasn’t

00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:14.351
much space, and there were only two bathrooms between the entire 700 passengers.

00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:16.671
One for men, one for women.

00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:21.481
If that wasn’t bad enough, the rooms were right next to

00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:25.281
the engines, which were, as you’d expect, rather loud.

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:30.631
And what’s more, as we’ll find out shortly, the consequences

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.431
of buying a third class ticket were, in many cases, lethal.

00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:42.281
Now, whilst their experience doesn’t sound like the best, it’s important to remember that

00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:47.481
this would have been the standard experience for most people on a TransAtlantic voyage.

00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:52.951
Most of these passengers wouldn’t have had hot water at home, sharing

00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:56.811
a bathroom wouldn’t have been particularly strange, and on other

00:08:56.811 --> 00:09:00.471
ships, they would have been expected to bring their own food on board.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:07.001
And although everyone on board was taking part in this magical experience,

00:09:07.241 --> 00:09:10.921
there was a very clear division between the classes of passengers.

00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:15.801
There was no sneaking upstairs for some Foie Gras or a swim.

00:09:16.131 --> 00:09:19.381
There were gates that closed off the different sections,

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:23.681
and this will become sadly important later on in the story.

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:27.831
So, to the story of the fateful voyage.

00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:32.741
It’s the morning of April 10th, 1912 and the big day

00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:36.325
has arrived, the Titanic is waiting at Southampton.

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:42.041
100,000 onlookers watch The Titanic fill up with crew

00:09:42.071 --> 00:09:45.991
and passengers, and Captain Smith departs at midday.

00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:52.081
She stops at Cherbourg, in France and Queenstown, in Ireland to pick up the

00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.891
remaining passengers before heading west towards the vast Atlantic Ocean.

00:09:57.771 --> 00:10:02.821
She would be due at New York on April 17th, exactly a week later.

00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:06.681
As we both know, she would never make it.

00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:11.181
The first 4 days, however, went as planned.

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:15.911
The upper classes enjoyed the luxuries and the less fortunate

00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:19.981
passengers waited in anticipation for their new lives in America.

00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:24.831
April 14th is when things take a dark turn.

00:10:26.111 --> 00:10:28.761
The ship was in the Northern Atlantic Ocean.

00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:32.946
Warnings were beginning to come in concerning the number of icebergs,

00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:38.551
so Captain Smith plots a new course, he changes direction slightly.

00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:43.661
As the night draws in, the temperature drops below freezing.

00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:48.631
There was no moonlight, only stars, and the waves were calm.

00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:55.601
The Titanic, which in sunny Southampton seemed like a giant feat of human engineering,

00:10:55.941 --> 00:11:01.891
now appeared almost insignificant compared to the huge, freezing, dark ocean.

00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:09.241
It’s about 600km southeast of Newfoundland, in Canada and nearing midnight.

00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:15.201
With a crew hard at work, and passengers either partying or getting

00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:20.031
to sleep, it’s at this point that events begin to unfold very quickly.

00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:28.351
At 11:40PM, Sailor Frederick Fleet is positioned in the Crow’s Nest, the ship’s lookout point.

00:11:29.591 --> 00:11:35.641
As well as challenging weather conditions, his job is made even more difficult by the fact

00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:41.278
that the ship’s binoculars are locked in a box, and the keys are still in Southampton.

00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:47.391
Another officer, a man named Officer Blair, had been removed from the

00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:52.651
Titanic just before departure and he had forgotten to hand over the keys.

00:11:54.131 --> 00:12:00.471
Fleet spots the tip of an iceberg, not too far in the distance, and urgently rings the bell.

00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:06.421
He follows this up with a call to the ship’s bridge, “ice right ahead!”.

00:12:07.741 --> 00:12:14.821
With great haste, with great speed, the ship is turned and a head-on collision is narrowly avoided.

00:12:16.251 --> 00:12:20.801
Whilst this may sound like good news, it isn’t, but more on that later.

00:12:22.101 --> 00:12:26.051
The side of the ship had scraped along the 122 metre

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.751
iceberg ripping several holes below the water line.

00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:36.101
The Titanic itself is made of metal, and weighs nearly 50,000 tonnes.

00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:41.121
The iceberg may be made only of frozen water and is

00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:44.921
only 30 metres high, 20 metres shorter than the Titanic.

00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:51.391
But it would have extended about another 300m below the surface.

00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:58.171
Put simply, it is absolutely massive, and would have weighed millions of tonnes.

00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:02.648
As the iceberg crushed against the side of the ship,

00:13:03.228 --> 00:13:07.178
huge fragments of ice were chipped away, landing on deck.

00:13:08.678 --> 00:13:13.048
Many of the passengers still thought nothing of this though, with one

00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:17.608
survivor saying, ‘We picked up blocks and most of us played snowballs.’

00:13:19.108 --> 00:13:24.258
10 minutes later, at 11:50PM, Captain Smith and a ship

00:13:24.368 --> 00:13:27.838
architect named Thomas Andrews inspect the damage.

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:29.568
It’s not good news.

00:13:30.648 --> 00:13:35.518
The mail room was flooding, but it wasn’t just wet letters that they had to worry about.

00:13:36.408 --> 00:13:40.988
Five of the supposedly ‘watertight’ compartments were already flooding.

00:13:41.998 --> 00:13:48.128
The ship’s architect, Andrews, who knew the ship’s design inside out, he knew it thoroughly,

00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:55.598
insists that because more than four compartments are flooded, the ship is, in fact, sinking.

00:13:57.008 --> 00:14:01.418
At midnight, 20 minutes after the collision, Captain Smith sends

00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:05.408
out his first distress call over the radio, he calls for help.

00:14:06.108 --> 00:14:09.098
The passengers are ordered to board the lifeboats.

00:14:09.308 --> 00:14:12.638
The unsinkable ship is officially sinking.

00:14:13.808 --> 00:14:17.988
It is only around this time that the metal gates segregating

00:14:18.178 --> 00:14:21.548
the lower classes from the upper classes are opened up.

00:14:22.698 --> 00:14:27.538
Whilst the scene in the famous movie showing these passengers frantically trying

00:14:27.538 --> 00:14:33.958
to open them is slightly fictionalised, this slight delay in opening them does mean

00:14:34.098 --> 00:14:38.398
that the first class ticket holders are already at the front of the lifeboat queue.

00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:46.988
And, tragically, just 20 of the possible 64 lifeboats had been installed on the boat.

00:14:47.938 --> 00:14:53.018
This was to try to keep the deck, the upper area, looking nice and tidy.

00:14:54.248 --> 00:14:58.288
It might have made the ship look pretty, but it meant that there were only

00:14:58.308 --> 00:15:03.458
enough lifeboats for an absolute maximum of half of the ship’s passengers.

00:15:04.688 --> 00:15:09.848
Shockingly, this actually met the minimal legal requirements of the time,

00:15:10.248 --> 00:15:14.908
as the idea was for the lifeboats to transport passengers to rescue ships

00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:20.378
and return to pick up more, not transport all passengers at the same time.

00:15:21.668 --> 00:15:25.818
As we’ll find out, this simply wasn’t possible for the Titanic.

00:15:27.168 --> 00:15:29.708
So, we’re still at about midnight now.

00:15:30.098 --> 00:15:33.108
The ship continues to transmit distress signals,

00:15:33.378 --> 00:15:36.798
calling out for someone, anyone, to come to save it.

00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:43.558
The Carpathia, 107km away, receives the message, ‘Come at once.

00:15:43.748 --> 00:15:47.277
We have struck a berg.’ and it changes course to help.

00:15:48.457 --> 00:15:52.507
It would take another 25 minutes for the lifeboats to start boarding.

00:15:53.477 --> 00:16:00.097
‘Women and children first’ is the protocol, but some officers think this means that no men

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:05.537
at all are allowed to board, whilst others think that men can fill up the remaining spots.

00:16:06.827 --> 00:16:14.457
As a result of the confusion, the first lifeboat leaves with just 28 of the 65 spots filled.

00:16:15.957 --> 00:16:21.457
By 1 o'clock in the morning, the lower decks are now totally flooded, and the

00:16:21.487 --> 00:16:26.617
bow, the front of the ship sinks further and further below the icy surface.

00:16:27.647 --> 00:16:32.297
Water rushes in 15 times faster than it can be pumped out.

00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:35.907
The writing is on the wall for the Titanic.

00:16:36.907 --> 00:16:42.867
15 minutes later, at a quarter past one in the morning, the weight of the flooding in the bow,

00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:50.017
the front part of the boat, causes the stern and propellers at the opposite end to rise out of

00:16:50.037 --> 00:16:56.257
the water, and the incline of the ship begins tipping passengers towards the freezing cold ocean.

00:16:57.757 --> 00:17:00.887
By this time, it is total chaos.

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:06.287
The last few lifeboats are departing, desperate passengers push their way to them.

00:17:07.747 --> 00:17:12.557
Some men, in a bid to survive, do whatever they can to get on the boats.

00:17:12.937 --> 00:17:18.597
Others accept their fate and stay put, rather than be labelled a coward back home.

00:17:20.097 --> 00:17:23.837
At half past one, the signals continue from the ship's

00:17:23.837 --> 00:17:28.058
officers, with two writing ‘women and children in boats.

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:29.998
Cannot last much longer”.

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:35.808
One of the most famous stories from the Titanic’s sinking is that the band

00:17:35.998 --> 00:17:40.228
kept playing whilst the ship went down, and this features in the movie.

00:17:41.078 --> 00:17:44.998
Whilst they were playing to calm passengers when the lifeboats were being

00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:49.218
filled, they soon packed up and strapped their instruments to their back.

00:17:50.328 --> 00:17:53.008
Sadly, none of the 8 musicians made it.

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:58.078
By five minutes past two, the last lifeboat leaves.

00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:04.158
There are 1,500 passengers remaining on board, with no options left.

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:08.788
The deck, the upper part of the ship, is now at such a

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:12.338
steep angle that it becomes almost impossible to stand.

00:18:12.908 --> 00:18:16.008
Hundreds fall or jump into the freezing water.

00:18:17.018 --> 00:18:20.698
Now, the sea temperature was 2 degrees below zero.

00:18:21.338 --> 00:18:24.368
Hypothermia would have set in within minutes.

00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:29.868
Two minutes later, at 2.17am, the Captain of the ship,

00:18:30.278 --> 00:18:34.128
Captain Smith, announces “it’s every man for himself”.

00:18:35.388 --> 00:18:41.498
The ship snaps in half and the stern, the back bit, sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

00:18:42.628 --> 00:18:48.368
Following a longstanding maritime tradition, Captain Smith goes down with his ship.

00:18:49.478 --> 00:18:52.268
Accounts of his death vary widely.

00:18:52.758 --> 00:18:57.968
Some say they saw him swimming towards a lifeboat, some say he sat by the

00:18:57.968 --> 00:19:02.888
wheel whilst it flooded, and some say they saw him shoot himself with a pistol.

00:19:03.588 --> 00:19:04.238
We’ll never know.

00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:12.908
A minute later, at 2:18, all the lights go out on the ship, plunging the tragic scene into darkness.

00:19:13.908 --> 00:19:18.428
And by 2.20am, just two minutes later, the rest of

00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:21.808
the ship sinks, floating to the bottom of the ocean.

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:26.548
Some resilient swimmers are pulled onto lifeboats.

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:31.768
In one of the most remarkable survival stories, the Titanic’s baker

00:19:32.128 --> 00:19:36.368
managed to survive long enough in the water to be pulled onto a boat.

00:19:37.368 --> 00:19:38.478
How did he manage it?

00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:42.388
Well, he says that he decided to drink a load of whiskey,

00:19:42.768 --> 00:19:46.808
and that this enabled him to stay calm to focus on swimming.

00:19:47.908 --> 00:19:54.108
Unfortunately, almost everyone else who fell into that icy water never made it out alive.

00:19:55.478 --> 00:20:00.108
The rescue ship, The Carpathia arrived at the scene 2 hours afterwards.

00:20:00.578 --> 00:20:05.698
It came as fast as it could, but it was 93km away when the Titanic struck

00:20:05.698 --> 00:20:11.338
the iceberg, and as you’ve heard, the entire tragedy was over very quickly.

00:20:12.488 --> 00:20:15.218
There was, however, a ship that was much closer,

00:20:15.408 --> 00:20:18.958
one that could perhaps have saved hundreds of lives.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:24.388
It was called The Californian, and it was only 25 kilometres away.

00:20:25.848 --> 00:20:30.978
The Captain of The Californian, and his lookouts did repeatedly see the lights

00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:36.618
and distress signals from The Titanic, but they thought them to be shooting stars.

00:20:37.728 --> 00:20:42.418
Others also misidentified the ship and didn’t believe it to be the Titanic.

00:20:43.758 --> 00:20:49.088
Crucially, the warning system wasn’t set up by the radio operator before he went to sleep,

00:20:49.418 --> 00:20:55.188
meaning any distress calls made by the Titanic fell on deaf ears, they weren’t heard

00:20:56.198 --> 00:21:03.138
. 
The Californian did eventually arrive, but only at 8:30am, 8:30 the following morning.

00:21:03.908 --> 00:21:09.308
Nobody could have lasted that long in the freezing temperatures, and all it found

00:21:09.438 --> 00:21:13.948
was the Carpathia rescuing the lucky few who had managed to get on a lifeboat.

00:21:15.188 --> 00:21:21.558
Perhaps surprisingly, no one knows the exact figures of how many people died on the early

00:21:21.558 --> 00:21:30.108
morning of April 15th, but it’s estimated that there were 703 survivors and 1503 deaths.

00:21:31.378 --> 00:21:34.658
And unfortunately, how much you paid for your ticket

00:21:34.898 --> 00:21:38.498
had a large impact on how likely you were to survive.

00:21:39.708 --> 00:21:44.418
Some 61% of the first-class passengers survived, whereas

00:21:44.588 --> 00:21:48.608
less than 25% of third-class passengers survived.

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:54.328
The evacuation deck was only accessible at first to upper class

00:21:54.328 --> 00:21:58.328
guests so poorer passengers were disproportionately affected.

00:21:59.328 --> 00:22:05.278
There were also reports of bribery, like the so-called ‘Money Boat’, where it was alleged that

00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:11.168
wealthy guests paid the lifeboat crew to sail away even though there was space for more people.

00:22:12.338 --> 00:22:15.218
Another reason that deaths were higher among third

00:22:15.218 --> 00:22:18.378
class passengers was that there were more families.

00:22:19.248 --> 00:22:23.218
When you consider the ‘men saved last’ policy, it’s important

00:22:23.228 --> 00:22:27.248
to underline that boys as young as 13 were considered men.

00:22:28.058 --> 00:22:34.368
As a result, mothers refused to leave their sons behind and countless families died together.

00:22:35.588 --> 00:22:39.128
As news of the disaster spread, the world was shocked.

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:43.768
Within days, both British and American investigations were launched.

00:22:44.328 --> 00:22:48.868
Death tolls like this were extremely rare, and with so many

00:22:48.968 --> 00:22:53.038
wealthy passengers on board, powerful people wanted answers.

00:22:53.968 --> 00:22:56.138
So, what were the findings?

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:59.158
Who is to blame, if anyone at all?

00:23:00.008 --> 00:23:04.378
This is the subject of much historical debate but by and large,

00:23:04.648 --> 00:23:09.508
it was considered to be just terrible misfortune, it was bad luck.

00:23:10.758 --> 00:23:14.738
No serious errors were found to have been made by the late Captain

00:23:14.738 --> 00:23:18.958
Smith, and the Titanic was on the correct course the entire time.

00:23:20.348 --> 00:23:24.778
More contemporary analysis shows that the North Atlantic Ocean was

00:23:24.848 --> 00:23:29.638
unusually icy at this time, which created strange weather conditions.

00:23:30.748 --> 00:23:35.398
Without getting too technical, these unusual conditions created something

00:23:35.398 --> 00:23:40.828
called, ‘abnormal refraction’ which causes light to bend unexpectedly.

00:23:41.748 --> 00:23:45.608
Visibility would have been far worse than it actually appeared

00:23:45.618 --> 00:23:50.348
to be, so the ship was only able to see the iceberg far too late.

00:23:51.808 --> 00:24:00.288
Also, whilst turning away from the iceberg seems like the best decision, peculiarly, a full-frontal

00:24:00.318 --> 00:24:06.768
impact, hitting the iceberg directly without changing course would likely have saved the ship.

00:24:07.718 --> 00:24:13.008
A Titanic architect gave evidence and said that in the event of crashing

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:17.248
directly into the ice, the front of the ship would have crumpled,

00:24:17.438 --> 00:24:22.198
killing around 40 firemen, but the rest would have held intact.

00:24:23.038 --> 00:24:29.148
It has to be said, however, that the other side of the debate judges those involved more harshly.

00:24:30.108 --> 00:24:36.078
Airtight areas weren’t completely sealed, which meant watertight compartments were anything but.

00:24:37.203 --> 00:24:42.288
Also, the steel and iron of the hull, of the bottom of the ship, were weakened

00:24:42.338 --> 00:24:47.218
by the freezing temperatures and speed of travel, which caused the rivets, the

00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:53.948
screws, to pop out easily, which massively sped up the speed at which the ship sank.

00:24:54.818 --> 00:24:59.488
And we can’t forget the crucial fact that no one had the key to the binoculars.

00:25:00.288 --> 00:25:03.738
Could spotting it seconds earlier have made all the difference?

00:25:04.218 --> 00:25:07.678
The story is filled with many agonising ‘what ifs?’.

00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:13.708
In terms of the legacy of the Titanic, to this day it remains one

00:25:13.738 --> 00:25:18.288
of the worst peacetime maritime disasters, in terms of loss of life.

00:25:19.288 --> 00:25:24.188
In the immediate aftermath, there were regulations that required all ships to have

00:25:24.188 --> 00:25:29.968
wireless equipment and crucially, there had to be a ‘lifeboat for every soul’ on board.

00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:34.821
And as to the question of where the Titanic is now, the

00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:38.301
ship still sits at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:44.201
Her wreck was discovered in 1985, but experts say that

00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:48.051
bringing it 4km to the surface would be impossible.

00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:53.621
What’s more, due to rust and water pressure, what remains

00:25:53.641 --> 00:25:57.481
of the ship will likely disintegrate within 30 years.

00:25:58.621 --> 00:26:04.211
So, while the physical remains of the ship will not be around for much longer, the tragic

00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:10.271
story of the Titanic will remain forever, a powerful reminder of the dangers of human pride,

00:26:10.724 --> 00:26:16.481
of the limits of engineering, or perhaps, simply of the immense power of mother nature.

00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:23.851
OK, that is it for today’s episode on The Titanic.

00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:29.111
I imagine you knew something of the story already, and perhaps you’ve seen the most famous

00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:34.101
film adaptation, but I hope that this went a little deeper into what really happened.

00:26:34.861 --> 00:26:38.201
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:26:38.611 --> 00:26:43.471
Have you ever read any of the heartwarming stories from survivors of the Titanic?

00:26:43.811 --> 00:26:48.381
Have you heard any of the tragic stories about husbands and wives who wouldn’t

00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:52.361
abandon each other, and perished together in the freezing cold waters?

00:26:52.991 --> 00:26:55.911
Why do you think that this story continues to have

00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:59.321
such a cultural impact, well over 100 years later?

00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:03.221
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:08.531

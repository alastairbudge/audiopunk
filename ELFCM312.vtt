Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.658
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:20.848
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:28.548
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series on the theme of Halloween.

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:34.668
In case you missed them, in part one we looked at the bloody history of vampires, and in part

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:40.754
two, which was one of our member-only ones, it was the hair-raising history of werewolves.

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:44.798
Today, we are finishing the mini-series with witches.

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:51.208
It’s a tragic story of superstition, of sexism, and how a misunderstanding

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:55.278
of science led to the murder of thousands of innocent women.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:02.103
OK then, let’s get started with the wicked story of witches.

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:07.683
Our story starts in the village of Salem in Massachusetts, in America.

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:15.373
Between 1692 and 1693, over 200 people out of a population

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:21.033
of roughly 500 were accused of witchcraft, the use of magic.

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:26.293
10 years after the last witch would be executed in England,

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:31.843
across the pond, in America, witchcraft hysteria was at its peak.

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:36.803
The event would become known as The Salem Witch Trials,

00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:40.143
arguably the most famous witch trials in history.

00:01:41.223 --> 00:01:47.803
It all began after two young girls in the village, Betty Parris and her cousin Abigail Williams

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:55.393
started experiencing horrible episodes of seizures, screaming, and pain throughout their bodies.

00:01:56.073 --> 00:02:02.203
They even crawled under furniture, threw things around their home, and made strange sounds.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:07.903
Understandably concerned, their family brought a doctor to the girls.

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:12.733
He could not find anything physically wrong with them and

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:17.483
his diagnosis was that they must be cursed by witchcraft.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:24.213
And soon, others around the village would slowly start to exhibit the same symptoms.

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:30.043
It did not take long for rumours of witchcraft to spread around Salem

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:35.433
and villagers would accuse each other of using magic to harm one another.

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:40.343
Soon enough, the trials and executions started.

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:48.073
The first to be executed was a lady called Bridget Bishop, after it was decided that it was she

00:02:48.263 --> 00:02:53.973
who had cursed the two young girls and had also attacked various other members of the community.

00:02:55.223 --> 00:03:00.663
As the trials continued, the two young girls began to make other accusations.

00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:05.213
Fingers were pointed and suspicions continued to grow.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:14.383
This cycle continued until hundreds had been accused, imprisoned, tortured and in some cases killed.

00:03:15.773 --> 00:03:20.963
20 of the accused, 14 of which were women, would face death by hanging.

00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:27.253
One, an 81-year-old man called Giles Corey, who was accused of

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:31.403
witchcraft along with his wife, would escape the hangman’s noose.

00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:36.253
I’m afraid though hanging would have been a blessing for Corey.

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.953
He was to suffer something much worse.

00:03:40.043 --> 00:03:45.073
Corey was what's called ‘pressed’, that is being slowly crushed

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:49.693
to death under a wooden board as weights were added one by one.

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:56.763
Five others were also accused, including two infant children, who died in prison.

00:03:57.543 --> 00:04:02.513
The village even had two dogs killed on suspicion of witchcraft.

00:04:03.573 --> 00:04:08.445
Yes, even children and dogs could not escape the hysteria of Salem.

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:13.065
So, what do historians think really happened?

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:17.805
If these poor women weren’t actually witches, which, of course,

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:21.565
they weren’t, why did they behave in such a strange way?

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:27.505
In the 1970s, a historian Linnda Caporael had an idea.

00:04:28.555 --> 00:04:33.275
She proposed that the village had been suffering the effects of a strange

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:38.225
fungus, rye ergot, that had grown on the wheat they used to make bread.

00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:44.955
This fungus has been described as nature’s LSD and it

00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:48.235
causes all of the symptoms the villagers were experiencing.

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:51.905
Essentially, everyone in the village was on

00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:55.602
hallucinogenic drugs, causing them to behave erratically.

00:04:56.592 --> 00:05:01.242
But of course, in 1692 there was no way these people had any

00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:05.182
awareness of this, so it was witchcraft that was to blame.

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:11.712
So this all begs the question - what exactly were they being accused of?

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.942
What was a witch?

00:05:14.202 --> 00:05:19.372
Why was it so bad, and why was being one punishable by death?

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:25.622
The ideas around witches at Salem had been brought over by European settlers

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:31.532
throughout the previous century and were the result of a long history of pagan beliefs.

00:05:32.562 --> 00:05:37.522
And while the idea of witches does exist in cultures across

00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:41.412
the globe, today we will be discussing European witches.

00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:49.282
A defining feature of these witches was that they could be any ordinary person who practises magic.

00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:54.072
In contrast, many other traditions and beliefs see

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:58.122
witches as beings with inherent supernatural powers.

00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:03.722
These European-style witches were usually women but

00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:07.382
could occasionally be men, children or even animals.

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:12.332
And fundamentally, their use of magic was believed to

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:17.372
make them a follower, or even worse, a lover of the devil.

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:24.802
Yes some people were convicted as witches on the basis that they had sex with the devil himself.

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:31.912
Clearly this was difficult, impossible, to prove, but there were plenty of signs

00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:37.312
that people came to believe indicated that someone, typically a woman, was a witch.

00:06:38.572 --> 00:06:44.142
Women who were old, women who had no children, women who had too many children,

00:06:44.562 --> 00:06:50.472
women who talked to themselves, who had pets, who did not attend church, who were too

00:06:50.472 --> 00:06:57.172
sexual, who were too intelligent, too ugly, too unfashionable, too rich or too poor.

00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:02.092
Any of these things could lead to suspicions you were a witch.

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:06.972
And I’m sure many of you are thinking that you too could have faced

00:07:06.972 --> 00:07:12.682
accusations of being a witch – these are not exactly a set of rare criteria.

00:07:13.752 --> 00:07:19.862
And although being a witch, and follower of the devil was clearly a bad thing to be accused of,

00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:26.772
ideas of women with positive supernatural powers have existed almost since the dawn of time.

00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:32.012
In ancient Greek mythology, for instance, there were figures such as

00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:37.132
the goddess of magic Hecate, or her daughter the enchantress Circe.

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:43.442
These mythical women were known to use magic both for good and evil.

00:07:44.112 --> 00:07:47.502
And for thousands of years there was this distinction

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:51.472
between black and white magic, good and bad magic.

00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:58.812
Pagan beliefs involved the use of both black and white magic, with white magic associated

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:04.442
with healing and a legitimate and celebrated practice often carried out by women.

00:08:05.512 --> 00:08:09.352
In contrast, black magic was typically thought to be

00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:13.492
spells that were intended to do harm, to damage someone.

00:08:14.832 --> 00:08:20.542
But by the 1200s, such beliefs were being stamped out in Europe by the Catholic

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:26.092
church, which declared that all magic was heretical, against Christianity.

00:08:26.877 --> 00:08:31.635
It might have been declared heretical, but it didn’t disappear altogether.

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:37.705
Instead, what happened was the categories of black and white magic became

00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:43.895
increasingly blurred and before long, white magic was also viewed with suspicion.

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:48.505
This was only made worse by misunderstandings about the

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:52.795
spread of diseases, most notably the plague, the Black Death.

00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:57.725
As the plague raged on and spread rapidly throughout the 14th

00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:01.895
century, people looked for someone or something to blame.

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:08.225
Perhaps unsurprisingly, in many instances it was those women who had been involved

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:13.375
in magical healing that were believed to be responsible for the outbreaks of disease.

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:17.155
And this was only made worse whenever there were

00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:20.745
poor harvests or diseases that also affected cattle.

00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:27.785
So, as a result of the church’s new views on magic and years of suffering due

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:32.625
to plagues, frustrations had reached an all time high by the 15th century.

00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:38.635
And as there was minimal evidence required for someone to be proven to be

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:42.845
a witch, it was a useful accusation for anyone you wanted to get rid of.

00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:49.565
Joan of Arc, now a patron saint of France, claimed she was acting under divine

00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:55.775
guidance, which led her to being tried for witchcraft and burned at the stake in 1431.

00:09:57.005 --> 00:10:02.185
And this rising anti-witch feeling even led the Pope to announce measures

00:10:02.195 --> 00:10:06.908
to be taken against witches, in the form of something called the Malleus

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:12.165
Maleficarum, or The Hammer of Witches, which was written in 1487.

00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:18.315
The book was written by a Catholic church official and it respresented the

00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:24.625
church’s official views on witches and how to capture, torture and execute them.

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:30.655
Basically, it was a guidebook for witch hunters, and it led to many

00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:34.525
witch hunts and the deaths of thousands of people for centuries.

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:39.365
It is estimated that over 16,000 people in Europe were

00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:44.015
executed as witches between the years of 1300 and 1850.

00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:51.455
Many thousands more were accused and tortured and likely died during torture or in prison.

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:58.615
And it was the Malleus Maleficarum, this book that laid out the basis for these accusations,

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:05.305
and it was also this text that firmly established the identification of women with witches.

00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:13.481
The book is an incredible piece of misogyny, sexism towards women, and included many of those

00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:20.391
ridiculous witch warning signs we mentioned earlier such as intelligence, fashion sense and age.

00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:28.581
Another characteristic the book highlighted was disfigurement, and this was believed to be a sign of

00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:35.061
the devil’s touch which is where the image of witches with warts on their noses or hands comes from.

00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:42.541
However, it wasn’t only old women with warts that had to be afraid of being accused of witchcraft.

00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:49.041
Young and old, beautiful or covered in warts, anyone could be accused of being a witch.

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:55.921
And looking through this guidebook, it’s clear that many of the signs of being a witch were simply

00:11:56.081 --> 00:12:03.111
signs of a woman not conforming to the expectations of the patriarchal, or male-dominated, society.

00:12:04.131 --> 00:12:07.731
For example, a woman who was too intelligent or too

00:12:07.731 --> 00:12:11.391
rich would not be as easy to control by her husband.

00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:17.671
But a woman who was too poor was not worthy of a husband and would either grow

00:12:17.691 --> 00:12:23.671
old alone and childless, therefore arousing suspicion, or enter into the typical

00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:28.811
female roles of midwifery or weaving, which might also lead to suspicion.

00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:35.301
So, given the book’s extremely general witch criteria, it's not surprising

00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:39.701
that it led to countless accusations of witchcraft, which led to hundreds

00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:44.621
of trials and countless executions, far worse than those seen at Salem.

00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:50.371
These trials which took place across Europe were large, continuous

00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:54.921
events that spanned many years due to the sheer amount of those accused

00:12:54.951 --> 00:12:59.851
and the long, painful process of imprisonment, torture and confession.

00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:04.381
Whole villages could find themselves involved in trials

00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:08.691
with hundreds accused despite very little or no evidence.

00:13:09.891 --> 00:13:14.571
The very worst of these trials took place in Germany, the country

00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:20.281
responsible for executing over 40% of all Europeans accused of witchcraft.

00:13:21.691 --> 00:13:25.391
One of the worst examples in Germany was the Würzburg

00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:30.212
trials, which took place between 1625 and 1631.

00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:38.161
These saw 900 people, 400 of which were children, burnt at the stake for being witches.

00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:45.351
The accusations ranged from the disgusting to the ridiculous, with children accused of

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:51.521
intercourse with demons and people condemned for humming a song in honour of the devil.

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:56.901
It’s not hard to see how these trials could end up involving thousands

00:13:56.901 --> 00:14:00.711
of people when you could be accused for simply humming a song.

00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:04.901
And it was not just villagers accusing one another,

00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:08.451
even monarchs, kings and queens, pointed the finger.

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:15.201
For example, in 1590, King James VI of Scotland, who was soon to become

00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:19.811
King of England too, blamed witchcraft for his recent misfortune at sea.

00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:25.861
King James had attempted to sail from just north of the English-Scottish border

00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:30.611
to Copenhagen, in order to marry his future wife, Princess Anne of Denmark.

00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:35.841
However, on his journey his fleet was met with a terrible

00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:39.871
storm which forced him to stop and take refuge in Norway.

00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:46.601
Did he consider for a moment that this might be the typical weather of the stormy North Sea?

00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:52.461
No, of course not, he blamed the disaster on witchcraft and the event

00:14:52.471 --> 00:14:57.091
started the king’s lifelong obsession with magic, witches and demons.

00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:02.721
First to be blamed for the storm was a lady called Geillis Duncan who was

00:15:02.731 --> 00:15:07.171
burnt alive at the stake after she confessed following days of torture.

00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:12.061
Soon after around 70 others would follow in her footsteps,

00:15:12.361 --> 00:15:15.861
many of whom she had been forced to name while being tortured.

00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:22.571
Perhaps unsurprisingly, whenever one of these poor women was being tortured and pressurised to

00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:28.191
name other “fellow” witches, they would name dozens of people in an attempt to stop the pain.

00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:34.052
The torture that people accused of being witches faced was truly horrific.

00:15:34.822 --> 00:15:38.222
Sometimes the victim was forced to stay awake for days

00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:41.602
and days until they were delirious and they confessed.

00:15:42.492 --> 00:15:49.395
Other more violent methods included whipping, or crushing their legs, fingers or toes with clamps.

00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:54.202
And we know that Geillis, the woman who was accused of causing the

00:15:54.202 --> 00:15:57.992
storm in the North Sea, had suffered all her fingers being crushed.

00:15:59.232 --> 00:16:04.892
Another common punishment was the ‘ducking stool’, and this is, I’m afraid, yet

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:10.282
another example of the deck being stacked, the system being rigged, against women.

00:16:11.402 --> 00:16:17.642
This was designed specifically for women and the victim would be strapped to a chair which was

00:16:17.642 --> 00:16:23.952
then submerged in freezing water for whatever amount of time the judges believed necessary.

00:16:25.142 --> 00:16:28.872
If she floated, if she came to the surface, she would

00:16:28.882 --> 00:16:32.962
be declared a witch, and most likely burned alive.

00:16:33.842 --> 00:16:40.522
If she sank, well, this was proof that she was innocent but she would probably die in the process.

00:16:41.842 --> 00:16:47.122
Another test to determine if the accused was a witch was seeing if they bled

00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:52.042
after being pricked with a needle, after a needle was put on their skin.

00:16:53.142 --> 00:16:57.272
If they did not bleed they would be found guilty of being a witch.

00:16:58.292 --> 00:17:04.262
But the problem was that a witch hunter would often use a blunt needle, a

00:17:04.362 --> 00:17:09.162
not sharp needle, that would not break the skin, or they would prick the poor

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:13.822
victim over and over again, waiting for one spot where it would not bleed.

00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:17.387
Why would they use these blunt needles?

00:17:17.387 --> 00:17:19.457
Why would they use these tactics?

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:24.742
Well because they were paid every time they successfully convicted a witch.

00:17:25.682 --> 00:17:31.352
Some people literally made a living through witch hunting, it was their job, so there

00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:36.952
was a clear incentive to find as many women as possible and “prove” they were witches.

00:17:38.152 --> 00:17:44.382
A man called Mathew Hopkins was one notorious English witch hunter, and it is said that he

00:17:44.382 --> 00:17:52.819
was responsible for the execution of 300 witches from the year 1644 until his death in 1647.

00:17:53.793 --> 00:17:59.702
3 years, 300 witches, 100 witches a year, one new one every few days.

00:18:00.052 --> 00:18:01.442
It was really quite something.

00:18:02.622 --> 00:18:08.992
Fortunately, the witch hunting madness wouldn’t last forever, and 35 years after Hopkins, the

00:18:09.162 --> 00:18:16.492
notorious witch hunter, died, in 1682 England would carry out its final execution of a witch.

00:18:17.872 --> 00:18:19.532
Why, you might be asking yourself?

00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:24.662
Why did people go from such unimaginable and illogical cruelty

00:18:24.922 --> 00:18:28.352
through to, well, at least a slightly more civilised society?

00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:35.422
Scholars have argued that witch trials had always been a result of war, religious tension,

00:18:35.732 --> 00:18:42.052
superstition, poor leadership, disease, and an underdeveloped understanding of medical science.

00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:46.432
And all of these issues had been present throughout Europe in

00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:51.412
the 14th to 17th Century when the witch hysteria really peaked.

00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:57.242
After the Black Death had ravaged through Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries,

00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:03.522
the 1500s saw the fracture of the Catholic Church, leading to countless religious,

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:08.952
civil and international wars and conflict between Catholics and Protestants.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:13.402
By the mid 17th century, much of this was over.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:21.772
The Treaty of Westphalia came in 1648, and by 1651 the English Civil War was over too.

00:19:22.732 --> 00:19:28.342
Shortly after, the Enlightenment started, and with it came a more nuanced, more

00:19:28.482 --> 00:19:33.202
developed understanding of everything from medical science to the rule of law.

00:19:34.112 --> 00:19:38.662
And clearly, accusing a woman of having sex with the devil because she

00:19:38.662 --> 00:19:43.072
has no children or she has lots of children makes absolutely no sense.

00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:50.042
As a result, life started looking brighter for anyone who might be accused of witchcraft.

00:19:50.782 --> 00:19:57.672
By 1735, England had even introduced the Witchcraft Act, which declared it a

00:19:57.712 --> 00:20:02.672
crime for a person to claim someone had magical powers or practised witchcraft.

00:20:03.396 --> 00:20:06.995
The act also outlawed the execution of witches.

00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:13.785
Other laws, too, helped to reduce the vast amount of accusations hurled towards women.

00:20:14.685 --> 00:20:19.955
For example, Britain continued to develop its Poor Laws, which helped

00:20:20.015 --> 00:20:24.215
to prevent women from falling into poverty and forced into positions,

00:20:24.425 --> 00:20:29.315
such as begging or prostitutition, that had formerly led to suspicions.

00:20:30.185 --> 00:20:34.505
Instead these women could be more welcomed members of society.

00:20:35.455 --> 00:20:39.955
And as Europe developed and modernised, witch fears faded.

00:20:40.485 --> 00:20:44.845
Which brings us to the modern day, and modern ideas of witches.

00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:50.545
In the 20th century, much like vampires and werewolves, witches

00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:55.165
became a mainstay of fiction, appearing in books, films and TV.

00:20:56.155 --> 00:21:01.845
By 1900, witches could even be the ‘good guys’, as in The Wizard of Oz,

00:21:01.965 --> 00:21:06.222
where this had a bad witch but there’s also a good one, called Glinda.

00:21:07.175 --> 00:21:12.225
And in most recent fiction, witches are often neither good nor bad.

00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.895
As you’ll know, the most popular children’s book series in

00:21:15.905 --> 00:21:19.695
history, Harry Potter, is all about wizards and witches.

00:21:20.922 --> 00:21:26.672
But outside of the world of fiction, in the real world, we can also, interestingly,

00:21:26.832 --> 00:21:33.212
see a rebirth of “witch culture”, or at least interest in witchcraft and paganism.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:42.062
One survey in 2008, found there were 340,000 people identifying as pagan in the

00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:49.422
United States, by 2014, another survey found 1.5 million, a staggering increase.

00:21:50.482 --> 00:21:55.472
This modern paganism has similarities with the white magic we talked about

00:21:55.532 --> 00:22:01.562
earlier - it uses herbs and healing, and can also involve fortune telling and spells.

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:08.242
There is even a whole subsection of TikTok dedicated to this called ‘Witch-Tok’.

00:22:09.272 --> 00:22:14.662
Now, it is chilling but fascinating to think about how tens of thousands of women were

00:22:14.892 --> 00:22:20.782
killed, only a few hundred years ago, for doing absolutely nothing wrong, for having

00:22:20.782 --> 00:22:26.062
committed the crime of being too poor or too rich, having no children or having too

00:22:26.062 --> 00:22:31.932
many, and who would have never even dared to experiment with any kind of magic like this.

00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:38.702
And now, in the 21st century, there are millions of people who are doing it, free from

00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:44.692
persecution, even though we have plenty of evidence that there is no scientific basis behind it.

00:22:45.512 --> 00:22:51.272
So, the next time you see someone wearing a witch costume, or someone talking about spells

00:22:51.272 --> 00:22:57.482
or white magic, you’ll know that the story of witches is in fact one of misogyny, of the

00:22:57.702 --> 00:23:04.492
murder of women of all ages, and it’s a story that goes a lot deeper than cheap black hats.

00:23:07.382 --> 00:23:12.622
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on witches, and with it comes

00:23:12.622 --> 00:23:16.322
the end of this three-part mini-series on the theme of Halloween.

00:23:17.002 --> 00:23:21.562
As you’ll have seen with all three, the stories of vampires, werewolves

00:23:21.602 --> 00:23:26.242
and witches are partly one of an innate human desire to create

00:23:26.362 --> 00:23:30.342
mythical creatures, but partly as a way to make sense of the unknown.

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:36.633
As always I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:23:37.103 --> 00:23:42.103
Do you have any interesting stories about witches or witchcraft from your culture?

00:23:43.027 --> 00:23:47.927
Were you surprised by the elaborate histories behind what have become simple Halloween costumes?

00:23:48.387 --> 00:23:51.677

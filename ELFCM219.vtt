Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.530
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.860
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.100
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Curiosities of Colour.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.460
This isn’t going to be an attempt to cover the vast and fascinating entire history

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.980
of colour, but we will explore some of the curiosities associated with colour.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.890
We’ll explore this through some unusual stories of five different colours, and on our journey

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.490
we’ll see how our understanding of colour has changed over time, what different colours have been

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.540
associated with different things, why the use of different colours has changed over time, and we’ll

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.460
end with some interesting colourful idioms and examples of what different colours mean in English.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.740
We have a lot to get through, so let’s get started right away.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.860
Let me start by asking you a question.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.570
How many colours are there?

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.754
Well, you might think first of the three “primary colours”: red, blue and

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:34.130
yellow, and think that every other colour is simply a mixture of these three.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.270
Or, you might think of the 7 colours of the rainbow:

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.230
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.790
Or you might think of the 11 main colours that children are taught about in school:

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.980
Black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, orange, pink, purple, and gray.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.880
If you are someone who enjoys painting or works with colours, you can no doubt name some more.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.160
Turquoise, Amber, Aquamarine, even Claret.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.200
And no doubt you could name many more in your mother tongue.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.800
The reality is that there are millions of colours, and  by some

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.610
definitions there is even an infinite number of different colours.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:34.940
Your web browser can display, to be precise 16,777,216 different colours, each identified

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.610
by a different what’s called HEX code, which is a combination of 6 numbers and letters.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.210
The purple-ish colour used on the leonardoenglish.com website is #6c63ff,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.120
for example, while the blue-ish colour used on the Guardian is #052961.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.730
Creating these colours on a screen is as simple as choosing the alphanumeric code you want.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.320
And of course you can go to an art shop and buy different

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.320
paints, mix them together and make different colours yourself.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.860
Being able to create literally millions of different colours is something we now take for granted.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.370
To state the obvious, it used to be a lot harder.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.990
Going back to the earliest discoveries of prehistoric art, it was clear that people

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.410
wanted to use different colours, they were just restricted to what was readily available.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.520
In prehistoric art, this meant relatively dark colours in general.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.840
You could use mud, earth from the ground to create browns and reds.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.100
You could burn wood to create black.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.130
If you could find chalk, you could create white and yellow.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.980
And reds, especially dark reds, could come from blood.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.160
For this reason, the majority of prehistoric art tends to use

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.700
these five colours as a base: black, white, red, yellow and brown.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.330
As time went on, different societies discovered how to create different

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.220
types of colour, and we are going to explore the curious history of

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.500
five of these colours today: red, blue, purple, yellow and white.

00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:39.260
But before we do that, a brief introduction to some of the history of the science of colour.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.320
We now know that colour comes from light, without light there is no colour.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.370
Light, however, was originally seen, in the Christian tradition at least, as entirely given by God.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.490
The Bible literally has this as its third verse: “And

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.340
God said, Let there be light: and there was light”.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.110
So, light was a gift from God, but in the late 17th Century a brilliant

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.710
young man made a fascinating discovery about this gift, about light.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.950
The 24-year-old Isaac Newton had been building on ideas about the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.670
nature of light developed by Descartes in the early 17th century.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.150
Previous to this, people believed that colour was just a mixture of light and darkness.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.040
Newton’s most famous development, at least relating to light, was when he

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.630
used a prism - a glass object - to show that what looked like a white light

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.040
was actually made up of a wide spectrum, a wide range, of different colours.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.920
People had seen this before, but believed that the prism was adding colour to the light.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.140
Newton’s revolutionary addition was to add another prism behind.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.410
The light went through the first prism and split into a spectrum of colours, and then

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.170
the second prism turned the full spectrum of colours back into white light again.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.520
Ta-da, it was clear now that the prism didn’t actually add

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.170
colour to light, the colour actually came from the light itself.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.620
And ever since then no one viewed colour in quite the same way.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:41.810
Interestingly, Newton first only divided the spectrum into five different colours - red,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:50.170
yellow, green, blue and purple - but then added two more, orange and indigo, because he

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:56.140
was a big fan of Pythagoras, and believed that the number seven had special properties.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.020
There are seven days of the week, seven natural notes, seven is a prime number, and so on.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.030
So, Newton added two colours, orange and indigo, and

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.230
this is why there are seven colours of the rainbow.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.720
Whether there are really five or seven is immaterial, it doesn’t really matter,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.060
the point is that Newton’s discovery showed the full spectrum of colours, and

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.240
proved that different colours could be created by mixing different ones together.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.180
Now, to explore the curiosities of colour, we are going to explore some of the history of five

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:43.100
colours - not exactly the original five named by Isaac, but five with some interesting stories.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:49.110
In each case, I hope to show you that, although our attitudes towards colour may

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.380
have changed, they always reflect very human underlying emotions and prejudices.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.610
Where shall we start?

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:04.660
Red is as good a place as any, and let’s start with an interesting fact about the colour

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:11.850
red: we, humans, are one of the few creatures on Earth that can see the colour red.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.650
When a matador waves his red flag at a bull in a bullring,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.880
the bull doesn’t charge because of the colour that he sees.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.420
He charges because of the waving movement of the cloth.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.610
From humankind‘s early days, red has been associated with

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.560
high passions – in particular sexual passion and danger.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:44.970
Men are, reportedly, particularly susceptible to the attraction or lure of red.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:52.550
There was actually an experiment conducted by the University of South Brittany in

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.660
France where waitresses were instructed to wear exactly the same style of t-shirt,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.830
only in five different colours: black, white, red, blue, green, and yellow.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:12.260
Interestingly enough, on the days in which the waitresses wore red t-shirts

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:19.680
the tips they received from male customers were anywhere from 15 to 26% higher.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.850
The development of different kinds of reds takes us

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.270
into the weird world of what’s called sumptuary laws.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:35.740
In Europe of the 13th and 14th centuries, laws dictated or told

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.500
you what sort of clothes and which colours you should wear.

00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:43.670
Bizarrely this depended on your social class.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.490
If you were an ordinary kind of person, say a labourer,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.060
you would be expected to wear dark brown clothing.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:59.156
This cloth was made through using a cheap dye which was a sort of clay colour.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.990
By contrast, the much more expensive and therefore high-class or prestigious bright red or

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.230
scarlet was the preserve of high-ranking men of the church – bishops and cardinals, for example.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:22.860
Interestingly, the association of bright red with prostitution and so-called red

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.786
light areas goes back to the Bible and the bright-red coloured beast that the

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:34.066
Whore of Babylon, described in the Old Testament Book of Revelations, sits on.

00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:39.836
Red’s association with high passions is thought to be because of its

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:46.046
associations, not only with red blood and red meat, but also with the

00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:51.805
ripe and red fruit, such as apples, that humankind has been attracted to.

00:10:52.695 --> 00:10:59.045
And to our final curiosity of red: in almost every country red seems to have

00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:05.495
been the first colour [other than black and white] to be given a name, with its

00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:12.715
symbolic appeal often drawn from blood, evoking strength, virility and fertility.

00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:19.935
Now, moving on to what is considered to be the most popular colour in the world: blue.

00:11:20.755 --> 00:11:26.505
Interestingly enough, the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Japanese and Hebrews did

00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:31.595
not have a name for blue and considered it to be a different type of green.

00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:37.715
Even today several languages, including, I believe, Korean, Vietnamese,

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:42.855
Thai, and Kurdish don’t make a clear distinction between blue and green.

00:11:43.614 --> 00:11:49.019
To many of you this might seem strange, as blue is all around us.

00:11:49.489 --> 00:11:53.519
Blue is one of the most dominant colours in the natural world.

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:57.339
Look up to the sky and you will see a blue colour.

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:02.779
Look to the seas and oceans and you will also find a large wall of blue.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:08.969
And looking down at our planet from space, the vast majority of it looks blue.

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:15.579
Of course, as we are told as children, the sky isn’t actually blue - it appears

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:20.519
blue because of the way in which the sun’s light is scattered when it hits the

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:26.609
atmosphere, and that’s why the sky turns red or orange at sunrise or sunset.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.944
And similarly, the sea isn’t “blue” either - it simply appears

00:12:31.954 --> 00:12:36.504
blue because the water absorbs the red light part of the spectrum.

00:12:37.404 --> 00:12:45.584
In any case, in the imagination of most cultures, the link is there: the sky and the seas are blue.

00:12:46.394 --> 00:12:52.190
There’s the sense that blue is a powerful force of nature, and that’s why it’s used in

00:12:52.190 --> 00:13:00.390
so many logos and flags to put the message across of something fundamental - whether

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:06.190
it’s the beloved British National Health Service or the flag of the European Union.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.950
But blue has not always been so sought after or desirable.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.920
Not only did the Romans associate blue with barbarism because the Celtic soldiers of

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:26.750
Britain dyed their bodies blue, but they also associated blue with mourning and misfortune.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:35.090
Blue‘s rise to prominence is associated with the rare and precious rock, lapis lazuli,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:40.970
from which you could create the powerful, intense deep blue colour of ultramarine.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.570
Prior to the 18th century, this magical stone, this lapis lazuli

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.790
came from a single source in the mountains of Afghanistan.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.990
The deep blue colour of the lapis lazuli stone has appealed to people since the

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:04.630
dawn of time, and there’s evidence of it being used in jewellery going back to

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:11.326
the 7th century BC, and it’s even used on the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankamen.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:19.700
It would be mined, polished, and used as jewellery, but the stone would normally be left intact.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:27.170
Starting in the medieval era, it was increasingly exported to Europe, where it would be

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:33.870
ground into a powder and turned into the colour ultramarine, meaning “beyond the sea”.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.920
This was a very complicated process though.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.590
First the mineral itself had to be mined in Afghanistan, then it needed

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.590
to be shipped all the way to Europe, then it would be ground down into a

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.690
powder and turned into a paint, a process which involved 50 different stages

00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:03.730
.
And after all of this, 1 kilogram of the mineral lapis lazuli would only get you about 30g of paint.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:10.490
So, as you might imagine, it was incredibly expensive, more expensive than gold.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:17.680
For this reason it was typically reserved for particularly important parts of a painting,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:25.580
the dress of the Virgin Mary, for example, and was associated with extreme wealth and luxury.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.390
Now, moving on, purple, a mixture of red and blue, is our next colour.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.350
Glancing at your phone, you will note that varieties

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.890
of purple are popular with the branding of companies.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:47.480
The Leonardo English logo is purple - now, if you’re thinking this is because of some deep

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:53.640
strategic research or the product of extensive focus groups, I’m sorry to disappoint you.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.800
It’s only because since I was a little boy I’ve always loved the colour purple.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:06.180
Like blue, it is a rare thing in nature - it’s not an easy colour to create.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.360
The story of how to create the colour purple has its own

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:17.060
interesting myth, and it centres around a Greek hero and a dog.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.300
According to the legend, the dog belonging to Hercules, the Greek hero,

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:29.200
returned one day to his master with a purple stain around his mouth.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.760
Hercules realised that the dog had been eating sea snails, he went to investigate,

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:43.840
and found that a particular type of sea snail gave off a sort of purple dye.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:51.320
This tale might well be a myth, but for thousands of years the only way to make

00:16:51.584 --> 00:16:57.794
the particularly bright and powerful purple called Tyrian Purple was by using

00:16:57.794 --> 00:17:04.124
sea snails, sea snails that were native to Tyre, a city in modern-day Lebanon.

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:10.254
Each of these small creatures contained one or two drops of purple

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:17.758
juice, and you would need 12,000 to create just one gramme of purple dye.

00:17:18.968 --> 00:17:24.648
The process of creating this purple dye was long, expensive, and very smelly.

00:17:25.548 --> 00:17:32.078
After gathering your tens of thousands of snails you would need to crush them, ensuring

00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:38.058
that you have plenty of their natural juices to keep the mixture moist, or wet.

00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:46.778
Then you would simmer or gently boil and ferment this mixture in urine for up to ten days.

00:17:47.678 --> 00:17:55.018
The smell given off by this process was said to be beyond disgusting, completely foul, horrible.

00:17:56.238 --> 00:18:01.188
As you can imagine, the resulting dye was extremely valuable – double

00:18:01.198 --> 00:18:04.958
the worth of gold at one point - and much sought after.

00:18:06.078 --> 00:18:10.578
In terms of hours worked, an ordinary labourer would need to work for

00:18:10.698 --> 00:18:17.118
24 years in order to buy just a small quantity of this precious stuff.

00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:24.498
Unsurprisingly, this dye was only affordable for those at the very top of society.

00:18:25.108 --> 00:18:30.038
Reportedly it was the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra’s favourite colour, and

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:35.128
it’s from Cleopatra that it became the favourite colour of Roman emperors.

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:41.748
When Julius Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, having become Cleopatra’s

00:18:41.758 --> 00:18:46.748
lover, he introduced the purple toga to Rome, and citizens of a

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:51.428
certain class were allowed to have a purple stripe on their toga.

00:18:52.338 --> 00:18:56.048
But only one man was allowed to wear the full purple

00:18:56.048 --> 00:19:00.468
toga - the Big Cheese or big boss himself, Julius Caesar.

00:19:01.758 --> 00:19:06.558
And for centuries, purple remained a colour associated with

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:10.448
power and privilege, due to the high cost of production.

00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:17.568
It was only in the 19th century that a synthetic way to produce purple was discovered.

00:19:18.328 --> 00:19:24.788
This happened when a young Londoner, eighteen year old William Perkins, who was trying to

00:19:24.828 --> 00:19:33.803
create a cure for malaria from coal tar accidentally discovered a synthetic purple dye in 1856.

00:19:35.118 --> 00:19:42.778
The factory he subsequently set up made him rich and created his own purple colour, mauve.

00:19:43.488 --> 00:19:47.878
This colour became widely used in Victorian London – in

00:19:48.068 --> 00:19:51.658
everything from postage stamps to the work of painters.

00:19:52.678 --> 00:19:57.108
You will, for example, find plenty of this mauve, this purple

00:19:57.108 --> 00:20:00.738
colour, in the paintings of London done by Claude Monet.

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:07.148
It is an intriguing curiosity that the popular image of late Victorian

00:20:07.168 --> 00:20:13.448
or 19th Century London, which is of a black and white world, is in fact a

00:20:13.638 --> 00:20:18.688
misrepresentation of what Victorian London really looked like: there would have

00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:24.798
been plenty of purple, or mauve, thanks to William Perkins‘s accidental discovery.

00:20:26.048 --> 00:20:31.488
Now, onto our penultimate colour, our second-last colour, yellow.

00:20:32.278 --> 00:20:38.918
Yellow is the most visible colour on the spectrum - it’s the easiest one to see, and is therefore

00:20:38.918 --> 00:20:45.608
the colour most commonly used to attract people‘s attention - think of the yellow, “hi-vis”

00:20:45.608 --> 00:20:52.428
jackets or gilets that everyone from school children on school trips to road workers use.

00:20:53.028 --> 00:20:57.908
It’s also the colour that most societies believed the sun to be.

00:20:58.668 --> 00:21:04.078
Like the sky or sea, the sun isn’t actually one colour in particular.

00:21:04.474 --> 00:21:09.828
It might appear yellow at certain times of the day, or red or orange at others,

00:21:09.988 --> 00:21:15.228
but this is only because of how its light is scattered by the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:23.108
If you see photos of the sun from space, it looks white, because it’s actually emitting white light.

00:21:24.308 --> 00:21:29.078
In any case, yellow is the colour most commonly associated with the sun.

00:21:29.868 --> 00:21:36.588
This and yellow‘s association with that most precious of metals, gold, gives yellow

00:21:36.818 --> 00:21:43.298
such a strong association in many cultures with wealth, good fortune and the divine.

00:21:44.218 --> 00:21:49.028
For example, in India, the bright yellow spice, turmeric, is

00:21:49.238 --> 00:21:53.338
thrown over couples when they are newly married – or newlyweds.

00:21:54.338 --> 00:22:02.148
Not so appetising or promising is yellow‘s link with decay, rottenness and the unwanted.

00:22:03.028 --> 00:22:10.418
These associations probably go back both to the yellowish colour of urine and also, more poetically,

00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:19.050
to the yellow foliage or leaves of autumn, much used by Shakespeare as an emblem of ageing.

00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:24.268
Macbeth, for example, famously says “I have lived long enough.

00:22:24.728 --> 00:22:29.218
My way of life/Is fall'n into the sere — the yellow leaf

00:22:29.938 --> 00:22:32.648
”. 
Sere, here means dry, all dried up.

00:22:33.388 --> 00:22:39.688
So Macbeth is saying that he is like a yellow leaf, dried up in the autumn.

00:22:40.838 --> 00:22:46.388
The most alarming gruesome and abhorrent use of yellow is as a

00:22:46.398 --> 00:22:51.538
symbol of racial oppression and in particular of anti-semitism.

00:22:52.328 --> 00:22:59.568
Racist legislation throughout the centuries has forced Jews to identify themselves through yellow.

00:23:00.638 --> 00:23:07.998
Going all the way back to the 13th century, Jews living in various European states, from modern day

00:23:08.008 --> 00:23:15.605
Germany to Spain, England to Italy, have been forced to identify themselves by wearing yellow stars,

00:23:15.675 --> 00:23:23.525
then yellow large hats in the 16th century, and of course in Nazi Germany the yellow star again.

00:23:24.265 --> 00:23:28.915
And you don’t need me to remind you of the tragic consequences of that.

00:23:29.935 --> 00:23:37.455
Our final colour, white, will, alas, offer little chance for a heartening conclusion to our curious

00:23:37.455 --> 00:23:44.435
wander through the world of colour, as white, like yellow, has its fair share of links with racism.

00:23:45.185 --> 00:23:50.335
It is difficult to trace all the origins of these links, but here are a few.

00:23:51.105 --> 00:23:58.465
It has always been difficult and expensive to process materials in order for them to appear white.

00:23:59.145 --> 00:24:04.975
Therefore white has long been connected in people‘s minds with money and power.

00:24:05.935 --> 00:24:13.225
In Ancient Egypt and Rome white was the colour of the clothes worn by priests and priestesses,

00:24:13.575 --> 00:24:20.355
and indeed even today white is the colour worn by senior religious leaders such as the pope.

00:24:21.295 --> 00:24:26.445
In much of European history only the very wealthy could afford to

00:24:26.445 --> 00:24:31.155
keep their clothes white because they had the money to employ many

00:24:31.155 --> 00:24:34.955
servants who would do all that time-consuming washing work for them.

00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:43.355
This association of white with quality was even evident in the way that in the 1930s

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:51.115
white bread became the preferred choice in the UK and USA over its brown, wholemeal [and

00:24:51.195 --> 00:24:58.625
incidentally much healthier] rival, which was associated with the less affluent, the less rich.

00:24:59.544 --> 00:25:02.574
Fast forward to our 21st-century world.

00:25:03.194 --> 00:25:09.654
Now, on trend designers have taken the age-old association of white with sexual

00:25:09.664 --> 00:25:15.144
purity and applied it more broadly in order to make their products attractive.

00:25:15.934 --> 00:25:22.134
Consider, for example, the use of white in the design of Apple‘s high end products.

00:25:23.174 --> 00:25:28.074
We can perhaps even trace this back to the history of ancient Greece and Rome.

00:25:28.824 --> 00:25:35.884
When in the 16th century the idea of the Classical, grand building was given new life by the

00:25:35.884 --> 00:25:43.734
Venetian architect Andrea Palladio, the powerful Classical concept of grandeur in building was

00:25:43.764 --> 00:25:50.974
tied in with the white colour of the buildings’ material - often Italian and always white marble.

00:25:51.904 --> 00:25:56.124
It was only in the mid-19th century that researchers realised that

00:25:56.144 --> 00:26:01.114
the classical statues and buildings of ancient Greece and Rome had

00:26:01.114 --> 00:26:05.854
in fact been usually brightly painted, they weren’t white at all.

00:26:06.654 --> 00:26:11.674
By that time, however, European colonialism and in particular

00:26:11.914 --> 00:26:15.614
British colonialism was spreading into Africa and India.

00:26:16.794 --> 00:26:23.384
In the same way that Victorian buildings were built on Classical models, so these imperialists

00:26:23.544 --> 00:26:30.194
saw themselves as built or fashioned in the same mould as the creators of Ancient Greece and Rome.

00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:37.704
Somehow, bizarre as it might seem, the link between the white, sparkling marble of ancient

00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:45.307
statues and buildings and the supposed superiority of white races seems to have been made.

00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:49.734
This is even more absurd when one stops to consider that the

00:26:50.074 --> 00:26:54.958
“white” of Caucasian people is, as the English novelist E.M.

00:26:54.988 --> 00:27:01.918
Forster described it in the 1920s, really a kind of “pinko-grey”, not very white at all.

00:27:03.008 --> 00:27:10.648
Now, when it comes to colours in English, like in many languages, cultural and sociological beliefs

00:27:10.818 --> 00:27:17.428
about the properties of colour have made their way into language, so let’s explore some of these.

00:27:18.398 --> 00:27:24.098
Firstly, you can be caught “red handed”, meaning you are caught in the middle of something.

00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:30.058
For example, if you find your child sitting next to a packet of chocolate biscuits

00:27:30.088 --> 00:27:35.168
with chocolate all around their mouth, you might say you caught them red handed.

00:27:36.268 --> 00:27:42.508
If something comes “out of the blue”, it comes from nowhere, it is very unexpected.

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:47.968
Your friend might tell you that a job opportunity came completely out of the blue.

00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:52.288
If someone is going through a “purple patch”, they

00:27:52.288 --> 00:27:55.468
are going through a period of good luck or success.

00:27:56.078 --> 00:28:00.347
If someone has a “yellow streak”, on the other hand, it means

00:28:00.347 --> 00:28:05.267
that they have a tendency to be cowardly, a tendency to be afraid.

00:28:05.887 --> 00:28:12.057
For example, you could say that your friend is a good person but he has a bit of a yellow streak.

00:28:12.797 --> 00:28:20.237
And if you tell a “white” lie, it’s an unimportant lie, an untruth that doesn’t really matter.

00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:25.167
For example, you might tell your child that they can go on a space

00:28:25.167 --> 00:28:29.127
rocket when they’re older, even if it might not technically be true.

00:28:30.017 --> 00:28:34.237
And there are plenty of idioms that refer to colours in general.

00:28:34.977 --> 00:28:39.787
If you show someone your true colours, you show them your true character.

00:28:40.277 --> 00:28:45.557
If you pass an exam with “flying” colours, you do an excellent job.

00:28:46.207 --> 00:28:52.297
If you add colour to something, it means to describe it in greater detail.

00:28:53.457 --> 00:28:58.757
So, there we have it, colour, and some of the curiosities therein.

00:28:59.667 --> 00:29:04.347
It’s pretty amazing to think about how our perception of colour has

00:29:04.357 --> 00:29:09.227
changed over time, how we have assigned different meanings to colour,

00:29:09.607 --> 00:29:13.547
that different colours have different qualities and associations.

00:29:14.337 --> 00:29:18.377
And even more amazing to think that colour is something that,

00:29:18.837 --> 00:29:22.997
in the literal sense at least, doesn’t actually exist at all.

00:29:25.757 --> 00:29:31.227
OK then that is it for today’s episode on The Curiosities of Colour.

00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:36.167
We have only just scratched the surface of this fascinating topic, but

00:29:36.387 --> 00:29:40.367
I hope that it has added some colour to the curious world of colour.

00:29:41.297 --> 00:29:44.707
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:29:44.927 --> 00:29:49.577
What are some associations of different colours in your language and culture?

00:29:50.017 --> 00:29:54.497
Are these the same or different to some of the ones I’ve mentioned in English?

00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:58.007
And how is colour used in your mother tongue?

00:29:58.617 --> 00:30:02.737
I’m sure there are some brilliant idioms, and I would love to know what they are.

00:30:03.247 --> 00:30:06.087
So, let’s get this discussion started.

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:11.207

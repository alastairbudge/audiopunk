Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:16.656
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.656 --> 00:00:21.076
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.916
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are talking about one of the

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:29.616
world’s most iconic public transport systems, the London Underground.

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:34.446
It’s a sprawling system that connects one of the world's megacities,

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:38.376
and handles over a billion passenger journeys every single year.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:45.176
It was, as you may know, the first underground rail system in the world, creating a

00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:51.606
blueprint that has been followed everywhere from Seoul to Sao Paulo, Bucharest to Bangkok.

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:57.916
And in this episode we’ll take a short look at its history, and learn how it grew from a

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:04.296
handful of dark, smoky underground tunnels into a state of the art public transport system.

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:10.386
So, let’s get right into it and talk about the history of the London underground.

00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:17.696
To start us off, I wanted to tell you a few statistics, a few numbers, to give

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:22.976
you some idea of just how big - and busy - the London underground really is.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.726
Every year over a billion passenger journeys are made

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:30.996
on the London underground, up to 5 million per day.

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:37.196
Sure, it’s no longer the world's biggest in terms of the number of passengers, that

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:42.556
prize goes to Seoul, with 3 billion trips per year, but it is still considerable.

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:50.576
The London Underground network consists of 272 stations, and is split up into 11

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:55.816
different lines, or routes, we might say, covering over 400 kilometres of track.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:02:01.266
It is a sprawling network of underground lines dug deep beneath the

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:05.686
city, responsible for carrying busy Londoners all over the capital.

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:11.869
The journey to get there, however, was long and not exactly straightforward.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.929
To be precise, the first London Underground line opened in 1863,

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.639
more than 100 years before today’s busiest subway system, Seoul.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.686
And this is what is particularly impressive, in my view, that the work

00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:33.126
on the London subway system started while the American Civil War was

00:02:33.126 --> 00:02:37.826
still going on, 10 years before Napoleon III took his last breath.

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:43.656
The point is, it’s very old, and that’s where our story will start.

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:51.692
Now, London has long been the largest city in England, but until the Industrial Revolution it was

00:02:51.692 --> 00:03:00.252
still relatively small - something like 14,000 people in the 15th century, 350,000 in the 17th

00:03:00.252 --> 00:03:08.894
century, but shortly after this its population began to balloon, to swell, to grow dramatically.

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:16.644
To give you some idea of just how quickly it grew, in 1780 there were around

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:24.694
750,000 people living in London, but by 1815 it had almost doubled, to 1.4

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:30.664
million, and then doubled again by 1860, to almost three million people.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:37.524
It might have been a big city, but people still lived relatively “local” lives.

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:42.694
Travelling from one part of the city to another wasn’t easy, and

00:03:42.694 --> 00:03:46.994
besides, for most people, there simply wasn’t a reason to do it.

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:53.444
For those that did need to travel from one part of the city to another, the options were limited.

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.864
There were primitive public horse buses.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:04:01.634
A horse bus is exactly what it sounds like, it’s a bus pulled by a horse.

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:08.154
By 1832 there were 400 horse buses in the capital, but it

00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:10.904
wasn’t a particularly convenient way of getting around.

00:04:12.264 --> 00:04:15.304
For those who could afford it, they would have private

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:19.044
horse and carriages, but even this was hardly ideal.

00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:24.024
The roads were busy and dirty, so it wasn’t exactly easy.

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:30.544
What’s more, London has a big river running through the middle, The Thames.

00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:38.884
Today there are 35 bridges that cross the river, but in the early 19th century there were only two.

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:45.724
The point I'm trying to make is that getting around the city was no simple task.

00:04:46.574 --> 00:04:48.114
So, what could be done?

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:54.834
Well, outside the cities, Great Britain had been experiencing a boom in the railways.

00:04:55.424 --> 00:05:03.168
The Liverpool-Manchester railway had opened in 1830, and by 1852 there was over 10,000

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:08.094
kilometres of railway track across the country, connecting every major town and city.

00:05:09.364 --> 00:05:14.674
Clearly, trains were an effective means of transport, but it wasn’t

00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:18.064
exactly like you could construct a trainline in the middle of a city.

00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:22.304
I mean, there were houses, streets, there was a city in the way.

00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:27.534
But a group of innovative civil engineers had an idea.

00:05:28.674 --> 00:05:32.334
What if we added a train line below the city?

00:05:33.694 --> 00:05:40.814
It seemed like a mad idea, but a private company called “Metropolitan Line” was given permission

00:05:40.824 --> 00:05:46.404
to start work on an underground railway line, which would connect Paddington railway station

00:05:46.654 --> 00:05:52.454
in the west with Farringdon railway station in the City of London, in the heart of the city.

00:05:54.044 --> 00:05:56.394
Construction started in 1860.

00:05:57.184 --> 00:06:01.334
It was technically underground, but it wasn’t so far underground.

00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:08.134
Workers dug a hole, built a sort of tunnel around it, and then covered it over with earth again.

00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:16.564
It opened to the public in 1863, and was a rip roaring success, it was a great success.

00:06:17.714 --> 00:06:22.754
On its first day, 38,000 passengers used it, travelling

00:06:22.754 --> 00:06:25.574
the 6 kilometres from Paddington to Farringdon.

00:06:26.934 --> 00:06:30.484
And, not to spoil the story, but if you have been to

00:06:30.484 --> 00:06:33.864
London you will know that this line still stands today.

00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:37.224
There is a line of the Underground called The Metropolitan

00:06:37.224 --> 00:06:40.354
Line that links up Paddington and Farringdon Stations.

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:43.366
It’s somewhat different today, of course.

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:49.134
The first iteration of the Underground, of the tube, as it's now called, had

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:54.844
wooden carriages that were lit by gas lanterns and pulled by steam trains.

00:06:55.654 --> 00:07:00.174
It wouldn’t have been particularly comfortable, but it was revolutionary.

00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:05.434
Almost immediately, there were plans to expand the line,

00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:09.528
to add more stations, and to continue to connect the city.

00:07:10.948 --> 00:07:15.418
By the 1870s, technological developments meant that these underground

00:07:15.428 --> 00:07:20.728
train lines could be dug and built much deeper, far below the city,

00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:25.998
but even these deeper lines still used more traditional steam trains.

00:07:26.938 --> 00:07:31.648
These thin, narrow tunnels were drilled to almost exactly the width of the

00:07:31.648 --> 00:07:36.128
trains in the shape of a tube, which is where the name ‘the tube’ comes from.

00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:44.388
And although these underground networks existed in the 1860s and 1870s, they didn’t become

00:07:44.388 --> 00:07:51.068
entirely practical or popular until they began running on electricity in the late 1880s.

00:07:52.168 --> 00:07:57.478
What's more, for the first 70 years of its existence, the London underground

00:07:57.628 --> 00:08:02.868
was still owned and operated by a series of different private companies, which

00:08:02.868 --> 00:08:07.908
meant that efforts to expand and invest in it weren’t particularly coordinated.

00:08:09.018 --> 00:08:15.948
But after it was brought into public ownership in 1933, things really started to change

00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:21.548
- decisions could be more long-term, rather than made with the aim of short-term profit.

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:27.688
And clearly when you need to invest lots of money to dig large tunnels underground and

00:08:27.858 --> 00:08:33.708
you are creating a public, not private transport system, long term thinking is important.

00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:40.258
Now, before we move on with our historical journey, I want to alert you to another

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:45.638
revolutionary aspect of the London Underground from 1933, the year that it was

00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:51.008
brought into public ownership, and that is the map of the London Underground.

00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:58.588
If you can imagine the map of the London underground, it's a series of more or less straight lines.

00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:02.148
It looks more like an electricity grid than a geographical

00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:07.368
map, and that’s actually by design, it's on purpose.

00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:12.928
It was created in 1933 by a man called Harry Beck.

00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:16.798
He wasn’t a map drawer, a cartographer.

00:09:17.318 --> 00:09:23.208
He was actually an electrical draughtsman, someone who draws electrical circuits.

00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:26.758
And he was something of a revolutionary.

00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:31.698
When he was asked to create a map of the Underground, he decided to

00:09:31.798 --> 00:09:37.058
base it on an electrical circuit board, not on traditional map design.

00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:41.738
His map didn’t accurately reflect the distance between

00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:45.198
stops, or whether the line snaked left or right.

00:09:45.938 --> 00:09:50.889
His map was beautifully simple; a series of more or less straight lines.

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:56.996
In fact, it was initially rejected, because it was too radical.

00:09:58.286 --> 00:10:02.886
But after some testing on members of the public, it was introduced.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:06.976
It did exactly what it needed to - it showed people what

00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:11.166
direction they needed to go, north or south, east or west.

00:10:11.226 --> 00:10:15.612
It showed people how to get  from A to B, and didn’t

00:10:15.622 --> 00:10:20.322
include superfluous, confusing or unnecessary information.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:28.122
And, as you may know, this model is used for most underground maps around the world today, they tend

00:10:28.132 --> 00:10:34.902
to be simple, with straight lines, and opt for user simplicity rather than geographical accuracy.

00:10:36.432 --> 00:10:38.052
Now, back to our story.

00:10:38.622 --> 00:10:42.902
Now in public ownership, there were big plans to expand the underground,

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:47.132
but these had to be put on pause when the Second World War broke out.

00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:53.332
But that didn’t mean that the London underground lay empty and unused during the war.

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:55.462
Far from it, in fact.

00:10:56.342 --> 00:11:00.352
As you may know, during the Second World War the London underground was

00:11:00.362 --> 00:11:05.492
used as a bomb shelter, a place for Londoners to hide from the Nazi bombs.

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:11.392
Though the early tube network had also been used for shelter during the First

00:11:11.402 --> 00:11:16.122
World War, it was nothing like the 1940s, when the intensity of the Blitz,

00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:20.692
the German bombing campaign, forced thousands of Londonders underground.

00:11:21.712 --> 00:11:27.662
London’s tube stations doubled as air raid shelters, with thousands of men, women

00:11:27.662 --> 00:11:33.072
and children sleeping on the station platforms, the walkways, and even on the tracks.

00:11:33.712 --> 00:11:37.112
There were so many people down there, in fact, that tickets

00:11:37.112 --> 00:11:41.522
were introduced to make sure stations didn’t become overcrowded.

00:11:42.632 --> 00:11:46.692
And because these German air raids went on for so long, there

00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:51.252
was even a special train service, known as the ‘Tube Refreshments

00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:55.372
Special’, that delivered food and drinks to the sheltering Londoners.

00:11:56.462 --> 00:12:01.822
And interestingly, the Underground didn’t only provide shelter for the people of London.

00:12:02.832 --> 00:12:07.762
Part of the Picadilly line was used to store artefacts and treasures from

00:12:07.762 --> 00:12:12.422
the British Museum, including the famous but controversial Elgin Marbles.

00:12:14.092 --> 00:12:18.862
When the war ended, the tube network continued expanding in order to keep up with

00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:23.832
London’s growing population, as it had done when it first opened in the 1860s.

00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:29.179
More lines were laid, more stations opened, the routes spreading further and further

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:34.022
across the city, creating this sprawling network that extends across the city today.

00:12:35.342 --> 00:12:41.332
Interestingly, however, there is one part of London where the tube didn’t expand to.

00:12:41.712 --> 00:12:43.072
Or not much, anyway.

00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:47.672
If you have visited London, you might have realised that there’s a

00:12:47.682 --> 00:12:52.442
noticeable difference between the tube service in north and south London,

00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:56.202
between the north side of the river and the south side of the river.

00:12:57.282 --> 00:13:01.582
In fact, there are only 31 tube stations south of the

00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:06.402
river Thames, whereas there are 250 north of the river.

00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:11.232
Several underground lines, including the Circle, Central,

00:13:11.432 --> 00:13:15.702
Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines don’t even go to south London.

00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:18.082
So, why is that?

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:20.732
Well, there are two main reasons.

00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:26.662
The first is to do with geology, that is, the type of soil, the ground.

00:13:27.642 --> 00:13:32.512
Put simply, the soil in south London contains a lot of sand and other

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:35.862
deposits that make it more difficult to build underground tunnels.

00:13:37.092 --> 00:13:40.722
The soil in north and central London, however, is mostly made

00:13:40.732 --> 00:13:44.382
up of clay and is much easier to drill and tunnel through.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:51.272
The second reason is that when the first lines began to open in the 1860s,

00:13:51.642 --> 00:13:56.922
south London was already quite well-covered by railway, that is, by normal train

00:13:56.942 --> 00:14:01.902
stations, so there simply wasn’t much of a need to add more track underground.

00:14:03.102 --> 00:14:09.772
The result is what you see today - south London has very poor underground connections, which often

00:14:09.772 --> 00:14:15.492
leads to people in North London complaining about having to travel south, because it takes so long.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:21.892
Sure, there are more overground trains, and decent bus connections, but in general

00:14:22.022 --> 00:14:27.222
it takes longer to get around, and much longer to get into central London, meaning

00:14:27.362 --> 00:14:31.202
that south London is generally a cheaper area to live in than north London.

00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:34.992
Now, back to the history of the underground.

00:14:35.522 --> 00:14:40.652
From the post-war period right through to the present day it has undergone near-constant

00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:45.562
enlargements and improvements, with the most recent being the opening of the “Elizabeth

00:14:45.612 --> 00:14:50.272
Line”, named after Queen Elizabeth, which was opened a few months before her death.

00:14:51.702 --> 00:14:57.872
And in 2023, 160 years after the first passengers chugged along through

00:14:57.872 --> 00:15:02.802
that smoky tunnel, it remains a living artefact of a technological

00:15:02.812 --> 00:15:07.252
breakthrough that has been emulated in almost 200 cities worldwide.

00:15:08.122 --> 00:15:13.122
So if your city has a subway system with a slightly odd looking map,

00:15:13.432 --> 00:15:17.762
it can probably trace its roots back here, to the London Underground.

00:15:18.972 --> 00:15:24.002
Now, to finish off this short exploration into the history of the tube,

00:15:24.252 --> 00:15:28.442
I have five pieces of trivia, facts, about the London underground.

00:15:29.682 --> 00:15:35.042
So, first up: if you are on the Central line, which unsurprisingly goes through

00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:40.902
central London, and you find the train twisting and turning, that is because

00:15:40.902 --> 00:15:45.742
the tunnel follows the city’s medieval street plan, full of twists and turns.

00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:51.262
Fact number two, the underground system’s escalators travel a

00:15:51.302 --> 00:15:55.772
distance equivalent to going twice around the globe every single week.

00:15:56.762 --> 00:16:01.262
Now, fact number three might actually surprise you, because a little

00:16:01.302 --> 00:16:07.233
over half, 55% to be precise, of the London Underground is overground.

00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:11.332
That’s right, despite it being called the ‘underground’,

00:16:11.562 --> 00:16:14.792
less than half of it is actually underground.

00:16:15.762 --> 00:16:19.272
And remember how I said that the distances on the map

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:22.562
don’t actually reflect the real distances above the ground?

00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:26.552
Well, fact number four is the perfect example of this.

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:33.222
The shortest distance between two stations on the underground network is in central London between

00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:39.602
Leicester Square and Covent Garden, which is on the Piccadilly line, and is just 300 metres.

00:16:40.462 --> 00:16:45.366
It’s so close, in fact, that there is no point taking the tube from Leicester

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:49.706
Square to Covent Garden, as by the time you’ve tapped in with your card, or

00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:54.776
bought a ticket, gone down the escalators, walked to the platform, waited for the

00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:59.496
train, taken it and come out the other side, it would’ve been quicker to walk.

00:17:00.916 --> 00:17:05.576
And finally, our fifth fact, in a single year trains on the

00:17:05.576 --> 00:17:10.866
London Underground travel a staggering 83.6 million kilometres.

00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:17.444
It’s quite the journey from the gas-light steam-powered trains that made that first journey in 1863.

00:17:19.134 --> 00:17:23.314
So, there you go, a brief but hopefully interesting

00:17:23.314 --> 00:17:25.994
journey through the history of the London Underground.

00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:32.124
It might not be the biggest, the cleanest, the prettiest, the most on-time, or even

00:17:32.124 --> 00:17:37.684
the best, but it was a pioneer that paved the way for cities all over the world.

00:17:38.544 --> 00:17:43.324
So next time you ride the metro in your city, or even if you have

00:17:43.324 --> 00:17:46.704
the chance to visit London and ride the Tube, you’ll know a little

00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:51.004
bit more about how the world’s original subway system got started.

00:17:53.826 --> 00:17:59.816
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on a short history of the London Underground.

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:04.374
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about it or this was the

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:08.334
first time you’d heard about the London Underground, well I hope you learned something new.

00:18:09.364 --> 00:18:12.704
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:13.054 --> 00:18:15.134
Have you been on the London underground before?

00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:18.424
How does it compare to the subway system in your country?

00:18:18.914 --> 00:18:22.173
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

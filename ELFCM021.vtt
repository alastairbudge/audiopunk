Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:10.513
by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:12.133
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:17.033
If this is your first time listening to the show, then welcome.

00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:22.403
It's great to have you on board and of course, if you are a regular listener, welcome back.

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:23.453
It's great to have you too.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.463
Regular listeners will know by now that the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast can be

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:33.753
found on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:39.599
If you aren't yet a member of Leonardo English and you want to follow along with the transcript and

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:46.522
key vocabulary in front of you, then you can become a member over at leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:53.815
The promotional price for becoming a member is ending at midnight on the 31st of January, which is

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:56.215
actually the day that this podcast is released.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.860
So if you want to lock in that price of just nine euros per month, which is under 10 US dollars,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.070
then make sure you had to leonardoenglish.com/subscribe before midnight.

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:16.467
Membership gives you access to the transcripts and key vocabulary for all of the podcasts plus two

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:24.537
new podcasts every week and also comes with a 30 day no questions asked refund policy, so if for any

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:29.907
reason you aren't happy or you haven't been able to use it, then you will get a full refund.

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.456
Okay then.

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:34.246
Today, let's talk about fake meat.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.858
Let's talk about what it is, why it's important, why people love it, why people hate it, and why it

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:48.358
might be landing on your plate pretty soon if it hasn't landed there already.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:57.761
By fake meat, there are two real categories of this, and it's an important differentiation to make.

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:08.972
Firstly, lab-grown meat, which is real meat, it's animal protein, but it doesn't actually involve

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.382
the slaughter of an animal.

00:02:11.432 --> 00:02:20.806
Then secondly we have plant-based meat, which is food that looks, feels and tastes like meat, but

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.056
actually doesn't have any meat in it.

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:26.086
It's made out of plant-based proteins.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:32.876
Let's just go into a little bit more detailed though as it's useful to understand the difference and

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.946
to understand how both of these are made.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:44.004
The first fake meat, the lab-grown meat, which is actually just real meat without animals, is grown

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:50.064
from animal cells with only a very small need to raise or slaughter animals.

00:02:50.184 --> 00:02:55.224
Basically, no animals need to be harmed during the creation of lab-grown meat.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:05.619
The process is of course, very complicated, but in essence some cells are taken from an animal and

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:13.838
from that what's called a 'cell line' can be created, which in turn can be turned into meat all

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.993
without one animal being killed.

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:28.001
So you can get a burger, a chicken nugget, a lamb steak, or in theory, any kind of meat all without

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.741
one animal being harmed.

00:03:31.037 --> 00:03:38.576
It might sound good in practice, but as the technology is still pretty young, it's very expensive.

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:46.686
The first burger that was grown in a lab, which was created by a team in the Netherlands, cost

00:03:46.706 --> 00:03:56.246
250,000 euros to make, and even a chicken nugget created by one of the leading companies in Silicon

00:03:56.246 --> 00:04:00.116
Valley currently costs about $50 to make.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:06.536
So there is evidently a lot of work to be done to bring down the cost and make it a viable

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:14.216
alternative, even if these companies can get over all of the hurdles, both of regulation, of

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:20.726
countries allowing them to sell their lab-grown produce, and any kind of cultural acceptance from

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:25.346
people of eating something that they know has been grown in a laboratory.

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:33.146
For the meat eaters among you, just ask yourself, would you eat something that has been grown in a

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:33.926
laboratory?

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:42.053
I say to myself that I would, but I guess if it was sat there on my plate, I wonder whether I really

00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:42.253
would.

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:50.723
So there's obviously still a lot of work to be done to make eating lab-grown meat a normal,

00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:51.893
acceptable thing to do.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:03.170
The second category, that of plant-based meat is one that is growing very fast and I'd imagine that

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.940
there's a good chance you may have already eaten some plant-based meat.

00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:17.364
Plant-based meat is, as the name suggests, food that looks, feels and tastes like meat, but is made

00:05:17.364 --> 00:05:19.134
from plant-based ingredients.

00:05:20.432 --> 00:05:29.372
Names you may be familiar with include Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, which are two of the most

00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:31.772
well known companies in this space.

00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:41.532
While 10 or 20 years ago, plant-based meat might have been pretty niche, and the options were few

00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:46.782
and far between, they were very limited, now things are pretty different.

00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:55.467
Growing up, I remember my cousin Patrick was the only vegan in our family, and I can remember

00:05:55.467 --> 00:06:01.467
looking at his vegan sausages and not being filled with a huge amount of jealousy.

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:07.540
I mean, they were pretty disgusting, and they always came in these sad cardboard boxes.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.640
But in a world where people are not only getting more attuned to the environmental impact that

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.017
eating meat has, but also on the conditions that much of the world's livestock lives in, there has

00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:26.337
been a huge increase in demand for meat-free products.

00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:35.277
People want to eat less meat, but they want better tasting stuff than the old tasteless vegan

00:06:35.277 --> 00:06:37.887
sausages that supermarkets used to sell.

00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:46.264
And now there are a plethora of options, from burgers that bleed, with beetroot juice, I should say,

00:06:46.504 --> 00:06:50.516
to a vegan sausage roll that is huge in the UK.

00:06:50.846 --> 00:06:55.076
Just Google Gregg's vegan sausage roll if you don't believe me.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.000
And consumers are taking these options in their masses.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:12.820
In North America, sales of plant-based meat have increased by 37% from 2017 to 2019 and it's a

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.500
similar story in Europe.

00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:21.732
Lots of these companies have managed to make meat alternatives that people think do actually taste

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:23.022
as good as meat.

00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:32.772
And so people that had historically refused to reduce their meat intake for taste reasons now don't

00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:35.532
have that as such a valid reason anymore.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:44.950
But it's not all rosy for plant-based meat and like anything there are those who are vehemently

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.780
against, they're opposed to the development of plant-based meat.

00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:58.326
Firstly, the farming lobby for livestock producers, the groups that represent the interests of

00:07:58.386 --> 00:07:59.676
livestock farmers.

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:02.876
Understandably, they are against plant-based meat.

00:08:03.397 --> 00:08:10.337
They say it will result in millions of farming jobs being lost, which is of course, in one sense

00:08:10.337 --> 00:08:10.867
true.

00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:18.757
If demand for traditional meat goes down, there'll be the need for fewer animals, therefore fewer

00:08:18.757 --> 00:08:26.179
farmers, and yes, it's sort of a fair argument, but the idea that all of these livestock farmers

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:30.499
will be unemployed and not be able to work again, it's pretty mad.

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:37.774
You have to assume that the economy is efficient enough that new jobs will be created and these meat

00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:39.934
farmers will do something else.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:45.484
They won't just be sitting on their backsides all day lamenting their days farming cattle.

00:08:47.217 --> 00:08:53.713
There is also the criticism, which is a more fair one in my view, that people assume that eating a

00:08:53.713 --> 00:09:00.587
plant-based meat meal will be healthier than eating the traditional meat version and it's not always

00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:01.037
the case.

00:09:02.136 --> 00:09:12.031
Meat-free burgers, for example, contain an average of 0.89 grams of salt per serving, while normal

00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:18.451
meat ones contain 0.75 grams, so they're better for you in terms of the salt content.

00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:27.525
Plant-based meat is almost by definition, highly processed and processed food isn't very good for

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.425
you at all.

00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:36.048
If you think that you can just go on a diet and eat vegan chicken nuggets and Impossible Burgers,

00:09:36.288 --> 00:09:38.928
well, it's not really a diet at all.

00:09:39.796 --> 00:09:46.150
And from a health point of view, if you're continuing to eat fast food-type stuff, you're no better

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.760
off eating the vegan options than the traditional options, at least from a nutrition point of view.

00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:59.505
If you read the ingredients of the Impossible Burger, for example, the one that Burger King launched

00:09:59.505 --> 00:10:06.135
in partnership with Impossible Foods, it reads more like the ingredients of a chocolate bar or a

00:10:06.135 --> 00:10:10.695
packet of sweets than something you might think of as a healthy food.

00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:18.645
And when you also consider all of the sauces that are smothered on the burger, well, it's really not

00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:19.605
that healthy after all.

00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:27.545
And this also raises the question, why are we so obsessed with meat as an idea?

00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:37.222
Why are all of these companies rushing to be just a meat alternative as opposed to just good tasty

00:10:37.222 --> 00:10:40.132
food that is good for us and better for the planet?

00:10:41.382 --> 00:10:45.458
So why is this, is it purely from a taste point of view?

00:10:45.668 --> 00:10:53.531
Because we think that meat tastes better, and if so, if everything about the taste and texture of

00:10:53.531 --> 00:11:00.491
meat could be replicated completely, either from a plant-based option or from something that was

00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:07.511
grown in a laboratory and produced in a way that didn't harm any animals, and that didn't cost any

00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:15.131
more than current meat, would that be enough for people to ditch meat altogether, to give up meat

00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:15.761
altogether?

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:23.375
Or is it from a nutritional point of view, do people just think that meat gives them the nutrients

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:25.415
that this fake meat won't.

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:33.598
And if so, if these nutrients were recreated either by lab-grown meat or plant-based meat, would

00:11:33.598 --> 00:11:35.848
that be enough for people to switch?

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:44.339
There are of course, still significant regulatory and cultural hurdles to overcome, but it certainly

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:50.069
seems like people are betting that the answer to these questions is yes.

00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:56.969
Billions of dollars are flooding into startups and companies that are trying to work on both

00:11:57.119 --> 00:12:00.209
lab-based meat and plant-based food products.

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:08.579
Beyond Meat, one of the biggest plant-based meat companies in the US is valued at over $6 billion

00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:12.296
and Impossible Foods is valued at a similar number.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:20.857
Only time will tell how consumer behaviour changes and whether in fifty or a hundred years people

00:12:20.857 --> 00:12:22.777
will be eating meat altogether.

00:12:23.512 --> 00:12:30.202
There are people who say that meat eating will go the way of things like smoking, being less and

00:12:30.202 --> 00:12:34.372
less culturally acceptable, and then it just fizzles out altogether.

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:42.082
But for the moment, meat consumption worldwide continues to grow as more consumers in places like

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:47.032
China are getting wealthier and increasing the amount of meat in their diets.

00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:51.756
So who knows where fake meat will be in 50 years.

00:12:52.686 --> 00:13:00.306
What we do know though, is that there are some big investors and some very smart money, that is at

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:04.236
least betting that it's only the beginning for fake meat.

00:13:05.777 --> 00:13:08.169
Alright then, that is it for today.

00:13:08.439 --> 00:13:14.439
I hope that this has been interesting and that you now know a little bit more about fake meat than

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:16.179
you did 15 minutes ago.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:23.733
As one final reminder, the introductory promotional price for becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:13:23.913 --> 00:13:30.483
and getting access to all of the transcripts and key vocabulary is coming to an end at midnight on

00:13:30.483 --> 00:13:34.113
the 31st which is the day that this podcast is coming out.

00:13:34.443 --> 00:13:39.983
So if you want to get the transcripts and key vocabulary for every podcast we've ever done, and

00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:46.386
every future podcast for just nine euros per month, that's less than $10 per month, then head to

00:13:46.386 --> 00:13:49.736
leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:13:50.376 --> 00:13:57.036
The transcripts are just so useful for helping you follow every single thing and not miss one word,

00:13:57.486 --> 00:14:04.206
plus the key vocabulary means that the hard words or expressions are explained for you, so you don't

00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:06.876
need to pause and look things up in a dictionary.

00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:13.325
And again, if you aren't happy at any time within the first 30 days, then you can get a refund for

00:14:13.325 --> 00:14:14.555
whatever reason.

00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:17.224
I'll also put the link in the show notes.

00:14:17.854 --> 00:14:19.924
As always, thank you for listening.

00:14:20.074 --> 00:14:21.604
It has been a pleasure.

00:14:22.114 --> 00:14:27.214
You've been listening to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:31.959
I'm Alastair Budge and I will catch you in the next episode.

Hello, good morning, good afternoon, good night, wherever you are.

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:12.842
This is the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:20.432
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about conspiracy theories.

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:29.086
We'll talk about what they are, the psychology behind why people believe them, what impact they

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:35.356
have, and at the end of the podcast, I'll tell you about three of the weirdest ones out there.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:45.856
You'll find out why people think Disney made the film Frozen, what animals people think built the

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:53.544
pyramids, and who people think helped humans build Stonehenge.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:01:01.344
Before we get right into it, if you don't have the transcript and key vocabulary in front of you,

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:05.674
you can grab it over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:11.004
If you're not already a member of Leonardo English, but would like to get your hands on the

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:17.454
transcript and key vocabulary so that you can follow along as I speak and not miss a single word and

00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:23.994
get the definitions of any of the less common words or expressions, then our promotional price of

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:29.874
just nine euros per month is only available until midnight on January the 31st.

00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:37.584
This was the special 'early bird' price and good things, well, they can't last forever So if you

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:44.514

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:56.418
As I said, this is only available until midnight on January the 31st, which is three days from when

00:01:56.418 --> 00:02:00.438
this episode is being released, so there isn't a huge amount of time left.

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:04.788
Okay then, conspiracy theories.

00:02:05.448 --> 00:02:12.468
Before we go into some of the weirdest ones out there, let's just define exactly what they are, why

00:02:12.468 --> 00:02:16.960
people believe them, and why they can be so seductive.

00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:27.086
A conspiracy theory, according to the Cambridge dictionary, is 'a belief that an event or situation

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:31.436
is the result of a secret plan made by powerful people'.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:39.596
You probably know about the existence of conspiracy theories such as that the moon landing was

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:47.936
faked, that JFK was assassinated by the CIA, or that 9/11 was an inside job.

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:53.036
You might be familiar with these theories, you might even believe them.

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:57.346
Millions of people all over the world do believe them.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:06.098
29% of Americans, apparently, according to a recent survey, believe that there is a deep state

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:08.138
working against President Trump.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.429
I have to admit there is something very seductive about a lot of conspiracy theories.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:24.729
This idea that there is some great conspiracy, some great secret or trick that is being held back

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:32.842
from normal people, plays right into the fictional narratives that we enjoy so much in films, books,

00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:33.802
and TV.

00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:42.685
It plays into this idea of goodies against baddies, normally with the government or any kind of

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:50.742
institution that has power over us as the baddy and the rest of the world us normal people, as the

00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:51.162
goodies.

00:03:52.154 --> 00:04:00.048
Conspiracy theories are also popular because we as humans are always searching for meaning and

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:04.008
connections in events, even when there might be none.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.742
Professor, Joe Uscinski, who is the author of a book called American Conspiracy Theories says, we

00:04:11.742 --> 00:04:18.462
are very good at recognising patterns and regularities, but sometimes we overplay that.

00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:23.532
We think we see a meaning and significance when it isn't really there.

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:31.542
We also assume that when something happens, it happens because someone or something made it happen

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:32.292
for a reason'.

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:40.615
What Professor Uscinski is saying is that especially when you want to believe something is true and

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:48.085
it fits into your narrative of goodies versus baddies, if someone presents a connection between

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:55.435
different events that fits your narrative of what you want to believe, then it's quite easy to find

00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:56.605
yourself believing it.

00:04:58.015 --> 00:05:06.025
The world can be a confusing place and people want to see patterns, they want to understand things,

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:09.025
they want there to be connections between events.

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:17.845
Conspiracy theories offer explanations that provide these connections, and they also suggest that

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:22.489
the underlying causes are hidden from public view.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:31.958
When confusing things happen, believers in conspiracy theories can then assume that it is because

00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:40.073
they are being intentionally deceived by outside forces, normally by the government, and this fits

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:44.753
into this attractive narrative of goodies versus baddies.

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:56.491
And while conspiracy theories used to be pretty niche and would exist in forums and chat rooms deep

00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:02.791
in the recesses of the internet, for a series of reasons they are now much more mainstream.

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:13.036
Some attribute this to social media, the ease with which fake news spreads, or you could even say

00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:16.156
just the ease with which information spreads.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:23.236
Others attribute this to a lack of trust in government and the authorities.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:30.886
As people trust these kind of institutions less and less, the more seductive it becomes to believe

00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:38.596
that there is some kind of great conspiracy that the government is engaged in against us, against

00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:39.556
normal people.

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:44.824
While others blame politicians for fanning the flames.

00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:52.984
When the President of the USA is a serial conspiracy theorist, this legitimises a lot of beliefs

00:06:53.224 --> 00:06:56.884
which would previously not have been given the light of day.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:06.846
And while some conspiracy theories used to be sort of laughable, the past few years have shown just

00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:09.066
how dangerous some of them can be.

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:14.356
Pizzagate, for example, is one that you might remember.

00:07:15.556 --> 00:07:22.516
To those of you that need a reminder, this was a conspiracy theory that there was a child sex ring

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:30.616
linked to the Democratic party in the USA, and it was operated out of a pizza restaurant in

00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:31.816
Washington DC.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:41.041
It was spread by fake news websites and far right organisations after having surfaced in internet

00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:41.671
forums.

00:07:42.355 --> 00:07:48.419
The restaurant owners, the owners of the pizza restaurant, were harassed by hundreds of people, and

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:56.429
a 28 year old man turned up at the restaurant to 'self-investigate' with an assault rifle and he

00:07:56.429 --> 00:07:58.079
fired three shots.

00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:07.274
The conspiracy theory has been completely debunked, proved to be completely false, and luckily

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:11.414
nobody died, but evidently it was pretty close.

00:08:12.974 --> 00:08:20.144
So these kinds of conspiracy theories can be really dangerous, and obviously I wouldn't like to even

00:08:20.144 --> 00:08:24.974
give any airtime to any semi mainstream conspiracy theory.

00:08:25.874 --> 00:08:33.254
So today we are going to talk about three of the wackiest, weirdest conspiracy theories out there.

00:08:34.554 --> 00:08:39.474
All of these aren't a joke, there are people who really genuinely believe them.

00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:48.784
So without further ado, our first one, our first conspiracy theory is that dinosaurs built the

00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:49.594
pyramids.

00:08:50.524 --> 00:08:50.914
Yes.

00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:58.354
Dinosaurs, the species that most people acknowledge to have been made extinct about 65 million years

00:08:58.354 --> 00:08:58.654
ago.

00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:08.509
They are believed by some to have been tamed, domesticated by the ancient Egyptians and to have

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:09.889
built the pyramids.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:18.959
The reason for this is supposedly that some texts were found that show images of dinosaur-type

00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:26.599
creatures building the pyramids, but the evidence seems to be pretty tenuous.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:33.289
I think we can safely say that dinosaurs were not involved in the construction of the pyramids.

00:09:34.249 --> 00:09:35.959
But I guess we'll never know for sure.

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:41.629
I imagine that's the policy line of people who believe that particular conspiracy theory.

00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:50.882
Secondly, and this is one that I quite like, there is a conspiracy theory that Disney made the film

00:09:50.912 --> 00:09:59.402
Frozen in order to distract attention from the other conspiracy theory that Walt Disney, the creator

00:09:59.402 --> 00:10:02.492
of Disney, was cryogenically frozen.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:11.096
If you weren't aware, there was a conspiracy theory or there still is a conspiracy theory, that when

00:10:11.096 --> 00:10:18.818
Walt Disney died he was frozen in order to be brought back to life when the technology existed.

00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:28.118
So when people would Google 'Disney frozen', all these websites would show up with conspiracy

00:10:28.118 --> 00:10:31.681
theories about Walt Disney being cryogeniclly frozen.

00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:40.546
So some people believe that the reason the entire Frozen franchise was created, and that it was

00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:48.766
called Frozen, was to fill up the search results with references to the actual film and not the

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:49.756
conspiracy theory.

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:55.496
So with this example, you kind of get two conspiracy theories for the price of one.

00:10:56.926 --> 00:11:03.556
If this is indeed true, and I should add, of course, I don't believe it is, the people at Disney

00:11:03.556 --> 00:11:05.086
really are pretty smart.

00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:11.806
As not only did this film hide the previous conspiracy theory from the search results of people

00:11:11.806 --> 00:11:18.256
looking for Disney plus frozen, but it has also made the company more than a billion dollars.

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:28.036
Finally, our third conspiracy theory takes us to Britain, and it's to do with Stonehenge.

00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:35.151
If you aren't familiar with Stonehenge, it's the prehistoric monument in the English countryside

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.211
with huge stones piled up on each other.

00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:48.226
It's estimated that it was constructed between 3000 and 2000 BC and archeologists have no hard

00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:54.256
evidence actually for how these huge stones were lifted up on top of each other.

00:11:55.576 --> 00:12:00.466
So some people believe that aliens built it.

00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:08.356
That they either built it themselves or they explained to humans how to lift up these huge stone

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:08.986
blocks.

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:16.197
And also, I have to admit, if you have ever seen them, it is pretty amazing to think that

00:12:16.557 --> 00:12:22.077
prehistoric man managed to lift up blocks weighing around 50 tonnes.

00:12:22.767 --> 00:12:29.757
But I think that going from thinking that it's pretty amazing to believing that the only explanation

00:12:30.027 --> 00:12:34.707
is that aliens helped them, well, I think that's quite a stretch.

00:12:35.997 --> 00:12:43.045
We could of course go on all day with weird conspiracy theories, and if you Google conspiracy

00:12:43.045 --> 00:12:50.650
theories, it really is a internet rabbit warren, you could just go on and on all day, but I think

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.260
this is quite enough for today's podcast.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:59.560
I will leave that up to you if you want to continue the hunt for conspiracy theories, but as I've

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.170
warned you, it is a slippery slope.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.080
So we will leave it there for today.

00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:11.995
For those of you listening that haven't yet got your membership to Leonardo English and haven't got

00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:17.095

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:25.405
price will come to an end at midnight on January the 31st the transcripts are incredibly helpful for

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:31.315
following every single word, and the key vocabulary means that you get explanations of the harder

00:13:31.315 --> 00:13:32.755
words as you go along.

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:39.646

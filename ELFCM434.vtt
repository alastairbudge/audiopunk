Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:15.433
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.293
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:24.613
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Edward Snowden.

00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:29.573
He is probably the most famous whistleblower in the world, after having

00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:34.144
leaked vast amounts of sensitive US government information back in 2013.

00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:36.983
And he has been on the run ever since.

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:41.673
So in this episode we are going to tell his story, asking

00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:45.903
ourselves whether he is a great American patriot or a traitor.

00:00:46.707 --> 00:00:49.169
OK then, Edward Snowden.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:58.077
In May of 2013, a 29-year-old American asked his boss to take some medical leave.

00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:04.287
He had epilepsy, he said, and he needed a few weeks of absence to get treatment.

00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:11.307
He had a respectable job, working as a contractor for the National Security Agency in Hawaii.

00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:19.827
He had a good life, a house, a girlfriend, a salary he would later say amounted to $200,000 a year.

00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:26.847
The man, Edward Snowden, had suffered from epilepsy in the past, but he wasn’t

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:31.947
planning on getting treatment; he had bigger plans for his leave of absence.

00:01:33.207 --> 00:01:41.056
And on May 10th, 2013, he got on a flight, never again to return to his home country.

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:45.136
His chosen destination was Hong Kong.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:51.076
He packed light, a few personal belongings, but he brought with him an item that would turn

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:57.136
him into one of the greatest fugitives in American history: a treasure trove of data that he

00:01:57.136 --> 00:02:02.316
had taken from the organisation that he had been working at, the National Security Agency.

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:10.076
The exact size of this haul would be debated, with the American security services claiming it

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:17.646
contained 1.7 million classified files, and Snowden later claiming it wasn’t quite that many.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:25.886
Whatever the true number was, it was very large, and Snowden had big plans for the files.

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:32.136
He wanted to share them with the world, to shine a light on what he believed to be

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:37.596
illegal and unconstitutional behaviour that was being performed by the US government.

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:45.296
And less than a month after landing in Hong Kong, the first revelation was unleashed.

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:51.716
This was jointly published, both in the American newspaper The Washington Post and

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:56.866
the British newspaper The Guardian, which printed its bombshell headline on June

00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:05.026
6th, 2013, “NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily”.

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:14.336
This report linked to a top-secret document ordering the telecommunications company Verizon to

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:21.166
hand over personal information about its customers to the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:27.176
It was a bombshell revelation, but it was just the start.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:34.406
Over the weeks and months that followed, revelation after revelation would be published in

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:39.946
The Guardian and The Washington Post about the true extent that the US government was spying

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:45.666
on the American people, without their knowledge and brazenly denying it at the same time.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:53.286
And these revelations would turn Edward Snowden into one of the most wanted people in the world,

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:59.576
forcing him into hiding, constantly looking over his shoulder to ensure that a pack of men

00:03:59.576 --> 00:04:04.826
in dark suits didn’t approach him, wrestle him to the ground and extradite him to the United

00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:11.286
States, where he would almost certainly face the rest of his life in prison and perhaps…worse.

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:18.526
Now, to understand why Edward Snowden took the actions that he took, it’s helpful to

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:23.186
learn a bit more about his early life and his character, so that's where we’ll start.

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:30.566
He was born in 1983, to a family with a long history of government service.

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:36.066
A grandfather was a senior navy official and worked at the FBI, his

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:41.066
father worked at the coast guard and his mother in the US justice system.

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:46.136
His older sister went to work for the government, and that

00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:48.946
was where Snowden figured he would probably end up too.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.330
He tried out for the army, feeling a patriotic duty to serve in the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.050
Iraq War, but broke his legs during training and had to drop out.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.080
It wasn’t long before he found his way into intelligence

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.940
work, working for the CIA as a systems administrator.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.200
He had, from a young age, been very interested in computing, and would

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.890
later write that he easily got a job because he was a “computer wizard”.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.140
This was in 2006, when he was 23 years old.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.440
He was posted to Geneva, in Switzerland, where he was

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.760
given a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.440
Almost immediately, his eyes were opened to the modus operandi of

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.760
the CIA, to the way in which his government conducted its business.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.420
In one account, he reported seeing a CIA operative trying to get a senior Swiss banker drunk

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.540
and then encouraging him to drive home, knowing full well he was over the alcohol limit.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.920
When the Swiss banker was arrested for drunk driving, the CIA intervened,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.510
saying they would help him get off the charges but only if he became

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.430
an informant, he gave up secrets on his banking clients to the CIA.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:22.380
Now, the Swiss authorities would deny this, saying it was extremely unlikely, but it was just one of

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:29.990
a plethora of examples of what Snowden said he saw of the CIA and the security services overstepping

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.960
the mark, behaving in a way that infringed on the civil liberties of members of the public.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.680
He became disillusioned, and to quote a later interview, “I realised

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.850
that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.”

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.190
He resigned from the CIA shortly after, in February of 2009, but he

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.520
continued to work for companies that contract for the government.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.030
In other words, he was no longer working for the government,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.770
but he was working for a company that worked for the government.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.980
As you may know, the US government in particular uses a large number of these outsourcing companies,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.550
spending hundreds of billions of dollars on these outsourced contracting companies every year.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.940
He worked for a couple of companies, first Dell and then one called Booz Allen Hamilton,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:32.450
but doing similar kinds of work: cyber security, systems administration and so on.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.770
He was, by all accounts, a talented and successful employee, and

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.900
would even be called “a genius among geniuses” by a former colleague.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.120
But he had a secret.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.540
After starting working at Dell, he had been downloading large caches

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.660
of sensitive information, classified files from the NSA that showed

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.450
the extent of the spying the government was doing on its citizens.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:08.120
For several years, in fact, he was carefully, meticulously, accessing files and information

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.330
that he was planning to use to out the government, to finally shine a light on what he

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:20.290
believed to be a crime that the United States government was committing against its citizens.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.110
In fact, he steered his career in a direction so that he was able to access more

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:33.020
and more sensitive information; the reason he moved from Dell to Booz Allen Hamilton

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.240
was because he would be able to access even more top secret information there.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.940
He had to take a large pay cut with the job switch, but

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.770
by this point Edward Snowden had no interest in money.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:54.020
He had one thing on his mind, and that was making the truth known, whatever the cost.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.030
He continued to download more and more classified information, but

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.910
the straw that broke the camel’s back came on the 13th of March, 2013.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.380
He was sitting at his desk, and reading a story on the news.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.540
The director of National Intelligence, a man called James Clapper,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:22.270
had stood in front of the Senate committee and sworn on oath that the

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:28.090
NSA does “not wittingly” collect information on millions of Americans.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.040
Snowden knew this was a complete lie.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.670
I mean, a large part of his job was to deal with the information

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.510
that was collected on millions of Americans without their knowledge.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.680
And everyone who worked at the NSA knew this, and of course James Clapper, as the Director of

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:55.180
National Intelligence, he didn’t just know this, he practically oversaw the entire operation.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.070
Snowden turned to his colleagues, and said “can you believe this shit?”,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.580
but their reaction was more of a “huh, yeah of course he’s going to lie”.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.580
And it was at that moment that he knew he had to come clean, it was time.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.320
To Snowden, the entire security apparatus of his country was rotten to the core.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:27.880
There was one of the most senior US government officials happily lying to the American people,

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:34.130
and everyone within the security services, from the NSA employees to the hundreds of government

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.890
contractors who worked with them, just accepted it as the way that things needed to be.

00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:46.996
Snowden didn’t, and decided that now was the time to tell the truth.

00:10:48.366 --> 00:10:53.036
Fortunately, he had been putting out feelers for several years; he had been in

00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:57.606
touch with journalists that he felt could be interested in revealing the truth.

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:04.616
In fact, going back to his time in Geneva, he had been in contact anonymously

00:11:04.776 --> 00:11:09.526
with a journalist from the Guardian newspaper, but it hadn’t really gone anywhere.

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:15.346
Snowden was incredibly security conscious, as you might expect, and

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:19.726
the Guardian journalist had found his security demands “too annoying”.

00:11:20.916 --> 00:11:26.576
But at the start of 2013, he had got back in touch with this Guardian journalist, a

00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:31.416
man called Glenn Greenwald, as well as a documentary filmmaker called Laura Poitras.

00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:36.256
He was still incredibly security conscious - he used the code name

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:41.296
“Verax”, he asked not to be quoted at length, in case the NSA could

00:11:41.316 --> 00:11:46.516
identify him by his writing style, and of course all files were encrypted.

00:11:47.576 --> 00:11:53.016
Snowden knew how far the tentacles of the US government could stretch, because

00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:58.236
he had seen these firsthand, and he was not going to be taking any chances.

00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:05.466
After all, the information that he had was highly sensitive, if he was caught, he could

00:12:05.506 --> 00:12:12.856
be put on trial for treason and executed; he knew he would be committing a capital crime.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:20.100
Shortly after seeing James Clapper lie under oath, he requested medical leave and fled

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.860
to Hong Kong, where he barricaded himself inside a hotel room with Poitras and Greenwald,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.800
who were now face to face with the whistleblower they had previously known only as “Verax.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.890
Snowden handed over his huge cache of documents, entrusting the

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.240
journalists to use their publications to tell the truth to the world.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.610
There were nail biting moments, not just for Snowden but for the journalists,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.990
who were fighting with their newspapers for the permission to publish.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:59.790
After all, this was no mere scandal about a footballer or a pop star or a misbehaving

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:05.150
politician; these were revelations about the very mechanics of government.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.370
And it wasn’t only the US government.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.250
In the data treasure trove that Snowden had provided, there was information

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:18.140
on the spying activities of a wide variety of governments all over the world.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.080
The newspapers had to be very careful about what they published, to ensure that it

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.000
wasn’t going to compromise the safety of any individuals or missions around the world.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:37.900
Negotiations with lawyers went on through the night, but on June 5th, 2013, that

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.830
first damning article appeared jointly in The Guardian and The Washington Post.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:50.330
Snowden wasn’t quoted directly in the article; after all, the story wasn’t about him.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.610
But a few days later, he publicly came forward as the source of the leaks.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.420
His face was all over the global news, interviews with

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.739
him being broadcast 24/7 on cable news all over the world.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:12.869
At the time, he was still in Hong Kong, which he had chosen specifically because of its, and

00:14:12.869 --> 00:14:17.979
I'm quoting directly, “spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent”.

00:14:19.469 --> 00:14:24.209
Understandably, there were some raised eyebrows at this description, but clearly Hong

00:14:24.209 --> 00:14:29.399
Kong, under the control of China, was not going to hand over Snowden to the United States.

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:37.049
On June 21st, a couple of weeks after the revelations, the United States government announced

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:43.479
that Snowden would be charged with violating the Espionage Act and theft of government property.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:50.299
He was ordered to return to the United States to face trial, and to make life harder

00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:55.599
for him to leave Hong Kong and flee to another country, his US passport was revoked.

00:14:57.029 --> 00:15:03.859
He was now a fugitive without a nationality, a whistleblower lost in a diplomatic vacuum.

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:09.159
Fortunately, for Snowden at least, there was another country that was

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:13.869
willing to help, a country that had no love lost with the United States.

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:18.469
He arrived in Russia a couple of days later, which

00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:22.129
granted him asylum, allowing him in without a passport.

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.539
Snowden knew that the Russian government was unlikely to hand him

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:30.789
over to the American authorities, so that was his next best bet.

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:39.009
In fact, and this is to fast forward a few years, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:46.219
in 2022, so if we are being truly accurate, we should refer to him as Russian, not American.

00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:51.679
Now, to move on to discuss the impact of these leaks, of these

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:57.479
revelations, and the content of them, the scale of the leak was staggering.

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:03.299
The exact number of documents that was leaked, as you heard, is still

00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:07.399
debated, with some reports suggesting that there were 1.7 million

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:11.459
documents, while others suggesting it is in the hundreds of thousands.

00:16:12.964 --> 00:16:17.934
Whatever the true number, it was vast, far too much for Snowden to have known

00:16:17.974 --> 00:16:23.924
exactly what was in every document, and so much that it has taken a long time for the

00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:29.884
journalists to trawl through and carefully decide which information to release and when.

00:16:31.419 --> 00:16:37.879
In terms of the content, the documents Snowden took exposed evidence of NSA spying on

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:42.669
the communications of foreign leaders, like the former German chancellor Angela Merkel.

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:47.479
It exposed the bulk collection of phone records in the Verizon leak.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:53.479
It showed that the NSA had direct access to the servers of major tech companies,

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:59.619
which allowed it to collect personal data such as emails, photos and videos.

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:06.451
Essentially, Snowden showed that many of the activities that we might consider

00:17:06.823 --> 00:17:11.649
to be private, from the messages we send our friends and family to the websites

00:17:11.649 --> 00:17:17.499
we visit to the people we have called, these are not private at all, and can

00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:21.759
be accessed by Snowden’s former colleagues and friends at the government.

00:17:23.379 --> 00:17:27.629
Now, as to the reaction to these revelations, there

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:30.889
are clearly two very different sides to be taken.

00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:36.939
To some, he was considered a hero, someone who was prepared to stand

00:17:36.939 --> 00:17:41.579
up against a huge invasion of privacy and a breach of civil liberties.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:48.059
He was a true American patriot, someone who was prepared to put the safety of the American people

00:17:48.309 --> 00:17:54.679
and the sanctity of the US constitution above his own personal comfort, safety and happiness.

00:17:55.519 --> 00:18:00.519
After all, he's been on the run ever since, utterly unable to live any

00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:04.809
semblance of a normal life ever since the first story was published.

00:18:06.509 --> 00:18:12.189
But to others, he was the opposite, someone who had been entrusted with sensitive

00:18:12.199 --> 00:18:17.069
information about the workings of government, information that existed to protect

00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:22.949
citizens, and by choosing to go public with this, he was doing great damage

00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:27.769
to the security services and endangering the lives of millions of Americans.

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:33.139
After all, if you have nothing to hide, it shouldn’t matter if the government

00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:36.789
can see the message you sent your friend or partner that you are running late

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:40.719
for the cinema or asking if they could pick up some milk on their way home.

00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:42.639
He was a traitor.

00:18:44.195 --> 00:18:49.829
Snowden, as you will probably know, has never returned to the United States to face trial,

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:57.486
instead living in Russia as a sort of “digital dissident”, speaking at conferences through a video

00:18:57.486 --> 00:19:03.376
link, writing his memoirs, standing up for civil liberties and championing personal freedoms.

00:19:04.552 --> 00:19:09.769
And his revelations and constant campaigning have led to some important changes.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:16.039
There have been various cases filed against the NSA contesting the legality of this bulk

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:22.739
collection of personal data, and in 2015 Barack Obama signed something called the Freedom Act,

00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:28.499
which was a modified version of a previous security and surveillance law called the Patriot Act.

00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:33.139
These changes, although important, have not brought

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:36.629
about the sea change that Snowden no doubt hoped for.

00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:44.359
But perhaps the most important legacy from Edward Snowden is that he ignited a global

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:49.809
debate on where we draw the line between personal privacy and national security?

00:19:50.739 --> 00:19:53.739
How far should the government be able to encroach on

00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:56.939
our private lives in the interests of national security?

00:19:57.829 --> 00:20:02.269
As far as they see fit, or should there be important lines that

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:05.419
they should never be able to cross, no matter the circumstances?

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:10.699
And his revelations have also raised important questions

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.409
about the role of the 21st century whistleblower.

00:20:14.659 --> 00:20:21.109
As you might know, whistleblowers are typically granted special protections, for obvious reasons.

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:27.689
If you find out about criminal activity in a company or an organisation, most

00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:34.099
countries have laws that allow you to reveal it and receive protection and immunity.

00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:39.989
But if you are a whistleblower against the government, as Snowden’s case shows,

00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:46.319
things are not always so clear cut, and you can find yourself charged as a traitor,

00:20:46.699 --> 00:20:51.219
your passport revoked, with no prospect of ever returning to your home country.

00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:56.410
Why is it, that the government seems to be in a completely different category

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.970
when it comes to whistleblowing, and what are the consequences of this?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.410
So, to wrap things up, the story of Edward Snowden has no easy answers.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.190
He believes he was acting in the best interests of his country;

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.510
his government believes he caused huge damage to his country.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:21.000
He believes he is a patriot; his government believes he is a traitor.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.960
His story is a reminder that the line between one and

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.440
the other is not always as clear as we might think.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.640
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Edward Snowden.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.030
I’m sure you knew a little bit about him before, but I hope

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.530
that this episode has allowed you to go a little deeper.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.890
As always, I'd love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.720
Was Edward Snowden a patriot or a traitor?

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:53.340
And where do you think we draw the line between personal privacy and national security?

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.820
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

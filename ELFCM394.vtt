Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:15.741
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:20.231
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:25.631
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about hell.

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:29.601
It is, according to some religions, the place where

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.341
people who have behaved badly in life go when they die.

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.341
For some people, hell is a place of eternal punishment, a

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:42.501
place where devils torture you in a myriad of different ways.

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:49.551
For others, it’s not quite so bad, and it’s merely a stepping stone on the path to redemption.

00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:55.961
So, in this episode we are going to explore the idea of hell, we’ll look at some different

00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:01.701
interpretations of hell, and what happens in each one, and you might well learn that

00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.721
hell, even theologically speaking, doesn’t look quite like you might have imagined it.

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:11.046
OK then, what is hell?

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:18.516
If I asked you, does hell exist, you’ll probably have a strong opinion either way.

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:24.246
Yes, hell most certainly exists, you know what happens there, and you

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:27.966
are going to live your life in a way that ensures you don’t end up there.

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:32.916
Or absolutely not, what a load of rubbish, absolutely nothing

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:36.136
happens to someone who has behaved badly after they die.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:42.896
My objective in this episode is certainly not to try to convince you either

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:48.136
way, nor are we going to have an intense theological discussion about hell.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:54.326
Instead, we are going to explore how ideas of hell have developed over

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:59.476
time, and how the idea of hell is addressed in various different religions.

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:05.636
Now, a quick disclaimer: we are talking about religion here, it’s clearly a complex

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:11.126
topic and one that you could never cover adequately and in depth in 20 minutes.

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:14.596
So please do not be offended if you feel that something

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:18.736
hasn’t been explained in enough detail or with enough nuance.

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:22.486
That would take days or weeks, and we only have 20 minutes or so.

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:28.856
Right, with that disclaimer out of the way, let me ask you a follow-up question.

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:32.266
I’ve already asked you whether hell exists.

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:37.176
Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and imagine what you see in hell.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.180
Even if you were in that second category of responses, and you think hell most

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.888
definitely doesn’t exist, I’d imagine that some images are still coming to mind.

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:57.560
You might be imagining a fiery underground place, perhaps it is dark and cold, perhaps it’s

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.420
packed full of people being tormented by demons, perhaps it is silent and you are utterly alone.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.080
There are a myriad of different interpretations of hell, both in different religions and even

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.320
within the same religion theologians have proposed a multitude of different ideas about hell.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.950
People have been grappling with the concept for thousands of years.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.580
It is such a large topic that we will have to narrow our focus to the Judeo-Christian and Islamic

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.320
traditions, but we’ll also have time to look at a few interpretations of hell from other religions.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.600
So, to kick things off, what is hell?

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.970
It’s a very broad question, but if you looked in a dictionary you would find something like “a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.880
place regarded in various religions as a spiritual realm of evil and suffering, often traditionally

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.780
depicted as a place of perpetual fire beneath the earth where the wicked are punished after death.”

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.190
Or, to put it another way, in plain English, it’s a place where bad

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.920
people go when they die, a place where they are punished and tortured.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.439
So, where does this idea come from?

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.493
Well, as long as people have believed in some form of deity, some form of God, there has been

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:24.760
in almost all religions a theological explanation about what happens to people after they die.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.590
Good people are typically rewarded after death, they go to heaven

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.870
and they are united with God, but what happens to “bad” people?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.050
Going all the way back to the Ancient Egyptians, there was a concept of judgement in the afterlife.

00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:49.380
After someone died, their soul had to go through the underworld.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.930
Part of this journey involved their heart being weighed

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.630
by the goddess of truth, balance, order, and justice.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.930
The dead person’s heart was weighed against a feather.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.380
If the heart was lighter than the feather, the soul was considered just

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.940
and allowed to pass into the afterlife, known as the Field of Reeds.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.380
However, if their heart was heavier than the feather, this meant that the dead

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.580
person had led a life filled with sin and injustice, they were a bad person.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.840
And this didn’t bode well.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.260
The dead person would be gobbled up, devoured, by a goddess called

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.940
Ammit, who was a mixture between lion, hippopotamus and crocodile.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.100
If this happened, the dead person would die again, which

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.080
was understandably not what any Ancient Egyptian wanted.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.890
So, it’s not hell in the traditional sense, but it is an

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.930
early example of bad people being punished after death.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.740
And moving forward to the Ancient Greeks, it’s here where we start

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.680
to get a more modern view of hell, or at least a view that is more

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.090
comparable to the views of hell in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.250
The Ancient Greeks believed in the Underworld, a dark, gloomy place

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.900
where people went after death that was overseen by the god Hades.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.570
And they believed that there was a specific part of the Underworld called Tartarus, a

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.790
section of the underworld where people who had behaved badly in life were eternally punished.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.260
If you are familiar with Greek mythology, you might remember the punishment for Sisyphus,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.150
the man who was forced to forever roll a large boulder up a hill, or Tantalus, who

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.420
killed his son and served him as food, and as a result was forced to stand in a pool of

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.810
water under a fruit tree, but whenever he reached for the fruit the branches moved away.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.360
This, by the way, is where the word “tantalising” comes

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.790
from, meaning something you really want but you can’t get.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.460
Now, let’s move on to talk about some Judeo-Christian interpretations of hell.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.640
In Judaism, the concept of hell isn’t so clearly defined,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.390
or central to the religion as it is in Christianity.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.600
The focus in Judaism is generally more on how to live a good and

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.010
just life in this world, rather than on the nature of the afterlife.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.230
In the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh, there is a place called "Sheol" that is often translated

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.030
as "Hell," but it’s a little different to the hell that you might be thinking of;

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.680
it’s more like a shadowy, quiet place of the dead than a place of eternal punishment.

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:59.542
There is also the idea of something called “Gehinnom” or “Gehenna”, which is a kind of hell, but the

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:06.082
punishment you get there is to understand, to come to terms with your moral indiscretions in life.

00:08:07.242 --> 00:08:10.872
What’s more, you don’t stay there forever; it’s more like a

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:15.502
place to go to be purified rather than one of eternal damnation.

00:08:16.876 --> 00:08:20.066
Now, let's move on to the Christian tradition of Hell.

00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:28.746
Christianity has a clear, single text, The Bible, so what does The Bible say about hell?

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:32.716
Are there precise definitions of what happens, of the

00:08:32.716 --> 00:08:35.576
different sins and the requisite punishments for them?

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:38.066
In short, no.

00:08:38.896 --> 00:08:44.676
There are multiple references to hell, but these are open to interpretation.

00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:51.616
As you may know, there are two sections in the Bible, the Old Testament and the New Testament.

00:08:52.316 --> 00:08:57.946
The Old Testament was written in Hebrew and the New Testament was written in Greek.

00:08:58.776 --> 00:09:04.946
The only specific references to “hell” appear in the New Testament, so they are Greek.

00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:13.246
And in The Bible, there are multiple words that are translated as “hell” in English: Hades,

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:20.076
Gehenna and Tartarus, all words and concepts that are borrowed from Ancient Greek or Judaism,

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:26.576
but–as you’ve heard–have slightly different meanings to the vision of hell that you might have.

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:32.396
What’s more, there are many references to what happens to bad people

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:36.726
in the afterlife, without there being any specific detail provided.

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:43.756
Now, figuring out exactly what is meant in The Bible, or any religious text for that matter,

00:09:44.056 --> 00:09:49.556
has kept people busy for thousands of years, and continues to keep people busy to this very day,

00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:55.956
so this is not going to be any attempt to analyse and finally explain the text of the Bible.

00:09:56.943 --> 00:10:01.593
The main points of debate in the Christian tradition are threefold:

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.440
Firstly, how long does a sinner go to hell?

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.270
For all of eternity?

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.460
Until they realise the error of their ways?

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.480
Until Jesus returns to Earth?

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.370
Secondly, is going to hell reversible?

00:10:17.842 --> 00:10:21.531
In other words, if you are sent to hell, can you ever get out?

00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:26.631
And thirdly, what actually happens to people in hell?

00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:31.421
Is it full of constant punishment, what is the nature of this punishment?

00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:34.751
Is it spiritual, emotional or physical?

00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:41.371
Is the punishment of hell only that you are not with Jesus, or is there “extra” punishment as well?

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:48.931
None of this is explicitly specified in the Bible, yet modern beliefs

00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:53.701
of hell, especially in the popular imagination, have concentrated on a

00:10:53.711 --> 00:11:00.631
few ideas: constant punishment, often physical, fire and extreme heat.

00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:06.911
So, if this didn’t come directly from the Bible, where did it come from?

00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:12.991
Well, lots of people have explored this concept of hell and divine

00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:18.361
punishment, but this idea was developed most famously by the Italian

00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:23.511
poet Dante Alighieri in his 14th Century epic poem The Divine Comedy.

00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:29.781
This is a lengthy poem split into three different parts: Hell, or

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:35.141
“Inferno”, then Purgatory and Paradise, Purgatorio and Paradiso.

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:42.641
In this poem, Dante provides an incredibly detailed description of what happens in hell.

00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:50.941
For Dante, hell is formed of 9 circles, going deeper and deeper below the Earth, with

00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:55.921
the sins of the souls in each circle getting more and more serious the deeper they go.

00:11:57.271 --> 00:12:00.731
Each sinner is punished in a different way, their

00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.401
punishment fitting the crime that they committed on Earth.

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:08.684
In the second circle, the lustful are punished by being blown

00:12:08.744 --> 00:12:13.364
about by violent winds, symbolising their lack of self-control.

00:12:14.784 --> 00:12:19.674
Going further down, the gluttons, the people who were too greedy in

00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:24.544
life, they are forced to lie in a horrible mixture of freezing rain,

00:12:24.974 --> 00:12:30.634
black snow, and hail, symbolising their life of selfish overindulgence.

00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:36.254
It’s an absolutely wonderful poem, a story even, and if you

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:38.944
have never read it I’d certainly encourage you to do so.

00:12:40.034 --> 00:12:46.254
So, where did he get these ideas from, if they weren’t specified directly in the Bible?

00:12:47.764 --> 00:12:51.464
In his Inferno, Dante was building on pre-existing Christian

00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:56.054
interpretations of hell, some of which involved “eternal punishment”.

00:12:57.514 --> 00:13:03.194
When he combined these ideas with a variety of other Medieval traditions and texts, as well as

00:13:03.194 --> 00:13:10.324
his own imagination, he came up with this incredibly vivid idea of hell, described through his

00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:16.071
own eyes as he journeyed through hell and learned about it from the sinners suffering there.

00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:24.054
And although Dante’s Inferno isn’t a religious text per se, and indeed Dante’s

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:28.614
hell is not universally accepted by Christians, the vision of hell that he

00:13:28.614 --> 00:13:34.254
presented has become the basis for the kind of hell that you or I might think of.

00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:41.104
Of course, his vision of hell being a place of eternal punishment is not unique.

00:13:42.024 --> 00:13:45.344
The idea of hell being a place of eternal punishment, as well as the

00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:49.874
idea of hell having multiple levels, was already prominent in Islam.

00:13:51.104 --> 00:13:55.644
Now, like in the Judeo-Christian tradition, there are multiple different

00:13:55.664 --> 00:14:01.104
interpretations of hell within Islam, but they broadly go something like this.

00:14:01.934 --> 00:14:05.574
There are seven different circles of hell, with sinners of

00:14:05.574 --> 00:14:08.344
different categories being assigned to different circles.

00:14:10.014 --> 00:14:15.894
Hell in Islam, called “Jahannam", is filled with burning fire, and, like

00:14:15.894 --> 00:14:20.474
in Dante’s Inferno, people suffering all manner of terrible punishments.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:25.949
Like in the Christian tradition, there is debate among scholars about

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:30.659
the nature of hell in Islam: is it somewhere a sinner is condemned for

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:34.919
eternity or can they be allowed to leave if they renounce their sins?

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:37.219
What happens to non-Muslims?

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:41.519
Are they condemned to hell by default, or can a non-Muslim

00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:45.229
who believes in God be spared from the fiery furnace?

00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:50.709
Hell is a complicated place, full of many, many questions.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:58.499
And this brings me on to the penultimate point to touch on today, in this short exploration of hell.

00:14:59.749 --> 00:15:04.549
I told you that we weren’t going to go into any deep theological discussion, but

00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:10.529
we do need to mention the so-called “Problem of Hell”, which is an ethical question

00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:16.369
that unites Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and indeed any religion with a “hell”.

00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:25.409
And it goes something like this: if there is an all-seeing and all-knowing God, a God that

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:31.449
has the power to change behaviour, that has the power to do anything, why should Hell exist?

00:15:32.289 --> 00:15:36.139
And especially, why should a Hell exist where a soul

00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:39.819
created by God should be subjected to eternal torture?

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:43.489
It just doesn’t seem like the kind of thing that a

00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:47.859
benevolent, loving God should do, so the theory goes.

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:54.889
Now, there are plenty of “answers” to the “problem of Hell”, and it is a problem that

00:15:54.889 --> 00:16:00.852
Christian, Jewish and Islamic scholars have grappled with for centuries, so if this is

00:16:00.852 --> 00:16:06.002
an area you’d like explore further, there is a lifetime of literature on the subject.

00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:11.912
And the final point to make is that the one way of avoiding this “problem

00:16:11.912 --> 00:16:16.292
of hell” altogether is simply by not subscribing to the idea of hell.

00:16:17.582 --> 00:16:22.012
In Buddhism, for example, the idea of hell simply doesn’t exist.

00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:27.512
Buddhists believe that there is a brief period after death where the soul might

00:16:27.602 --> 00:16:33.592
suffer temporarily, but only before being reborn, before being reincarnated.

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:41.532
Similarly, Hinduism has a temporary realm of suffering called “Naraka”, but it’s more like

00:16:41.532 --> 00:16:47.572
a temporary purgatory, a place where people go to pay for their sins, before being reborn.

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:54.492
And still on the subject of predominantly Asian religions, Confucianism doesn’t really

00:16:54.492 --> 00:17:00.952
have a clear answer to what happens after death, so there is no clear concept of hell.

00:17:02.462 --> 00:17:07.852
Now, of course, if we are talking about belief systems overall, or systems of

00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:13.072
disbelief, you could say, if you do not believe in a God, if you are atheist

00:17:13.072 --> 00:17:17.102
or if you are agnostic, then you don’t have to worry about the “problem of

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:21.802
hell”, because you believe that there is no hell; it simply doesn’t exist.

00:17:23.102 --> 00:17:28.462
Right, the final point to address is that, even though there might be debate in almost

00:17:28.522 --> 00:17:34.042
every religion with hell about what goes on there, clearly the concept of hell is

00:17:34.042 --> 00:17:39.662
a useful one when it comes to encouraging good moral behaviour and belief in god.

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:45.912
After all, if there is even the slightest possibility of being forced to lie in a horrible

00:17:45.912 --> 00:17:51.462
mixture of freezing rain and black snow all day, or of a devil putting a hot poker up your

00:17:51.462 --> 00:17:58.032
bottom or being eaten alive by a big ferocious monster, avoiding this fate might just be

00:17:58.032 --> 00:18:03.292
the sort of thing that encourages you to believe in God and be on your best behaviour.

00:18:04.322 --> 00:18:08.222
So, to wrap things up, and perhaps try to answer the

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:11.702
question of the title of the episode, what is hell?

00:18:12.752 --> 00:18:16.772
Who knows, but be good and you’ll never need to find out.

00:18:19.121 --> 00:18:23.271
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration of hell.

00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:27.191
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that it might have shone some

00:18:27.191 --> 00:18:31.821
light on what many people consider to be a dark and mysterious place.

00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:35.841
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:39.871
If you believe in Hell, what does it look like for you?

00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:44.211
What are some expressions in your language that use the word “hell”?

00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:51.071
If you are a believer in a religion we didn’t touch on in this episode, what does hell mean to you?

00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:55.211
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

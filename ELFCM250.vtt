Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:16.832
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.052
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:28.312
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the history of smoking.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:33.142
Now people have smoked all sorts of things for thousands of

00:00:33.142 --> 00:00:37.622
years, but nothing has ever been more popular than tobacco.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.039
Tobacco, and cigarettes in particular, have a fascinating but sordid history;

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.149
we’ve known about the dangers of smoking for decades, perhaps even centuries.

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:57.029
And yet, smoking has long been marketed as something glamourous, cool, and aspirational.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.549
So, today, we are going to look at the early history of tobacco, why

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.519
people started smoking in the first place, how it became one of the

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:11.859
world’s largest industries, and what the future of smoking might look like.

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:20.024
Now, depending on where and where you grew up, one of the smells that is

00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:25.484
probably most recognisable and familiar to you is the smell of cigarette smoke.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:32.094
If you’re over 30, you doubtless saw many people smoking indoors, and

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:37.614
you also probably saw an ashtray on nearly every coffee table you sat at.

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:45.624
And you may even remember your office or workplace being filled with the smell of cigarette smoke.

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:50.014
These days, of course, it’s a bit different.

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:57.064
It is illegal to smoke in indoor public spaces in much of the United States, and Europe.

00:01:57.524 --> 00:02:02.104
Many other countries, even the historically cigarette-loving

00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:06.454
China have also instituted strict smoking bans.

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:14.344
New Zealand has even gone a step further and proposed a plan to one day end

00:02:14.364 --> 00:02:20.244
smoking entirely in the country, by banning the sale of cigarettes to the youngest

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:26.614
generation, making it illegal for anyone born after 2008 to buy cigarettes.

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:32.854
Yet in spite of all of these measures, more than one billion people,

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:39.114
14% of the entire global population, still smoke cigarettes, and the

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:43.574
cigarette industry is still among the most profitable in the world.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:51.914
But how exactly did cigarettes, and tobacco smoking in general, become as widespread as it did?

00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:59.324
Well, when we imagine someone smoking, we probably imagine them smoking cigarettes.

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:05.254
But the activity of smoking is, of course, much much older than the cigarette.

00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:10.034
Tobacco is thought to have been cultivated and smoked for

00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:13.764
thousands of years by indigenous peoples in the Americas.

00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:19.204
For these indigenous groups across North and South America, tobacco

00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:23.684
played a very different role than it does in many cultures today.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:29.684
These groups considered tobacco to be sacred, to be holy and

00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:34.914
used it in ceremonies, for prayer, and for medicinal purposes.

00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:42.594
Many indigenous communities still use tobacco this way, though not nearly as much as they once did.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:48.304
The turning point in tobacco’s history, however — at least as far

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:53.930
as the rest of the world is concerned —   happened in 1492, when the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.640
Italian explorer Christopher Columbus arrived on the island of Cuba.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.080
As you probably know, he actually thought he had arrived

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.510
in China, but that’s a story for another episode.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.973
In Cuba, Columbus encountered members of the island’s native population, and

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:20.231
observed something rather curious; they had rolled some leaves into tubes,

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:26.071
had set fire to one end of them, and they were breathing in the smoke.

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:30.991
When Columbus tried smoking these mysterious leaves

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:35.481
himself, he found that he rather liked how it made him feel.

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:44.491
Smoking on the whole was new to Columbus and his men, as almost nobody in Europe smoked at the time.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:51.231
The leaves were tobacco — or ‘cohíba’ in the indigenous Taíno language.

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:58.951
Columbus, however, heard the Taíno word ‘tabako’ — a word which actually referred to

00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:06.261
those rolled tubes the locals were smoking, not the plant itself — anyhow the name stuck.

00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:12.631
Although this was the first time Columbus had puffed on a cigarette,

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:16.941
it wasn’t actually the first time he had encountered tobacco.

00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:22.331
Before landing in Cuba, on the Bahamian island known today as San

00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:27.011
Salvador, he had been given tobacco leaves as a gift by the natives.

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.551
But he didn’t know what they were, or what to do with them, so he

00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:36.181
simply threw them overboard, he threw them into the water off his ship.

00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:43.411
Columbus brought tobacco leaves and seeds back with him to Spain, he taught

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:48.121
people how to smoke them, and the habit caught on amongst the Spanish.

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:54.781
Portuguese sailors brought tobacco, and the pastime of smoking, back to their country too.

00:05:55.821 --> 00:06:00.051
And Tobacco continued to spread rapidly throughout the continent.

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:06.101
In the late 16th century, the French diplomat Jean Nicot encountered a

00:06:06.161 --> 00:06:11.031
tobacco plant in Lisbon, in Portugal, while on a trip from his native France.

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:19.371
Nicot, who had learned of tobacco’s supposed curative properties, sent some tobacco seeds

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:25.351
to the then-queen of France, Catherine de Médici, who suffered badly from headaches.

00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:30.451
The tobacco seeds he sent came with instructions.

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:39.521
She was to crush the seeds into powder and inhale it, to breathe it up into her nose.

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:46.521
This apparently proved successful, and the practice of inhaling

00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:52.041
ground tobacco seeds — a preparation known as ‘snuff’ — caught on.

00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:57.661
Snuff-taking, as it was called, took hold in France,

00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.871
quickly spreading to England and the rest of Europe.

00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:04.661
Pipe smoking became popular during this time as well.

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:09.821
As with Catherine de Médici, tobacco was used as a

00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:14.451
treatment for all sorts of health problems, even cancer.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:20.791
The claims about its medicinal properties were, of course, dubious at best.

00:07:21.781 --> 00:07:27.321
Tobacco’s global expansion had truly started, and smoking became a popular

00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:31.991
activity all across Europe, north Africa, the Middle East, and China.

00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:39.031
The centre for global production was in the harsh slave plantations of the southern

00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:45.391
United States, but it was also being grown in places like India, China, and West Africa.

00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:53.911
Now, while cigarettes are thought to have been invented as far back as the 1600s, by beggars

00:07:54.021 --> 00:08:01.481
in Seville, Spain, the pre-rolled cigarette didn’t really take hold until the 19th century.

00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:08.861
This was mainly because, prior to that point, they were made almost entirely by hand.

00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:13.801
There were some machines that existed, but they simply weren’t very efficient.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:22.511
This made the pre-rolled cigarette a relatively high-end luxury item, one which the average

00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:29.741
person couldn’t really afford — a far cry from the packs of pre-rolled cigarettes sold nowadays.

00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:34.911
The one thing that made a huge impact on the industry

00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:38.331
was a little invention called the Bonsack Machine.

00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:48.601
In 1880, a man named James Bonsack invented a machine that could roll up to 210 cigarettes a minute.

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.611
This was a huge deal, to say the least.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:58.741
Bonsack went into business with a man named James Buchanan Duke, and

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:05.331
by the late 1880s, the men were making 4 million cigarettes daily.

00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:12.921
Cigarettes could now be mass-produced, which reduced the cost, and made them available to almost

00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:20.411
anyone, and as any smoker knows, it’s far more convenient to not have to roll your own cigarettes.

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:27.271
Cigarettes were even famously included in soldiers’ ration packs during World War

00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:33.741
I, as a way for them to cope with both boredom and the stresses of trench warfare.

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:37.751
Sales of cigarettes also boomed during World War II.

00:09:39.131 --> 00:09:44.131
As a result, by 1950, around half of the adult

00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:48.011
population in the industrialised world smoked cigarettes.

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:54.184
Now, most people today are at least somewhat aware of the dangers of

00:09:54.184 --> 00:09:58.884
smoking, and whether or not you are a smoker you don’t need me to tell

00:09:58.884 --> 00:10:03.204
you that smoking is not a very good idea from a health point of view.

00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:11.714
But back in, say, the 1940s or 50s, people just didn’t have the information we have today.

00:10:12.484 --> 00:10:18.064
There were rumours that smoking led to a higher rate of certain diseases, and

00:10:18.224 --> 00:10:24.694
smokers tended to cough more and have trouble breathing compared to non-smokers,

00:10:25.004 --> 00:10:30.274
but there wasn’t hard, scientific evidence about the dangers of smoking.

00:10:31.324 --> 00:10:36.374
On January 12th, 1964, however, the New York Times

00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:40.434
published a story that erased that doubt altogether.

00:10:41.624 --> 00:10:45.614
The headline, printed on the newspaper’s front page in

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:50.784
big, bold letters, read: ‘Cigarettes Peril Health, U.S.

00:10:50.814 --> 00:10:52.074
Report Concludes.’

00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:56.194
Peril, by the way, means harm, causes danger to.

00:10:57.594 --> 00:11:03.794
Cigarette smoking, the article stated, contributed so substantially to the U.S.

00:11:03.794 --> 00:11:09.376
death rate that immediate action would need to be taken to prevent further harm.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:14.996
These days, it’s common knowledge that cigarettes can lead

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:18.886
to lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:23.606
There are graphic adverts and public service announcements that

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:27.946
show just how bad the effects of smoking can be on our health.

00:11:28.686 --> 00:11:33.956
Yet when Surgeon General Luther Terry released his report

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:38.316
during a January 11th press conference, it was a bombshell.

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:43.716
So, why exactly did the report have such a huge effect on people?

00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:49.246
Well, prior to the report’s release, doctors were unable to prove

00:11:49.356 --> 00:11:52.726
that there was a definitive link between smoking and cancer.

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:57.226
Yes, people certainly felt some of the effects, from

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.886
throat irritation, to coughing, to shortness of breath.

00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:04.936
And doctors were also starting to notice that people who

00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:09.706
smoked were often more likely to develop certain diseases.

00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:13.402
Yet, no one knew exactly how bad the risks were.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.586
To understand just how disturbing this news must have been, it’s useful

00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:24.876
to remember quite how important smoking was in many peoples’ daily lives.

00:12:25.876 --> 00:12:29.286
Tobacco is, of course, an addictive substance.

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:33.666
It contains the chemical compound of nicotine, which is a stimulant.

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:39.336
Simply put, nicotine makes you feel good, and it was that feeling

00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:43.516
that Christopher Columbus enjoyed so much on his trip to Cuba.

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:49.406
But tobacco isn’t just physically addictive; it’s a major part

00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:53.456
of many people’s daily routine, particularly their social lives.

00:12:54.576 --> 00:13:00.426
Whether it is with the morning coffee, at a break at work or over a drink at a pub

00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:07.206
after work, as any smoker knows, the cigarette is often a fundamental part of social

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:13.396
life, and this was especially so during the years before the Surgeon General’s warning.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:18.316
Now this, as it turns out, the fact that the cigarette

00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:22.766
was an integral part of life, was not entirely accidental.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:29.916
Cigarette companies were, and to some extent still are, masters at advertising.

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:35.856
From around the 1920s onward, adverts for cigarettes were colourful

00:13:36.046 --> 00:13:40.956
and elaborate, and companies spared no expense in their design.

00:13:41.686 --> 00:13:47.836
Tobacco companies knew that they were all selling the same end product, dried tobacco

00:13:47.836 --> 00:13:53.846
leaves wrapped in paper, but they needed to persuade people that their product was unique.

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:59.936
Cigarettes started to show up in a number of Hollywood films, smoked by some of the

00:13:59.936 --> 00:14:05.986
most glamourous actors and actresses of the time, from James Dean to Audrey Hepburn.

00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:11.864
They were also advertised in magazines, on the television and on the radio.

00:14:12.354 --> 00:14:14.594
The messages were not subtle.

00:14:15.114 --> 00:14:21.124
Adverts for companies like Camel, Marlboro, and Lucky Strike portrayed smoking in an

00:14:21.404 --> 00:14:28.474
aspirational light, with photos of beautiful women, ruggedly handsome men, and happy couples.

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:34.444
Smoking was cool, it was something done by the beautiful, the rich and the famous.

00:14:35.724 --> 00:14:40.494
Much like adverts for things like cars, clothing, and cologne,

00:14:40.744 --> 00:14:45.054
cigarette adverts promoted a lifestyle, not just a product.

00:14:46.394 --> 00:14:50.344
And many of these adverts even claimed that their cigarettes were

00:14:50.504 --> 00:14:56.354
healthier than the others; one 1946 print advert for the brand Camel

00:14:56.724 --> 00:15:00.904
claimed that “More Doctors Smoke Camel Than Any Other Cigarette.”

00:15:01.714 --> 00:15:05.924
Some even claimed that their cigarettes were safe for pregnant women.

00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:12.154
There were also ‘light’ and ‘mild’ cigarettes, which were marketed as a healthier choice.

00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:16.764
Nowadays, these claims seem rather suspect.

00:15:17.004 --> 00:15:21.954
But, back then, of course the information about smoking’s health risks

00:15:22.224 --> 00:15:27.204
just wasn't as widespread; people had no reason to believe any differently.

00:15:28.214 --> 00:15:33.164
But despite the best efforts of the tobacco industry, it was

00:15:33.164 --> 00:15:36.954
fighting a losing battle against the scientific evidence.

00:15:37.544 --> 00:15:45.254
In fact, by 1958, 44 percent of Americans already believed smoking caused cancer, and a

00:15:45.254 --> 00:15:52.004
number of medical associations warned that tobacco use could cause lung and heart disease.

00:15:53.494 --> 00:16:00.834
To counter, to fight this growing belief in the ill effects of tobacco, in 1958

00:16:01.084 --> 00:16:07.614
some of the largest American tobacco companies formed the Tobacco Institute, an

00:16:07.614 --> 00:16:13.774
organisation which aimed to undermine the research that linked smoking with disease.

00:16:14.544 --> 00:16:18.094
Once it was established, the Tobacco Institute was

00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:22.674
hell-bent on trying to preserve its product’s reputation.

00:16:23.664 --> 00:16:27.104
Yet, try as it might, it was fighting a losing battle.

00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:34.934
Since the Surgeon General Luther Terry released his bombshell report in 1964, dozens

00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:39.909
of other reports have come out that linked smoking to chronic illness and death.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:47.064
People might have liked smoking, they might have liked the feeling of smoking cigarettes

00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:53.154
but they didn’t like the idea of dying, and smokers started quitting the habit and

00:16:53.404 --> 00:16:59.194
teenagers stopped taking it up, at least to the same degree that they had in previous years.

00:17:00.164 --> 00:17:06.564
But it was in the 1980s and 1990s, that tobacco companies started to feel the

00:17:06.714 --> 00:17:11.984
legal consequences of being more concerned with profit than public health.

00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:16.274
In 1996, a man named Dr.

00:17:16.274 --> 00:17:19.984
Jeffrey Wigand — a former executive at the U.S.

00:17:19.984 --> 00:17:25.334
tobacco company Brown & Williamson — revealed that his company had added

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:30.384
harmful chemicals to its products in order to make them more addictive.

00:17:31.474 --> 00:17:37.564
Perhaps the most groundbreaking case, however, was something called the Master Settlement Agreement.

00:17:38.364 --> 00:17:45.584
In 1998, Brown & Williamson, along with three of the U.S.’ largest tobacco companies, would be

00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:55.834
forced to pay $206 billion  — around €350 billion in today’s money— over a period of 25 years.

00:17:57.284 --> 00:18:02.704
The money went towards covering tobacco-related healthcare costs in the United States,

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:08.904
and the settlement put an end to many of the industry’s most harmful marketing efforts.

00:18:10.094 --> 00:18:17.474
Many individuals have also succeeded in suing tobacco companies over smoking-related health issues.

00:18:18.144 --> 00:18:25.494
One of the most famous was Howard Engle, a paediatrician who, along with a group of other

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:32.564
plaintiffs, other people in the case, successfully sued the tobacco industry in 1994 for

00:18:32.564 --> 00:18:39.901
smoking-related health problems, forcing the tobacco companies to pay out $145 billion.

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:47.214
And since the start of the 1990s, the leaders of the tobacco industry continue

00:18:47.244 --> 00:18:52.554
to face lawsuits like these, and they have paid out hundreds of billions of

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:58.794
Euros in damages to both victims of smoking-related illnesses and their families.

00:18:59.984 --> 00:19:04.174
And yet, Big Tobacco — the name given to the world’s most

00:19:04.194 --> 00:19:08.194
powerful tobacco companies — shows no sign of going anywhere.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:13.444
Even though smoking rates in the United States and the U.K.

00:19:13.544 --> 00:19:20.458
have been falling for decades, and global rates have been falling on the whole, population

00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:25.948
growth has meant that more cigarettes are being smoked by more people than ever before.

00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:33.268
Indeed, in 2019 there were an estimated 7.41 trillion

00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:37.638
cigarettes smoked worldwide by 1.14 billion people.

00:19:38.298 --> 00:19:43.098
And although there are more cigarettes being smoked than ever before, and there is

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:49.098
no shortage of current customers for Big Tobacco, the percentage of adults who smoke

00:19:49.298 --> 00:19:54.928
is falling, and the percentage of teenagers taking up the habit is also falling.

00:19:56.358 --> 00:20:00.518
This might be a good thing as far as public health is concerned,

00:20:00.798 --> 00:20:04.788
but it presents a rather large problem for Big Tobacco.

00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:11.608
Big Tobacco knows that it has an incredibly addictive product that its users

00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:17.418
physically need to use multiple times a day and have great trouble stopping using.

00:20:18.348 --> 00:20:24.008
With over a billion smokers worldwide, cigarette companies make vast amounts of

00:20:24.008 --> 00:20:29.598
money, but the business model isn’t sustainable long-term because fewer and fewer

00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:34.688
young people are taking up smoking and, well, it’s not a nice thing to say but the

00:20:34.688 --> 00:20:40.438
nature of smoking is that it doesn’t help its customers live a long and healthy life.

00:20:41.598 --> 00:20:48.798
In developing countries with less regulation about tobacco advertising, Big Tobacco can continue

00:20:48.798 --> 00:20:54.498
to use the same strategies that worked to get hundreds of millions of Americans and Europeans

00:20:54.498 --> 00:21:01.938
smoking, but in more regulated environments they need to innovate and develop new products.

00:21:02.988 --> 00:21:09.638
E-cigarettes, or “vapes”, for example, which allow the user to inhale nicotine through

00:21:09.638 --> 00:21:15.338
vapour, have - as I'm sure you know - become enormously popular in recent years.

00:21:16.298 --> 00:21:20.848
This is particularly true among the younger generation; in

00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:25.948
2018, over 20 percent of high school students in the U.S.

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:32.518
vaped — vaped is the word for using an e-cigarette – vs just 8% for cigarettes.

00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:37.588
Many vape brands, it just so happens, are owned by Big Tobacco.

00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:45.197
Although vaping is considerably less harmful than smoking, it still isn’t without its dangers, and

00:21:45.397 --> 00:21:51.767
there have been hundreds of deaths and thousands of lung injuries caused by vaping in the US alone.

00:21:52.837 --> 00:21:57.597
Now, with everything we now know about the tobacco industry, one very

00:21:57.597 --> 00:22:01.587
large question remains: what does the future of smoking look like?

00:22:02.757 --> 00:22:07.217
As I mentioned at the beginning of this episode, New Zealand plans

00:22:07.217 --> 00:22:12.687
to enact a law that will effectively ban anyone currently 14 years

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:17.177
old or younger from purchasing cigarettes for their entire lives.

00:22:17.767 --> 00:22:18.247
The U.K.

00:22:18.247 --> 00:22:25.449
government also recently announced its goal to make England smoke-free by the year 2030.

00:22:26.667 --> 00:22:33.407
Tobacco companies like Philip Morris have even proposed what they’re calling a ‘smoke-free future,’

00:22:33.947 --> 00:22:40.447
in which cigarettes are replaced entirely by smoke-free tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes.

00:22:41.187 --> 00:22:45.237
Yet there’s still no evidence that switching to e-cigarettes

00:22:45.387 --> 00:22:48.437
will help cigarette smokers quit tobacco for good.

00:22:49.517 --> 00:22:55.137
So, all of this begs the question: will we ever live in a smoke-free world?

00:22:55.257 --> 00:23:01.017
And will mankind ever be able to wean itself off its addiction to tobacco?

00:23:01.877 --> 00:23:03.687
Well, one thing’s for sure.

00:23:04.197 --> 00:23:09.017
Big Tobacco has been fighting hard for hundreds of years, and for all its

00:23:09.017 --> 00:23:14.037
talk about a smoke-free future, it sure isn’t going down without a fight.

00:23:15.867 --> 00:23:20.587
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the history of smoking.

00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:24.337
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:25.097 --> 00:23:28.797
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:32.287
What is the culture towards smoking in your country?

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:35.617
How has this changed over the course your lifetime?

00:23:36.147 --> 00:23:42.657
What do you think when you hear that a tobacco company wants to help create a “smoke free future”?

00:23:43.107 --> 00:23:46.787
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

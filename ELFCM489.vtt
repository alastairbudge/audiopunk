Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.469
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.759
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.651
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Jimmy Lai.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.590
He was one of the most successful businessmen in Hong Kong, worth billions of dollars.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.940
But he decided that there was something he valued more than money: freedom.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.320
His is a story of entrepreneurship, Hong Kong, democracy, China,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.700
communism, protest, bravery and conviction, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.280
OK then, let’s get started and learn about the story of Jimmy Lai.

00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:02.230
In life, one chance meeting can change everything.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.520
For Jimmy Lai, this came at some point in the mid 1950s.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.149
He was a small boy, just 8 or 9 years old at the time, and he was working

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.580
as a railway porter in Canton, modern day Guangzhou, in southern China.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.640
China had officially turned communist in 1949, and within a few years anyone who

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.240
was deemed opposed to the revolution found themselves in a difficult position.

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:39.000
Jimmy Lai’s father was one such person.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.550
He had been a successful businessman, but his business, house and possessions were stripped

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.248
from him and both he and his wife, Jimmy’s mother, were sent to a labour camp for reeducation.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.020
Jimmy was on the street, doing anything he could to make ends meet.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.329
Including carrying people’s suitcases to and from trains in Canton railway station.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.089
This gave the young boy a rare opportunity to experience the outside

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.010
world, the world beyond the impoverished streets upon which he lived.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.070
The nature of a railway station is of course that people come and go, and it gave Jimmy the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.130
chance to see how people lived, how they dressed, what life was like outside communist China.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.019
And one day, after carrying a well-dressed man’s baggage, the man stopped.

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:46.459
He gave Jimmy a few coins as payment, but he reached

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.310
into his pocket and brought out a bar of chocolate.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.020
He gave it to Jimmy, who looked astounded.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.299
He had never seen a bar of chocolate before, let alone tasted one.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.259
He opened it, bit into it, and the starving little boy was

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.230
immediately hit by the delicious taste of velvety chocolate.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.490
He turned to the man and asked him where he was from, to which he responded “Hong Kong”.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.780
Jimmy thought that Hong Kong must be heaven, because he had never tasted anything so delicious.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.450
He was determined to get to this idyllic place, this mythical

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.660
land of wealth and most importantly, chocolate: Hong Kong.

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:42.750
Now, it took him a few years, but when he was just 12 years old he managed to stow away

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.870
on a boat with another 100 or so children of a similar age, and they made it to Hong Kong.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.609
Today you can make the trip from Guangzhou to Hong Kong on a high-speed train - it takes only

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:03.180
50 minutes - but back then it would have taken several hours, with these poor young boys and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.470
girls packed away like sardines at the bottom of a boat swaying from side to side with the waves.

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.700
When he arrived, it was a different world.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:22.610
Hong Kong was still a British colony, and compared to mainland China, its economy was booming.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.859
It was a regional manufacturing centre, with thousands

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.169
of factories producing garments and household goods.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.260
It was a far cry from the People’s Republic of China that Jimmy left

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.600
behind, which had started its bold experiment with collectivisation

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.010
that would lead to the deaths of tens of millions of its citizens.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.140
Jimmy, who let’s remember, was only a 12 year old boy at the time, immediately

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.930
started working in one of these factories, a factory making gloves.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.830
It was hard, mindless and dangerous work with 12 hour days, and

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.330
indeed the young boy lost part of a finger in an industrial accident.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.539
But there was something about the city, something about Hong Kong, that inspired him.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.650
It seemed like a place where anything was possible.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.240
Early on in his time there he realised that there was a skill that he needed to

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.100
develop, a skill that perhaps you might also be thinking about: to speak English.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.790
This wasn’t some great foresight on his part, or that he had read about the economic growth

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.380
of America, it was a simple practical reason: he saw that the people in the factories

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:52.010
who pointed at him and gave orders all spoke English, so he thought “if I want to be one

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.739
of those one day, if I want to get ahead, English seems like something I should know”.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.940
Fast forward a few years and Jimmy had worked his way up, becoming the manager of a factory.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.550
He received a year end bonus, invested it in Hong Kong’s booming

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.099
stock market, had a few big wins, and branched out on his own.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:22.580
Now, we aren’t going to talk so much about his business career, but he launched

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.020
what would become Giordano, a clothing brand that you might have heard of.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.600
Despite its Italian-sounding name, Giordano is 100% Jimmy Lai, it is a Hong Kong brand.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.629
He joked about picking the name from a napkin in a New York pizza joint.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.445
He was clearly a talented businessman, and before long there were

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.789
thousands of Giordano shops all over the world, especially in Asia.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.395
This made Jimmy Lai a very rich man, a billionaire.

00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:03.690
At the same time that all of this was happening, so in the late 1980s and early

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.659
1990s, the political winds were changing both in mainland China and in Hong Kong.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.229
Mao Zedong had died in 1976, and after his death China

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.960
had embarked on a policy of opening up its economy.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.460
Jimmy Lai had been a direct beneficiary of this, as mainland China was a key

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:36.090
market for Giordano, but he was still distrustful of the authorities in Beijing.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.169
And then, in 1989, there were the Tiananmen Square protests,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.329
with the resulting crackdown on the student protestors.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.609
This flipped a switch for Jimmy Lai, as he knew that if the Chinese government could

00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:58.040
do this in Beijing, it wouldn’t be long before they could do this in Hong Kong too.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.580
And it’s now that we have to switch gears a little for some

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.630
Hong Kong history, and in fact some Hong Kong geography too.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.560
Hong Kong island, the 80 kilometre squared island, was

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.859
handed over to the British in 1842 after the first Opium War.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.270
After the Second Opium War, which ended in 1860, the British acquired

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.380
more territory on mainland China itself, Kowloon and Stonecutters Island.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:39.640
And then in 1898, Britain acquired a much larger piece of land, called the “New Territories”.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.320
But this was different.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:48.390
Instead of China giving this piece of land to Britain, or perhaps it would be more accurate

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.699
to say Britain taking this land from China, the arrangement was for a 99 year lease.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:04.249
In other words, China rented this piece of land to Britain for a period of 99 years.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:11.180
There was no explicit provision in the contract specifying what would happen after

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:18.862
the 99 years, in 1997 but as Hong Kong continued to develop economically and become

00:09:19.102 --> 00:09:24.012
an important regional hub, there was no question about it returning to China.

00:09:25.342 --> 00:09:29.772
This leased piece of territory was by far the largest part of Hong Kong,

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:33.801
so it would have been almost impossible for the British to keep the much

00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:37.718
smaller Hong Kong island, Kowloon Peninsula, and Stonecutter’s Island

00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:41.791
The entire thing would go back, the leased piece of

00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:44.861
territory and the two smaller pieces of Hong Kong.

00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:47.311
It would all be returned to China.

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:53.891
So, starting in the late 1970s, negotiations began between Britain

00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:58.231
and China about what Hong Kong returning to China would look like.

00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:00.911
It would not be simple.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:07.621
After all, mainland China was a one-party state ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.

00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:15.651
Hong Kong was never a full electoral democracy, but it had taken important steps towards democracy,

00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:20.741
especially after people had seen what had happened across the border in Tiananmen Square.

00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:25.731
There was a huge discrepancy in wealth and living standards.

00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:35.021
China in 1997 had a GDP per capita of under $800, while Hong Kong’s was more than $27,000.

00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:40.631
What’s more, they had very different political and legal systems.

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:45.571
So, the negotiators had the difficult task of agreeing what

00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:48.771
would happen to Hong Kong after it was handed back to China.

00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:52.061
How would Hong Kong be governed and administered?

00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:53.581
What laws would apply?

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.221
How would it all work?

00:10:56.621 --> 00:11:01.361
The agreement that was reached was “one country, two systems”.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.541
In other words, Hong Kong would become part of China

00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:09.771
again, but it would operate in a different, unique way.

00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:17.831
This framework was meant to last for 50 years, to give time for Hong Kong to properly be absorbed

00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:28.001
into China, so this process would start in 1997 and continue until 2047, 23 years from now.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.016
And this brings us back to Jimmy Lai.

00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:37.161
He had seen what had happened in Tiananmen Square, he had seen the suppression of the

00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:42.511
human rights and freedoms that he had come to enjoy in Hong Kong, and he was worried.

00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:49.161
In 1995, with $100 million of his own money, he decided

00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:52.961
to start a newspaper, which he called Apple Daily.

00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.151
It was quite a sensational publication, covering

00:11:57.181 --> 00:12:00.921
everything from news to gossip to scandalous stories.

00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:07.211
Nobody was immune to its criticism, not even the Chinese communist party.

00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:14.731
It was staunchly pro democracy, and in editorials it argued for free

00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:19.121
speech, the right to protest, and the defence of civil liberties.

00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:27.381
It soon became one of the most popular newspapers in Hong Kong, and this was a problem for Beijing.

00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:33.541
Jimmy Lai’s house was attacked multiple times, he received death threats,

00:12:33.891 --> 00:12:39.021
once he even returned home to find a skinned dog on his doorstep.

00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:44.491
While all of this was going on, he was still the owner of the

00:12:44.511 --> 00:12:48.841
Giordano clothing brand, whose key market was mainland China.

00:12:49.831 --> 00:12:53.471
There were political campaigns in China encouraging citizens

00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:58.061
to boycott the brand, as it was run by an enemy of China.

00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:05.701
Running the company in China became increasingly difficult, and in 1996, a

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:11.239
year after launching Apple Daily, Lai was forced to sell his stake in Giordano.

00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:14.371
It simply wasn’t tenable any more.

00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:21.491
To do business in China, especially at the kind of level that Jimmy Lai was at, you cannot

00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:27.631
be publicly critical of Beijing, and you most certainly cannot run a pro-democracy newspaper.

00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:35.731
A year later, in 1997, the handover took place, and Hong Kong returned to China.

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:41.269
And slowly but surely, the pressure from Beijing started.

00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:47.919
The people of Hong Kong, who had enjoyed the freedom to protest and had experienced the

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:53.619
fledglings of democracy, soon started to feel the pressure of the Chinese government.

00:13:54.919 --> 00:14:00.079
Pro-democracy lawmakers were sidelined, Hong Kong laws were replaced by

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:04.679
Beijing ones, there was increased censorship and control over the media.

00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:11.549
Lai’s Apple Daily became a beacon of pro-freedom and pro-democracy, and

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:16.209
Lai himself became a prominent figure in the pro-democracy movement.

00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:20.559
He would organise protests, he would be there with everyone else

00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:25.185
in a t-shirt, sitting peacefully or speaking into a megaphone.

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:30.169
And the emphasis on peace is an important one.

00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.059
He always made sure that any protest that he was involved

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:38.179
in was a peaceful one, that he never resorted to violence.

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:43.699
Even when the police attacked protestors, with tear gas for example,

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:48.589
he encouraged them to fight their violence with peaceful means.

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:55.999
You might remember the “umbrella movement” from 2014, where protestors were encouraged to put up

00:14:56.039 --> 00:15:01.329
umbrellas to protect themselves from tear gas and water cannons that the police would fire at them.

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:07.892
But peaceful or not, Beijing did not like Jimmy Lai.

00:15:09.287 --> 00:15:13.349
Now, remember that after the handover in 1997, the

00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:17.849
agreement for Hong Kong had been “one country, two systems”.

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:24.889
In other words, Hong Kong was part of China but it had things like a different legal system.

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:31.349
And for several years, citizens of Hong Kong were protected from

00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:35.589
some of the more draconian of China’s laws and security measures,

00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:40.769
which intensified after Xi Jinping took over as President in 2012.

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:48.479
For example, in 2015, China passed its National Security Law, which was

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:52.959
intended to protect the country and its citizens, but its critics have said

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:57.099
has made it easier to lock up anyone who is critical of the government.

00:15:58.549 --> 00:16:04.509
In Hong Kong there was no such law, and indeed after the law was passed on

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:10.129
the mainland, the chief executive of Hong Kong–essentially the main regional

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:15.159
political leader–said that there were no plans to include a similar law.

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:18.367
One country, two systems remember.

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:28.169
But fast forward only 5 years, and in 2020 Hong Kong got its own national security law.

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:34.419
It is deliberately difficult to interpret, but the upshot is that

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:39.399
it granted Beijing supreme authority over Hong Kong laws, and the

00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:43.789
Chinese government the ability to interpret the law as it saw fit.

00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:48.319
It meant that people could be held without trial, that people could be

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:53.519
deported to China, and it put an exceeding amount of pressure on the media.

00:16:54.949 --> 00:17:01.049
Apple Daily, the pro-democracy newspaper founded by Jimmy Lai, was a casualty of this.

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:07.699
In August of 2020, just a few months after the law was passed, the offices

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:13.129
of Apple Daily were raided, and the following June 500 police officers

00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:17.619
charged into the offices, arresting multiple people, including Jimmy Lai.

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:24.359
He was led out in handcuffs, the then 72-year-old frogmarched out of

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:29.039
the company’s offices, flanked by two stern-looking police officers.

00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:35.809
And since then his bank accounts have been frozen, and properties seized.

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:43.459
He has been in and out of court multiple times, and has faced charges of everything from

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:49.759
unlawful assembly to conspiring and colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.

00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:57.076
His flagship newspaper, Apple Daily, was forced to close down in 2021,

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:01.199
dealing a crippling blow to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.

00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:07.899
And to this day Jimmy Lai has remained in custody.

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:12.939
As of the time of writing this episode, his trial is

00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:17.419
ongoing, but its outcome is a foregone conclusion.

00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:25.719
To date, national security trials have a 100% conviction rate, and there is little

00:18:25.719 --> 00:18:31.569
doubt that it will remain at 100% long after the verdict is passed on Jimmy Lai.

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:37.159
If he is convicted, which may even have happened by the time this

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:41.039
is released, he faces spending the rest of his life in prison.

00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:46.089
In all probability he will never be allowed to see his family again,

00:18:46.369 --> 00:18:50.359
he will never taste the freedoms that he fought so hard to preserve.

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:57.209
There is clearly a lot to admire about Jimmy Lai, but perhaps the most revealing

00:18:57.209 --> 00:19:02.399
thing about his character is that he stayed in Hong Kong throughout all of this,

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:08.899
when he could have very easily escaped to the United States or the UK or Taiwan

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:14.614
or any other country, and continued his pro-democracy advocacy from there.

00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:16.399
But he didn’t.

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:21.799
He stayed, knowing full well the fate that awaited him: a show trial,

00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:26.589
a public conviction, and then the remainder of his life behind bars.

00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:33.029
And for that alone, I think he is certainly a man whose story deserves to be told.

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:39.099
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Jimmy Lai.

00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:42.579
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:46.029
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:50.489
We have lots of members from mainland China and from Hong Kong, so I know

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.909
that this is a sensitive topic, but I would love to know what you think.

00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:56.839
What do you think lies in store for Jimmy Lai?

00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:00.799
How is Hong Kong changing, and how has it already changed?

00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:04.429
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

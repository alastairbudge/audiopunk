Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.970
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.580
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.619
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Banned Books, and look at

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.140
the history of what happens when the publication of a book is forbidden, it is not allowed.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.359
It is a fascinating topic, and will take us from the The Middle Ages

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.989
right through to the modern day, as we’ll look at all of the different

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.679
reasons that books are banned, and what happens when they are.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.470
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.769

Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.800
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.190
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.060
OK then, banned books.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.460
If I were to ask you what was the common link between The Bible, William

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.590
Shakespeare, Harry Potter, The Quotations of Chairman Mao and Mickey

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.910
Mouse, I would be very impressed if you said that they had all been banned.

00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:17.502
They have, all for very different reasons, at different times, in different

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:22.937
countries, but they have all been considered too dangerous for people to read.

00:02:23.837 --> 00:02:30.967
You are probably already thinking “why”, and indeed this intriguing story will lead us to

00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:38.107
ask lots of questions: why do different governments at different times in history ban books?

00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:42.487
What does it tell us about a society when it bans books?

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:47.987
Indeed, once you start asking these kinds of questions, you encounter even more

00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:55.327
profound ones: why and under what conditions is knowledge often considered dangerous?

00:02:56.117 --> 00:03:02.697
What is the effect on a society of trying to limit knowledge and, with it, human curiosity?

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:04.877
Is it ever a good thing?

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:11.167
Our interesting journey will begin with a bit of history – starting with the invention of the

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:18.677
movable type printer in 1440; however, the main focus of the episode will be on books that have

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:25.547
been banned in the 20th century that you are likely to have heard about and, perhaps, even read.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:31.727
By a banned book, I am referring to a book which a government or

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:36.777
[in the case of the United States] a state has banned or forbidden.

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:44.757
Usually the prohibition, the banning, of a book comes about through making it illegal to publish it.

00:03:45.617 --> 00:03:51.877
In the pre-Internet days this meant that people would not be able to buy the book, unless

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:57.247
it was printed privately, or smuggled into the country, brought into the country illegally.

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:04.347
Now, of course, censorship, banning books, is significantly harder, and anyone who

00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:10.407
wants to find a banned book online won’t have a particularly hard time finding it.

00:04:10.887 --> 00:04:14.917
We’ll talk about this in greater detail towards the end of the episode.

00:04:15.737 --> 00:04:20.787
Before we embark on the historical side, let me try to articulate or

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:25.477
express some of the thoughts that are perhaps going through your mind.

00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:29.857
For what reasons do ruling powers generally ban books?

00:04:30.157 --> 00:04:35.967
What effect does banning have on the popularity of the book, once the ban is removed?

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:41.237
And what does banning a book tell us about the country that banned it?

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:48.617
We will encounter most of these questions on our travels and return to them at the end, but as

00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:55.407
a general rule, books are banned because they challenge the current beliefs of a government or

00:04:55.507 --> 00:05:01.957
a ruling elite, whether that is a religious institution, an educational board or a government.

00:05:02.757 --> 00:05:07.497
And to the last question, about what banning a book tells us about

00:05:07.497 --> 00:05:12.627
the country that bans it, well, the banning of books is generally a

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:17.798
bad thing - a badge of shame, it doesn’t reflect well on the country.

00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:22.828
Just look at a list of regimes that have done a lot of it in recent

00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:29.138
history – the USSR, Nazi Germany, North Korea and Apartheid South Africa.

00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:36.118
It’s an unappetising list, it is not a list of countries that you would normally look up to.

00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:41.678
Perhaps there are occasional exceptions, such as books that promote

00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:46.998
religious or racial hate or child abuse or bomb-making, or things like that.

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:53.608
But as a general rule, there is a correlation, a connection between how happy a country

00:05:53.618 --> 00:06:00.618
is to ban books and how happy it is to persecute its people and limit their liberty.

00:06:01.648 --> 00:06:07.816
As the German playwright and poet, Heinrich Heine, predicted in one of his plays in 1821:

00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:13.098
“….where they burn books, they will also ultimately burn people.“

00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:20.199
As we know, this terrible prophecy was fulfilled by the Nazis, initially with their book

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:27.629
burning across 34 German university towns and cities in May 1933 and then during the Holocaust.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.809
To start our story, let us travel back in time to the first half of the 14th century.

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:41.219
Books in Europe were produced mainly by hand, they were written out by people.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.579
And only a tiny proportion of the population of Europe

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:49.845
was literate, only a tiny proportion could read and write.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.759
For most people, the only book that they would be aware of was the Bible.

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.969
And their only access to the Bible was through the priest

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.949
in their church who would read sections of it in Latin.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:12.819
In 1440 this all changed though, or at least it was the start of what was to be a seismic change.

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:18.829
The German inventor, Johannes Gutenberg, started working on the printing press.

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:26.269
And a large impact of his invention was, initially at least, on religious publishing.

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:31.809
Guttenberg‘s invention of the movable type printer meant that he was able

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:37.939
to print, easily and cheaply, so-called indulgences for the Catholic church.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:44.529
These indulgences were pieces of paper – forms, really – which, when filled in

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:50.889
and personalised, allowed officials of the Church to sell to each person a written

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:56.669
forgiveness for the sin that they had committed or even might commit in the future.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:03.919
With expensive crusades needing to be fought in the Middle East, the sale of indulgences was

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:10.359
a particularly easy and welcome way for the Church to make money in the late 15th century.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:16.154
So, you might think that was entirely a success story for the Church;

00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:22.384
not so - because this system was so open to abuse and corruption, its

00:08:22.394 --> 00:08:27.654
worsening reputation added to the growing opposition to the Catholic Church.

00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:34.844
This opposition to this system and to the established church was shown dramatically in

00:08:34.844 --> 00:08:42.404
1517 when Martin Luther wrote his famous 95 Theses which he nailed to the church door.

00:08:43.304 --> 00:08:48.224
This was in effect the start of the Protestant revolution or Protestantism.

00:08:48.224 --> 00:08:52.734
How does this have anything to do with banning books, you might think?

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:58.677
Well, in the age before printing, Luther’s complaint against the Catholic Church might

00:08:58.787 --> 00:09:05.007
have simply been an academic but heated debate amongst the clergy or the priests.

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:11.837
But, with this area of Germany being the centre of world printing at the time, Martin

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:18.097
Luther’s 95 Theses could be swiftly and economically printed and distributed; at least

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:24.267
300,000 copies were produced and distributed in the three years following their publication.

00:09:25.187 --> 00:09:32.367
By 1500 nearly 8 million books had been published in Europe following the birth of printing.

00:09:33.147 --> 00:09:39.227
It's difficult to know for sure how much of an increase this was compared to the hand-writing

00:09:39.237 --> 00:09:45.797
of books, but it is estimated to be about a twentieth of the post-Gutenberg number.

00:09:46.517 --> 00:09:51.297
Not only were more books published, but the cost reduced dramatically.

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:55.807
It is thought [based on a study in the Netherlands] that the

00:09:55.807 --> 00:10:03.667
price of books decreased by about 340 times between 1460 and 1550.

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:09.597
So, other than turbo-charging the Protestant Reformation what were the

00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:14.337
longer term consequences of these societies becoming increasingly literate?

00:10:15.267 --> 00:10:20.457
The answer is that it was certainly not all straightforward, but the major consequence

00:10:20.647 --> 00:10:27.007
on an individual level was the huge increase in literacy and, with it, individuality.

00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:34.397
The cultivation of the individual’s mind and his or her thoughts was possible in a way

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:40.597
which had not been available before, except for a tiny minority of priests and scholars.

00:10:41.547 --> 00:10:48.347
As access to knowledge started to be democratised, this allowed for new ideas to be developed and

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:54.587
spread, and was the start of Renaissance humanism, later on The Enlightenment, and indeed was the

00:10:54.597 --> 00:11:00.387
start of the tradition of freedom of information and ideas that we are all beneficiaries of today.

00:11:01.237 --> 00:11:05.857
Of course, as knowledge was democratised, printing became cheaper, and it was

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:11.257
much easier to spread your ideas to a larger population, those in power became

00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:18.857
increasingly cautious of the effect of unorthodox ideas or beliefs on their citizens.

00:11:19.597 --> 00:11:24.447
When very few people could read and write, spreading an idea was difficult.

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:29.777
With cheap printing and a literate population, it was much easier.

00:11:30.887 --> 00:11:35.267
Although there are plenty of examples of banning books in the few hundred

00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:40.027
years after Gutenberg’s printing press, we are going to focus on the past

00:11:40.097 --> 00:11:45.487
100 years or so, and look at banned books in the 20th and 21st centuries.

00:11:45.987 --> 00:11:51.037
The different reasons for banning books tend to overlap, but I have

00:11:51.037 --> 00:11:58.447
separated them into four categories: political, sexual, moral and religious.

00:11:59.257 --> 00:12:03.397
Firstly, political, books that are banned because they contain

00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:07.727
political beliefs that are contrary to those of the ruling elites.

00:12:08.697 --> 00:12:14.007
Totalitarian states are fearful of individuality and thoughts

00:12:14.027 --> 00:12:18.237
which run counter to, which are different to their own.

00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:20.667
Dissent is dangerous.

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:29.097
Therefore it should come as no surprise that, when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 on a wave of

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:35.967
renewed German militarism, he hated books which criticised the German army in the First World War.

00:12:36.817 --> 00:12:42.047
For this reason, Erich Remarque’s fine novel about a young man growing to

00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:49.218
adulthood, called All Quiet on the Western Front, was banned from 1933-1945.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.647
Stalinist USSR was also a dangerous place for writers.

00:12:55.117 --> 00:13:00.917
Many fled, they escaped; and many who remained lost their lives - either

00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:05.727
with a secret service bullet to the head or by dying in a gulag.

00:13:06.997 --> 00:13:10.887
Novelist and poet Boris Pasternak stayed and managed to

00:13:10.887 --> 00:13:15.107
navigate this dangerous environment during Stalin’s lifetime.

00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:22.777
His masterpiece, Dr Zhivago, was rejected by the state authorities in 1956.

00:13:23.257 --> 00:13:29.857
It was smuggled abroad, it was taken abroad without official permission, and published by the

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:37.677
founder of the Italian publishing house and bookseller, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, in Milan in 1957.

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:45.467
When Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for this brilliant novel which covers the 1917 Bolshevik

00:13:45.497 --> 00:13:52.897
Revolution and the civil war that followed, state pressure was such that he had to refuse the prize.

00:13:53.717 --> 00:14:00.587
Even though it had been published in 18 languages by 1958, and therefore very widely

00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:07.627
read all over the world, it was not taken off the banned list in the USSR until 1988.

00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:14.437
Whilst still in the category of political books, let’s consider the question of Hitler‘s

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:21.387
autobiography or life story, Mein Kampf, which is normally translated in English as “My Struggle”.

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:28.967
In the same way that it is illegal in Germany to make the Nazi salute, it was illegal to publish

00:14:29.087 --> 00:14:36.187
this book until 2015 when the copywright to publish held by the state of Bavaria stopped.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:40.017
So it is now available, you can buy it.

00:14:40.597 --> 00:14:46.947
This is still a contentious issue, there are those that feel strongly about it on both sides.

00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:53.368
The reasons for continuing to ban it tend to include arguments such as that

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:59.418
people buy it as a support for Nazi beliefs, and that it is still offensive to

00:14:59.418 --> 00:15:04.438
the millions of people who had relations that lost their lives to the Nazies.

00:15:05.368 --> 00:15:12.058
But, those who say it shouldn’t be banned tend to ask whether the book is actually that powerful,

00:15:12.308 --> 00:15:19.008
and suggest that banning it actually gives it a sort of badge of honour that it doesn’t deserve.

00:15:19.938 --> 00:15:23.178
Of course, I will leave you to make your own mind on that.

00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:30.228
Moving on from the political, let’s talk about books that were banned for their sexual content.

00:15:31.058 --> 00:15:34.418
Governing powers generally do not like their citizens

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:38.048
to read books which have explicit sexual content.

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:45.518
Whilst this attitude in the first half of the 20th century was mainly towards descriptions

00:15:45.548 --> 00:15:51.548
of heterosexual sex, more recently governments and school governing boards [in the

00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:57.988
USA especially] have banned books which are seen as promoting homosexuality and other

00:15:57.988 --> 00:16:04.848
forms of sexual expression and ways of living which are different to traditional views.

00:16:05.578 --> 00:16:09.328
It will perhaps come as no surprise therefore that countries

00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:12.958
like Malaysia and Singapore have done this quite recently.

00:16:13.788 --> 00:16:15.828
A book called Gay if OK!

00:16:15.888 --> 00:16:20.958
A Christian Perspective, for instance, was banned in Malaysia in 2013.

00:16:21.868 --> 00:16:27.568
Two of the most famous examples of books in English banned for their sexual content

00:16:27.698 --> 00:16:35.198
are Ulysses, by James Joyce, and one called Lady Chatterley's Lover, by D H Lawrence.

00:16:36.108 --> 00:16:40.868
Ulysses is an incredibly complicated book, it’s very hard to read,

00:16:41.088 --> 00:16:46.368
and sometimes actually manages to avoid being banned, to avoid being

00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:50.958
censored, because the sexual passages are so difficult to understand.

00:16:51.858 --> 00:16:58.048
Lady Chatterley‘s Lover led to the most famous trial of a book in British history when

00:16:58.238 --> 00:17:06.108
in 1960 its publisher, Penguin Books, was prosecuted for the offence of Obscenity; this

00:17:06.138 --> 00:17:11.698
means publishing something which is considered offensive and harmful to people’s morals.

00:17:12.748 --> 00:17:17.868
Famously, at the trial the prosecution lawyer asked the jury, asked the

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:23.358
people judging the trial: “would you wish your wife or servants to read it?”

00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:29.748
Penguin, the publisher, won the case, and the book was allowed to be printed again.

00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:36.258
But the trial did a huge amount to boost awareness of it, it was an incredibly

00:17:36.258 --> 00:17:43.448
effective marketing campaign, and when the ban was lifted sales skyrocketed.

00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:46.368
Although the book is one of D.H.

00:17:46.368 --> 00:17:51.048
Lawrence’s worst books, he actually wrote many, many better

00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:54.798
books, Lady Chatterley‘s Lover sold many more copies.

00:17:56.038 --> 00:18:02.158
The third category is that of banning for moral reasons - moral degeneracy,

00:18:02.158 --> 00:18:06.308
is a term sometimes used by governments to describe this concept.

00:18:07.078 --> 00:18:14.198
This is where ruling powers consider that the influence of a book will cause people – especially

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:21.368
young people – to behave badly, and in a way that isn’t in line with how people should behave.

00:18:22.398 --> 00:18:26.318
In the United States there seems to be a constant debate about what

00:18:26.318 --> 00:18:31.308
should and shouldn’t be allowed to be taught in schools, and from state to

00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:36.348
state what is considered to be a morally acceptable book varies greatly.

00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:43.078
Perhaps the most famous example of a book that is frequently banned by censors

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:49.842
for moral reasons is The Catcher in the Rye, written by JD Salinger in 1951.

00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:55.468
This book is completely fascinating and is actually going to be the subject

00:18:55.478 --> 00:19:00.958
of the next episode, the next members only episode, so look out for that one.

00:19:01.928 --> 00:19:07.798
In short, it is a story about teenage rebellion, and centres around a narrator

00:19:07.998 --> 00:19:15.438
called Holden Caulfield who lies, swears, smokes, and generally behaves badly.

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:21.658
It is a cult novel, and since its publication 70 years ago it has

00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:26.918
remained both one of the most banned books in the USA and also the

00:19:26.918 --> 00:19:31.818
second most read on high school curriculums, after Of Mice and Men.

00:19:32.948 --> 00:19:37.538
Harry Potter, which I imagine you may have read, or at least you are familiar

00:19:37.538 --> 00:19:42.593
with, has been banned in a long list of different countries, often for what

00:19:42.608 --> 00:19:48.088
you could categorise as “moral” reasons - that it shows children using magic

00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:52.468
to get what they want, which apparently is not what children should be taught.

00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:58.878
Similarly, Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was banned by the governor

00:19:58.908 --> 00:20:04.528
of a province in China because animals can speak in the book, and he said

00:20:04.738 --> 00:20:09.248
that it wasn’t morally right to put animals and humans on the same level.

00:20:10.258 --> 00:20:15.688
There was even a story about the fact that the book “Black Beauty”, which is a book

00:20:15.728 --> 00:20:21.708
about a black horse, was banned in Apartheid South Africa, because it showed the words

00:20:21.708 --> 00:20:27.648
black and beauty next to one another, but it does seem that this might be an urban myth.

00:20:28.678 --> 00:20:33.248
Our final category is books that have been banned for religious reasons.

00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:40.798
Of course, there is some overlap between all of the four categories - political, sexual, moral

00:20:40.798 --> 00:20:46.718
and religious, but it’s probably between moral and religious that the overlap is the greatest.

00:20:47.398 --> 00:20:53.808
In particular in theocratic countries, in countries where there is an official state religion,

00:20:54.008 --> 00:21:00.448
the state often sees its job as to protect both its religion, and the morals of its citizens.

00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:07.408
And when it comes to banning books for religious reasons, the pressure to ban them more

00:21:07.438 --> 00:21:12.808
often than not comes from the people within the country, not the government itself.

00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:17.698
You may be familiar with the Indian-British author Salman Rushdie.

00:21:18.108 --> 00:21:25.428
In 1988 he published a book called The Satanic Verses, which provoked a dramatic reaction across

00:21:25.428 --> 00:21:32.058
the Muslim world because it was considered blasphemous and disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.

00:21:33.198 --> 00:21:40.821
There were huge protests, the book was banned, and indeed the Ayatollah of Iran issued a fatwa,

00:21:40.828 --> 00:21:47.276
essentially an official declaration, calling for the death of the author and his publishers.

00:21:48.216 --> 00:21:53.846
This was unprecedented, the leader of a country calling for Muslims

00:21:53.856 --> 00:21:58.516
around the world to murder an author because of a book he had written.

00:21:59.436 --> 00:22:06.486
Salman Rushdie was given 24/7 police protection, and he had to go into hiding for 10 years.

00:22:07.446 --> 00:22:11.526
Like Lady Chatterley’s Lover, this was excellent marketing for the book.

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:16.796
One book store in the US initially didn’t sell it for security reasons,

00:22:17.056 --> 00:22:21.186
but then realised that it was so in demand that they changed their mind.

00:22:22.196 --> 00:22:25.786
It went to number one on the bestseller list, and sold

00:22:25.786 --> 00:22:29.266
five times more than the number two book on the list.

00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:34.200
So, to conclude, does banning books actually work?

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.430
Certainly, if the objective is to make fewer people

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.820
read them, the answer seems to be a resounding no.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:50.520
In almost every case banning books has made people want them more, and actually increased sales.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.920
And in the era of the Internet, banning books has become even more pointless.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:01.270
A book is a story, it is words on a page, and it is information.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.850
A physical book is only one way in which that information can be distributed.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.440
Nowadays, information and ideas aren’t shared only in physical books, they are shared

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.080
on websites and via applications, which are obviously a lot harder to censor, to ban.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.660
The question of censorship of information, and doing things like banning people

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:30.800
from social media platforms is a whole other kettle of fish, it is another topic

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:35.860
altogether, but it is, of course, closely related to the question of banning books.

00:23:36.642 --> 00:23:41.992
Books might make for an easy target, given that it is a lot easier to stop them

00:23:42.002 --> 00:23:46.652
being sold in shops than it is to stop people from visiting certain websites.

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:49.612
But it is almost always a bad idea.

00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:52.812
So, what can we take from all of this?

00:23:53.522 --> 00:23:59.474
Firstly, it’s that banning a book is almost always a badge of shame for a country.

00:23:59.854 --> 00:24:05.074
We only need to look at the countries that have done it in the past, and those that are doing

00:24:05.074 --> 00:24:11.784
it now, and it would be difficult to find one that is looked up to by the rest of the world.

00:24:12.894 --> 00:24:19.884
Secondly, if you want a quick way to increase sales of a book, then banning it is an excellent idea.

00:24:20.434 --> 00:24:25.684
Especially in the era of the internet, where any kind of information is available if you

00:24:25.684 --> 00:24:31.314
look hard enough, banning something is a quick way to lead to more people wanting to read it.

00:24:31.704 --> 00:24:35.964
And finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is that banning

00:24:35.994 --> 00:24:40.442
ideas is perhaps more dangerous than the ideas themselves.

00:24:43.592 --> 00:24:48.412
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Banned Books, on

00:24:48.552 --> 00:24:52.232
what happens when the publication of a book is forbidden.

00:24:52.862 --> 00:24:56.212

Are there any interesting stories of books that were banned in your country?

00:25:04.922 --> 00:25:07.172
And if so, why were they banned?

00:25:07.732 --> 00:25:10.572
Do you think there is a right time to ban a book?

00:25:10.772 --> 00:25:14.962
Or should anyone be free to publish anything, anywhere, and

00:25:15.522 --> 00:25:18.419
should it be a matter of personal choice who should read it?

00:25:19.069 --> 00:25:20.019
I would love to know.

00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:24.669

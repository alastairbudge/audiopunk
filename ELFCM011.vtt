If you're a new listener and hey, this is only the 11th episode we've ever done, so everyone is kind

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.093
of new, then welcome.

00:00:19.543 --> 00:00:26.193
The good news is that you only have a back catalogue of 10 episodes before you've listened to every

podcast we've ever made.

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:31.053
And to those returning listeners, welcome back.

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:33.843
It's great to have you, and thanks for supporting the podcast.

00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:40.773
This is just a very quick reminder, as always, for the most serious of English learners among you,

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:47.223
that you can get a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website,

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:49.753
which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:57.871
Okay, it's the 24th of December today, so that means it's just a day until Christmas.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.791
I'm currently in Trieste in Italy with our two month year old baby.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:09.091
I'm definitely more excited than he is right now, but I dare say that next year the tables may be

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:09.571
turned.

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.421
Anyway, enough about me.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:19.921
Today I am going to tell you the story of the book that made Christmas, or rather a book that has

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:25.231
been instrumental in making our current understanding of Christmas what it is today.

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:32.896
There are of course, plenty of books that have been written that have had an enduring impact on the

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.006
cultures we live in.

00:01:35.296 --> 00:01:42.856
The religious texts, of course, but even things like Aesop's fables, the Grapes of Wrath, 1984,

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:49.306
they've all had a enduring cultural impact on the English speaking world and further afield.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.910
But today we are going to be talking about another book.

00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:57.473
It's a Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.

00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:05.193
It is, if you haven't read it, a fantastic story, and depending on your level of English, you could

00:02:05.193 --> 00:02:08.433
even try reading it in the original, in English.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:11.223
It's only a hundred pages or so.

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:17.523
Although it was written almost 200 years ago, much of the language isn't actually too complicated.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.118
Otherwise, just read it in translation.

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:21.798
Nobody should judge you for that.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:30.327
A Christmas Carol is a book that has had a huge impact on the modern idea of Christmas, not just in

00:02:30.357 --> 00:02:33.507
Great Britain, but in large parts of the Western world.

00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:41.619
When Dickens wrote it in 1843, of course, he didn't know that it would have this kind of impact,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:47.586
although he was hopeful that it would have a positive impact on how we think about Christmas.

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.062
He wrote the book pretty quickly, apparently in six weeks.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:59.932
It was then self-published because his publisher couldn't actually meet the strict deadline that he

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:00.532
was working to.

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:08.943
He printed 6,000 copies and it was completely sold out by Christmas Eve, on this very day, 176 years

00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:09.213
ago.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:17.799
6,000 copies might not sound like a lot in the days of Amazon and the Internet, but back in 1843

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.479
that was pretty impressive.

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:26.505
Before a Christmas Carol, there wasn't really a common consensus about Christmas, there wasn't

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.115
really a set of common traditions.

00:03:30.015 --> 00:03:35.145
For many of you, you will have grown up in countries where for as long as you've been around,

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.401
Christmas has always been celebrated but it wasn't always like this.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.061
Not at all.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.210
Christmas hasn't actually always been celebrated at all.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:53.330
Indeed in the 17th century celebrating Christmas was banned in Great Britain as the Presbyterian

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.990
church, the puritanical branch of the church in Great Britain at the time declared that the Bible

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.850
said you could only celebrate the Sabbath, not any other Holy days.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.535
And when the Europeans headed off to America - and remember, it was the most puritanical of the lot,

00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:19.865
the most puritanical of the Europeans who went first - they took with them this Puritan or

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:25.235
Presbyterian belief that only the Sabbath, only Sunday should be celebrated.

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:31.629
And it wasn't until the 18th century that they accepted that Christmas could be celebrated as a day.

00:04:32.323 --> 00:04:39.430
There was this feeling that celebration or festivity was inherently sinful and associated with

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.440
degenerate Catholic habits.

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:47.895
And even now, some Presbyterians, some real Puritans, especially in the North of Scotland are

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:51.085
reluctant to celebrate Christmas wholeheartedly.

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:57.805
In any case, by the 18th Century or so, there were so many different interpretations of Christmas

00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:04.105
and how it should be celebrated that there was no common, no underlying consensus about what

00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:12.244
Christmas meant, or how it should be celebrated, So when a Christmas Carol was published 176 years

00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:20.014
ago it painted such a vivid, such a ideal picture of Christmas that it was immediately seized upon

00:05:20.074 --> 00:05:26.824
by the general population and became the basis for a lot of the traditions that we now take part in

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:30.844
today, and that you may even be taking part in now, literally.

00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:38.646
Before we go into exactly what these traditions are I'll just recap on the story of A Christmas

00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:40.836
Carol, for those of you who haven't read it.

00:05:42.338 --> 00:05:50.288
The central character of the book is a mean spirited, selfish, old man, Ebeneezer Scrooge who just

00:05:50.288 --> 00:06:01.714
hates Christmas He is described as a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous,

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:02.674
old sinner.

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:08.066
Don't worry if you don't understand all of those words, it could be summarised by saying that he is

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:10.316
nasty and selfish.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.740
One cold Christmas Eve, Scrooge is nasty and mean to his employees.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.990
Two men knock on his door asking for charity for the poor, and he refuses them.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.405
He is then rude to his nephew Fred, who invites him to spend Christmas together.

00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:35.730
And then when Scrooge gets home, he is visited by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.210
Marley.

00:06:37.072 --> 00:06:43.915
The spirit, the ghost, of his old business partner as a punishment for his greedy and self-serving

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:50.005
life has been condemned to wander the earth weighed down with heavy chains.

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:57.534
Marley said he is trying to save Scrooge from the same terrible fate that has befallen him.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.153
He tells Scrooge that he will be visited by three different ghosts over the course of the next three

00:07:05.153 --> 00:07:05.663
nights.

00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:12.793
They are the ghost of Christmas past, the ghost of Christmas present and the ghost of Christmas

00:07:12.793 --> 00:07:13.213
future.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:19.375
And sure enough, over the next three nights, these ghosts do visit Scrooge.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:26.230
The ghost of Christmas past takes Scrooge on a journey through Christmases from his past where

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:33.850
Scrooge sees himself as an unhappy child and a young man more in love with money than his fiance.

00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:42.481
The ghost of Christmas present takes Scrooge to see his employee, Bob Cratchit, at home with his

00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:42.931
family.

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:51.734
At Bob Cratchit's house, scrooge sees Bob Cratchit's son, a small little boy called Tiny Tim, who's

00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:59.204
very ill, almost paralysed, but still happy, positive and full of Christmas spirit.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:06.430
The ghost then takes Scrooge to see his nephew, Fred's Christmas celebrations, which he had been

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:12.010
invited to, but rejected with the infamous phrase, 'bah, humbug'.

00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:19.204
Finally, the ghost of Christmas future shows Scrooge visions of his own death.

00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:27.544
Scrooge is terrified and begs the ghost to alter his fate, promising that he will change his ways

00:08:27.814 --> 00:08:31.624
saying he will honour Christmas and be full of Christmas spirit.

00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:34.571
And sure enough, he does keep his promise.

00:08:34.828 --> 00:08:40.736
When he wakes up on Christmas day, he is full of excitement and buys the biggest turkey in the shop

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:47.573
for the Cratchit family before spending the day with his nephew, full of renewed joys of Christmas.

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:53.598
So in the end, it's a happy story with Scrooge realising the error of his ways.

00:08:54.495 --> 00:09:01.082
But how did this one story have such a large cultural impact and help define what we understand as

00:09:01.102 --> 00:09:01.882
Christmas today?

00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:09.064
As I said, there are elements of the story that immediately resonated with people at the time and

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:13.433
have now just been adopted into people's understanding of what Christmas is.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:21.922
Firstly, the association of Christmas with the ideas of charity, compassion, and kindness.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.870
Dickens, the author, was deeply troubled by the working conditions for the poor in Victorian

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.710
Britain, which were utterly horrific.

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:37.926
The story highlighted that Christmas had lost its former purpose, that of charity and kindness

00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:39.666
towards those less fortunate than us.

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:48.566
The publication of a Christmas Carol was a sort of rallying call for the rich to take better care of

00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:53.216
the poor, to have more compassion towards those less fortunate than them.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:10:00.883
I'm by no means saying that today the world is equal and we've fixed all of this, of course, far

00:10:00.883 --> 00:10:07.357
from it but the fact that most people associate Christmas with some sort of charity and compassion

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:11.047
is largely thanks to Dickens and A Christmas Carol.

00:10:11.947 --> 00:10:19.936
Also from a visual point of view, the picture of Christmas that you might imagine, of a table with

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:25.951
lots of food on, a Christmas tree, snow and presents, these images are all central to A Christmas

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:33.541
Carol and are still now 176 years later, the basis of how a lot of us imagine Christmas.

00:10:33.902 --> 00:10:40.038
I guess if I asked you to close your eyes and imagine what a Christmas scene might look like, it

00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:41.478
might look something like that.

00:10:42.944 --> 00:10:49.678
Thirdly, from a linguistic point of view, A Christmas Carol has left a lasting impact on the English

00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:57.690
language The phrase Merry Christmas had been in use since the 16th century, but it was stamped in

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.720
people's minds after appearing in A Christmas Carol.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.440
Merry Christmas is now the traditional way to greet people on Christmas, although of course, Happy

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.400
Christmas works as well.

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:15.278
A Scrooge,remember that's the main character from the book, so a Scrooge is someone who is mean who

00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:19.928
doesn't want to celebrate, and normally someone who is overly tight with money too.

00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:28.352
And a Tiny Tim, the poor crippled child in the book has become another way to refer to vulnerable

00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:31.952
innocent people, normally, children, normally a child.

00:11:33.063 --> 00:11:38.746
Even though it was such a smash hit of a book, Dickens didn't really make any money from it.

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:46.036
He published it himself, as I said, to a very high standard, so it was very expensive to produce,

00:11:46.396 --> 00:11:50.176
and then he sold it very cheaply to make it accessible to the poor.

00:11:51.163 --> 00:11:57.253
But it was such a hit, and Charles Dickens became inexorably linked to Christmas in people's

00:11:57.253 --> 00:11:57.943
imaginations.

00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:07.773
So much so that it's reported that in 1870 when Dickens died, a young girl in London said, Mr

00:12:07.773 --> 00:12:08.523
Dickens, dead?

00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:10.743
Then will Father Christmas die too?

00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:11.733
Okay.

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:18.819
I hope you forgive my impression of a young girl in London in 1870 but that is what was supposedly

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:19.179
said.

00:12:19.556 --> 00:12:25.646
Luckily, Father Christmas didn't die with Dickens, and I dare say that he may be visiting some of

00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:29.636
you, or I guess probably more likely your children tonight.

00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:36.703
We've just got time to talk about one last Christmas tradition, and this actually isn't directly

00:12:36.703 --> 00:12:41.023
related to a Christmas Carol, but did happen at exactly the same time.

00:12:42.424 --> 00:12:47.594
You might not know that the Christmas card, which perhaps you've been sending and have received this

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:53.819
year was only invented in 1843, the same year that a Christmas Carol was published.

00:12:54.651 --> 00:13:00.840
Previously, people used to write long letters to each other at Christmas and one frantically busy

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.320
civil servant Henry Cole, who didn't have time to write a mountain of letters, had a thousand cards

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.355
printed and those he didn't need, he made them available for sale.

00:13:11.696 --> 00:13:17.740
Immediately this trend caught on as people liked the simplicity of it and the fact that they were

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.120
prettier than a letter.

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:25.465
Now imagine many people now might not even send Christmas cards because they say they don't have

00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:28.495
enough time and they were invented as a time-saving measure.

00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:35.245
Well, I hope that you have an absolutely fantastic Christmas or a very Merry Christmas, I should

00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:41.185
say, and if you want some holiday reading and you feel in need of some Christmas cheer, then you

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:43.225
could definitely give A Christmas Carol a shot.

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:49.094
I saw it's actually available on Amazon Kindle for 50p and it's just a hundred pages long.

00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:52.469
As always, I hope you've enjoyed the show.

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:57.629

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.280
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.340
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.310
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about one of my least favourite subjects.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.490
Idioms.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.450
As you may well know, there are thousands of idioms in English.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.500
You might have heard a teacher telling you that you need to learn as many idioms as possible,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
you might have heard another one telling you that idioms don’t matter in the slightest.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.470
And in this episode we are going to look at both sides or the argument, but we’re

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.330
not only going to be talking about my opinion, or the opinion of someone else.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.580
We are going to look at different types of idioms.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.330
I'll give you my proposal for a new way of thinking about them, including

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.170
how to learn them effectively, and perhaps, just perhaps, we’ll be

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.550
able to answer the question for good of whether idioms really matter.

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:16.715
OK then, idioms.

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:22.025
A few weeks ago I was sitting with some friends having dinner.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:30.465
Most of these friends are involved in some way with learning English, with ESL - they run English

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:36.495
schools, help people to find places to learn English, or run activities for English learners.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:43.125
One friend brought along a colleague of his, someone who I had never met before.

00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:47.895
His name was Kris, and he was from Poland.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.675
I was immediately struck by his accent.

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:57.405
Not only because he had almost perfect pronunciation, but because he spoke

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:02.295
like an upper-class English gentleman and used incredibly advanced vocabulary.

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:09.435
It turned out that he had spent quite some time studying in English-speaking countries,

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:16.565
and he clearly had an excellent ear, he listened very carefully to the sounds of language.

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.765
Now, why am I mentioning him?

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:24.905
Well, we were talking about language, and in particular, idioms.

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:30.725
A couple of the Spanish members of the group joked about the expression

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:34.885
“it’s raining cats and dogs”, meaning that it’s raining heavily.

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:39.745
One turned to me and said, “you say that in English, right?”

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:47.235
And my response was, well, yes it is an English idiom, but I can honestly

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:52.385
say that I can’t remember a single time that I have ever heard any

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:56.595
native speaker saying it in conversation with another native speaker.

00:02:57.305 --> 00:03:02.295
It always comes up in textbooks and is used by teachers, especially

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:07.115
non-native teachers, because it’s a funny, visual expression.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:14.015
If you follow English teachers on Instagram or TikTok, you will probably find lots of them

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:19.765
telling you about this idiom, perhaps with funny pictures of cats and dogs in the background.

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:24.815
It lends itself naturally, you could say, to social media.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:30.065
But do people actually use it in native conversation?

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:35.705
If you were in a pub in Manchester, would you overhear one person saying

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:39.585
to the other “oh, it’s really raining cats and dogs at the moment”?

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:46.315
In my opinion, no, never or at least very rarely.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:54.105
Clearly, with almost half a billion native English speakers, and even 70 million or so native

00:03:54.105 --> 00:04:00.095
English speakers in Britain, we have to generalise somewhat here, but here is what I said.

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:08.145
I said that I thought native English speakers used far fewer idioms than most non-native speakers

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:15.215
thought, and one of the main advantages of idioms seems to be for English schools to sell courses.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:22.805
The conversation went on, and in fact, the Polish guy I mentioned earlier disagreed with me.

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:27.705
In his experience, English speakers do use a lot of

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.795
idioms and idiomatic language in day-to-day speech.

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:33.955
So, who was right?

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:38.545
Me, a native English speaker, and someone who spends most

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.545
of their day thinking about English and language learning?

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:47.275
Or Kris, a Polish guy who was clearly very intelligent, had an

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:51.751
excellent ear and spoke very good English, but was not a native speaker?

00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:58.331
It turns out that we both were, sort of, and I’ll explain why in a minute.

00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:04.681
To do this, let me take you on a little exploration, a journey through

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:09.071
the world of idioms in English, so we can try to answer the question of

00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:13.641
whether British people, and native English speakers, actually use idioms.

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:20.481
First, I think it’s helpful to think about the different types of idiomatic language.

00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:26.851
There are several different ways of categorising idioms, but what I want to start with is

00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:32.271
one I found on the Grammarly website, which I think is one useful way of thinking about it.

00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:38.341
So, according to Grammarly, there are four different types of idioms.

00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.451
Firstly, there are “pure idioms”.

00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:47.171
A pure idiom is an expression that has a completely

00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:49.901
different meaning to the words in the expression.

00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:55.501
For example, “it’s raining cats and dogs” doesn’t literally mean that there

00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:59.681
are cats and dogs coming down from the sky, it means it’s raining a lot.

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:06.781
You could even argue that “it’s raining cats and dogs” isn’t a pure idiom,

00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:11.171
because you can probably guess what it means from the “raining” part.

00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:16.971
It’s what one linguist, a professor called Sam Glucksberg, called

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.461
a “transparent” idiom, meaning you can kind of guess its meaning.

00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:27.581
A completely “pure” idiom, or what Professor Glucksberg would call

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:31.681
an “opaque” idiom, might be something like “under the weather”.

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:35.751
If you don’t know that expression, can you guess what it means?

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:39.671
No, you can’t, not without context at least.

00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:44.501
In case you didn’t know, it means that you're feeling ill, you're feeling unwell.

00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:47.391
So, that’s a “pure idiom”.

00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:54.041
The second type of idiom is something called a binomial idiom, which is an idiom

00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:59.961
formed of two words, normally joined together by a preposition like “and” or “or”.

00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.151
Can you think of one?

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:05.551
If you managed to think of one, well done.

00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:11.041
Examples of binomial idioms would be things like “like chalk and

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:16.281
cheese”, meaning two very different things, so you might say, “Oh, we’re

00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:20.151
like chalk and cheese, but we need to work together on this project”.

00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:25.671
Or “fair and square”, meaning completely fair, according to the rules.

00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:29.191
So, that’s a binomial idiom.

00:07:30.391 --> 00:07:36.351
The third type is something called a “partial idiom”, which is an expression

00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:41.161
that is left unfinished, because a native speaker would know how it ends.

00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:46.401
For example, if you had some bad news but something good

00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:50.521
happened at the end, someone might say “every cloud”.

00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:55.341
That probably sounds very strange if you didn’t know what they were

00:07:55.361 --> 00:08:00.581
talking about, but “every cloud” is the first part of the idiom “every

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:05.771
cloud has a silver lining”, meaning that good things come from bad things.

00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:12.771
Or another more classic example might be “when in Rome”, which is the first

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:17.331
part of the expression “when in Rome, do as the Romans do”, meaning that you

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:22.211
should try to respect new cultures and try new things when you're in new places.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:25.351
So, that’s a partial idiom.

00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:30.321
And then the final type is something called a “Prepositional

00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:33.881
idiom”, which is actually very similar to a phrasal verb.

00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:40.901
A prepositional idiom is, as the name suggests, a word with a preposition at the

00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:45.841
end, which creates a slightly different expression, much like a phrasal verb.

00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:52.371
For example, “step up” means to put yourself forward for a particular position.

00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:59.481
You could also put “step up” in the “partial idiom” category, as some people would use

00:08:59.481 --> 00:09:04.661
it as a shortened version of “step up to the plate”, which means to put yourself forward

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.511
for a particular position, or to take action when something is particularly difficult.

00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:16.851
And there are a few more categories that some people would include in the category of “idioms”,

00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:22.631
like cliches, euphemisms and proverbs, but we aren’t going to speak about those today.

00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:30.721
As you can see, these are not always exact categories, and there is an overlap between them.

00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:37.571
And I’d also say that these categories don’t actually matter - most native

00:09:37.571 --> 00:09:42.961
speakers would have no idea about what category an idiom is in and you shouldn’t

00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.321
waste a minute of your precious time worrying about such unimportant things.

00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:53.081
In fact, the only reason I told you these categories was to demonstrate that they

00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:58.032
don’t actually matter, so I can give you a more sensible way of thinking about idioms.

00:09:59.172 --> 00:10:01.812
So, let’s get back to the matter at hand.

00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:08.872
Of all of the idioms in English, 25,000 by some counts, which matter and which don’t?

00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:13.812
Cleary, the ones that matter are the ones that people actually use.

00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:15.832
But how do you figure that out?

00:10:16.842 --> 00:10:20.442
Well, let me answer this question in a roundabout way.

00:10:21.562 --> 00:10:27.252
For most native speakers, deciding to use an idiom isn’t an active decision.

00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:32.562
If they use an idiomatic expression, it’s normally because it's

00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:36.922
simply the easiest and most convenient way to express meaning.

00:10:38.522 --> 00:10:44.692
To give you an example, let me go back to one of the idioms from earlier, “fair and square”.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:51.812
This, at least in British English, is a very common way of expressing what the idiom

00:10:51.812 --> 00:10:57.462
means, that a game or competition was played fairly and according to the rules.

00:10:58.712 --> 00:11:03.002
For example, you might hear someone saying “did you see the match last night?

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:09.742
It was really close, and Arsenal had three penalties, but in the end Chelsea won fair and square”.

00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:15.872
If you swapped “fair and square” for the literal meaning of the idiom,

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:21.922
saying “ but in the end Chelsea won fairly”, or even “Chelsea won fairly and

00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:26.742
according to the rules of the game”, it would sound really weird and unnatural.

00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:31.792
In this case, a native speaker would use the idiomatic

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:35.122
way of saying it because that is the more natural way.

00:11:35.822 --> 00:11:39.922
They aren’t thinking “oh, I’ll use an idiom here”, an idiom is

00:11:39.992 --> 00:11:44.502
subconsciously used because it is the easiest way of saying this.

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:51.699
So, let me propose a new way to think about categories of idioms, a way that

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:56.389
I think is more helpful to anyone learning English as a second language.

00:11:57.129 --> 00:12:03.039
And this categorisation is easy, and not only because there are only two categories.

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:09.939
In the first category there are idioms that are so frequently in use, and are so much

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:15.579
more natural than the literal term, that native speakers wouldn’t think twice about them.

00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:18.929
In fact, I used an idiom there.

00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:19.959
Did you see it?

00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:24.749
I said that native speakers “wouldn’t think twice”.

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:32.019
To not think twice about something means to not carefully consider it, for it to come naturally.

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:38.189
And indeed, in this case, when I was thinking about what to say, I didn’t think,

00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:42.359
“oh, that's a good way to express that thought and I'll use an idiom there”,

00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:48.189
using wouldn’t think twice is the most common way of expressing that idea.

00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:51.239
So, that’s the first category.

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:58.029
And the second category is, as you might have guessed, the idiomatic expressions that

00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:03.999
don’t come so naturally, the idioms where the literal alternatives are in wide use.

00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:08.529
I would certainly put “raining cats and dogs” in this category.

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:13.479
I would be quite surprised if you found a native speaker using it outside of the

00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:18.289
classroom, and there are many more common alternatives that you’ll be likely to hear.

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:24.609
It’s pouring, it’s chucking it down, it’s soaking, it’s raining heavily, or

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:29.649
a very common but slightly rude expression would be “it’s pissing it down”.

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:36.179
So, when thinking about idioms and idiomatic language, I would encourage

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:41.579
you to think about two categories of idioms: the first is “useful and

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:46.729
in-use idioms”, and the second is “less useful and not used idioms”.

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:53.129
Now, you’re probably thinking “come on then, how do I figure out what category an idiom is in?"

00:13:54.129 --> 00:13:54.769
Good question.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:58.659
To this, I have good news and bad news.

00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:00.899
Let’s do the bad news first.

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:08.329
The bad news is that there is no hard and fast rule, you should pay attention to language in context

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:15.549
and listen to phrases that sound unfamiliar or unusual just like the one I used, “hard and fast”.

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:19.859
If you’ve never heard that idiom before, do you know what it means?

00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:26.539
It means “fixed”, “definite”, but it’s a very common expression, perhaps

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:31.309
even more common than saying “fixed”, especially when describing rules.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:38.549
So, that’s the bad news, that nobody can tell you that this idiom is category one,

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:44.249
therefore learn it and use it, and this idiom is category two, so don’t worry about it.

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:49.509
With so many dialects and different types of English in use, there

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:54.939
is no rule, no “hard and fast” rule, that will apply to all versions.

00:14:56.055 --> 00:14:58.195
But here comes the good news.

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:04.445
It’s that, in my opinion of course, this means that you can completely ignore any

00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:10.285
large lists of idioms, and please do not for the love of God buy any courses or

00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:15.455
lists of “the top 1,000 idioms you need to know in English”, or anything like that.

00:15:16.505 --> 00:15:22.185
By far the most effective way of learning idiomatic language is by learning them in

00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:28.685
context, because it’s only in context that you’ll see what idioms are actually used or not.

00:15:29.675 --> 00:15:32.795
A list of idioms for English learners is not context.

00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:35.235
A textbook is not context.

00:15:35.645 --> 00:15:38.665
And a course on idioms is not context.

00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:41.155
So, that’s the good news.

00:15:41.915 --> 00:15:45.495
Now, to bring this back to the start of the episode.

00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:51.245
If you remember, I told you about a dinner I had, and a discussion about idioms.

00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:59.105
I had said that I thought people in Britain used far fewer idioms than non-native speakers thought.

00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:03.595
Another guy at the table, a guy from Poland, said that

00:16:03.605 --> 00:16:07.425
he thought people in Britain used idioms very frequently.

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:10.315
So, who was right?

00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:13.495
Well, I was certainly slightly wrong.

00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:19.205
As a native speaker, it’s easy to use idiomatic language without realising

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:24.455
it's idiomatic, because you don’t think of it like an idiom; it’s simply the

00:16:24.455 --> 00:16:30.155
most common and easy way to communicate a point, so that’s the language we use.

00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:36.575
You heard me mention numerous examples of this during the episode, from “fair and

00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:42.405
square” through to “wouldn’t think twice”, these are idioms, or idiomatic expressions,

00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:47.525
that are so common that most native speakers wouldn’t even realise they’re using them.

00:16:48.795 --> 00:16:51.715
So, Kris was certainly right on that point.

00:16:52.995 --> 00:16:57.575
But the idioms that tend to be used most commonly are not

00:16:57.755 --> 00:17:01.345
always the ones that you’ll find in textbooks or courses.

00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:02.695
Why?

00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:08.125
Because they aren’t always as vivid and fun, they don’t make you laugh,

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:12.965
like “cats and dogs”, they are just part of language, they are vocabulary.

00:17:13.855 --> 00:17:19.445
They are, in fact, used so frequently that they become more common than the literal

00:17:19.445 --> 00:17:23.875
meaning, so it’s almost forgotten that they are idiomatic in the first place.

00:17:24.975 --> 00:17:26.935
So what’s the moral of the story?

00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:32.845
Well, if you ask me, it’s to focus on learning idioms in context, through

00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:38.205
real-life English content, podcasts, newspapers, books, and so on.

00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:42.445
Not through vocabulary lists, courses, or worksheets.

00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:47.945
And here’s one final top-secret tip that I want to leave you with:

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:52.815
if it’s raining heavily and you really want to sound like a native

00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:58.345
speaker, please, please, please, don’t say “it’s raining cats and dogs”.

00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:06.545
OK then, that is it for today's episode on idioms and idiomatic language.

00:18:06.905 --> 00:18:10.395
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that it’s given you a fresh

00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:15.205
perspective on this important but often overemphasised part of English.

00:18:16.165 --> 00:18:19.465
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:19.795 --> 00:18:22.575
Do you agree with this categorisation of idioms?

00:18:22.975 --> 00:18:25.165
How do you approach learning idioms?

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.735
Who was right?

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.425
Me, Kris, or both of us?

00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:33.435
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

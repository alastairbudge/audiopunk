Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.773 --> 00:00:16.163
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:20.473
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:27.043
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something called The Barnum Effect.

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:32.673
You might not have heard of it before, but you have almost certainly experienced it.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:40.033
If you have read a horoscope, had your fortune told, or cracked open a fortune cookie in a Chinese

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:47.533
restaurant, and thought, that is so me, then you have experienced the Barnum Effect firsthand.

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:51.623
So, in this episode we are going to look at this in

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:55.593
detail, explain how it works, and what you can do about it.

00:00:56.843 --> 00:00:59.233
OK then, The Barnum Effect.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:05.273
When I was growing up in the UK, every Saturday night on

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:09.793
primetime TV there was a show called The National Lottery Live.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:16.443
Every week, millions of British people would play the National Lottery, choosing their

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:22.293
lucky numbers, and on Saturday evening they would eagerly await to see whether their

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:27.703
numbers had come up, whether they were going to be instantly turned into a millionaire.

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:34.623
To add to the suspense, before the numbers were drawn, the camera would

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:40.763
turn to a middle aged lady with jet black hair, her fringe cut short.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.343
Her name was “Mystic Meg”.

00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:50.903
She would often wear a purple, velvety coat, and hold a crystal ball in front of her.

00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:57.273
Behind her there was smoke, drawings of planets, and mysterious signs.

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:04.043
She would look into her crystal ball, then directly at the camera, and in

00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:10.043
a soft and mysterious but assertive voice, announce what her crystal ball

00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:14.643
had told her about the people who would be winning the lottery that evening.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:18.453
Here’s a clip of her doing exactly that.

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:33.125
Dreammaker planet Neptune and Venus spin fortunes for Scorpio

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:38.745
and Capricorn and someone who bought a ticket at 6:00 PM today.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:46.405
The power of the pendulum is spelling out Pat and Cathy as winning names.

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:50.687
And a woman wearing dark blue is serving drinks.

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.617
A gray cat with golden eyes is close by.

00:02:55.557 --> 00:03:03.681
Insurance workers, bin men and a dentist will be celebrating too.

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:08.531
So to recap, what did she say?

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.831
It would be good news for Scorpio and Capricorn.

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:16.991
Someone who bought a ticket at 6pm today will be a winner.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:20.981
People called Pat and Cathy will be lucky tonight..

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.351
A woman wearing dark blue is serving drinks.

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:27.621
A grey cat with golden eyes is close nearby.

00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.011
Insurance workers, bin men and a dentist will be celebrating too.

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:38.531
And you heard the screams of celebration, as people heard the

00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.141
predictions of Mystic Meg and thought, hey, she is talking about me.

00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:50.771
Now, that clip was from October the 28th of 1995, and I cannot say

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.301
with certainty that the big winner that evening was not a dentist

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.641
called Pat who bought a ticket at 6pm with a grey cat with golden eyes.

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:04.141
The point is, in all probability, one or several of those

00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:08.011
predictions probably could have been true for one of the winners.

00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:11.741
There are 12 star signs, and two were named.

00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:19.611
Pat and Cathy are both popular names, 6pm is a popular time to buy a ticket, a woman in

00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:24.591
dark blue serving drinks is a pretty common occurrence on a Saturday evening in the UK.

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:30.181
There are lots of grey cats, and lots of insurance workers, bin men and dentists.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:36.251
And indeed, no doubt tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of people

00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:41.591
heard those predictions that evening and thought, it’s me, she is talking about me.

00:04:42.857 --> 00:04:47.387
Then the winning numbers were revealed and, uh oh, they didn’t win.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:54.507
This is a prime example of The Barnum Effect, which is, and I'm quoting

00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:59.517
directly, “the phenomenon that occurs when individuals believe that personality

00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:04.687
descriptions apply specifically to them, despite the fact that the description

00:05:04.697 --> 00:05:09.187
is actually filled with information that applies to everyone.” End quote.

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:15.584
Despite the fact that we all kind of know that predictions like the ones Mystic Meg would make

00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:22.234
could apply to many people, they can be alluring, they can be attractive, we want to believe them.

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:28.094
In the specific case of Mystic Meg, she was something of a national icon.

00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:34.304
She presented this fortune telling segment on the National Lottery Live programme from

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:41.574
1994 to 2000, and she had an astrology column in one of the country’s most read newspapers.

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:47.664
Indeed, her popularity was such that she even entered the English language.

00:05:48.344 --> 00:05:53.134
When a politician or football manager or someone like that was asked to make a

00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:58.874
prediction about an election or a football match, they might respond “I’m not Mystic

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:04.097
Meg”, as another way of saying “I don’t know and don't ask me about the future”.

00:06:05.377 --> 00:06:11.637
Now, you probably have similar people in your country, astrologers and predictors of the future.

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:13.441
You might even believe them.

00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:18.587
A reported 29% of Americans believe in horoscopes and

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:24.307
astrology, 23% of French people do, and 17% of Mexicans do.

00:06:25.347 --> 00:06:29.647
Clearly, for lots of people, perhaps even for you, it’s important.

00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:36.357
But it is a prime example of the so-called “Barnum Effect”, this idea that

00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:40.947
we think that a statement is about us, when in fact it could be about anyone.

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:47.567
The term was named after a 19th century American businessman called P.T.

00:06:47.577 --> 00:06:53.167
Barnum, who ran a collection of circuses involving fortune tellers and mystics.

00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:58.617
Now, was he a deep believer in spirituality, horoscopes and the like?

00:06:59.457 --> 00:06:59.767
No.

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:07.417
He was a capitalist, a businessman, and was reported to have said “a sucker is born every minute”.

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:12.797
A sucker, by the way, is a gullible person, someone

00:07:12.797 --> 00:07:15.497
who is likely to believe anything that they are told.

00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:21.627
Clearly, Barnum wasn’t the first person to trick people out of their hard-earned

00:07:21.627 --> 00:07:25.987
money by pretending to be able to tell their fortunes or read their horoscopes.

00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:28.947
This is an industry as old as time.

00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:37.977
But the term “The Barnum Effect” was only coined relatively recently, in 1956, after

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:42.457
there was an increasing amount of research done into this psychological effect.

00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:46.487
The research typically went something like this.

00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:53.007
A researcher would provide a group of people with a series of statements that they

00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:58.527
were told were specific to them, and then ask them to say how accurate they were.

00:07:59.597 --> 00:08:04.397
I’ll actually read you out one of the tests now, so you can experience this for yourself.

00:08:05.837 --> 00:08:11.237
You probably know the point I’m trying to make, but imagine for one moment that I have asked

00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:15.987
you to fill out a questionnaire where you need to answer questions about your personality.

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:20.447
I tell you that I will examine your results and then

00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:24.007
provide you with my detailed analysis of your personality.

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:30.547
So, here we go, here is my “expert” diagnosis of your personality:

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:35.444
You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.

00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:39.198
You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.

00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:45.561
You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.

00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:52.071
While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.

00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:56.291
Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you.

00:08:57.461 --> 00:09:03.501
Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside.

00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:08.191
At times you have serious doubts as to whether you

00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.531
have made the right decision or done the right thing.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.311
You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become

00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:19.771
dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:24.591
You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.361
accept others’ statements without satisfactory proof.

00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.491
You have found it unwise to be frank in revealing yourself to others.

00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:38.691
At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while

00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:42.451
at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved.

00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:47.051
Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.

00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:50.981
Security is one of your major goals in life.

00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:59.571
OK, so those are the 13 character traits that the participants were given, and they were

00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:05.461
told that they were specifically about them, based on the answers they had provided.

00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:11.921
Then, the thirty-nine participants were asked to rank on a

00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:16.761
scale of 0 to 5 in terms of how accurate each statement was.

00:10:17.587 --> 00:10:22.071
0 for completely wrong, 5 for exactly right.

00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:27.031
When the results were collected, the participants gave the

00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:33.101
statements an average of 4.3, they said that they were very accurate.

00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:40.031
This was the exact test that was conducted by an American psychologist called

00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:45.388
Bertram Forer, and indeed the Barnum Effect is sometimes called The Forer Effect.

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:53.281
Forer would later reveal that every participant was given the same statements; the

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.681
answers they had provided about their personality were not taken into consideration.

00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:03.701
And indeed, these “observations” about their personalities were taken

00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:07.811
from a book about astrology that he found in a nearby newsstand.

00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:15.371
He published this in a 1949 study, and the results were clear for all to see.

00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:23.591
Now, psychologists have made several observations about how this effect works, about why

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:29.011
perfectly rational and intelligent people are likely to believe statements like this.

00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:35.301
Firstly, if the person believes that the analysis is only about

00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:39.371
them, that the predictions or statements are specific to them.

00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:45.291
Of course, if you think something is tailored to you, you are more likely to believe it.

00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:53.311
Secondly, if they believe that the person making the predictions is a person of authority.

00:11:54.491 --> 00:12:00.451
This can be because that person is a psychologist or it’s because that person has the authority

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:06.731
of going on national TV every Saturday evening and being given a platform to predict the future.

00:12:08.183 --> 00:12:13.063
And thirdly, if the statements contain lots of positive character traits.

00:12:13.703 --> 00:12:18.013
Everyone is more likely to believe positive statements about them than

00:12:18.013 --> 00:12:23.023
negative statements, people naturally love praise and dislike criticism.

00:12:24.073 --> 00:12:29.773
It is a classic cognitive bias, a reality that we create for ourselves,

00:12:30.093 --> 00:12:35.823
despite the fact that when we analyse it in detail, we know it not to be true.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:41.933
Now, as a final point to add to this little exploration of The Barnum

00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:47.963
Effect and cognitive bias, it isn’t just Mystic Meg, astrologers and tarot

00:12:48.013 --> 00:12:52.443
card readers who take advantage of our cognitive biases to exploit us.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:56.393
It is also something that many technology companies use.

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:01.743
If you use products like Spotify or Netflix, you will

00:13:01.743 --> 00:13:05.683
probably be recommended songs or movies “handpicked for you”.

00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:12.653
Sure, they do have all of your data about what you have listened to or watched before, but

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:18.913
in all probability this recommendation is given to tens or hundreds of millions of people

00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:25.223
based on relatively broad demographic data; it’s not as personal as you might think it is.

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:34.540
If Netflix says “ you might like this latest blockbuster film”, you might think “well, yes I might

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:41.076
like that, how creepy”, but tens of millions of other people are getting exactly the same message.

00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:44.168
You see this with stuff you buy online as well.

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:49.808
Sure, many companies will send you personalised advertising and emails

00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:53.808
after you “forget” to buy a specific pair of shoes on a website.

00:13:54.568 --> 00:14:01.588
But others will take advantage of this cognitive bias and show you supposedly “personalised”

00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:06.738
recommendations, but in fact they are recommendations that might apply to anyone.

00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:13.718
And to give you a specific language learning example of a cognitive bias, I’m sure you have

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:19.508
seen many websites for English learning courses that ask you a series of questions that

00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:26.278
you read and think “of course, yes, that’s me”, that person is speaking to me and me alone.

00:14:27.548 --> 00:14:31.568
Questions like “Do you wish people didn’t ask you where you came from?

00:14:32.118 --> 00:14:34.148
Do you want never to be asked to repeat yourself?

00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:36.478
Would you like a perfect English accent?”

00:14:37.498 --> 00:14:41.648
Of course, almost everyone reading those questions would answer yes.

00:14:43.208 --> 00:14:49.708
And where you see the Barnum Effect in full swing is on websites or apps that ask

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:54.858
you to input information about yourself so that you think that it is personalised,

00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:59.058
therefore you are more likely to take whatever action the app wants you to take.

00:15:00.538 --> 00:15:05.168
I actually tested this out on a few popular English apps, creating different

00:15:05.178 --> 00:15:09.628
accounts and providing completely different answers during the onboarding

00:15:09.668 --> 00:15:15.578
process, the sign up process, yet the experience afterwards was exactly the same.

00:15:16.598 --> 00:15:22.568
There is no need to personalise the experience if you already think that it is personalised.

00:15:24.088 --> 00:15:28.688
You might know that the most popular language learning app in the world, Duolingo,

00:15:29.098 --> 00:15:33.488
asks you to do things like select how often you want to learn when you sign up.

00:15:34.648 --> 00:15:38.288
It now uses this data to personalise your experience,

00:15:38.608 --> 00:15:41.998
but when it first launched this feature it didn’t.

00:15:43.088 --> 00:15:47.378
Still the team at Duolingo made an interesting observation.

00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:55.048
They ran a test and saw that people who set a goal and supposedly “personalised” their

00:15:55.048 --> 00:16:00.808
experience were more likely to come back to the app than those who weren’t asked to set a goal.

00:16:01.718 --> 00:16:07.028
Importantly, it didn’t initially adapt the user experience after sign up depending

00:16:07.028 --> 00:16:11.212
on the goal that had been set; it just analysed the data of people who had been

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:17.638
asked to set a goal against those who hadn’t, and saw that even the simple factor of

00:16:17.648 --> 00:16:22.648
thinking that an experience is personalised to you was likely to increase engagement.

00:16:23.768 --> 00:16:28.898
So, in this case at least, the Barnum Effect isn’t always used for negative

00:16:28.898 --> 00:16:33.588
outcomes; it can push people into taking an action that they want to take anyway.

00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:39.988
That being said, it is powerful, and it’s something that we should at least be aware of.

00:16:40.848 --> 00:16:44.668
So, how can you avoid falling for the Barnum Effect,

00:16:44.968 --> 00:16:48.078
how can you beat this particular cognitive bias?

00:16:49.118 --> 00:16:53.670
Well, one way is to think about the three reasons that people tend

00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:58.051
to fall into the trap, and analyse the statement against each one.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.411
Is the statement really specific to you?

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:06.501
If it’s a star sign, it is specific to 1/12 of the population.

00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:11.491
If it’s a generic statement, think about how many people it would apply to.

00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:16.131
Is the person making the statement a person of authority?

00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:17.541
Should you trust them?

00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:21.121
Have predictions they have made in the past come true?

00:17:21.911 --> 00:17:27.141
Or are they an octopus or someone who you have paid money to to read your palm?

00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:31.711
And last but not least, what is actually being said?

00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.891
Are you being flattered?

00:17:34.767 --> 00:17:37.031
Is the statement positive or negative?

00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:42.581
If it’s positive, remember that you are more likely to believe that it applies to you.

00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:48.221
So, ask yourself these three questions, and you should be

00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:51.741
able to stop any potential Barnum Effect before it’s too late.

00:17:52.641 --> 00:17:56.451
But, even if you do fall for it, is it so harmful after all?

00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.571
Is there anything wrong or dangerous about reading your horoscope in the

00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:05.071
morning, or opening a fortune cookie and thinking, “oh, how accurate”?

00:18:06.341 --> 00:18:10.771
Probably not, but just remember, next time you hear a statement

00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:16.121
and think “that’s so me”, just remember that hundreds of thousands,

00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:20.491
perhaps millions of people, are thinking exactly the same thing.

00:18:23.475 --> 00:18:29.235
OK then, that is it for this little exploration of The Barnum Effect, the powerful

00:18:29.245 --> 00:18:34.005
psychological effect that makes us believe things are about us, even when they are not.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.925
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:41.575
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:44.505
Do you believe in astrology and fortune telling?

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.955
If so, what do you say to people who think it is a load of nonsense?

00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:53.865
And if you don’t believe it, do you think it is some harmless fun,

00:18:54.215 --> 00:18:56.975
or do you think there is something a little more dangerous to it?

00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:01.205
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:04.375

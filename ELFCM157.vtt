Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.002
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:16.185
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:27.210
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Inflation.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.500
Now, the word inflation probably doesn’t sound particularly

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.860
interesting to you, but it is actually a really interesting phenomenon.

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:39.690
And, it is one that affects every single one of us.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.809
Prices rise, and sometimes go down.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.949
The money in your pocket might buy more or less of something at any given point in time.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.589
So today we are going to try to understand why that actually happens.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.330
What actually is inflation?

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.349
What causes it to happen?

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.850
Is it a good, or a bad thing?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.842
And what can you do about it?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.779
It’s a really interesting subject, so let’s get stuck in right away.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.489
Inflation is something that is relevant to all of us,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.000
and is a good thing to understand at any point in time.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.510
But I thought that now is a particularly pertinent time, a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.170
particularly important time, to understand it, for a few reasons.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.280
Firstly, governments around the world are printing vast amounts of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.990
money to stimulate economies that have been hit badly by COVID-19.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.060
If there is more money that exists, then each unit of

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.900
money, typically, is worth less, and prices tend to rise.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.980
Secondly, in almost all of the episodes where we talk about the price of something

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.530
in the past, I try to explain what that number would be in today’s money.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.980
I wanted to explore this theme a little bit, as it’s really interesting

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.380
to ask ourselves what actually causes the price of things to go up.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.580
And a final reason is related to the relationship between inflation, wages, and political stability.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.650
In this point we’ll explore the reason that a pay rise doesn’t always

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.700
mean an actual pay rise, as nurses in Britain recently found out.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.189
So, now is the time to explore this fascinating, and very important subject.

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.280
No matter how old you are, you probably have memories

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.790
from your childhood of how much certain things cost.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.929
And the costs, whether that’s for your favourite chocolate bar, for

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.910
a magazine you used to buy, or for a toy, will almost undoubtedly

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.740
have been lower when you were a child compared to what they are now.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.950
I’ll give you a few examples from my childhood.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.076
There was a comic book I used to read called The Beano.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:05.500
I can remember clearly that it used to cost 38p, 38 pence, I guess in around 1995.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.079
I just checked now and it’s £2.75, it’s now 7 times more expensive.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.159
One of the most popular toys, when I was about 6 or 7 was something called a Mighty Max.

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.010
It cost £5.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.950
It doesn’t seem like you can buy them anymore, but similar toys are around £30 to £40.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.799
Now, I was born in 1987, not so long ago, in a country that hasn’t experienced high

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.189
inflation in my lifetime, but depending on when you were born, and the country you live

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.150
in, prices might have gone up 10, 100, 1000 times compared to when you were growing up.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.649
You get the picture.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.630
The price of stuff goes up.

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.920
The term for this is inflation, and in this case it’s consumer price inflation,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.850
an increase in the price that we, as consumers, pay for goods and services.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.809
So, let’s dig down into why this actually is.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.549
There is no central person or government official telling the

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.440
magazine or the toy shop that they should increase their prices.

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:24.240
They increase prices either because they need to, because their costs have increased, or

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.930
because they can, because there are enough people who are prepared to pay these higher prices.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.270
There are, in general, three different categories of reasons for inflation, according to economists.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.000
The first is what they call “Cost-push inflation”.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.920
The idea is that the costs for businesses have increased, therefore they

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.400
need to pass on these costs to customers in order to still make a profit.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.890
There are thousands of reasons why costs might have increased, from workers asking for higher

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.779
wages to bad weather, from a ship getting stuck in the Suez canal through to political conflict.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.020
In my example of the Beano magazine, if the cost of paper increases, if the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.100
people who draw the comics are paid more, and if the rent in the shop where I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.240
buy the comic book goes up, well the shop will need to charge me more than 38p.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.120
So, that’s the first reason, “Cost-push inflation”.

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.160
The second category is what’s called “Demand-Pull Inflation”.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.170
This is what happens when people have more money, and the demand for something increases.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.830
If we go back to our example of my Beano magazine, imagine that instead

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.350
of one 8-year-old Alastair wanting to buy a copy of the Beano, there are

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.210
10,000 other little boys wanting to buy a copy, and only 1,000 that exist.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.940
The magazine could say, well, let’s see how much these little boys

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.049
really want their copy of the Beano, and let’s increase the price to 48p.

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:11.010
1,000 little boys dutifully buy the magazine at 48p, and so the price becomes 48p.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:20.239
Of course, this is a simplistic example, but for goods such as chocolate, it is a very real example.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.680
Demand for chocolate has boomed in the past decade, as consumers in

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.822
countries such as India and China now have the disposable income to buy it.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.139
And if the amount of chocolate being produced increases at a lower rate than

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.060
the amount of people who want to buy it, then the price is likely to go up.

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.295
If you are a long-term chocolate lover, no doubt you will

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.580
have noticed that the price you pay for it has been going up.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.810
And the final reason or final category is what’s called “Built-In Inflation”.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.520
This is essentially the idea that people expect the prices to go up, so they go up.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.479
If you have lived in a society where prices do go up, and wages go up, then that’s what they do.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.279
Prices go up, therefore wages go up, therefore people have more

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.460
money, so they spend more, so prices go up, and the circle continues.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.500
So, these are some of the broad causes of inflation, according to economists.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.390
We aren’t going to go into huge detail on the specifics of how inflation

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.690
is calculated, but it’s worth spending just a couple of minutes addressing

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:39.110
the subject, as newspaper headlines and TV news programmes are filled with

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:45.150
statistics about inflation, but it’s not always exactly clear what they mean.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.409
Essentially, there are different ways to measure inflation, but the one

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.990
that’s most commonly used is something called a Consumer Price Index.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.510
What this does is calculate the total cost of a selection of different things that

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:07.914
people buy, from bread and milk through to medicine, mobile phone contracts, and so on.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.030
The price for everything is added up, adjusted for how regularly you

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.090
buy it and how much of it you buy, and you get a number at the end.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.319
For sake of ease, let’s say the number is 100.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:30.790
If next year the number for the same basket of goods is 103, then the rate of inflation is 3%.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.280
Simple, right?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:39.839
It might be simple to calculate, but understanding it and controlling it isn’t quite so easy.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.700
And this brings us nicely on to our next question.

00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:46.376
Is inflation good or bad?

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:50.776
Should we be happy that prices are rising, or should we not?

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:55.656
Of course, there are multiple different theories about this, and the

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:59.826
answer depends on who you speak to, and how much the price rises.

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:05.686
There are many instances in history of hyperinflation, when the price

00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:11.116
rises at an uncontrollable level, and that is undoubtedly a bad thing.

00:09:11.896 --> 00:09:15.186
You are probably familiar with the examples of Weimar

00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:19.456
Germany, of Zimbabwe, and more recently, of Venezuela.

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:24.196
In all of those countries the price of goods started rising quickly,

00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:28.746
then more quickly, and before long there was a situation where you

00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:33.236
had to carry money in large suitcases just to buy a loaf of bread.

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:37.766
Obviously, that’s a terrible thing for an economy and a society.

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:43.536
It means that any money you have is soon worthless, and a society

00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:48.126
without any viable means of exchange runs into huge problems.

00:09:49.216 --> 00:09:53.646
But, there is an argument that inflation, at a low level,

00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:58.366
between 1 and 3%, is a positive thing for an economy.

00:09:59.166 --> 00:09:59.656
Why?

00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:04.186
Because it encourages people with savings to invest their

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:07.666
money in productive things that will help grow the economy.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:13.456
Let’s say inflation is at 3% and you have €100,000.

00:10:14.076 --> 00:10:21.916
In 1 year you will need to have €103,000 to buy what your €100,000 would have bought today.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:31.216
In 10 years you would need to have €134,000 to buy what you could buy today for €100,000.

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:37.166
So, instead of leaving money in a bank, you might invest it in a business, in the stock

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:42.566
market, or you could just buy stuff, because you know that your money is worth less

00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:48.276
and less every year, so it is in your advantage to spend it now rather than later.

00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:52.306
And spending money is what turns the wheels of the economy.

00:10:53.256 --> 00:10:59.076
Now, if you don’t have savings, or money sitting in the bank, then inflation only

00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:04.426
really matters to you if your salary increases at a lower rate than inflation.

00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:11.018
I mean, if the money you make every month increases more slowly than the prices increase.

00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:16.938
If your salary increases at a higher rate than inflation, and assuming that the rate

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:22.318
of tax remains the same, then you will end up being able to buy more every month.

00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:26.058
Let’s take another example here, because unfortunately

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:29.228
my Beano comic book one won’t work in this case.

00:11:29.848 --> 00:11:37.078
Let’s say that you have expenses of €1,000 every month, and you have a salary of €1,500.

00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:44.808
Every month you spend €1,000 on things you need, and you have another €500 for things you want.

00:11:45.528 --> 00:11:51.228
If the price of everything increases by 10%, you might think “oh, no, I’m going

00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:57.648
to have to spend €1,100 a month buying exactly what I used to spend €1,000 on”.

00:11:58.588 --> 00:12:06.698
But if your salary increases at 15%, let’s say, you now have €1,725, you

00:12:06.698 --> 00:12:12.486
can still cover your expenses, and you now have €625 for everything else.

00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:13.708
You’re ok.

00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:18.076
Now, the point here is that inflation is important

00:12:18.296 --> 00:12:21.266
if it increases at a higher rate than your salary.

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:27.586
If you live in the UK, or you follow UK news, you might have seen that this

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:31.856
problem has been something that has been all over the news in the past few months.

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:40.226
The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced that nurses would be receiving a 1% pay rise next year.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:45.266
Although he was no doubt hoping to be congratulated for this, because

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:49.436
who doesn’t support nurses being paid more, especially after what

00:12:49.446 --> 00:12:53.466
must have been a horrific year, he was widely criticised for this.

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:54.896
Why?

00:12:55.316 --> 00:13:00.846
Because the target for UK inflation is 2%, and this year it

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:05.336
has been around 1%, meaning that this isn’t a pay rise at all.

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:10.776
If your salary goes up by 1% but the cost of everything else has gone up by

00:13:10.776 --> 00:13:15.876
more than 1%, the number on your payslip might have increased, but so have

00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:20.256
the numbers at the supermarket, so you can’t buy anything more than before.

00:13:21.136 --> 00:13:27.726
Now, this brings us back to an important point, and it’s about the value of money, and

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:33.666
why money only works if you trust the government to do a good job of managing the economy.

00:13:34.496 --> 00:13:38.726
Until 1931, the UK had something called the gold standard.

00:13:39.046 --> 00:13:46.886
This meant that every pound that existed was backed by gold that the government kept in its vaults.

00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:50.996
Your paper money could be swapped for gold, it could be

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:55.566
exchanged for a physical object, guaranteed by the government.

00:13:56.196 --> 00:14:00.706
In 1931 the UK abolished the gold standard, meaning

00:14:00.876 --> 00:14:05.576
that a pound on its own is now worthless, really.

00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:10.486
You can’t go to the Bank of England and say ‘can I swap my pound for gold?’,

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:14.726
they would smile at you nicely and politely ask you to leave the building.

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:22.416
The value of money, whether this is pounds, Euros, dollars, or any other currency, is

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:28.336
only because you can use it to do things you actually need or want to do, whether that’s

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:34.046
buying bread at a baker, paying rent to your landlord, or anything else you so choose.

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:39.036
The actual number in your bank account or on your payslip is

00:14:39.396 --> 00:14:43.217
irrelevant; the only thing that matters is what you can do with it.

00:14:43.936 --> 00:14:50.416
The deal that we all implicitly make is that we trust that our money won’t lose its value too

00:14:50.416 --> 00:14:56.356
quickly, and for that to happen, the government needs to keep a very close eye on inflation.

00:14:57.216 --> 00:15:02.896
One of the main roles of government is to control inflation, precisely so that it remains

00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:07.976
at a steady rate, and people can trust what their money will be worth in the future.

00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:12.046
Controlling inflation means political stability.

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:18.106
If it’s too high, well it runs the risk of running out of control and becoming

00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:24.209
hyperinflation, as was the case in places such as Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe and Venezuela.

00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:31.939
In all of these countries the currency became worthless, the state essentially collapsed, and

00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:37.669
in the case of Weimar Germany it cleared a path for the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party.

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:44.279
Indeed, the country in Europe that is probably most afraid of high inflation is

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:49.679
Germany, given that it experienced firsthand what high inflation rates can lead to.

00:15:50.599 --> 00:15:53.699
But, what if there were no inflation?

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:58.869
What if there were a way to stop this happening, and to stop prices rising?

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:01.789
Well, there sort of is.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:07.649
The opposite of inflation is called deflation, and it’s like inflation but in reverse.

00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:10.269
Every year things get a little bit cheaper.

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:13.269
Every year wages tend to reduce.

00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:17.989
And if you are thinking that this is just theoretical, it’s not.

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:22.659
Japan has been undergoing a period of deflation on and

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:26.759
off since the 1990s, and has struggled to get out of it.

00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:31.419
It isn’t quite so tragic as hyperinflation, but once

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:35.209
deflation starts, it’s very hard to turn it around.

00:16:35.709 --> 00:16:41.329
In a country with deflation, your money becomes more and more valuable over time, which

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:47.499
means there is less of an incentive to spend or invest, so the economy doesn’t grow as fast.

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.379
And that is exactly what Japan has been suffering from.

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:56.169
Its economy has been almost flat over the past 30 years

00:16:56.449 --> 00:17:00.869
while the US economy, for example, has tripled in size.

00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:06.691
Now, I want to finish this exploration into the word of inflation with

00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:11.481
a brief discussion of the relationship between bitcoin and inflation.

00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:19.201
Episode 122 from a few months ago goes into this in much greater detail, so I’d

00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:23.301
recommend listening to that if you’re interested in exploring this area further.

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:27.361
One of the main reasons believers in Bitcoin are so

00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:31.251
fanatical about it is that it doesn’t suffer from inflation.

00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:36.891
There are a fixed number of bitcoins in existence, so, unlike dollars,

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:41.611
pounds or Euros, you can’t add more bitcoin to the monetary system.

00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:47.041
One of the causes of inflation, as we learned about earlier with the Demand-Pull

00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:52.131
Effect, is due to there being more money in circulation so that prices go up.

00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:58.121
This can’t happen with bitcoin, because the quantity of bitcoin is fixed.

00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.721
Now, an important point to note is that, although the bitcoin price has

00:18:03.741 --> 00:18:09.481
increased significantly, this isn’t due to price inflation; in fact, you now need

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:14.371
significantly fewer bitcoin to buy the same amount of things as a few years ago.

00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:19.481
1 bitcoin 10 years ago might have bought you a slice of pizza.

00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:21.401
Now it will buy you a Porsche.

00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:27.931
OK, if you have got this far, congratulations, it’s been quite an economics-heavy

00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:33.571
episode, and I know there is quite a lot of jargon, of complex terminology in there.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:39.691
The reality is that inflation is still something that we don’t completely understand.

00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:45.881
Economics isn’t an exact science, and if you look at a chart, a graph

00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:51.111
of inflation over time, it jumps up and down seemingly randomly.

00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:57.071
Economists and policymakers have ideas about how to control it, but

00:18:57.071 --> 00:19:00.878
really there are millions of different factors that influence it.

00:19:00.878 --> 00:19:06.581
Economics is really a social science that tries to understand human behaviour.

00:19:07.301 --> 00:19:14.101
And we human beings are unreliable and unpredictable, and the world is an unstable place.

00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:20.221
The bargain that we all make is that we trust the government to keep inflation under control.

00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:23.571
Normally, governments manage this quite well.

00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:28.881
But when they don’t, well you just need to look at Weimar Germany,

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.881
Zimbabwe, or Venezuela to see what the consequences can be.

00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:39.211
OK then, that is it for today's episode on inflation.

00:19:39.581 --> 00:19:44.441
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and the next time you see

00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:49.461
that the price has gone up for your favourite chocolate bar, your favourite magazine, or your

00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:55.371
landlord, then perhaps this will give you an idea about some of the reasons why that might be.

00:19:56.341 --> 00:20:01.121
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, especially

00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:06.291
if you have lived either in a country or through a period of high inflation.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:16.686
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:21.116
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:27.836
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the life of Donald Trump.

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:32.596
Now, no doubt you need no reminder of who Donald Trump is.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.706
His presidency was one of the most controversial in recent

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:40.376
American political history, and impossible to ignore.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:44.006
We’re all well aware of his scandals: all the things he

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:48.356
said and did - both true and ‘fake news’, as he would say.

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:52.056
But we’re not here to talk about his presidency today.

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:57.426
We’re here to talk about his life before he became leader of the free world.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.496
We’ll take a look at his early life and the impact of his parents.

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:04.596
His businesses, and many business failures.

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:07.696
His scandals, and criminal investigations.

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:12.596
And consider whether or not he really wanted to be president, or

00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:17.286
he simply became the most powerful man in the world… by accident.

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:21.737
OK then, the life of Donald Trump.

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:28.247
On a June afternoon in 2015, a small crowd waited around

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:31.697
in the basement of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper.

00:01:32.557 --> 00:01:38.767
There was a small stage, and posters promising to ‘Make America Great Again’ on the walls.

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:46.207
Then, suddenly, everyone turned and all eyes looked up towards a golden escalator.

00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:49.337
First, the shoes came into view.

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:53.827
Then the legs, the midsection, the tie, and, finally,

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:58.297
a shock of poorly dyed blonde hair and a cheesy grin.

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:04.647
The reality TV star and businessman Donald Trump was slowly descending the golden

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:10.497
escalator, and he just announced his candidacy to be president of the United States.

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:15.047
It was an escalator ride that altered American history forever.

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:23.627
Almost exactly 69 years before this, a Scottish immigrant named Mary MacLeod gave birth to a boy.

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:32.587
His name was Donald John Trump, and he was born in New York on the 14th of June, 1946.

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:39.427
His father, Fred Trump, was a brash, outspoken New York real estate developer.

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:47.157
Fred and Donald were, you could say, a great example of the famous phrase: ‘Like father, like son.’

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.497
Fred Trump had made his fortune building thousands of apartment units,

00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:57.267
mostly in Brooklyn, New York, for some of the city’s poorest people.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:01.327
But he didn’t do this out of the goodness of his heart, of course.

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:07.877
Rather, Fred Trump took government money to build social housing, but didn’t quite

00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:12.597
tell the real truth about how much the construction, the building would cost,

00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:17.811
meaning he would charge the government more and put the difference in his pocket.

00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:24.493
While clearly, as a businessman, he was allowed to make a profit, his business practices

00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:31.433
raised eyebrows so much that he was investigated in 1954 by the Senate Banking Committee for

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:36.523
overestimating the costs of his construction projects and keeping the difference for himself.

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:39.323
But that’s just the start.

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:46.113
Fred Trump was not only a man of questionable, shady business practices, like his

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:51.533
son would be accused of being, but there is also substantial evidence to suggest

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:56.611
that he would discriminate against his tenants based on the colour of their skin.

00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:02.411
Specifically, African American tenants weren’t treated well by Fred Trump.

00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:10.281
In 1967 after black tenants were repeatedly rejected for apartment applications, an

00:04:10.281 --> 00:04:17.081
investigation concluded that of the almost 4000 apartments in Trump Village, one of

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:23.391
Fred’s many housing complexes, just seven were occupied by African-American families.

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:29.651
Now, Donald Trump might have got the taste for business, and perhaps

00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:34.381
slightly questionable business practices, from his father, but there

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:38.471
were plenty of maternal influences too, influences from his mother.

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:44.631
Specifically, for his style and his trademark hair, he has his mother to thank.

00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:51.641
She also had a love for eccentric hairstyles, and for many years Mary, his

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:57.881
mother, sported a dramatic orange swirl reminiscent of her son’s infamous hairdo.

00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:03.558
She often wore fur coats and extravagant jewellery, and Donald Trump

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:07.898
has frequently acknowledged his mother’s influence on his personality.

00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:14.818
In his 1987 book ‘The Art of the Deal,’ he wrote: “Looking back, I

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:19.188
realise now that I got some of my sense of showmanship from my mother.”

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:24.448
Mary’s sense of showmanship would take her son onto every

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:27.688
TV screen in America, and then into the White House.

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:31.488
Anyway, back to young Donald’s early life.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:38.368
After attending a private boarding school, Trump initially studied at Fordham University in the

00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:45.558
Bronx but in 1966 he went on to the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:53.028
During his studies he managed to avoid being ‘drafted’ into the Army to fight in the Vietnam war.

00:05:53.754 --> 00:06:00.079
But in 1968, by the time he had finished his studies, Trump was initially

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:06.669
declared eligible to fight but, as you may know, he was given another medical

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.189
deferral - for  bone spurs, basically hard bumps that develop on the end of bones.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:19.579
This was essentially a doctor’s letter saying “don’t send him to Vietnam, he isn’t healthy enough”.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.552
So, he never went.

00:06:22.102 --> 00:06:26.552
Now, there has been plenty of controversy about this, and it has since

00:06:26.572 --> 00:06:31.212
been suggested that the doctor who diagnosed his bone spurs was a

00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:36.042
tenant in a Trump building and did Fred, Donald's father, a favour.

00:06:37.352 --> 00:06:42.092
Upon his graduation, and safe from the battlefield, Donald began working

00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:46.102
with his father and soon got into the spirit of the family business.

00:06:46.962 --> 00:06:53.032
By 1971, at the age of just 25, he was made President.

00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:56.882
Not President of the United States, of course, that would have to wait.

00:06:57.312 --> 00:06:59.932
President of his father’s real estate business.

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:04.879
It seems that the young Donald was quite happy to go along with his

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.579
father’s questionable business practices, and his career would be

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.539
plagued, filled, with legal difficulties and accusations of wrongdoing.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:20.082
In 1973 Fred and Donald, along with their company,

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:23.842
then called Trump Management, were sued by the U.S.

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:29.452
Justice Department for violating the 1968 Fair Housing Act for alleged

00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:32.892
racial discrimination at their apartment buildings in New York City.

00:07:34.032 --> 00:07:37.632
Both Fred, who was Chairman, and Donald, the company

00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:40.792
president, were named as defendants in the lawsuit.

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:46.122
It might not have been for a great reason, but this was Donald’s first

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:50.792
time in the national spotlight, and he certainly made the most of it.

00:07:51.982 --> 00:07:57.502
In response, the Trumps decided to countersue the Justice Department for

00:07:57.502 --> 00:08:04.272
$100 million, but the matter was eventually settled out of court in an

00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:08.672
arrangement that meant they didn’t have to admit any guilt, any wrongdoing.

00:08:09.952 --> 00:08:16.762
In the late 1970’s and 1980’s Donald began to go upmarket, and move the

00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:21.882
family business from affordable housing into luxury hotels and casinos.

00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:25.772
To do this, however, he needed two things.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:28.352
Money, and lots of it.

00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:33.280
And political connections to get purchases and planning permission approved.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.870
Fred Trump, his father, had both.

00:08:37.544 --> 00:08:41.363
And it’s here, really, that the career of Donald Trump took off.

00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:48.023
It all started, in Trump’s own words, with a ‘small loan of one million dollars’ from his father.

00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:53.783
Now, 1 million dollars in the early 1970s is about 7 million

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:58.273
dollars now, it’s not everyone’s definition of a “small loan”.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:02.023
And there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Trump

00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:04.983
was actually loaned a lot more than he first claimed.

00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:12.283
With this money, he continued buying up properties, and in 1983 opened the

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:17.573
famous Trump Tower, an office, retail, and housing complex that would become

00:09:17.573 --> 00:09:22.075
the headquarters of the Trump Organization - and where he famously announced

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:27.440
his candidacy for president after descending the golden escalator in 2015.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.750
From here, the developments continued to grow, and of course

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.470
the Trump name was plastered all over every new building.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.950
Using loans and political favours, he bought and developed Trump

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:49.343
Plaza in 1984, and the 19-story Plaza Hotel in 1988 for $400 million.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:57.110
In 1985 he bought the famous Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach in Florida, the estate

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.660
that he would later refer to as the Winter White House, an estate where it turned

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.730
out he had been keeping classified materials after handing over the presidency.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.600
On top of this there were casinos in Atlantic City, an

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.700
airline, and a smorgasbord of interlinked business ventures.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:15.830
All, of

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.080
course, named Trump something or other.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.730
But much like the fortunes of politicians, the world of business is

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.870
often unpredictable and success can ‘ebb and flow’ with the economy.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.480
‘Ebb and flow’, by the way, basically means something that goes up or down or varies.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:40.130
Well, when economies across the Western world started to fall into recession in

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:45.430
the early 1990s, the many Trump Organization businesses also began to suffer.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:52.140
Trump struggled to keep up with his debt payments, the money he owed, which is

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.900
believed to have gone into the billions; although, as we know from his time in the

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:02.140
White House, he likes to keep his financial records close to his chest, or top secret.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.470
After trying to restructure some of his businesses, Trump was forced to give up his

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.390
airline and sell his superyacht called the ‘Trump Princess’, he was forced to take

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.510
out new mortgages on all of his businesses, and limit himself to a personal budget.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.470
But the financial difficulties continued to grow.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:30.080
Trump Taj Mahal casino was called into bankruptcy court in 1991 - it was $3

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.960
billion in debt just one year after opening its doors - and two of his other

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.750
casinos, as well as his Plaza Hotel in New York City, also went bankrupt in 1992.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:48.360
Things got so bad in the 1990’s that Trump almost went personally bankrupt,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:54.140
and in 1992, with banks threatening to foreclose on the huge loans they

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.550
had given him, Trump agreed to turn over many of his remaining assets.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.180
From that moment on, most major banks were sceptical about doing business with the self-styled

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:11.830
“very stable genius”, and the Trump brand moved mostly into entertainment ventures.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:19.260
As always, Trump’s true business value was unclear: estimates of his net worth during

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:25.170
this rocky period in the 1990’s varied from the billions to the negative millions.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:32.700
Our next stop is a place where you might have first become aware of Donald Trump: on a TV screen.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.023
Despite all the business successes and failures, and being relatively well

00:12:39.023 --> 00:12:45.043
known in New York social circles, nothing made Trump more famous or set him

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:50.043
on the road to the White House] more than the reality TV show, The Apprentice.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:54.683
Not only could he present himself as a highly successful businessman

00:12:54.843 --> 00:12:59.203
on TV screens across America - never mentioning all the legal cases and

00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:02.953
bankruptcies, of course - he also made quite a lot of money from the show.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:07.943
It is believed that Trump made around $200 million from The Apprentice.

00:13:08.593 --> 00:13:14.643
But to someone who would claim to be a billionaire, and someone who clearly had a keen

00:13:14.663 --> 00:13:20.353
understanding of the value of a brand, The Apprentice gave him something much more valuable.

00:13:20.873 --> 00:13:26.173
It positioned him in the minds of the American public as a “self-made billionaire”.

00:13:27.093 --> 00:13:30.843
And for a nation with an almost religious infatuation

00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:35.073
with businessmen and making money, this was priceless.

00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:42.333
The 2008 relaunch of the show, The Celebrity Apprentice, brought him into celebrity circles,

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:49.213
confirmed his position as a household name in American TV society, and his well known signature

00:13:49.213 --> 00:13:54.413
catch phrase - ‘you’re fired’ - gave him authority in the minds of the American public.

00:13:55.413 --> 00:13:59.123
America had seen him in a carefully controlled business

00:13:59.123 --> 00:14:03.027
situation on The Apprentice looking decisive and authoritative.

00:14:03.867 --> 00:14:08.617
This seed that he planted in the 2000s would come in useful later on.

00:14:09.697 --> 00:14:15.947
But if we put aside the self-made billionaire TV persona for a moment, Trump certainly had

00:14:15.947 --> 00:14:22.557
some very big business failures over the years, including, but not limited to, Trump Steaks; a

00:14:22.687 --> 00:14:29.597
Trump Ice bottled water brand; Trump Vodka; and, of course, the prestigious Trump University.

00:14:30.677 --> 00:14:35.627
Trump University, or, The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, as it became known when

00:14:35.627 --> 00:14:40.127
authorities declared it misleading and possibly illegal to describe as a university,

00:14:40.537 --> 00:14:45.757
was an educational service that offered classes in real-estate investment and

00:14:45.967 --> 00:14:50.907
entrepreneurialism, and the chance to learn from the great real estate mogul himself.

00:14:51.987 --> 00:14:57.387
For the small price of up to $50,000 you too could learn how

00:14:57.387 --> 00:15:00.977
to become a real estate billionaire, just like Donald Trump.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.627
It sounded too good to be true.

00:15:04.127 --> 00:15:08.527
You´d only needed to pay $50,000 but you’d learn the secrets to become a billionaire?

00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:12.517
It turned out that it might just have been too good to be true.

00:15:13.637 --> 00:15:19.157
In 2011 Trump University was investigated by the New York Attorney General,

00:15:19.547 --> 00:15:26.157
and in August of 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil

00:15:26.157 --> 00:15:31.617
lawsuit alleging that the business had lied to and defrauded its students.

00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:37.937
After denying the allegations for a few years, Trump eventually settled the

00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:45.317
lawsuits for $25 million in November 2016, after he had been elected president.

00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:52.767
So, how exactly did Donald go from TV star to president of the free world?

00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:57.037
Was the White House always part of his plan, or was it

00:15:57.057 --> 00:16:00.237
an elaborate marketing strategy that ‘got out of hand’?

00:16:00.587 --> 00:16:04.287
Was he a committed politician, or a shameless opportunist?

00:16:04.937 --> 00:16:11.327
Well, despite what Trump might have said on the campaign trail back in 2016, it's believed

00:16:11.457 --> 00:16:18.240
that he first considered a presidential run, as a Republican, as far back as 1988.

00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:23.877
He was never quite the anti-establishment, political outsider he makes himself out

00:16:23.877 --> 00:16:29.287
to be, and had been involved with politics, on some level, for most of his life.

00:16:30.307 --> 00:16:34.577
In 2000 he was a presidential candidate for the third-party

00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:38.657
Reform party but he withdrew after winning two primaries.

00:16:39.337 --> 00:16:47.467
He then unofficially campaigned for a while in 2012, and reportedly also considered a run in 2014.

00:16:48.527 --> 00:16:53.637
It's safe to say that Trump had flirted with the idea for many years,

00:16:53.797 --> 00:16:59.197
but had no strong political ideology or values guiding him and wasn’t

00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:02.627
really interested in things that he couldn’t win or profit from.

00:17:03.687 --> 00:17:10.637
Although he was a Republican president and is now considered anything from moderately to extremely

00:17:10.657 --> 00:17:16.047
right-wing, Trump’s political donations over the years make for very interesting reading.

00:17:16.897 --> 00:17:24.277
Specifically, until 2010, he had donated more to the Democrats than he had to the Republican party.

00:17:25.017 --> 00:17:29.667
And his official party affiliation has also changed over the years.

00:17:30.587 --> 00:17:36.207
He initially registered as a Republican back in 1987, switched to the

00:17:36.207 --> 00:17:41.497
Reform Party for that brief presidential run in 2000, was a Democrat between

00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:48.717
2001 and 2009, and then finally switched back to the Republicans in 2009.

00:17:49.857 --> 00:17:57.557
In fact, and you might find this very surprising, in 2008 he actually endorsed Hillary Clinton

00:17:57.807 --> 00:18:03.327
in the Democratic primaries, but then supported the Republican John McCain for president.

00:18:04.337 --> 00:18:06.957
So, back to his path to the presidency.

00:18:07.437 --> 00:18:13.787
In February 2011 Trump appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference, and although

00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:19.727
his speech there is believed by some to have ignited his career within the Republican Party,

00:18:20.177 --> 00:18:25.987
many in the media thought his appearances were more promotional than political, and that,

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:32.587
in reality, the whole thing was a marketing ploy, a marketing idea, for The Apprentice.

00:18:33.217 --> 00:18:39.507
Indeed, there’s real speculation among journalists and historians that Trump’s presidential run

00:18:39.697 --> 00:18:46.607
in 2016 also began as an attention-seeking scheme to promote his struggling business ventures.

00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:52.747
As the former Fox News CEO and close friend of Trump, Roger Ailes, once

00:18:52.747 --> 00:18:57.447
said, "if you want a career in television, first run for president."

00:18:58.677 --> 00:19:05.117
And many people believe that that’s exactly what Trump wanted to do: run for President, lose

00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:10.977
the election but receive hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free publicity, then launch

00:19:10.977 --> 00:19:16.626
a new news network or use the increased fame as a marketing technique for his businesses.

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:23.196
Even a week before the election, reportedly, Trump and his team were sure he would lose.

00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:24.976
And he was OK with that.

00:19:25.626 --> 00:19:28.686
According to one journalist, Trump told Ailes that

00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:31.576
the campaign had been "bigger than I ever dreamed of.

00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:34.436
I don't think about losing, because it isn't losing.

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:35.676
We've totally won."

00:19:36.747 --> 00:19:39.747
So, what happened when he actually won?

00:19:40.237 --> 00:19:42.557
Well, it was a shock, to say the least.

00:19:43.157 --> 00:19:44.197
Donald Trump Jr.

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:48.587
is reported to have said that his father "looked as if he had seen a ghost.

00:19:48.947 --> 00:19:51.647
Melania was in tears - and not tears of joy."

00:19:53.177 --> 00:19:57.347
After winning the most unlikely of political upsets, there were reports that

00:19:57.357 --> 00:20:01.597
Trump didn’t even want to live in the White House, and that he was unimpressed

00:20:01.597 --> 00:20:06.437
with the decor, and that he struggled to live without the maids and butlers

00:20:06.587 --> 00:20:10.867
that he had long enjoyed in his collection of private residences and hotels.

00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:16.397
So, how did Donald Trump, a supposedly successful businessman with

00:20:16.397 --> 00:20:20.557
a shady track record of investments and legal challenges, how did

00:20:20.557 --> 00:20:24.617
he win the presidency and become the most powerful man in the world?

00:20:25.217 --> 00:20:29.767
Well, clearly tens of thousands of hours of TV and millions of

00:20:29.767 --> 00:20:33.888
words have been written analysing how and why this happened.

00:20:34.748 --> 00:20:41.028
So I only want to make one point here, and it’s that the fact that he was the clear outsider,

00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:47.088
and that he wasn’t expected to win, meant that his campaign became relatively pressure-free.

00:20:47.748 --> 00:20:51.508
This allowed him to paint himself as a political underdog,

00:20:51.798 --> 00:20:55.348
someone thought to have little or no chance of winning anything.

00:20:56.228 --> 00:21:01.288
Portraying himself as an outsider against the establishment candidate and former

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:07.308
First Lady Hilary Clinton, Trump was pretty much free to say and do whatever he liked.

00:21:08.278 --> 00:21:12.188
This was, as I’m sure you'll remember, often done in very

00:21:12.288 --> 00:21:15.988
provocative, offensive, and politically incorrect language.

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:21.568
He bragged about his wealth, claiming it would free him from the influence of the big

00:21:21.598 --> 00:21:28.012
political donors that dominated Washington, and promised to ‘drain the swamp’ in Washington DC.

00:21:29.098 --> 00:21:33.228
Desperate to be seen as rich and powerful, he talked endlessly about

00:21:33.238 --> 00:21:37.758
his business empire, his bank balance and even his golden toilet.

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:44.058
This kind of braggadocious behaviour clearly resonated, and he portrayed

00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:48.368
himself as a tough self-made billionaire businessman who would be able to

00:21:48.368 --> 00:21:52.408
have the same success in government as he had had in the business world.

00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:58.288
So by a combination of luck, opportunism, and the unpopularity of his

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:04.008
opponent, on November 9th of 2016, Donald Trump won the US presidential

00:22:04.008 --> 00:22:07.698
election in one of the greatest political upsets of all time.

00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:14.910
His decisions in office enraged many, delighted many others, and he tore up the rule

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.050
book in anything and everything from climate change to trade and foreign policy.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.510
It made him the most famous and recognisable face in the world,

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.390
and there wasn’t a day when he wasn’t all over cable news.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.690
Of course, The Trump Show might have quietened down, but it is far from the end of the series.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:43.230
There are rumours of another presidential run in 2024, when Donald Trump will be 78 years old.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:50.240
If this does happen, as Trump knows all too well, it will be “must watch TV”.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:58.500
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Donald Trump, a reality TV star

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.680
and businessman with a questionable legal track record that went on to win

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.519
the presidency and shift the direction of not only American but world history.

00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:11.309
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:14.639
Where does Trump rank among US presidents?

00:23:14.929 --> 00:23:17.029
Do you think he really wanted to become president?

00:23:17.449 --> 00:23:21.789
And have we seen the last of Donald Trump, or is this just the start?

00:23:22.449 --> 00:23:25.669
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.800
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the murder of Maurizio Gucci.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.729
It’s a story of high fashion, of luxury, of love,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.660
rivalries, jealousy, betrayal, warring families, and murder.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.029
So, let’s not waste a minute and dive right into it.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.930
On 27th of March 1995, Giuseppe Onorato was working as usual

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.349
at the stylish office building in which he was a doorman.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.900
The offices were just a stone’s throw away from Milan’s fashion district, an affluent and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.550
trendy area, and not the usual type of setting for the events that would unfold that morning.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.610
Arriving for work was Maurizio Gucci.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.620
Once Gucci’s president, he was now working on his own

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.059
business from the type of lavish offices he had grown used to.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.739
As the Italian businessman climbed the front steps, Giuseppe Onorato, the doorman,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:33.059
watched another man get out of a nearby car and walk towards the entrance of the building.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.399
Gucci greeted his loyal doorman, who saw the third man drawing a gun.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.729
There were four shots, at first.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.600
Three of these landed in Gucci’s body.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.729
The fourth and final shot was to the head.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.259
But the gunman wasn’t done.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.610
He then turned his attention to the shooting's only witness: Giuseppe Onorato, the doorman.

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:05.474
By the time the police arrived, the doorman was sitting in a pool of blood.

00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:10.664
He had been hit twice in the arm before the gunman had panicked and fled.

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:14.174
Onorato was injured, but alive.

00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:18.204
However, it wasn’t just his own blood he was covered in.

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:23.354
He was cradling the lifeless body of Maurizio Gucci.

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:29.214
The grandson of the man who had founded one of the biggest brands in fashion was dead.

00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:36.464
For many, the murder of a rich and famous businessman in a city like Milan was unheard of.

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:42.194
For others, it came as less of a shock; Gucci had many enemies.

00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:49.444
But despite various leads, or suspects, the case would remain unsolved for two years.

00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:57.144
Before we dive into the events that led up to this tragedy, let’s remind ourselves of a bit of

00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:03.974
Gucci history, as it’s in this history that we may find some clues about this shocking murder.

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:12.874
Maurizio Gucci’s grandfather, Guccio Gucci, was born in Florence in 1881 and caught

00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:18.534
his first glimpses of luxury working at the Savoy Hotel in London as a teenager.

00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:24.104
Inspired by the well-to-do guests, and particularly their

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:28.064
luggage, Guccio began making travel bags and accessories.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:36.084
Eventually, in 1921 he opened a luxury leather shop in Florence called House of Gucci.

00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:42.604
The brand quickly gained momentum, garnering attention from the global elite, leading

00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:48.854
to the opening of a second store on one of Rome’s luxury shopping streets in 1938.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:56.644
That same year, Guccio brought on three of his sons, Aldo, Vasco and Rodolfo, to

00:03:56.644 --> 00:04:01.494
help him run the business and continue its expansion over the next few decades.

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:09.568
In 1953, a Gucci boutique was even opened in New the first company store located outside of Europe.

00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:14.678
Just two weeks later however, the founder, Guccio Gucci,

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:19.258
died, aged 72, leaving his three sons to run the business.

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:24.798
As you might imagine, Guccio Gucci’s grandson, Maurizio

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:28.578
Gucci, was no stranger to wealth and high society.

00:04:29.188 --> 00:04:36.438
But, despite his family’s great power and status, he was a notoriously shy and awkward young man.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:41.338
His mother died when he was just five, and so his

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:45.048
father, Rodolfo, was quite overprotective of his son.

00:04:45.638 --> 00:04:51.558
He was also rather overbearing, and the young boy grew used to doing as his father told him.

00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:57.601
That was until 1970, when, at 22 years old, he met a

00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:01.745
lively and charismatic woman named Patrizia Reggiani.

00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:06.968
At that time, Reggiani was known in the elite Milan social circles

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:11.268
as a popular, wealthy socialite with a luxurious lifestyle.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.258
But it hadn’t always been that way.

00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:19.738
Unlike Maurizio, Patrizia was born poor to a single

00:05:19.738 --> 00:05:22.758
mother and had never known her biological father.

00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:28.008
However, when she was twelve, her mother married a rich

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:31.178
trucking entrepreneur who would later adopt Patrizia.

00:05:32.618 --> 00:05:37.288
And this new father spoiled her, buying her fur coats,

00:05:37.498 --> 00:05:41.308
fast cars, fine jewellery and whatever else she desired.

00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:47.038
She began to develop a taste for fine things that would ultimately consume her.

00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:54.998
Still, the trucking business did not lend itself to the same glamorous lifestyle as fashion moguls

00:05:55.198 --> 00:06:01.998
such as the Guccis, and Patrizia had to work her way into the same elite social circles as Maurizio.

00:06:03.138 --> 00:06:08.078
Their encounter in 1970 kicked off a whirlwind romance.

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:14.308
They fell in love quickly, and Maurizio even proposed to her on their second date.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.378
But there was just one problem.

00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:21.948
Rodolfo, Maurizio’s father, he did not approve of the couple.

00:06:22.688 --> 00:06:27.818
He saw Patrizia’s background as a red flag, a warning sign that

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:32.208
she was only interested in his son for his money and status.

00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:38.328
But young Maurizio was head over heels for Patrizia, and his

00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:42.718
father had to resort to more extreme measures to break the pair up.

00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:48.798
He disinherited his son, cutting Maurizio off from the family company and money.

00:06:49.468 --> 00:06:51.198
But this still did not work.

00:06:52.288 --> 00:06:58.558
As the wedding drew closer, Rodolfo Gucci even asked the cardinal of Milan to put a stop to it.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:06.438
It was no use and the couple married in 1972 with no members of the Gucci family in attendance.

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:12.098
But luck was about to turn for the new Mr and Mrs Gucci.

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:19.698
A year before their marriage, Maurizio’s uncle Aldo had hinted that he wanted to start training

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:25.588
up a younger member of the family to take over the business, rather than his own much older sons.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:32.138
Aldo was responsible for running Gucci in America, and he was instrumental

00:07:32.138 --> 00:07:35.945
in helping turn the business into an international powerhouse.

00:07:37.105 --> 00:07:40.765
Maurizio wouldn’t have to wait for long to re-enter the family business.

00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:47.035
In the same year as his wedding, Aldo invited him to New York to begin working for Gucci again.

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:50.925
And life was good for the couple for a while.

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:57.535
Professionally, business was booming, and Maurizio and Patrizia had become quite the pair.

00:07:58.205 --> 00:08:03.095
She was his right-hand woman, advising him on various Gucci business matters.

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:09.525
The couple owned several properties, including the luxury New York penthouse that they lived in.

00:08:10.005 --> 00:08:14.455
Patrizia collected fine jewellery and Maurizio bought what

00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:18.075
was, at the time, the world’s largest wooden sailing boat.

00:08:19.285 --> 00:08:23.575
And they flaunted this wealth about town, driving around in a

00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:28.425
chauffeured car and entrenching themselves in New York’s social scene.

00:08:29.695 --> 00:08:33.325
They even reunited with Rodolfo Gucci, Maurizio’s

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:37.165
father, after the birth of their first child in 1976.

00:08:38.144 --> 00:08:44.190
The reunion wouldn't last for long as just six years later, Rodolfo Gucci was dead.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.780
Upon his father’s death, Maurizio inherited his father’s Gucci shares,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.010
making him the majority shareholder of the iconic fashion house.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.130
And he wasn’t going to be a silent shareholder, either.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.940
While his father and uncle had always wanted to preserve

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.090
Gucci as a family business, Maurizio had other plans.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.870
He didn’t like the direction the company had been heading.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.770
What he saw to be excessive franchising and mass production

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.360
of products had degraded the brand’s name in his eyes.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.020
He wanted to bring exclusivity back to Gucci, even

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.590
if he had to take his own family down in the process.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.170
His plan was to replace his uncle as Gucci’s president, its boss.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.031
To do this, he enlisted the help of his cousin, Paolo, Aldo’s son.

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:44.110
Paolo had once been vice president of Gucci after years as chief designer.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.275
He is even credited as one of the minds behind the famous double G logo.

00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:54.555
However, he felt like his voice was not being heard enough.

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:59.505
So, in 1980, he had gone behind his father’s back and

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:03.545
opened his own, independent fashion line called Gucci Plus.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:07.885
When he found out, Aldo was furious.

00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:12.965
Not only did he fire his son, but he sued him for infringing

00:10:12.975 --> 00:10:16.235
Gucci trademarks and cut him off from its suppliers.

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:22.050
Paolo wanted to seek revenge, and so the cousins made a deal.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.980
Paolo agreed to help vote Aldo off Gucci’s Board of Directors and in return,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.030
Maurizio would let Paolo independently lead some design work in the company.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.070
And the plan worked.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.580
Maurizio was able to take Aldo’s place as president.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.250
However, just as his professional life took off, his

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.290
personal one was beginning to crumble, or at least, change.

00:10:50.678 --> 00:10:55.478
Despite their differences, just before his death, Rodolfo Gucci had warned

00:10:55.478 --> 00:11:00.848
Patrizia, his daughter in law, that Maurizio would change once he gained more power.

00:11:01.648 --> 00:11:04.978
“You will find you are married to another man,” he told her.

00:11:05.948 --> 00:11:07.908
And his prediction came true.

00:11:08.808 --> 00:11:14.138
Once he became president, Maurizio began spending less and less time with his family

00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:18.968
and started to cut Patrizia out of the day-to-day running of the Gucci business.

00:11:19.468 --> 00:11:22.998
She was no longer able to steer the company in her own direction.

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:28.294
And it wasn’t just a lust for power that was driving Maurizio away.

00:11:29.304 --> 00:11:33.644
After buying his extraordinarily large sailing boat, he took a keen

00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:38.032
interest in sailing, sponsoring races and teams all over the world.

00:11:38.972 --> 00:11:44.264
And while Patrizia did not share this passion, he soon found someone who did.

00:11:45.384 --> 00:11:50.765
He met an American model called Sheree Loud at a sailing event in 1984.

00:11:51.674 --> 00:11:55.664
Despite both being married to other people, Maurizio avidly

00:11:55.664 --> 00:11:59.434
pursued her and the two began an affair that same year.

00:12:00.404 --> 00:12:03.074
They travelled together to sailing events across the

00:12:03.074 --> 00:12:05.824
world and Sheree helped him to renovate his boat.

00:12:06.494 --> 00:12:10.304
They seemed to have much more in common than Maurizio and Patrizia.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:17.354
And so, in March of 1985, Maurizio packed his bags and left his family home.

00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:22.374
At first, he told his wife that he was simply going on a business trip.

00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:29.134
But, the next day, he sent a mutual friend to tell her that he would not be returning at all.

00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:33.224
This, of course, greatly angered Patrizia.

00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:39.044
Not only did he not have the courage to tell her in person, but he also wanted her

00:12:39.074 --> 00:12:44.464
to keep up appearances and, in public, pretend that they were still happily married.

00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:49.639
The couple had not yet officially divorced, so Patrizia did

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:53.379
as Maurizio asked, perhaps in the hopes of winning him back.

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:58.799
Maurizio, meanwhile, was only able to enjoy his new life as the

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:03.069
president of Gucci and free from his controlling wife for a short time.

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:09.589
Aldo, his uncle, felt publicly humiliated by his exile from Gucci.

00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:15.569
His nephew had removed many aspects of the company that were considered his legacy.

00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:19.789
Paolo also was unhappy with his cousin, Maurizio.

00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:25.189
He had never followed through with his promise to give him the creative freedom he had agreed to.

00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:34.479
So Aldo and Paolo teamed up and together they claimed that Maurizio, in order to avoid inheritance

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:40.819
tax, had forged his father’s signature on forms transferring him his late father’s shares.

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:46.889
And when they reported this to the authorities, Maurizio was charged with the crime.

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:50.509
Luckily for him, he managed to avoid prison.

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:56.899
In an almost James Bond-like fashion, as police were coming to arrest him he received

00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:01.599
a warning from his lawyer and quickly jumped on a motorbike, fleeing to Switzerland.

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:08.719
This is where he would stay for several years until he was acquitted, essentially found not guilty.

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:13.349
During this time, he was stripped of the Gucci presidency.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:15.989
But, he still owned half of the company.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:21.829
Once again, he had to hatch a plan to, form a plan to regain control.

00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:26.209
And this time, he would leave no room for retaliation.

00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:33.839
So, in 1988, with the help of an investment bank called Investcorp, he began to buy

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:38.559
out the rest of his family, meaning that they would no longer own shares in Gucci.

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.709
The first target was Paolo.

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:46.189
Still struggling to set up his own fashion label, he could use

00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:49.779
the money he got from selling his shares to fund this venture.

00:14:50.309 --> 00:14:52.289
And so he sold them to Investcorp.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:57.779
After this, Maurizio persuaded more of his cousins to sell their

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:01.909
shares, all won over by the large cash amounts they would receive.

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:06.569
Feeling betrayed by his own sons, and being the last

00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:10.239
one to hold onto his shares, Aldo eventually sold too.

00:15:10.969 --> 00:15:16.249
But it wasn’t easy for him; he told Maurizio it was like selling his own soul.

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:24.359
So by 1989, Maurizio was not only in full control of Gucci again, but he was the

00:15:24.369 --> 00:15:29.249
last of his family left in the company and free to make all the changes wanted.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:34.009
He closed many Gucci stores, ended franchises, and

00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:36.939
reduced the number of products that Gucci produced.

00:15:37.989 --> 00:15:42.819
He also brought in new designers and executives to give Gucci a fresh look.

00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:49.489
Unfortunately, that same year Maurizio and Sheree Loud’s relationship came to an end.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:53.439
But it didn’t take too long for Maurizio to find romance again.

00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:59.787
Just a year later, in 1990, he started dating interior designer Paola Franchi.

00:16:01.137 --> 00:16:06.083
Franchi had been a friend of Maurizio and Patrizia’s, and had even gone to their wedding.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.893
Patrizia was enraged, she was livid.

00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:14.343
Meanwhile, at Gucci, things weren’t going so well.

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:19.873
Maurizio was a reckless spender, both personally and professionally.

00:16:20.473 --> 00:16:24.983
His restructuring of the company had been expensive, and he’d

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:29.003
spent money on trivial things such as lavish new offices.

00:16:30.663 --> 00:16:35.733
This ate away at Gucci’s bottom line, and the finances were in the red.

00:16:36.643 --> 00:16:42.513
Investcorp no longer trusted Maurizio to run the company, and they wanted to buy him out too.

00:16:43.893 --> 00:16:49.573
Maurizio had also been taking out bank loans to help fund his extravagant personal life.

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:56.373
But with no way to pay back these loans, the banks also threatened to seize his shares.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.853
But Maurizio was not about to give up his ownership of Gucci

00:17:00.963 --> 00:17:05.033
that easily, so he decided to take out yet another loan.

00:17:06.273 --> 00:17:12.713
This time it was with a man called Delfo Zorzi, a suspected terrorist living in Japan.

00:17:13.813 --> 00:17:20.563
In exchange for tens of millions of euros, Maurizio promised Zorzi the rights to sell Gucci in Asia.

00:17:21.763 --> 00:17:25.833
Unfortunately for him, no amount of loans or dodgy dealings could

00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:31.473
save him, and in 1993 he finally sold his half of Gucci to Investcorp.

00:17:32.453 --> 00:17:37.213
This marked the end of the Gucci family’s involvement with the Gucci fashion house.

00:17:38.043 --> 00:17:43.813
Supposedly, this final exchange deeply angered Patrizia, his ex-wife.

00:17:44.703 --> 00:17:49.973
Perhaps she felt betrayed, as she’d always felt like a Gucci, or perhaps it

00:17:49.973 --> 00:17:54.133
was because she would never again be able to have influence in the company.

00:17:55.603 --> 00:17:58.803
But things were only going to get worse for Patrizia

00:17:59.123 --> 00:18:03.850
when, in 1994, Maurizio finally officially divorced her.

00:18:05.113 --> 00:18:09.913
In the settlement, Patrizia received property, a lump sum of millions

00:18:09.913 --> 00:18:13.853
of euros and a yearly allowance of hundreds of thousands of euros.

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:18.013
But to her, this was a “mere bowl of lentils”.

00:18:18.403 --> 00:18:19.153
She wanted more.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.523
Worse still, she was legally prohibited from using the Gucci name,

00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:28.493
although she never actually stopped referring to herself as a Gucci.

00:18:29.713 --> 00:18:31.853
And these issues were just the start.

00:18:32.673 --> 00:18:37.153
Maurizio, still not having learned his lesson, continued to burn through

00:18:37.153 --> 00:18:41.643
the money he’d received from selling his shares, spending lavishly and

00:18:41.803 --> 00:18:45.943
renovating his apartment with his new lover according to his expensive tastes.

00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:51.489
What’s more, rumour had it that Maurizio wanted to marry Paola.

00:18:52.213 --> 00:18:55.823
This threatened to reduce the payments Patrizia received from him.

00:18:56.323 --> 00:19:00.283
Plus, in her eyes, there was only room for one Mrs Gucci.

00:19:01.603 --> 00:19:06.573
But the pair never did marry, as in 1995 Maurizio Gucci

00:19:06.723 --> 00:19:10.736
was dead, lying in a pool of blood In front of his office.

00:19:11.756 --> 00:19:14.786
And this brings us back to the start of this episode.

00:19:15.356 --> 00:19:17.386
Who killed Maurizio Gucci?

00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:22.246
The first place the police looked was inside the Gucci family.

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:28.656
With all the in-fighting and battles for control, could Maurizio have been murdered in revenge?

00:19:29.656 --> 00:19:31.606
Paolo was an obvious suspect.

00:19:32.066 --> 00:19:35.866
After selling his shares, he had continued legal battles with

00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:39.916
Maurizio over the rights to design clothes using the Gucci name.

00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:43.636
But there was no evidence linking Paolo to the crime.

00:19:44.566 --> 00:19:49.986
Next, they looked at Zorzi, the suspected criminal with whom Maurizio had taken out a loan.

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:53.986
But they soon received evidence that he had paid

00:19:54.006 --> 00:19:56.986
off this loan in full, so there was no motive there.

00:19:58.026 --> 00:20:01.386
Luckily, the police received a very interesting tip-off.

00:20:02.156 --> 00:20:06.806
The concierge of a Milan hotel had bragged to a customer that

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:10.986
he’d been paid to help organise a hitman to kill Maurizio Gucci.

00:20:12.126 --> 00:20:13.566
And who had paid him?

00:20:14.686 --> 00:20:16.796
If you didn’t know, perhaps you’d guessed it.

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:19.906
It was Patrizia, Maurizio Gucci’s ex-wife.

00:20:20.676 --> 00:20:24.896
And the more the police investigated Patrizia, the more guilty she seemed.

00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:29.796
She had not exactly kept it a secret that she despised her ex-husband.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:33.926
After their divorce, she had left him threatening messages,

00:20:34.196 --> 00:20:37.876
in one even saying, “For you, it is hell to come.”

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:43.696
And even less subtly, she had asked just about everyone she knew whether they could

00:20:43.696 --> 00:20:48.726
help her dispose of her ex-husband, even talking about it with her divorce lawyer.

00:20:49.836 --> 00:20:52.926
Her behaviour after his death was suspicious, too.

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:58.766
On the day he died, she had written just one word in her diary: paradise.

00:20:59.856 --> 00:21:05.376
And, just three hours after he died, she had drawn up a notice to evict

00:21:05.436 --> 00:21:10.246
Paola, to kick Paola out from the apartment she had shared with Maurizio.

00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:16.786
She seemed too prepared for her ex-husband's death, almost as if she had known it would happen.

00:21:18.056 --> 00:21:24.233
The final, damning piece of evidence came after the police wire-tapped the hotel concierge’s car.

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:28.536
They caught members of the group who had helped plan and carry

00:21:28.536 --> 00:21:31.686
out the murder talking about their payment from Patrizia.

00:21:32.426 --> 00:21:35.246
They were unhappy with the amount she had paid them and

00:21:35.426 --> 00:21:39.176
were beginning to hatch a plan to extort more out of her.

00:21:40.296 --> 00:21:43.986
But before anything could come of it, the police turned up at

00:21:43.996 --> 00:21:48.646
Patrizia’s doorstep on the morning of the 31st of January 1997.

00:21:49.156 --> 00:21:50.726
They were there to arrest her.

00:21:51.986 --> 00:21:56.580
Seemingly calm and unsurprised by this, Patrizia had just

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.590
one thing she wanted to do before she was taken to prison.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.790
She had to go and put on a fur coat and fine jewellery.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.840
At her trial, she maintained her innocence.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.700
But, with 43 boxes of evidence presented against her, she was quickly

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.870
found guilty and sentenced to 29 years for arranging an assassination.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.190
In 2011, she actually got an early chance at freedom through what's called a

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.530
work-release programme, meaning you can get out of prison if you get a job.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.640
However, she turned this opportunity down, saying that she had never

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.670
worked a day in her life and she sure as hell wasn’t going to start now.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.060
Five years later she was finally released after serving 18 years.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:49.390
Despite her previous comments about never having had a job, she has even expressed an interest

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:56.140
in working for Gucci again because, according to her, she is “the most Gucci of them all.”

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:03.670
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the murder of Maurizio Gucci.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.130
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.770
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.860
Do you think that Patrizia’s sentence was too lenient, and she

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.620
would have been given a longer sentence if she wasn’t so wealthy?

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.200
Do you think that it was the money that corrupted the Gucci family, or was there something deeper?

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.080
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

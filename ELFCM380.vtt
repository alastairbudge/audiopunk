Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.329
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.449
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.259
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.169
about a man I imagine you might not have heard of.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.879
Although you might not have heard of him, you almost certainly

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:34.619
have bought something he sold, directly or indirectly.

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.149
And we’re not talking about Steve Jobs, or the boss of Nike, or anything like that.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.239
This man didn’t sell fancy phones, or trainers, or anything particularly luxurious.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.159
He sold something debatably more important.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:51.079
Oil.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.669
Today we are going to be talking about a man called Marc Rich, the

00:00:56.669 --> 00:01:01.119
secretive billionaire who would earn the nickname of The King of Oil.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.009
It’s a fascinating story that starts with an escape from the Nazis, takes

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.819
us to America and then brings together Iran and Israel, Fidel Castro,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.479
General Franco of Spain, Angola, Apartheid South Africa and Bill Clinton.

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:24.698
OK then, let’s get right into it and learn about Marc Rich, the King of Oil.

00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:32.228
January 20th, 2001 was a particularly busy day for Bill Clinton.

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:36.308
It was his last day in the Oval Office, it was his

00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:39.388
last day as President of the United States of America.

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:45.178
In less than 24 hours time, he would pass the mantle to George W.

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:49.958
Bush, and with it, his presidential powers would vanish into thin air.

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:55.708
One of the many perks of being President of the United States is that you have

00:01:55.708 --> 00:02:01.485
the power to pardon people, to absolve them of criminal charges against them.

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:06.978
As President, you can do this throughout your term, but your last

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:10.538
day in office is clearly the last opportunity you have to do this.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:17.058
Much like at school you or I might have waited until the night before the exam and then thought,

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:23.948
oh no, there’s a lot of work I need to do, I better get cracking, as far as pardons go, Bill

00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:29.728
Clinton left a lot to the last minute, he was a very busy man on his last day in office.

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:37.038
Over the course of his presidency, he pardoned 450 people, but almost

00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:42.038
a third of these people were pardoned on January 20th, on his last day.

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:48.288
There were pardons of relatively minor criminals, pardons which didn’t arouse much attention.

00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:53.238
There were pardons of more controversial criminals, like those of members of a

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:57.838
Puerto Rican paramilitary group that had set off bombs in New York and Chicago.

00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:06.888
But the most controversial pardon of all was of a 66-year-old man called Marc Rich.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:14.078
Rich didn’t stand accused of blowing anyone up, or of any kind of violent crimes.

00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:20.758
Since 1983 he had been on the run from the US authorities after having been

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:26.778
accused of wire fraud, tax evasion and breaking a trade embargo with Iran.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:33.448
He never returned to the United States, so he could never be convicted, but if

00:03:33.498 --> 00:03:39.458
he had been found guilty he would have been sentenced to up to 300 years in jail.

00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:47.388
He had been cast as an enemy of the state, yet in the days leading up to his pardon, politicians

00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:52.818
and lawyers from all over the world had petitioned the Clinton administration for a pardon.

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:58.118
In particular, pressure had come from Israeli politicians.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:04.461
The then Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak vouched for him, as did the

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:09.851
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert, who was then the Mayor

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.501
of Jerusalem but would go on to be the Prime Minister five years later.

00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.661
Powerful American tax lawyers had published reports

00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:20.941
suggesting that Rich wasn’t actually guilty of any crimes.

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:26.631
And what’s more, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise, had given

00:04:26.631 --> 00:04:29.651
more than a million dollars to the Democratic Party.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.451
With only hours to spare before the power to pardon

00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:37.891
would be forever stripped from him, it was announced.

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:41.661
Bill Clinton had issued an executive pardon.

00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:47.091
18 years later, Marc Rich was no longer a wanted man.

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:53.391
So, the question you are probably asking yourself is…who was Marc Rich?

00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:58.481
Was he really as bad as he was made out to be, and what did he do

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:03.081
to have three Israeli Prime Ministers personally vouch for him?

00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:09.191
His story is as fascinating as it is improbable.

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.991
It’s improbable as Marc Rich was lucky to have survived past childhood.

00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:23.531
He was born Marcell David Reich in 1934 in an orthodox Jewish family in Antwerp, in Belgium.

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.871
In May of 1940, the five-year-old Marcell Reich was shoved into a car

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:34.311
by his father as the family fled from the Nazi invasion of Belgium.

00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:38.191
The family successfully made it to France.

00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:43.661
If they had been any later, they would most likely have been in the six to ten

00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:48.251
thousand Jews that were rounded up in Antwerp and sent to concentration camps.

00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:53.071
Eventually the family made it to the United States, where they

00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:59.251
settled, and Marcell Reich became the more American-sounding Marc Rich.

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:06.921
Fast forward to 1954, and Rich got a job working at a company called Phillipp Brothers.

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.971
Phillipp Brothers was a large commodity trading company.

00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:17.151
What this meant was it bought and sold raw materials - metals,

00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:20.751
minerals, food stuffs, and natural resources.

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.211
Traders from Phillip Brothers would have relationships with companies

00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:28.951
all over the world that produced these goods, and they would buy

00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:32.031
them and sell them to other countries that needed to use them.

00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:37.991
This is called commodity trading, and Marc Rich would go on to

00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:42.831
become the undisputed king, world emperor, of commodity trading.

00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:49.121
But he started at the bottom, in the mailroom, sorting post.

00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:56.581
It wouldn’t be long before he would prove himself to be capable of much more, and two years

00:06:56.581 --> 00:07:03.391
later he was a fully-fledged trader, buying tin from Bolivia and selling it all over the world.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:10.641
This was in 1956, so it’s worth spending a couple of minutes reflecting

00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:14.601
on what was going on in the world around this time, and why it was

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:18.661
the perfect time for a person like Marc Rich to be getting started.

00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:22.101
So, what was going on?

00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:26.601
Well, great changes and instability the world over.

00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:31.141
The Cuban Revolution, the Cold War, the Suez Crisis,

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:35.531
decolonisation, and regime change all over the world.

00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:41.791
What’s more, this was in a period where communication was not easy.

00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:45.541
Telephone communication was expensive and often

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:48.531
connections were poor, especially in developing countries.

00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:53.991
The commercial fax machine wasn’t even invented until 1964, and of

00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:57.771
course we are almost 50 years away from email becoming widespread.

00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:04.171
This global instability and difficulty of communication was combined with the start

00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.691
of a period of global economic growth that has continued pretty much ever since.

00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.591
So, why was this good news for Marc Rich and his commodity trading colleagues?

00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:20.741
Well, Marc Rich was nominally in the business of buying and selling

00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:25.521
goods, originally tin, but then other metals, chemicals and raw materials.

00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:31.261
But he was really in the business of information and trust.

00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:38.521
He made money by buying something from someone and then selling it for more money to someone else.

00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:42.611
To do this effectively he needed to do several things.

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:47.741
For starters, he needed to know where to get that thing from

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:51.311
in the first place, he needed to know who would sell it to him.

00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:55.811
Then, he needed to persuade them to actually sell it to him.

00:08:57.141 --> 00:09:03.681
This might sound easy, but when you are talking about tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars

00:09:03.861 --> 00:09:08.930
worth of goods, the seller needs to trust that they are going to be paid on time, or at all.

00:09:10.286 --> 00:09:15.289
Thirdly, he needed to be sure that he could sell it for more money than he bought it for.

00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:21.499
Sometimes this was relatively simple, when he already had a buyer set up, so it

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:25.549
was merely a case of matching buyer and seller, and pocketing the difference.

00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:32.179
But where the real big money was to be made was on taking calculated risks

00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:36.719
that the price for something would go up dramatically after he had bought it.

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:44.109
This is where Rich came into his own, this is what really set Rich apart from his colleagues.

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:48.859
Yes, he was known as a very fast learner, very trustworthy,

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:53.299
and a very hard worker, working 16-hour days, 6 days a week.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:59.859
But his real skill was in his ability to spot the direction the world was heading.

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:07.269
In a fast-changing world with poor access to information, this would be pivotal to his success.

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:12.959
The first evidence of this was when he correctly predicted that global

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:17.589
demand for the element mercury would spike, it would increase dramatically.

00:10:18.489 --> 00:10:25.039
Mercury was increasingly used for batteries in military equipment, and Rich sensed that

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:30.039
the Cold war was hotting up and that countries would be investing in military equipment.

00:10:30.699 --> 00:10:36.119
He bought as much mercury as he could, and sold it for a large profit when the price rose.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:42.339
But his talents didn’t only consist of spotting money-making opportunities.

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:48.679
He had an uncanny knack for being able to arrange complicated deals between

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:53.739
multiple parties that didn’t just involve paying hard cash for a raw material.

00:10:54.829 --> 00:11:00.419
When he was transferred to Spain, to run the Madrid office, he made influential connections

00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:05.779
with the fascist regime, and he would be a valuable partner to Spain throughout his career.

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:12.169
He also started to travel all over South America sniffing out deals, earning himself

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:17.029
the reputation of a well-connected middleman who could facilitate trade between two

00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:22.049
countries that didn’t necessarily want to be seen doing business with one another.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:27.659
Probably the most surprising example of this is one that was revealed

00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:31.719
in a book about his life by the Swiss journalist Daniel Ammann.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:39.799
And that is of Rich helping arrange a deal between Israel and Iran in 1968

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:45.609
to construct an oil pipeline that ran from Eilat, a coastal city in the

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:50.339
south of Israel, through to Ashkelon, a port city in the Mediterranean.

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:58.059
To explain why this was important and surprising in equal measure, relations between Israel and

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:03.329
Iran were very tense at the time, even though they were slightly better than they are today.

00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:11.549
Iran officially wouldn’t deal with Israel, as being seen to do so would aggravate its allies.

00:12:12.619 --> 00:12:17.869
To sell its oil to Europe, Iranian tankers needed to pass through the Mediterranean.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:22.129
They had previously gone through the Suez Canal, but in

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:27.219
1967 Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian leader, closed it.

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:32.539
Iran needed to get its oil to the Mediterranean, but

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:36.409
its main route, via the Suez Canal, was now unusable.

00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:41.349
Israel, on the other hand, unlike most of its Arab neighbours,

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:45.489
has no oil reserves of its own, or at least basically none.

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:51.729
So secretly allowing Iranian oil to pass through its borders, and being

00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:56.179
able to buy a proportion of it as it went through, was a perfect solution.

00:12:57.449 --> 00:13:01.039
And it would be here, in fact, that Marc Rich would

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:03.629
make his name, and the beginnings of his fortune.

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:09.159
He had practically single-handedly invented what was called the spot market

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:14.029
for oil, meaning that oil could be sold at its price that day, rather

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:17.839
than be tied up in long-term contracts managed by state-owned companies.

00:13:18.609 --> 00:13:24.159
He was able to act as an intermediary, a middleman, someone who countries could

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:29.069
deal with and buy goods from while camouflaging the origin of those goods.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:34.229
I imagine it will interest our Spanish listeners to learn that Spain bought

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:39.079
oil that had been transported through this Israeli pipeline via Marc Rich,

00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:44.699
despite Spain having no formal diplomatic relations with Israel until 1986.

00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:52.479
But Spain needed oil, and Israel had it, or at least it was transported through Israel.

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:57.539
And Marc Rich was the man who was able to facilitate this through

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:01.899
his business and political contacts in Spain and in the Middle East.

00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:09.859
And on the subject of business and politics, for Marc Rich business was business,

00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:14.279
politics only entered into the world of business to facilitate a transaction.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:20.529
Time and time again, when other countries or companies avoided doing business in

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:25.889
a particular country because of its politics, this didn’t matter for Marc Rich.

00:14:26.859 --> 00:14:30.289
He had broken off from Phillip Brothers, his first and only

00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:35.979
employer in 1974, and set up his own company, Marc Rich + Co.

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:40.589
This gave him the ability to make a lot more money than as

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:44.129
an employee, and also the freedom to do whatever he wanted.

00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:50.659
He decided to base Marc Rich + Co in the small town of Zug, in Switzerland.

00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:54.759
This might sound like an odd choice.

00:14:55.369 --> 00:14:59.219
Marc Rich wasn’t Swiss, nor were his key business partners.

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:03.569
And Zug is in the middle of the Alps, it’s not exactly New York

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:07.299
or London, and it’s not close to a port or anything like that.

00:15:08.499 --> 00:15:12.129
But it would prove to be a very sensible choice.

00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:16.449
It was in Switzerland, a country famous for its neutrality,

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:20.399
a country not prone to sanctioning other countries.

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:27.829
For a business that made its money dealing with some pariah states, this was a clear advantage.

00:15:28.739 --> 00:15:31.779
Oh, and the very low tax rates didn’t hurt either.

00:15:32.789 --> 00:15:38.839
So, in 1974, Marc Rich + Co was founded, and within a couple of years the

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:43.279
business was making hundreds of millions of dollars of profit every year.

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:50.929
Rich and his business partners had an enviable black book of contacts, and over the space of a

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:57.079
few years he would supply tens of billions of dollars of commodities, mainly oil, to everyone

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:03.389
from Apartheid South Africa to Pinochet’s Chile, Angola to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:08.409
But it would be one deal in particular that would turn

00:16:08.409 --> 00:16:12.119
him from trading genius into public enemy number one.

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:18.119
And this brings us back to his old ally and business partner, Iran.

00:16:19.696 --> 00:16:25.789
To very briefly remind you of some Iranian history, from 1953 to 1979,

00:16:26.129 --> 00:16:31.499
Iran had been run by a Shah who was labelled as a puppet of the West, a

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:35.869
man who had been put back on the throne after an American-sponsored coup.

00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:40.674
Marc Rich had pretty good relationships with people in the Shah’s

00:16:40.704 --> 00:16:44.894
regime; he made a lot of money, as did his contacts in Iran.

00:16:46.324 --> 00:16:51.164
In 1979 there was the Iranian revolution, or Islamic Revolution,

00:16:51.604 --> 00:16:54.894
when the leaders of Iran turned their backs on the West.

00:16:55.984 --> 00:17:01.204
In November of the same year, November of 1979 a group of students

00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:05.254
attacked the US embassy in Tehran, taking American hostages.

00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:12.084
Why this is relevant for our story is that this led to American sanctions against Iran,

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:17.704
meaning that the US government forbade its citizens and companies from dealing with Iran.

00:17:18.964 --> 00:17:24.594
But Iran was a key partner for Marc Rich, even after the regime change.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.764
And Marc Rich was an American citizen.

00:17:28.824 --> 00:17:35.564
So what did Marc Rich do, did he obey US sanctions, and cut off all dealings with Iran?

00:17:36.734 --> 00:17:37.494
He did not.

00:17:37.884 --> 00:17:42.984
In fact, he increased his business with the now pariah state, and this is

00:17:42.984 --> 00:17:46.654
where the decision to base his company in Switzerland becomes important.

00:17:47.664 --> 00:17:54.404
There weren’t technically Swiss sanctions on Iran, so Marc Rich technically could do what he liked.

00:17:55.434 --> 00:18:01.604
Although Marc Rich the man was an American, Marc Rich + Co, the company,

00:18:02.134 --> 00:18:07.094
wasn’t an American company, so it didn’t have to abide by US laws.

00:18:08.014 --> 00:18:12.234
Now, legally this might have been fine, but from a public

00:18:12.264 --> 00:18:14.794
image point of view it would come back to haunt him.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.924
The American media would later portray him as a

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:22.404
billionaire businessman without an ounce of patriotism.

00:18:23.424 --> 00:18:28.714
Back in the United States there was an oil crisis, with prices skyrocketing

00:18:28.714 --> 00:18:32.374
and petrol stations not having enough petrol for American customers.

00:18:33.064 --> 00:18:38.611
And there was Marc Rich, an American citizen, dealing with a pariah

00:18:38.814 --> 00:18:42.414
regime and making hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

00:18:43.884 --> 00:18:46.704
But he would soon have bigger problems.

00:18:47.684 --> 00:18:54.464
In 1981 federal prosecutors received a tip-off about a massive tax fraud at his company,

00:18:54.974 --> 00:19:00.714
amounting to some 70 million dollars, something like 200 million Euros in today’s money.

00:19:01.744 --> 00:19:07.494
Now, the details of this tax evasion case are quite complicated and kind of boring.

00:19:08.094 --> 00:19:12.004
It all involves various different companies buying and selling oil

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:15.764
to each other to try to take advantage of US government regulation.

00:19:16.694 --> 00:19:18.934
You can look them up if you like, but you don’t need

00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:21.534
to know them in great detail to understand the story.

00:19:22.774 --> 00:19:26.944
The important thing to underline is that the US government went

00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:31.734
after Marc Rich, he fled to Switzerland and was never able to return.

00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:36.764
The case against him was led for several years by Rudy Giuliani,

00:19:37.124 --> 00:19:41.074
who you may remember as Donald Trump’s slightly eccentric lawyer.

00:19:42.534 --> 00:19:49.834
Back then Giuliani was a little less eccentric, but no less publicity savvy; he managed to turn

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:57.174
this case into front page news, and in so doing turn Marc Rich into public enemy number one.

00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:02.854
With the US government on his back, Marc Rich’s ability to run his business was

00:20:03.164 --> 00:20:08.494
significantly impacted, and he ended up having to sell it to his management team in 1994.

00:20:09.944 --> 00:20:15.474
Now, the terms of the deal have never been revealed, but it’s estimated that Marc Rich

00:20:15.594 --> 00:20:21.544
made $600 million personally from the sale, over a billion Euros in today’s money.

00:20:22.894 --> 00:20:28.524
Not bad going, but no amount of money would be able to get the US government off his back.

00:20:29.574 --> 00:20:30.404
Or would it?

00:20:31.644 --> 00:20:37.454
Throughout the 1990s there had been increasing pressure on Rich to return to the United States and

00:20:37.454 --> 00:20:42.774
face criminal charges, even with plots to capture him in Switzerland and bring him back by force.

00:20:44.234 --> 00:20:48.364
As a result, he had a team of ex-Mossad bodyguards who

00:20:48.364 --> 00:20:52.584
followed his every move, and there were several narrow escapes.

00:20:53.774 --> 00:20:58.254
It wouldn’t be until January 20th, of 2001, that he finally

00:20:58.254 --> 00:21:01.444
received the phone call that he'd been waiting almost 20 years for.

00:21:02.564 --> 00:21:06.704
President Clinton, with only a few hours left as “president”,

00:21:07.074 --> 00:21:10.934
had granted him clemency, he was no longer a wanted man.

00:21:12.474 --> 00:21:16.554
As you heard at the start of the episode, this was a controversial pardon.

00:21:17.574 --> 00:21:20.924
He was painted as a tax evading cut-throat businessman

00:21:21.214 --> 00:21:23.974
who broke sanctions and made billions in the process.

00:21:24.514 --> 00:21:27.614
If he could buy his way out, what example did this set?

00:21:28.937 --> 00:21:34.547
Now, I should stress that Marc Rich always claimed that he did nothing wrong, that he did not

00:21:34.547 --> 00:21:41.237
knowingly evade taxes, and there was no legal reason for his Swiss company not to trade with Iran.

00:21:42.707 --> 00:21:49.677
He died in June of 2013, almost exactly 10 years ago, leaving behind a complicated legacy.

00:21:50.937 --> 00:21:55.197
He was first and foremost a trader, a man who put together

00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:59.957
buyer and seller, asking few questions and casting no judgement.

00:22:00.817 --> 00:22:04.257
He was the man in the middle, simply providing a service.

00:22:05.677 --> 00:22:10.437
That service was an incredibly valuable one; it turned him into a billionaire.

00:22:11.805 --> 00:22:15.457
At his height, he controlled a large part of the world’s oil supply.

00:22:16.437 --> 00:22:22.907
If you drove in a car, train or aeroplane at any point from 1960 to the

00:22:22.907 --> 00:22:28.667
mid 1990s, there’s a high chance it was powered by oil sold by Marc Rich.

00:22:29.627 --> 00:22:35.967
Now, you might agree or disagree with his actions and methods, but you have

00:22:35.967 --> 00:22:41.177
to admit that nobody was more deserving of the nickname “The King of Oil”.

00:22:43.437 --> 00:22:49.597
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Marc Rich, the secretive oil billionaire that

00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:54.687
brokered deals with controversial regimes and got on the wrong side of the US justice system.

00:22:55.627 --> 00:22:58.817
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:59.257 --> 00:23:00.787
Had you heard of Marc Rich before?

00:23:01.417 --> 00:23:04.937
How much of a role does politics have to play in business today?

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:09.349
Do you think there is a case for someone like Marc Rich, a man who is prepared to

00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:13.727
do business with any country or regime, no matter what that country might be up to?

00:23:14.607 --> 00:23:17.877
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

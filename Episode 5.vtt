Hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.324
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:17.078
Today we are going to be talking about how countries win the world politics game without force.

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:25.513
We'll reveal why language is such a fantastic tool to project power across the world and what Donald

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:28.813
Trump is doing for US interests outside the US.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:36.673
Yes, it's time to learn about how soft power is a vital tool in the global diplomatic toolbox.

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:43.183
Before we head fully into this podcast, I just wanted to remind you that you can find the key

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:47.673
vocabulary and transcript for this podcast on Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:53.401
There's also a load of interesting material on the blog about how to learn English effectively with

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:56.911
podcasts, so that's well worth a look if you haven't done so already.

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:00.211
Okay, so soft power.

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:07.460
In the age of the self-proclaimed strong man where world politics is seen by some to be a zero sum

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.160
game, it's worth looking at one way in which countries have projected their power onto the world

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.250
through soft means.

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:21.157
We'll start by defining what soft power actually is and look at some examples of soft power.

00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:26.675
Then we'll talk about how countries have used this to their advantage and finish by discussing

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:29.545
whether it's actually really important after all.

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:33.874
Okay, so to begin with, what is soft power?

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:41.311
If you were to look up the phrase in a dictionary, you'd find the definition of soft power as 'a

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:46.081
persuasive approach to international relations', typically involving in the use of economic or

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:47.291
cultural influence.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:54.224
Really what it means is the ability of a country to influence other countries and other people

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:58.684
through influence and attraction as opposed to coercion.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.719
It's the opposite of hard power, which means a country getting its way by forcing another country to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.429
do something, normally military force of some kind, threats or sanctions.

00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:17.269
To give you a practical but basic example, if I'm a country and I want to expand my power by

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:25.209
increasing the number of people under my rule, I can either decide to use hard power and invade

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.889
another country with my army and conquer its people.

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:34.464
Or I could make my country seem so attractive and aspirational that people from another country

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:41.016
would want to just come and join it so I don't have to attack the other country if I want to get its

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.156
people to come and live in my country.

00:02:44.482 --> 00:02:50.902
The term was coined by Joseph Nye the Harvard political scientist in 1990 but he, by no means

00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:52.632
invented the concept.

00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:58.942
Countries have been engaged in soft power since the start of time, since the birth of nations.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.671
However, it has become more and more of a tool for a few reasons.

00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:10.437
Firstly, it's no longer quite so acceptable to just attack another country and steal what they have.

00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:17.757
While this might've been okay for Genghis Khan, and debatably actually still acceptable well into

00:03:17.757 --> 00:03:23.967
the 20th century, a country normally can't just invade another and expect to get away with it.

00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:32.111
To the majority of the world's population force and aggression isn't really considered aspirational

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:34.331
in the way that it once was.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.670
Secondly, in a globally connected world, soft power can actually spread very easily.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.880
It's much more effective in many ways than hard power, especially as it's often much cheaper as

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.290
countries can actually get their citizens to do the work for them.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.119
This has its own share of issues, which we'll come to in a bit.

00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:02.602
According to Nye, a country's soft power rests on three things.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:07.041
Its culture, so in places where it's attractive to others.

00:04:07.724 --> 00:04:12.349
Its political values, so when it lives up to them at home and abroad.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.034
And its foreign policies, so when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority.

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:23.503
Can you think of any examples of soft power?

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:31.585
Well, I guess that this podcast is indirectly at least a great example of British soft power.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:38.432
Language is one of the oldest and most powerful examples of a country exerting its soft power.

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:43.573
English has become the lingua franca for much of the modern world.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.693
This is, I imagine, one of the reasons that you are learning it.

00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:53.907
The fact that English has such a dominant position is great for the soft power of countries that

00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:54.517
speak English.

00:04:55.254 --> 00:05:01.451
It immediately makes them more attractive as destinations, as 20% of the world's population already

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:07.063
speak their language, and it gives their citizens an immediate advantage as English as their mother

00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:07.513
tongue.

00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:14.884
If you wonder why so many countries pour money into helping people learn their language, it's to

00:05:14.884 --> 00:05:17.624
make their country more accessible and more attractive.

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:23.899
Whether it's the BBC putting money into their language learning tools, which are great, by the way,

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:29.324
if you haven't checked them out or it's Deutsche Welle in Germany, these aren't just funded out of

00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:31.454
the goodness of the broadcaster's heart.

00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:35.484
They're there to project linguistic power all over the world.

00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:44.294
In fact, if you are wondering, which country is often considered to be the best at soft power, it's

00:05:44.574 --> 00:05:45.024
the UK.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.680
Does this come as a surprise?

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:57.885
Well, the UK is the 78th largest country in the world by land area and 21st by population, but it

00:05:57.885 --> 00:06:02.445
packs a sizable punch and is currently the sixth largest economy in the world.

00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.308
How?

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:09.378
It's not all down to soft power, of course, but it does play an important part.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:17.194
Things like the Royal family, the BBC, the Premier League, the Spice Girls, the English legal

00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:17.694
system.

00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:22.384
These are all parts of British soft power that are known all over the world.

00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:28.914
With the prevalence of the English language as well, the UK is firmly positioned as one of the

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:35.584
world's dominant soft power nations, even if economically it's likely to continue its gradual

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:37.084
decline in the world rankings.

00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:43.367
The UK, of course, has been a global or, or at least regional power for hundreds of years.

00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:50.077
Although colonisation was of course completely the opposite of soft power, what it has left behind

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:55.405
are institutions and laws that continue to project British soft power across the world.

00:06:57.113 --> 00:07:03.563
But the UK isn't the only country that has realized the power and the potential of soft power.

00:07:04.414 --> 00:07:10.060
I should also point out that in the 2019 soft power report, it has slipped into second place.

00:07:11.133 --> 00:07:17.505
France always ranked pretty highly in any league table of soft power and came top of the rankings

00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:19.105
for 2019.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:26.606
It has a strong cultural footprint with a history of philosophy, arts, film, and literature, and the

00:07:26.606 --> 00:07:32.676
French revolution has projected it as a strongly Republican country with values that anyone around

00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:34.106
the world can aspire to.

00:07:35.282 --> 00:07:38.112
Italy as well, has had a similar imprint on the world.

00:07:38.142 --> 00:07:43.722
Culturally, you can probably find an Italian restaurant, or at least someone who will sell you some

00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:46.262
sort of pizza almost anywhere in the world.

00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:50.687
And Rome remains one of the world's most popular cities for tourism.

00:07:52.295 --> 00:07:56.354
The US of course, has historically shown mastery of soft power.

00:07:56.837 --> 00:08:04.142
The idea of the American dream where anyone can make their way in society has attracted hundreds of

00:08:04.142 --> 00:08:10.298
millions of people from all over the world, and the success of American business and the projection

00:08:10.298 --> 00:08:16.430
of the American ideal through music, film, and literature just amplifies this message all over the

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:24.562
world, but also more recent world powers are just waking up to the importance of soft power and the

00:08:24.562 --> 00:08:26.758
power of a strong global image.

00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:34.236
China, for example, has of course historically been a great power, but always within a regional

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:35.016
context.

00:08:35.526 --> 00:08:41.701
It never really sought to expand this territory beyond what was deemed Chinese territory, at least

00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:49.941
in the way that European powers did in the past 30 years, China has really started to push its soft

00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:57.053
power agenda, funding institutes to learn Chinese around the world called Confucius institutes and

00:08:57.053 --> 00:09:03.113
then also providing an alternative to World Bank or IMF funding for countries all over the world,

00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:04.643
especially in Africa.

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:11.237
Many Middle Eastern states, especially those with relatively new-found oil wealth are trying to

00:09:11.237 --> 00:09:18.047
change the image, whether it's buying Premier League football clubs, acquiring Renaissance art, or

00:09:18.047 --> 00:09:24.404
investing in US technology startups many of the Gulf States are trying to portray themselves as

00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:31.364
enlightened modern states, despite a lot of their politics actually not really keeping up with this

00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:31.904
at all.

00:09:32.584 --> 00:09:38.950
Of course, being able to practically print money thanks to vast oil reserves makes this all a lot

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:45.176
easier, but soft power isn't something that any country can just switch on and off, even if they

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:47.806
have enough cash in the bank as we will come to in a bit.

00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:49.188
Okay.

00:09:49.248 --> 00:09:54.929
So we've established that soft power can be a pretty powerful tool and that countries are starting

00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:56.319
to invest heavily in it.

00:09:57.574 --> 00:10:03.964
But if soft power is such a powerful option in the diplomatic toolbox, then why isn't every country

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:07.024
just prioritising this as an initiative?

00:10:08.037 --> 00:10:10.287
Well, there are a few reasons.

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:12.577
Firstly, it takes time.

00:10:13.077 --> 00:10:16.477
It's a long game and results don't happen immediately.

00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:23.909
In an era when politicians are fighting for reelection and are only thinking in timeframes of under

00:10:23.909 --> 00:10:31.599
five years, for the most part, big soft power initiatives are unlikely to reap benefits during the

00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:33.119
politicians' time in office.

00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:39.336
Secondly, for the most part, it's not just something that can be turned on when you want it to,

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:41.916
especially from a cultural point of view.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:49.100
The great artists, filmmakers, writers and creators, they are a product of the society that they

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.710
grew up in.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.130
They're a product of the education they received, and the country can't just decide that it wants to

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.910
create a great artist or playwright and they just emerge.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.200
It's something that isn't controllable.

00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:08.538
Although of course you can foster the environment to help culture blossom, and of course it takes

00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:08.808
time.

00:11:10.229 --> 00:11:12.289
Thirdly, it's hard to measure.

00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:16.715
Politicians love soundbites and hard numbers.

00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:19.149
You know, GDP has increased by X percent.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.519
Unemployment has reduced by Y.

00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:29.324
Really investing in soft power initiatives isn't something that will give immediate results, as we

00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:30.094
already mentioned.

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:33.784
And even when it does, it's not an easy thing to measure.

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:37.305
And this is one of the reasons why it's so often ignored.

00:11:38.313 --> 00:11:43.123
One timely example is in the US under the presidency of Donald Trump.

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:50.267
His administration has been forthright in the fact that they are putting America first being hostile

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:56.677
towards immigrants compared to previous administrations and are demonstrating values that I think

00:11:56.677 --> 00:11:59.597
most people would struggle to argue are aspirational.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:08.090
When compared to Barack Obama, who was a hugely popular president outside the US, Donald Trump has

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.670
done a lot of damage to America's soft power.

00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:18.495
There was a survey of Europeans in September of 2019 and the results were pretty damning.

00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:27.443
Just 5% of Europeans said that they trust Donald Trump, and there are multiple reports that support

00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:32.293
the theory that he is doing severe damage to American soft power around the world.

00:12:33.077 --> 00:12:40.007
Indeed, in 2016 the US was ranked as the most powerful country in the world in terms of soft power.

00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:42.007
But by 2019.

00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:47.927
It had slipped down to fifth place below France, the UK, Germany, and Sweden.

00:12:49.397 --> 00:12:55.015
As a self-proclaimed strong man, he would likely say that he doesn't care, and the power of economic

00:12:55.015 --> 00:12:57.615
sanctions or the U S army is all that matters.

00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:01.903
However, history would certainly suggest this isn't completely correct.

00:13:03.176 --> 00:13:09.306
So in a world where so many politicians see hard power as the only method to get what they want,

00:13:09.896 --> 00:13:12.026
what does the future hold for soft power?

00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:16.672
Well, I want to close with two final points today.

00:13:17.407 --> 00:13:21.907
Firstly, the importance of soft power is far from over.

00:13:23.242 --> 00:13:28.692
While some politicians may be moving away from investing heavily in it right now.

00:13:29.192 --> 00:13:33.182
This is bound to come back and bite their countries in the long run.

00:13:33.977 --> 00:13:40.767
While investing in soft power - or rather the institutions that help foster soft power - today will

00:13:40.792 --> 00:13:47.844
pay dividends for years to come, not investing in soft power is just set to disadvantage future

00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:48.494
generations.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:55.498
The countries today with the strongest soft power are reaping the benefits from things that were set

00:13:55.498 --> 00:13:58.598
in motion tens or hundreds of years ago.

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:06.484
Secondly, this shift away from soft power by some larger countries, the US for example, has left a

00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:09.844
void and opportunities for other smaller countries.

00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:16.995
To give a practical example, Estonia, a country with a population of only 1.3 million, which only

00:14:16.995 --> 00:14:25.151
gained independence from the USSR in 1991 has recreated itself as a digital country and aspirational

00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:28.621
place for Europeans to move to or set up businesses.

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:36.239
This is reaping huge economic dividends as well with GDP growing almost 5% in 2017.

00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:43.161
Or Sweden, another relatively small European country, but one that packs a substantial soft power

00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:46.681
punch, especially with its focus on environmental protection.

00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:54.125
This just shows that smaller countries can play pretty effectively at the soft power table as well.

00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:58.275
It's not all about economic size and the amount of cash you have in the bank.

00:14:59.647 --> 00:15:00.157
Okay.

00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:04.297
I hope that this introduction to soft power has been interesting.

00:15:04.767 --> 00:15:09.747
It's a subject that I think is going to get more and more important, and the politicians who neglect

00:15:09.747 --> 00:15:13.507
it are taking a very short term and dangerous view.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.500
This podcast and the fact that every one of you is making an active effort to learn a language that

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.560
was native only to a small Island in northern Europe is testament to the power of soft power.

00:15:27.902 --> 00:15:34.012
As always, if you enjoyed the podcast, please do tell your friends, colleagues, classmates, family

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:36.622
members, or anyone who you think will be interested.

00:15:37.022 --> 00:15:40.002
The more people who listen well the better the podcast will get.

00:15:40.823 --> 00:15:45.926
If you're listening to this podcast on your favourite podcasting app, then please do take 30 seconds

00:15:45.926 --> 00:15:47.446
and think about leaving a review.

00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:53.133
Every review helps more people find out about the podcast, and as I said, that's a good thing for

00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:53.703
everyone.

00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:58.835
If you're looking for the key vocabulary or transcript, you can grab that on Leonardoenglish.com.

00:15:59.563 --> 00:16:04.873
I'll just leave you with this one soundbite from the former president of South Korea, the country

00:16:04.873 --> 00:16:07.363
that exported Gangnam Style all over the world.

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:11.574
"In the 21st century culture is power."

00:16:13.192 --> 00:16:18.002
I've been Alastair Budge and you've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:16:18.002 --> 00:16:18.362
English.

00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:20.392
I'll catch you in the next episode.

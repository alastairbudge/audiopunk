Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.160
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.119
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:25.260
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about salt.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.139
You might look at it as a simple white seasoning,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.209
something to add to your cooking to give it some flavour.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.699
But, as we’ll see, salt has played a fascinating role throughout history.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.219
And that’s what we’ll be exploring today.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.280
We’ll talk about how salt has started revolutions, how it featured in society, language, and

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.420
culture, and how this little rock changed the world in ways that you might find surprising…

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.301
OK then, the history of salt

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:03.241
Let me start this episode by asking you what might seem like a simple question.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.631
What does salt taste like?

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:14.471
It’s a taste that we all know; salt is a substance that is used in practically every cuisine

00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:20.481
worldwide, and it is now so cheap and plentiful that we all know what it tastes like.

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:28.051
But if you had to describe it to an alien, or someone with no taste buds, what would you say?

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:32.341
When I was thinking about this, my first thought was to

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:36.271
say “salty”, but clearly that’s not much help to anyone.

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:44.431
It is a strange thing, that a mineral that is so ubiquitous has a taste that is so hard to describe.

00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:53.321
But on the other hand, salt is elevated to a primary status where we describe things as “like salt”.

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:58.991
Salt has a taste, an instantly recognisable one at that, but

00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:03.291
it serves a greater purpose than adding its own salty flavour.

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:08.941
It intensifies other flavours, bringing out the taste of other ingredients in a meal.

00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.941
It can balance and soften flavours, helping a bitter

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.591
dish taste less bitter or a sweet dish taste less sweet.

00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:23.071
It is a miracle ingredient, something that can be found in

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:27.921
every kitchen, from Bogotà to Beijing, Stockholm to Samarkand.

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.951
And it is also now astonishingly cheap, so cheap that it’s something most

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:37.841
people will never think about reducing their use of because of its price.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:43.181
But, as you may well know, it has not always been this way.

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:49.431
There is a popular legend that Moorish merchants in the sixth century would

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:54.721
travel to subSaharan Africa where they could trade their salt for gold.

00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:57.251
The price was simple.

00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:06.581
One ounce of salt for one ounce of gold; a 1 to 1 trade, making salt as valuable as gold.

00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:13.481
There is some debate over whether that’s just an urban myth, whether salt was ever

00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:19.501
really on a par with gold, ounce for ounce, but what is undeniable is that salt’s

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:24.801
magical and multi-use properties, combined with the difficulty of obtaining it in

00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:30.231
certain areas of the world, this made it significantly more expensive than it is today.

00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:35.461
Now, before we move any further with the history of salt,

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.581
let’s just remind ourselves of what salt actually is.

00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:44.141
I mean, you know what it is and what it looks like; it is a white

00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.031
rock or crystal that can be ground down into a sort of powder.

00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:55.011
But to break it down even further, salt is a mineral made up of two chemical

00:03:55.021 --> 00:04:01.551
elements: Sodium and Chloride, and these two elements combine to form Sodium Chloride.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:06.711
What we know as salt will typically have some trace elements,

00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:11.281
some small amounts of other elements, but that is all it is.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.580
In terms of where salt comes from, it has two main sources:

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.130
Firstly, the sea, of course.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.670
Seas and oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface, and this water is salty.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.830
When the water evaporates, the salt doesn’t, so you are left with dry salt deposits.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.690
That’s one way of getting salt.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.370
Secondly, salt mines.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.380
Here, you don’t have the problem of having to separate the salt from

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.590
water, but you do have the problem that these deposits are often deep

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.330
underground, meaning that they are not particularly easy to reach.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.180
Yes, there are the above ground deposits of salt, but

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.400
these are far from sufficient to meet global demand.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.110
And this was the case even going back thousands of years,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.730
which brings us nicely onto the story of the history of salt.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.020
Now, this isn’t going to be an exhaustive chronological history, nor are we going to

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.750
try to cover every date in the history of salt, as there would simply be far too much.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.550
If you go back to the earliest archaeological discoveries, whether we are talking

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.390
about Europe, Africa or Asia, there is usually some evidence of people processing salt.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.730
Going back to 5400 BC in Bulgaria, there was a salt mine.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.520
There’s evidence of a salt pan going back to at least 6000 BC in Shanxi province, in northern China.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.180
Now, the reason to use salt back then was more than solely as a flavouring for food.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.830
It had a much more important role than that: food preservation.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.010
If you cover meat and fish in salt, as you will know, it doesn’t go bad, as the

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.540
bacteria that would otherwise grow can’t survive in a highly salty environment;

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.110
they die, so salted meat or fish can remain good to eat for several months.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.030
Clearly, this made salt an incredibly valuable tool for society, as it meant that you didn’t

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.090
have a window of only a few hours after catching or killing an animal before it went bad.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.290
It could be preserved with salt, taken on a trip, or simply stored for later use.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.600
But salt had another miraculous use.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.550
It was used as an antiseptic, to kill bacteria in a wound.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.610
For Roman soldiers who had suffered an injury in battle, a large cut

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.260
to the leg, let’s say, salt could be applied directly onto the wound.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.950
It would sting, sure, it would be very painful, but the salt would

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.830
kill the bacteria, preventing infection and helping the wound to heal.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.770
And, we’re not done quite yet; the uses of salt continue.

00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:12.197
We humans need salt in our diets to survive.

00:07:13.187 --> 00:07:17.467
Starting in the mid 20th century, there has been a bit of a backlash towards salt

00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:23.677
consumption, with doctors warning of the perils of a high salt diet, but there is one thing

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:29.917
that’s just as bad, or perhaps worse, than a high-salt diet, and that’s a no salt diet.

00:07:31.537 --> 00:07:35.917
Salt, in small amounts, around 500 mg per day according to the

00:07:35.917 --> 00:07:40.137
Harvard School of Public Health, it is essential for human survival.

00:07:41.887 --> 00:07:46.767
Someone who found this out the hard way was Napoleon Bonaparte, as when his

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:51.777
army was retreating from its ill-fated Russian campaign, it ran out of salt.

00:07:52.517 --> 00:07:59.217
Food couldn’t be preserved, and soldiers’ immune systems weakened due to their reduced salt intake.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:03.027
So, salt is a miracle mineral indeed.

00:08:04.227 --> 00:08:10.857
And as you might imagine, practically from the start of human civilization, salt was in high demand.

00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:17.257
Some of the earliest trade routes were based on the salt trade, with merchants travelling

00:08:17.257 --> 00:08:22.087
from areas where salt could be easily found to areas where salt was harder to come by.

00:08:23.577 --> 00:08:28.723
If you are an Italian and you’ve driven the Strada Statale 4, the highway

00:08:28.723 --> 00:08:34.373
number 4 you might know that this also goes by the name “Via Salaria”, the

00:08:34.383 --> 00:08:39.183
Salt Road, an ancient Roman trade route based on the transport of salt.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:45.393
Salt was the quintessential commodity; something that everyone wanted,

00:08:45.653 --> 00:08:50.233
was easy to value, because you could simply weigh it, didn’t go bad,

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:55.203
and the only difficulty was transporting it from one place to another.

00:08:56.753 --> 00:09:00.913
Given its ubiquity and high demand, there are many instances

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:04.143
of salt becoming the subject of high government taxes.

00:09:04.943 --> 00:09:11.453
After all, it was an easy target: easy to measure and something that people couldn’t live without.

00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:17.763
Perhaps the most famous example of a tax on salt will be well-known

00:09:17.763 --> 00:09:21.830
to a French listener, and that was something called La Gabelle.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:27.899
This started off in the Middle Ages as a tax on a collection of different

00:09:27.929 --> 00:09:33.639
agricultural products, but was changed to be a tax only on salt.

00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:40.689
Now, you might think that a tax on salt is nothing to write home about, it’s an unimportant

00:09:40.739 --> 00:09:46.409
part of history, but in the case of La Gabelle, nothing could be further from the truth.

00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:52.639
French people had to live with this tax from the 14th century.

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:56.359
And it was loathed, it was hated.

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:01.109
Different regions of France paid different levels of

00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:05.359
taxes on salt, leading to huge regional differences.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:14.681
According to one report, in 1790 the price of a large bag of salt could vary from 31 sous

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:21.579
in Brittany, in Northern France, but if you went to Berry just a few hundred kilometres

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:30.279
further south, you would pay 611 sou, 20 times as much, for exactly the same salt.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:36.449
What’s more, the richest in French society had all sorts of exemptions

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:40.849
from this tax, leaving the peasants to pay these high prices.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:46.249
And in fact, dissatisfaction over La Gabelle is thought to

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:49.449
have been one of the main catalysts for the French Revolution.

00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:54.949
Of course, the French Revolution didn’t happen only because French salt was

00:10:54.949 --> 00:11:01.279
too expensive, but the tax was so universally loathed and unfair that it

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:05.389
certainly didn’t help with social unity and faith in the French monarchy.

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:13.339
Salt would also come to play another important role across the Atlantic, in the American Revolution.

00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:20.979
As we heard earlier, salt was critical for preserving food and as a basic antiseptic.

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:27.909
British forces tried to block off deliveries of salt to the American revolutionary forces,

00:11:28.329 --> 00:11:34.109
knowing full well that this would be as damaging to the Americans as a heavy military defeat.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:40.159
The result of this was an increase in salt smuggling, and an increase

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:44.169
in domestic production, and of course the Americans proved victorious

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:48.529
in their revolution, thankfully not completely running out of salt.

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:55.349
Now, as you can see, salt throughout history has been much more than a mere

00:11:55.359 --> 00:12:00.159
seasoning; it dictated trade routes, played an important medical function,

00:12:00.729 --> 00:12:06.089
was a large source of revenue for nations, and had a hand in revolutions.

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:14.519
Given its role in so many elements of life and history, it has left a lasting mark on language too.

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:19.739
So given that this podcast is all about learning English, we are going

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:24.279
to talk about some words and expressions related to salt in English.

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:29.179
Several of these expressions might be exactly the same as in your

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:32.959
language, but it is interesting to learn about them nonetheless.

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:40.559
Salary is perhaps the best known word that comes from salt, and this comes from

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:45.959
the Latin salarium, which was the allowance given to Roman soldiers to buy salt.

00:12:47.512 --> 00:12:52.242
Salad is a word that you might not have known comes from salt, but it does.

00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:57.422
It comes from the Latin word “sal”, meaning salt, and if you’re

00:12:57.422 --> 00:13:01.912
wondering why the two are linked, it was because salad was eaten salted.

00:13:03.542 --> 00:13:07.002
Now, moving on to expressions that you might hear in English,

00:13:07.502 --> 00:13:11.122
the first is to say that someone is “worth their salt”.

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:17.452
This means that someone is good at their job in a way that is expected, so

00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:21.972
you might say, “any English teacher worth their salt would be able to explain

00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:26.512
the difference between it’s with an apostrophe and its without an apostrophe”.

00:13:27.982 --> 00:13:31.162
And if you are wondering where this comes from, it’s thought to

00:13:31.172 --> 00:13:35.232
come from Ancient Rome, where salt would be a part of your salary.

00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:38.902
So if you weren’t worth your salt, it meant that you weren’t

00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:41.512
good at your job, you weren’t deserving of your salary.

00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:47.922
Our next expression is “salt of the earth”, which means someone who is a

00:13:47.962 --> 00:13:53.282
very kind and good person, someone trustworthy and honourable, and someone

00:13:53.422 --> 00:13:56.566
who does not try to pretend to be anything other than what they are.

00:13:58.072 --> 00:14:02.182
You might know the origin of this already, as it’s an expression that exists

00:14:02.192 --> 00:14:07.272
in several other languages, but if you don’t, it actually comes from the Bible.

00:14:08.192 --> 00:14:11.892
In Jesus’s sermon on the mount, in the Gospel of Matthew,

00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:16.432
Jesus tells his disciples, "You are the salt of the earth.”

00:14:18.032 --> 00:14:23.132
And you can use it in English in a completely non-religious way, you can refer

00:14:23.182 --> 00:14:29.702
to someone as “salt of the earth”, saying “Oh, Jim, he’s real salt of the Earth”,

00:14:30.242 --> 00:14:36.362
meaning that Jim is honest, trustworthy and not proud; he is a good, humble man.

00:14:37.692 --> 00:14:42.602
And finally, our third expression is one that you might know, but it’s a good one.

00:14:43.322 --> 00:14:48.652
And that is to “take it or take something with a pinch of salt”, or

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:53.082
in the US it’s more common to hear “take it with a grain of salt”.

00:14:54.182 --> 00:14:58.793
A grain means a single piece of salt, and a “pinch” means a small amount.

00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:04.082
The two expressions mean the same thing, and if you take something

00:15:04.082 --> 00:15:07.842
with a pinch or a grain of salt, you do not take it seriously.

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:12.662
So, you might say to a colleague, “the boss said that we would all be getting

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:16.902
pay rises and extra holiday this year but I’d take that with a grain of salt”.

00:15:18.604 --> 00:15:23.984
In terms of where this expression comes from, its origins are slightly more murky and

00:15:24.144 --> 00:15:31.664
debated, but one theory has it going all the way back to Pliny the Elder in 77AD, who

00:15:31.724 --> 00:15:36.924
translated a recipe for an antidote to poison, which included a small amount of salt.

00:15:38.474 --> 00:15:43.784
In any case, the original meaning has changed significantly, and you can find people

00:15:43.784 --> 00:15:49.174
in English speaking countries using this expression in a decidedly non-medical setting.

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:54.914
So, there we have it, a brief salty history of one of, if

00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:58.224
not the most important mineral in the history of the world.

00:15:59.074 --> 00:16:04.804
So next time you sit down for dinner, take your first mouthful, and think, “hmm, this

00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:09.724
dish needs a little salt”, and you reach for that little white container, well you’ll

00:16:09.724 --> 00:16:13.994
know a little bit more about the history of “The Most Precious Rock In The World”.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:20.434
OK then, that is it for today's episode on salt.

00:16:20.774 --> 00:16:23.844
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:27.434
As always, I'd love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:31.184
What words or expressions come from salt in your language?

00:16:31.744 --> 00:16:33.014
How would you describe salt?

00:16:33.624 --> 00:16:38.744
And here’s a trickier one to think about: how would the world be different were there no salt?

00:16:39.394 --> 00:16:42.384
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:16:42.854 --> 00:16:45.414

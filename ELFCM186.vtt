Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:16.746
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:21.156
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:29.759
I'm Alastair Budge and today is the start of another mini-series, this time on Scottish Heroes.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.519
In part one, today’s episode, we are going to be talking

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:38.539
about William Wallace, the Scottish freedom fighter.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:46.419
Then in part two, we are going to talk about Mary Queen of Scots, probably the best

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:53.029
known woman in Scottish history, and one who met a tragic end at the hands of her cousin.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.499
And finally, in part three we will meet Bonnie Prince Charlie, another revolutionary

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.769
leader who has gone down in Scottish history for his fight against the English.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:11.189
Throughout this mini-series you’ll notice some common themes.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.319
Constant battles against the English being the main one, but also conflicts

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:22.399
within Scotland, the role of women, developing military tactics, Protestantism vs.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.399
Catholicism, the French, quite how interrelated the European royal

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.619
families were and how a lot of these conflicts were very, very bloody.

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:39.569
All of these episodes have been a huge amount of fun to make, so I hope you’ll enjoy them.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.089
Before we get right into today’s episode though, let me remind you that you can

00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:32.942
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:37.092
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:39.412 --> 00:02:41.872
OK then, William Wallace.

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:51.163
If you were in London on August 23rd 1305, almost exactly 716 years before

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:55.588
this episode will be released, you might have witnessed a brutal event.

00:02:56.548 --> 00:03:01.668
A man was stripped naked, his feet tied together with a rope.

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:08.228
The rope was tied to 5 horses, which dragged the man 6

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:11.758
kilometres through the hard, cobbled streets of London.

00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:18.598
As he was being dragged along the streets, his head bumping up and down on the hard

00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:25.158
stones, crowds of people shouted at him, throwing stones and rotten vegetables.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:31.226
When he arrived at his final destination, an area of the city called Smithfield,

00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:37.678
the rope was cut, and the half-conscious man was dragged up onto a stage.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:46.058
From there, a rope was tied around his neck, he was pulled up, and hung until he was half dead.

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:53.058
But instead of being left there to die, he was cut down, and placed on a table.

00:03:53.847 --> 00:04:00.567
If he was still conscious, he would have seen the executioner’s knife come down on his chest,

00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:08.807
and his heart, stomach, liver, lungs and testicles removed and thrown on a burning fire.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:14.783
His head was then cut off, and put on a pole on London Bridge.

00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:19.333
The rest of his body was cut into four pieces and

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:23.273
sent to four different towns in England and Scotland.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:26.793
That man’s name was William Wallace.

00:04:27.753 --> 00:04:32.183
Now, I appreciate that this was quite a graphic description that you

00:04:32.183 --> 00:04:36.473
might not have been expecting, and I apologise if you were eating your

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:42.363
breakfast, but the brutality of it does help us understand several things.

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:47.093
Firstly, quite how bloody life was back then.

00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:51.793
And secondly, most importantly, quite how much of a

00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:55.963
threat this man was considered to be by the English king.

00:04:57.003 --> 00:05:01.933
So, to tell the story of William Wallace, and in fact to tell the

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:07.533
stories of the protagonists in every episode in this mini-series, we are

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:12.823
going to split it into several parts, with a bonus section at the end.

00:05:13.823 --> 00:05:17.753
We will start by talking about the life of our protagonist,

00:05:17.973 --> 00:05:20.733
then we’ll talk about their fight with England.

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:25.553
In every case, their lives and stories are pretty

00:05:25.553 --> 00:05:29.260
closely intertwined with a struggle against England.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.510
Then, we’ll talk about how they are remembered in Scotland, and their influence after their death.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.140
And in every part of this mini-series, we will end with a

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.000
few unusual and surprising facts about our main characters.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.750
In this first episode, to help set the scene for the entire series, I’ll

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.480
start by painting a brief picture of Scotland as a part of the British Isles.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.450
You may well know some of this already, but it’s helpful to be reminded of it.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.580
Scotland is the country at the north of the British Isles.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.370
It’s almost exactly 60% of the size of England from a geographical area point of view, and

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:25.180
about a third of this is what’s called The Highlands, a beautiful area of hills and mountains.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.730
The majority of the Scottish population, which has always been significantly smaller

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.580
than the English, lives to the south of the country, close to the border with England.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.490
And talking about the border, there is a direct land border with England.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.920
It’s about 150km long.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.620
The Romans built a wall in 122AD to try to keep out invaders from the

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.390
north, but since they left there has basically been no real physical border.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.780
Now, coming back to our story of William Wallace, not a huge amount is known

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:11.340
for sure about his early life, and separating William Wallace “the man” from

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.460
William Wallace “the legend” is a task that historians are still working on.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.950
We believe that he came from a relatively upper middle-class family, of Welsh descent.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:31.780
Indeed, Wallace comes from “of Wales”, so he probably had Welsh ancestors.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.800
When he was growing up, there was no fight with England.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.840
There was a Kingdom of Scotland which was ruled by a man named Alexander III.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:50.960
Unfortunately, Alexander died in 1286, when Wallace was around 16 years old.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:57.820
Alexander’s granddaughter, a girl called Margaret, Maid of Norway was his heir.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.100
But there were two problems with Margaret, which caused a third problem.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.932
Firstly, she was only 3 years old when Alexander died.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.190
Secondly, she lived in Norway.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.160
And the third problem was that she was sent from Norway

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.320
to Scotland to be crowned queen, but she died on the way.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:28.190
With no clear next king or queen, Scotland was thrown into a crisis.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.460
There was disagreement between the Scottish lords about who should become

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.920
the next leader, and it looked like civil war was about to break out.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:47.110
To avoid this, the King of England, King Edward I was invited to help with the succession.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:54.870
But, Edward I was power-hungry, and he saw this as an opportunity

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.830
to enlarge his territory, and take Scotland for himself.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:06.240
He quickly ordered the Scottish lords to recognise him as their leader.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.790
The Scottish lords wouldn’t have this, and instead

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.870
recognised a man named John Balliol as their king.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.800
But Balliol was weak, he didn’t have the support required from the entire

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.025
Scottish nobility, and he grew weaker under constant pressure from Edward I.

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:35.170
At the time that this was all happening, a young man was starting to make a name for himself.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.910
William Wallace was in his early 20s, and had started to

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.620
develop a reputation as a fierce hater of the English.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.100
There is a legend that one day Wallace was fishing in a Scottish river.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.850
He was approached by a group of five English soldiers,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.500
who demanded he give them the fish he had caught.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:06.150
He offered them part of them, part of the fish, but not all of them.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.710
The English soldiers were furious, how dare a Scotsman answer

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:17.290
back to them, and one drew his sword, ready to attack Wallace.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.300
Wallace wasn’t armed, he didn’t have a sword, but he managed to hit one of the English

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:31.360
soldiers with his fishing rod, snatch his sword, and killed two of the other soldiers.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:38.910
This incident has actually given the name to a Scottish plant, a “Bickering Bush”.

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:43.553
To bicker means to argue, and legend has it that this

00:10:43.613 --> 00:10:48.163
particular bush grew where Wallace had this famous argument.

00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:55.813
Wallace’s hatred of the English grew even stronger when he heard about how Edward I was

00:10:55.823 --> 00:11:02.553
marching north to invade Scotland, and had committed brutal attacks on Scottish towns.

00:11:03.593 --> 00:11:08.263
In particular, there was an account of an attack on a town called Berwick,

00:11:08.443 --> 00:11:13.673
which is now in England but used to be in Scotland, where King Edward ordered

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:18.783
for men, women and children to be slaughtered by his English soldiers.

00:11:19.473 --> 00:11:23.603
Wallace started to raise support to fight the English, and

00:11:23.763 --> 00:11:28.683
before long his small militia had turned into a small army.

00:11:29.703 --> 00:11:34.403
In September of 1297 his army was to be put to its first

00:11:34.413 --> 00:11:39.303
real test outside the town of Stirling, in central Scotland.

00:11:40.073 --> 00:11:45.323
Wallace’s army waited on one side of the river as the English army approached.

00:11:46.143 --> 00:11:50.503
The Scottish army was significantly smaller than the English,

00:11:50.683 --> 00:11:55.653
with around 5 or 6,000 men to the English army’s 9,000.

00:11:56.563 --> 00:12:00.993
It was also, unlike the English army, not a professional one.

00:12:01.853 --> 00:12:07.593
But on Wallace’s side was a deep knowledge of the local terrain, of the

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:13.403
land around him, and the mentality of a revolutionary freedom fighter.

00:12:14.743 --> 00:12:20.373
As the English approached the river, they had to go across a narrow bridge,

00:12:20.393 --> 00:12:25.573
a bridge that could only manage two soldiers side by side at one time.

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:34.463
On the other side of the bridge was what’s called a bog, a marshland, an area of very wet grass.

00:12:35.563 --> 00:12:41.433
Traditional battle etiquette, traditional military manners, would dictate that

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:46.563
the English would be allowed to cross the bridge, to go to the decided battle

00:12:46.563 --> 00:12:53.163
location, to line up across from the Scots, and only then the battle would start.

00:12:54.352 --> 00:12:59.663
But William Wallace didn’t care for manners, he didn’t play by the rules.

00:13:00.053 --> 00:13:05.923
Wallace waited until just enough English soldiers had crossed the bridge,

00:13:06.303 --> 00:13:12.543
then his troops charged at them and pushed them onto the boggy, wet ground.

00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:16.783
The soldiers couldn’t go back across the bridge, they were

00:13:17.053 --> 00:13:22.863
stuck, and 5,000 of the 9,000 English soldiers were killed.

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:28.773
Wallace was hailed as a military genius - he had beaten the English

00:13:28.783 --> 00:13:34.083
army, and he became the face of the battle for Scottish independence.

00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:40.053
He was rewarded with the position of Guardian of Scotland, which was

00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:45.203
essentially the role of protecting the country while a new king was found.

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:51.033
Energised by this victory, Wallace’s army moved south, and

00:13:51.103 --> 00:13:55.043
continued to fight against any English settlements he found.

00:13:56.043 --> 00:14:00.373
There are some truly terrible stories here about burning

00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:05.723
monasteries, raping women, and killing civilians in brutal ways.

00:14:06.273 --> 00:14:13.173
But these accounts mainly come from English sources, who were of course trying to portray

00:14:13.213 --> 00:14:18.823
William Wallace as a tyrant and a criminal, rather than a legitimate military leader.

00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:24.713
King Edward I of England was in France fighting the French at the time.

00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:32.873
When he heard the news he was furious, and set off personally to defeat Wallace.

00:14:33.683 --> 00:14:39.793
As the English armies headed north, Wallace retreated and burned everything on

00:14:39.793 --> 00:14:45.293
his way back, trying to make it harder for the English armies to find supplies.

00:14:46.183 --> 00:14:49.713
But the English army was professional, they weren’t going

00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:53.663
to stop just because Wallace had made life harder for them.

00:14:54.223 --> 00:14:57.113
Plus, they were thirsty for revenge.

00:14:57.983 --> 00:15:04.703
In July 1298, A year after the glorious victory at Stirling, Wallace’s army

00:15:04.893 --> 00:15:10.083
again faced the English at a town called Falkirk, just south of Stirling.

00:15:11.273 --> 00:15:14.793
This time, the Scottish army did not fare so well.

00:15:15.943 --> 00:15:16.493
The reason?

00:15:17.273 --> 00:15:21.130
The English army had started using something called the longbow,

00:15:21.393 --> 00:15:26.613
a bow that allowed archers to fire arrows great distances.

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:31.923
This weapon is often called the machine gun of the Middle Ages.

00:15:32.503 --> 00:15:36.423
An archer could fire it quickly, the arrows could go

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:40.963
great distances, over 300 metres, and they were deadly.

00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:47.003
Wallace’s army learned this the hard way, and 2,000 Scottish

00:15:47.003 --> 00:15:52.013
soldiers were slaughtered as the arrows rained down from the sky.

00:15:53.043 --> 00:16:00.723
Wallace managed to escape with his life, but his reputation as a military genius was in tatters.

00:16:01.873 --> 00:16:06.433
With his army partially destroyed, and support reduced,

00:16:06.663 --> 00:16:10.113
he was stripped of his title of Guardian of Scotland.

00:16:11.453 --> 00:16:15.783
While the military fight might have been over, he took to

00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:19.933
diplomacy to try to continue his quest for independence.

00:16:20.653 --> 00:16:26.213
There are records of him going to France and even Rome to try to get

00:16:26.213 --> 00:16:31.533
support for Scottish independence, but to no avail, he had no luck.

00:16:32.443 --> 00:16:37.253
He was still a symbol of Scottish freedom though, of

00:16:37.383 --> 00:16:42.383
Scottish independence, and King Edward I wanted him dead.

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:48.993
He promised great rewards for anyone who would give him Wallace, but for 7 years

00:16:49.173 --> 00:16:55.193
Wallace managed to evade capture, travelling throughout Scotland and France and Italy.

00:16:55.903 --> 00:16:58.793
But he couldn’t escape the English forever.

00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:04.623
The reward for his capture was too tempting, and indeed Wallace

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:09.873
was betrayed by one of his own, he was betrayed by his own servant.

00:17:10.723 --> 00:17:17.423
On 5 August 1305 Wallace was captured while he was sleeping, and taken to London.

00:17:18.593 --> 00:17:24.803
He was given a show trial, he was charged with the crime of high treason,

00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:29.413
and well, you heard at the start of the episode what happened next.

00:17:30.453 --> 00:17:35.343
So, that is the life of William Wallace, and of his fight with the English.

00:17:35.843 --> 00:17:41.643
His impact since his death has been vast, and it is rare for any

00:17:41.783 --> 00:17:46.403
discussion of Scottish independence to not mention William Wallace.

00:17:47.163 --> 00:17:52.173
Going back to the aftermath of his death, he set the wheels in motion for

00:17:52.173 --> 00:17:57.323
the subsequent Scottish Wars of Independence, and his fight was continued by

00:17:57.333 --> 00:18:02.703
Robert The Bruce, a Scottish nobleman who was to repeat Wallace’s success at

00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:07.611
Stirling Bridge with another epic victory over the English at Bannockburn.

00:18:08.393 --> 00:18:12.893
There is a huge monument to William Wallace on a hill in

00:18:12.903 --> 00:18:17.073
Stirling, which you can see from the main road driving north.

00:18:17.943 --> 00:18:21.403
And his story is taught in every Scottish school.

00:18:21.863 --> 00:18:27.293
I actually grew up in Scotland, and lived there until I was 13, and the story

00:18:27.303 --> 00:18:32.033
of William Wallace was one of the first ones we learned in history class.

00:18:32.723 --> 00:18:37.403
It really is hard to find any other individual that has such a

00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:42.383
strong hold over the Scottish national psyche as William Wallace.

00:18:42.843 --> 00:18:48.333
The characters we’ll hear about in parts two and three of this mini-series are

00:18:48.333 --> 00:18:54.323
also important, but when it comes to Scottish independence, William Wallace is

00:18:54.323 --> 00:18:59.533
the original freedom fighter, the original campaigner for Scottish independence.

00:19:00.393 --> 00:19:05.513
Now, to conclude this episode with some weird or unusual facts.

00:19:06.303 --> 00:19:09.033
You might have noticed that I haven’t said the word

00:19:09.103 --> 00:19:13.093
Braveheart once during this episode, until now that is.

00:19:13.793 --> 00:19:20.803
William Wallace is of course the inspiration for the 1995 movie with Mel Gibson, Braveheart.

00:19:21.503 --> 00:19:26.023
The film did a lot to raise awareness of the story of William Wallace,

00:19:26.243 --> 00:19:31.303
although there is a lot of the film that is completely inaccurate, and large

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:36.773
parts of it that come from legends still slightly doubted by historians.

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:42.883
For example, in the film the main reason to rebel against the

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:46.793
English is because Wallace’s wife is killed by an Englishman.

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:52.873
There are some accounts of this in different stories that came years after

00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:57.093
Wallace died, but there isn’t much evidence for it actually being true.

00:19:58.103 --> 00:20:01.143
It does make a good story though, and if you haven’t

00:20:01.143 --> 00:20:04.523
seen it, Braveheart is certainly a fun film to watch.

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:07.843
Although I wouldn’t rely on it for historical accuracy.

00:20:08.893 --> 00:20:14.093
And our final unusual fact about William Wallace is that he was incredibly

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:19.253
tall, and accounts have him standing at over 2 metres in height.

00:20:20.243 --> 00:20:24.473
Given that the majority of the population would have been significantly

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:29.793
smaller than we are now, this really must have made him seem like a real giant.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:35.023
And interestingly, his arch nemesis, and the man who had him

00:20:35.023 --> 00:20:39.433
killed, King Edward I of England, was also known for his height.

00:20:40.053 --> 00:20:44.613
He was nicknamed Edward Longshanks - a shank is another

00:20:44.613 --> 00:20:50.026
name for a leg - and he was reportedly almost 190cm tall.

00:20:51.523 --> 00:20:56.433
So, there we have it, the most famous freedom fighter in Scottish

00:20:56.433 --> 00:21:01.283
history, and his almost 10 year campaign for Scottish independence.

00:21:02.103 --> 00:21:11.213
He was killed 23 years before independence was to be achieved again, in 1328, but it is arguably

00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:17.093
the fact that he fought so bravely against the English, and was killed because of it, that

00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:24.428
turned him into a legend, and has continued to unite and inspire the Scottish people ever since.

00:21:26.528 --> 00:21:32.938
OK then, that is it for today's episode on William Wallace, the Scottish freedom fighter.

00:21:33.598 --> 00:21:39.168
As a reminder, this is part one of a three-part mini-series on Scottish Heroes.

00:21:39.618 --> 00:21:44.058
Next up, part two, our members-only episode will be on Mary Queen

00:21:44.088 --> 00:21:49.218
of Scots, the woman who was made queen when she was only 6 days old.

00:21:49.688 --> 00:21:53.488
And then part three will be on Bonnie Prince Charlie, the

00:21:53.488 --> 00:21:57.868
man who was either a Scottish Legend or an Italian Coward.

00:21:58.598 --> 00:22:02.238

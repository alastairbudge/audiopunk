Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.879
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.119
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:27.443
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series on crime and punishment.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.269
In case you missed them, in part one we talked about the history of crime

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.609
and punishment in Britain, from trials by ordeal through to The Bloody Code.

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:44.579
In part two we did a deep dive into the history of capital punishment, and looked at the history of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.959
the death penalty right from its earliest years through to public opinion of it in the 21st century.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:57.239
And in today’s episode, part three, we are going to be talking about the history of prisons.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.249
Being locked away might now be the most common punishment for breaking the

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:07.368
law, but prisons, in their current form, are a relatively modern invention.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:12.888
So in this episode we’ll learn more about the history of prisons, from their early

00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:17.798
beginnings as places to temporarily hold suspected criminals through to the modern

00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:22.594
day, when there are more people imprisoned around the world than ever before.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.717
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about prisons.

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:35.117
In Alexandre Dumas’ 1844 masterpiece, The Count of Monte Cristo,

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:40.407
the story starts with the imprisonment of a 19-year-old man.

00:01:41.307 --> 00:01:47.717
His name is Edmond Dantès, and the place of his incarceration is the notorious Château

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:53.407
d'If, a tiny fortified island, a few kilometres away from Marseille in southern France.

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:59.497
Dantès has been falsely accused of being a supporter of Napoleon

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:04.677
Bonaparte, and he is thrown into this seemingly inescapable prison.

00:02:06.077 --> 00:02:14.247
For 14 years he is cut off from society, forced to live in physical and mental isolation.

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:23.037
And Dantès is innocent, he has been stitched up, falsely accused of a crime he did not commit.

00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:28.747
I’m not going to ruin the rest of the story for you if you’ve never read the book, but

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:35.557
let me just say that only the first 300 or so pages are set in the prison, and the next

00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:41.217
900 are the most amazing story of getting even with the people who ruined his life.

00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:48.727
Fortunately, the justice system in most countries has improved in the 200 years since Edmond

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:54.327
Dantès was sent to the Château d'If, and people are less likely to be wrongly convicted.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:03:01.377
But the method of punishment–the prison–has never been more popular.

00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:09.117
Across the world today there are an estimated 11.5 million people

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:13.777
in prison, locked up, cut off from the rest of the society.

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:17.057
So, how did we get here?

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:23.031
Back when Edmond Dantès was in prison, it was a relatively rare occurrence.

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.861
Prisons were places where people would typically be held while awaiting a sentence,

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:34.431
which–as you heard in the last two episodes–would often involve physical or capital

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:40.521
punishment, or in Victorian Britain, transportation, being sent to somewhere like Australia.

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:47.511
These prisons were more similar to what we today would call a jail rather than a prison;

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:54.407
they were temporary places of captivity, the captivity in itself wasn’t the punishment.

00:03:55.747 --> 00:04:00.167
The idea of incarceration being an effective long-term solution to deal

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:04.456
with criminals came during the Enlightenment, when thinkers started

00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:08.356
to question the morality and effectiveness of the justice system.

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:11.506
What was the role of the justice system?

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:15.996
Was it moral justice, to punish them for their crimes?

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:20.266
Or was it to prevent that individual from committing more crimes?

00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:24.266
Or was it to deter other people from committing crimes?

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:28.426
And depending on what the answer to the first question

00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:32.224
was, what was the most effective punishment to achieve it?

00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:37.714
Some sort of public punishment or humiliation, like branding them

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:41.204
with a hot iron or letting people throw rotten vegetables at them?

00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:46.204
Was it to require them to pay money, to compensate for someone else’s loss?

00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:50.974
Was it to pack them off on a ship and send them to the other side of the world?

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:56.164
Or was it to kill them, as we talked about at length in the last episode?

00:04:57.404 --> 00:05:02.234
All of these options had been tried, but according to some key

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:06.682
Enlightenment figures, they were both ineffective and morally wrong.

00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:13.262
The Italian philosopher Cesare Beccaria, as you might remember from the last episode on

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:19.668
capital punishment, was opposed to capital punishment, preferring incarceration, imprisonment.

00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:25.058
We went into all of the reasons as to why in the previous episode, so I

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:30.198
won’t repeat them here, but they included practical and moral reasons.

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:36.178
Beccaria provided the handbook on the wrongs of capital punishment

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.746
and the advantages of imprisonment, but it was men and women

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:45.396
who came afterwards that added some practicality to his ideas.

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:51.336
The first to talk about is an Englishman called John Howard.

00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:58.488
As a young man he had been captured by the French and held briefly in a French prison.

00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:07.638
This was in 1756, so by “prison” here I mean more like a holding cell, a temporary place

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:12.623
to keep your prisoners, not for people for whom being imprisoned is the punishment.

00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:18.578
Like all prisons at the time, conditions were horrendous, they were very bad.

00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:25.078
This personal experience is thought to have sparked a lifelong interest in prison,

00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:33.028
and in 1777, after going on a huge tour of prisons both in Britain and mainland

00:06:33.038 --> 00:06:39.378
Europe, he published an almost 500-page report called The State of the Prisons.

00:06:40.218 --> 00:06:45.818
This was the first time that someone had gone to such lengths to document what life was like

00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:52.381
for people who were being held in prisons, and, as you might expect, it was pretty grim reading.

00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:58.831
Prisons were overcrowded, sanitary conditions were awful, there was little separation

00:06:58.831 --> 00:07:04.071
of prisoners based on age, gender, or the nature of the crime they were convicted of.

00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:09.541
Prisoners were also just forced to sit around all day, they weren’t made to

00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:14.271
work or allowed much freedom to do anything at all; they weren’t kept busy.

00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:20.461
And perhaps most surprising was that he found that there was a large number of prisoners

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:26.581
who completed their sentences or had been acquitted, people who had either served their

00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:32.461
time or been found not guilty of whatever crime they had been accused of, but were still

00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:37.311
being held in prison because they didn’t have enough money to pay the fee for the jailor.

00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:43.011
The prison system at the time was semi-private, so the

00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:46.091
jailors had to cover their own costs for running the prison.

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:51.886
It might seem bizarre to us now, but not only were prisoners

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:57.146
locked up behind bars, but they had to pay for the privilege.

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:04.236
And if they couldn’t pay, well, they had to stay there until some kindly friend

00:08:04.236 --> 00:08:08.526
or relative could pay for them, which simply never happened for some people.

00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:14.796
John Howard brought this report to the British parliament, and two years later,

00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:21.186
in 1779, a bill was passed that brought several of his suggestions into law.

00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:28.166
More purpose-built prisons were constructed and there were regular inspections of these prisons.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:35.436
Hard labour and religious instruction became used as a way to keep prisoners busy, help generate

00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:41.126
a small income, and give inmates some skills that they could use upon their eventual release.

00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:48.556
Prisons conditions in Britain started to improve, but they were still pretty awful.

00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:54.562
In the early 19th century, prison conditions, especially for female

00:08:54.582 --> 00:08:59.542
prisoners, were given a significant boost by a woman called Elizabeth Fry.

00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:08.588
Fry was a Quaker, and she had seen firsthand the squalor that still existed in British prisons.

00:09:09.848 --> 00:09:14.048
She also saw how dangerous prisons were for women, especially young

00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:19.428
women, children really, who had to share cells with adult, male prisoners.

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:25.953
In 1818 she became the first woman ever to give evidence to a Select

00:09:25.973 --> 00:09:30.183
Committee of the British Houses of Parliament, and she presented her case.

00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:35.353
Her main proposal was for the separation of male and

00:09:35.353 --> 00:09:39.053
female prisoners, which was accepted and enshrined in law.

00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:44.373
The other changes would have to wait, and although she spent the rest of

00:09:44.373 --> 00:09:49.383
her life committed to prison reform and improving the conditions for female

00:09:49.393 --> 00:09:54.479
prisoners, there were no major developments before her death in 1845.

00:09:55.969 --> 00:10:01.969
Another key person concerned with the role and practicality of prisons was Jeremy Bentham.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:06.249
Now, Jeremy Bentham is a fascinating character.

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:10.939
He was the father of utilitarianism and for a long time

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:14.959
his embalmed corpse was on display in my old university.

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:19.519
We actually made an entire episode on his life, it’s episode number

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:24.969
116, so if you’d like to learn more about his life specifically, then

00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:28.559
I’d recommend listening to that episode if you haven’t done so already.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:35.599
But the reason to mention him here is because he did a lot of work on prison design.

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:42.136
Specifically, he created the concept for a prison called a Panopticon.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:48.675
The Panopticon is a circular building with prison cells at the edges and an

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:54.195
area in the middle where a single prison officer is placed, so the prison

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:59.481
officer can theoretically see every prisoner just by turning their head.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.640
And the prisoners don’t know whether they are being watched at that time, so the

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:11.960
theory at least is that they will behave better because they might be being observed.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.980
It was never actually built but it has gone down in history as a fascinating

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.560
architectural concept for the efficient control of a mass of people.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.300
Now, as you can see, although the conditions of prisoners might not have

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.530
improved drastically during this period, so the late 18th and 19th centuries,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.350
there was increasing work and thought put into how they could be improved.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.270
And, combined with this, there was increasing discussion about the role of prisons.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.640
People like Elisabeth Fry had argued that the role of prison was to reform the individual.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.270
Now, this was quite a revolutionary idea, in Britain at least.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:06.410
You would be punished for your crime, and–if you weren’t executed–the punishment would make you

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.740
not want to commit the crime again, principally because you didn’t want to be punished again.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.508
There was relatively little discussion about your character being reformed, about there

00:12:16.538 --> 00:12:22.538
being some kind of moral or spiritual awakening that you might have that made you come to

00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:26.768
the realisation that what you'd done was wrong and therefore you shouldn’t do it again.

00:12:27.908 --> 00:12:33.358
But Fry and prison reformists that followed proposed that prison could

00:12:33.548 --> 00:12:38.218
be a place for reform, for the inner change of the criminal’s character.

00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:42.758
There would be moral and spiritual reform, which would

00:12:42.798 --> 00:12:45.838
typically involve some kind of religious instruction.

00:12:47.128 --> 00:12:52.048
And there would also be practical reform, giving people skills that could help

00:12:52.048 --> 00:12:56.698
them become a productive, law-abiding citizen on their release from prison.

00:12:58.114 --> 00:13:02.464
In the early days of prison reform, so the early 19th century,

00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:06.404
this typically meant teaching prisoners how to read and write.

00:13:07.098 --> 00:13:12.468
And this also had a spiritual link, in that once prisoners had learned how to read, they

00:13:12.468 --> 00:13:17.388
were encouraged to read the Bible, and achieve spiritual redemption at the same time.

00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:22.198
Across the pond, in the United States, there was also

00:13:22.388 --> 00:13:26.378
serious work and debate about the role and design of prisons.

00:13:27.378 --> 00:13:31.738
Solitary confinement started to become the preferred method of holding

00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:37.723
prisoners, so instead of people being packed into large cells of 20 or

00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:42.468
more prisoners, they were kept alone, cut off from their fellow inmates.

00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:48.444
This was considered to not only be better from a security perspective,

00:13:48.564 --> 00:13:52.864
but more likely to lead to inner reflection and character reform.

00:13:53.944 --> 00:13:58.594
Moving into the 20th century, a key but little-known prison reformer in

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:03.294
Britain was a man who would later become Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.

00:14:04.374 --> 00:14:12.234
Churchill was Home Secretary from 1910 to 1911, and in that time he made some sweeping

00:14:12.234 --> 00:14:16.794
reforms that both reduced the number of people who were sent to prison in the first place

00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:23.634
and placed a greater focus on education, reformation, and acceptable living conditions.

00:14:24.852 --> 00:14:31.682
And, while this is skipping ahead a little bit, this is broadly considered the ideal format

00:14:31.682 --> 00:14:38.192
for incarceration today, in the UK at least: a cell that holds a single prisoner during

00:14:38.192 --> 00:14:44.725
the night, then skill development, reform, exercise and socialisation during the day.

00:14:45.775 --> 00:14:50.075
The idea is that the prisoner then comes out a reformed individual,

00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:54.685
fully understanding of the wrongs of their criminal past, and ready to

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:59.785
make a new start as a functional and contributing member of society.

00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:02.825
So, does it work?

00:15:03.815 --> 00:15:08.495
Well, it depends on what you define by “work”, and to define “work”

00:15:08.665 --> 00:15:12.355
there needs to be agreement on what the objective of imprisonment is.

00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:17.213
If we define “work” as effectively punishing people for their crime,

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:21.823
that is a subjective question, and one that deals more with the

00:15:21.823 --> 00:15:26.423
judicial system rather than the practicality and efficacy of prison.

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:33.193
If we define “work” as “removing criminals from society”, then yes it works.

00:15:33.883 --> 00:15:38.883
Edmond Dantès might have managed it, but modern prisons are not easy places

00:15:38.883 --> 00:15:43.889
to escape from, and they are very effective at removing people from society.

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:50.679
But if we define work as “rehabilitate so that the criminal tendencies

00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:54.866
are removed”, it is very hard to argue that modern prison works.

00:15:55.816 --> 00:16:02.406
According to a 2021 paper that looked at 116 different studies of the efficacy

00:16:02.406 --> 00:16:08.506
of prisons, imprisonment showed zero or a negative effect on offending rates.

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:14.356
In other words, someone who was sent to prison was no less likely, and often

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:19.876
more likely, to re-offend than someone who had been given a non-custodial

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:25.036
sentence, a criminal who had not been sent to prison but had to do something else.

00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:31.286
Prison might be a good way of parking people, locking them up so that

00:16:31.286 --> 00:16:35.796
they cannot participate in society, but when it comes to rehabilitation,

00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:41.136
there is clear evidence that it does not work as effectively as intended.

00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:47.436
Now, this is not to suggest that it would be preferable to go back to 18th century conditions

00:16:47.516 --> 00:16:53.536
and pack men, women, and children together in large, rat-infested cells, or let armed robbers

00:16:53.536 --> 00:16:59.566
and murderers back onto the streets with a small fine and some community service, but it is only

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:05.579
to say that when it comes to rehabilitation, the current prison system falls terribly short.

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:13.346
However, this has not stopped countries all over the world locking people up in record numbers.

00:17:14.646 --> 00:17:18.326
The US is particularly extreme when it comes to incarceration,

00:17:18.876 --> 00:17:24.967
and 0.5%, or 1 in every 200 Americans is in prison.

00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:31.127
Now, prisons in America is a topic in itself, with large questions about

00:17:31.137 --> 00:17:36.007
privatisation, incarceration rates by race, and state-by-state differences.

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:40.077
So we’ll have to wait for another opportunity to talk about that.

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:44.797
Coming back to Britain, though, where we started this mini-series and

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:48.217
where a lot of the early discussion about the role of prison took place,

00:17:48.507 --> 00:17:53.587
almost every week there are articles about the crisis in Britain's prisons.

00:17:55.051 --> 00:18:01.921
The year is 2024, but the headlines talk about overcrowding, about unsanitary conditions

00:18:02.091 --> 00:18:08.181
and prisoners forced to catch and eat the rats that scuttle around on the cold cell floor.

00:18:09.131 --> 00:18:15.181
This is almost 250 years after John Howard’s 500-page report to the British parliament

00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:21.231
about the awful conditions in British prisons, and not such a huge amount has changed.

00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.441
So, what’s the alternative?

00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:30.531
Well, prison reformists point to non-custodial sentences, especially for

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:37.021
non-violent, so-called victimless crimes, such as drug possession or sex work.

00:18:37.871 --> 00:18:42.211
This would reduce pressure on the already creaking prison system, it would

00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:47.081
reduce the cost–because keeping someone in prison is expensive–and it would do

00:18:47.081 --> 00:18:51.851
a better job at reducing the probability of reoffending, so the theory goes.

00:18:52.784 --> 00:18:59.384
To wrap things up, it is easy to say that prisons “don’t work”, or that they are “broken”.

00:19:00.184 --> 00:19:03.434
Clearly, they are imperfect in so many ways.

00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:10.594
Winston Churchill, that to many unknown prison reformer, once famously said about

00:19:10.594 --> 00:19:16.154
democracy that “it is the worst form of government, except for all the others.”

00:19:17.084 --> 00:19:20.244
He could well have said exactly the same thing about prisons.

00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:27.564
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the evolving role of prisons, and with that

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:32.554
comes the end of this three-part mini-series on the theme of crime and punishment.

00:19:33.154 --> 00:19:36.394
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:19:36.652 --> 00:19:40.664
perhaps it has got you thinking about the role of the judicial system in society.

00:19:41.274 --> 00:19:44.284
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:44.804 --> 00:19:47.354
What is the prison situation like in your country?

00:19:47.774 --> 00:19:52.914
Are there calls for reform, and if so, what are some of the solutions being proposed?

00:19:53.564 --> 00:19:56.884
And if you were the Minister of Justice, or the Minister

00:19:56.884 --> 00:19:59.984
for Prisons, what would you do to fix the situation?

00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:03.501
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:06.451

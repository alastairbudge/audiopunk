Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:16.825
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:21.655
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.825
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.565
Olympic Games, and specifically, politics and the Olympic Games.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:36.805
The Olympic Games are, supposedly, a politics-free event.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:41.525
But history shows us that it is very difficult to separate the two.

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:46.525
With the upcoming summer Olympic games in Tokyo, then the Winter Olympic Games

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:52.605
happening in 2022 in Beijing, now is an excellent time to ask ourselves the

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:59.025
question of whether politics can, and should, ever be kept separate from the games.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:04.995
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:50.745
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:54.875
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:59.625
OK then, politics and The Olympics.

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:01.975
Let’s start with some history.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:07.385
Our story starts, as many great stories do, in Ancient Greece.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:11.305
Specifically, in the large peninsula in southern

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:15.265
Greece, the Peloponnese, and in the town of Olympia.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:21.225
When the first Olympics actually took place is not completely clear, but

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:29.895
the first written records date back to 776 B.C, almost 2,800 years ago.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:37.815
It started out, so historians believe, as a festival to honour the Greek God Zeus.

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:44.715
Although it was obviously significantly smaller, the general idea was similar to today’s

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:51.975
Olympic Games - a series of athletic competitions - running, jumping, wrestling, and so on.

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:56.335
Ancient Greece at this time was a collection of different

00:02:56.425 --> 00:03:00.005
city-states, which were often at war with each other.

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:07.035
These city-states would send their best athletes to Olympia to compete in the games.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:12.835
One can imagine that, as there is now, it would be a matter of great

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:18.805
pride if an athlete from your city-state, your athlete, won a competition.

00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:27.395
So, even from the outset, from the very first Olympic games, politics was an important part of it.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:34.505
There is a theory that these warring Greek city-states, these city-states that were fighting with

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:41.665
each other, would call a temporary truce, a temporary peace, in order for athletes to travel to

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:48.795
Olympia and take part in the games, but that is now believed to be a bit of a modern-day myth.

00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.715
In any case, the games became very popular.

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:59.215
They were held every 4 years between August 6 and September 19, and they

00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:04.575
were so important that ancient Greek historians actually used to use the

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:10.415
four-year periods between the games as a reference point for historical events.

00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.311
The Ancient Olympics, as they are now called, continued for

00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:21.165
over a thousand years, and only stopped in the year AD 393.

00:04:22.255 --> 00:04:25.405
By this time, Ancient Greece had been conquered by

00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:29.145
Rome, and the Romans were in control of these games.

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:36.885
In 380AD, Christanity had become the only accepted religion in the Roman

00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:42.425
empire, and all other religions or belief systems were considered pagan.

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:47.935
As they were thought to be a celebration of the ancient Greek gods, the

00:04:47.935 --> 00:04:52.065
Olympics games were considered pagan, and were banned outright, they were

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:57.385
stopped, and there were no Olympics for one and a half thousand years.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.325
That was the end of the Ancient Olympics.

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:05.555
Now, let’s skip forward to the 19th century, and talk about

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:09.955
the rebirth of The Olympics, and the modern Olympic Games

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:15.905
To give you some additional context to this, Greek Independence

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:21.467
from the Ottoman Empire had been achieved in 1830 and there was a

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:27.137
revival of national pride in things regarded as distinctively Greek.

00:05:27.747 --> 00:05:32.826
Athletic competitions similar to The Ancient Olympics had taken place

00:05:32.952 --> 00:05:40.711
in 1859, 1870 and 1875, but they were all relatively small-scale.

00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:47.411
It wasn’t until the arrival of a French aristocrat, a man named Baron Pierre

00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:52.081
de Coubertin that the Olympic Games as we know them today were developed.

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:57.441
This young Frenchman was obsessed with the idea of physical

00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:01.881
exercise as a way of preventing illness and keeping healthy.

00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.681
He had travelled to Olympia, he knew about this ancient tradition, and

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:14.731
proposed the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, partly with his mission of

00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:20.431
promoting physical exercise and also just as a great international competition.

00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:29.331
He was given the authority to restart the games, and in 1894, almost exactly 1,500 years

00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:36.341
after the last Olympic Games, The International Olympic Committee, the IOC, was formed.

00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:41.551
Now, back to the question of politics and the Olympic Games.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:49.021
The first Olympic Games in 1896 were held in Greece, in Athens, as one might expect.

00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:54.991
The first question the organisers had to ask themselves was “well, who is invited?”

00:06:56.021 --> 00:07:01.801
As you may know, this period of history saw a number of big military clashes

00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:08.781
within Europe; in 1870 the Franco-Prussian war had seen France heavily defeated,

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:13.701
and there were some question marks over whether Prussia would be invited.

00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:21.081
But, to Baron de Coubertin’s credit, he did choose to include Germany in the first games.

00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:28.221
We will soon see though that participation in the games, both countries not

00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:33.081
being allowed to participate, and countries choosing not to participate for

00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:37.931
political reasons, will be a feature throughout the history of the modern games.

00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:44.081
And indeed let’s jump to the Olympic Games in Berlin, in 1936,

00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:48.716
for our first modern example of a political Olympic Games.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:56.141
In the Olympic Games of 1920 and 1924, as a punishment for its actions in World War

00:07:56.141 --> 00:08:02.221
I, Germany had been excluded, it had not been allowed to participate in the games.

00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:09.571
But, in 1936 it was the host nation, the games were to take place in Germany.

00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:17.291
By 1936, the Nazi regime was in full control of the country, and it sought to use

00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:23.221
the Olympic Games as a way of demonstrating both the fact that Nazi Germany was

00:08:23.221 --> 00:08:30.141
a functioning, successful country, and secondly that the Aryan race, the white,

00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:35.831
northern European people were superior in every way, particularly physically.

00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.831
I imagine you may have seen pictures or video clips from this Olympic

00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:46.901
Games, with people in the crowd doing the Nazi salute, with their

00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:51.271
right hands in the air, and people in their military uniforms.

00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:56.526
Now, at least when it comes to Hitler and the Nazis' theory of Aryan

00:08:56.526 --> 00:09:03.936
superiority, that was clearly proved wrong, when Jesse Owens, the American

00:09:04.156 --> 00:09:08.926
black athlete, won four gold medals and was the star of the competition.

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:14.016
But the fact that the Olympics were held in the capital of Nazi

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:18.566
Germany helped legitimise the regime, and show it to the world.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:25.966
The Nazi emblem, the Swastika, was on full display, and there was implicit

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:30.976
endorsement, or support, given to the regime by the Olympic committee.

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:37.696
Now, it is perhaps easy to say with retrospect, with the benefit of hindsight,

00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:43.106
that these games shouldn’t have been held in Berlin, but it does raise the

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:47.786
question of what types of countries should be allowed to hold the Olympics?

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:51.976
Yes, probably not countries with regimes that look like

00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:55.476
they might commit genocide, but where do you draw the line?

00:09:56.236 --> 00:10:00.026
One only needs to look at some of the countries that have been awarded

00:10:00.036 --> 00:10:05.966
the Olympics in the past 20 years or so to find examples of countries

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:10.206
that have at least been accused of some pretty terrible crimes.

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:14.786
Let’s move on to Mexico City, in 1968.

00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:20.066
These games actually have two important examples of politics

00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:23.946
and the games, one domestic and the other international.

00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:30.096
Firstly, 10 days before the opening of the games there was a protest by

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:34.726
Mexican students against the amount of money that had been spent on the games.

00:10:35.216 --> 00:10:41.486
Instead, they believed that it should have been spent on domestic social programmes, that the money

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:48.446
should have been spent helping Mexicans, not building expensive stadiums for an international event.

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:54.976
Eager to not have any disruption to the first Olympics in Mexico, and indeed

00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:59.986
the first Olympics in Latin America, the Mexican police attacked the plaza

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:05.376
where the students were gathering, killing 200 people and injuring 1,000 more.

00:11:06.526 --> 00:11:10.996
But the most famous of the political events at these games

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:15.206
was to come during the actual events, and on the field.

00:11:16.116 --> 00:11:21.636
In America, the civil rights movement had been going on for almost 20 years.

00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:25.811
African Americans had been fighting for equal rights and

00:11:26.051 --> 00:11:29.771
had been struggling against systemic racism in the U S.

00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:37.581
The podium for the 200m race was to become a centre of political demonstration,

00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:43.691
and the scene of probably the most iconic photo in Olympic political history.

00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:47.651
An American, Tommie Smith, had won the race.

00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:50.291
An Australian, Peter Norman, came second.

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:53.795
And another American, John Carlos, came third.

00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:59.561
Tommie Smith and John Carlos were both black, they were African Americans.

00:12:00.291 --> 00:12:05.241
As they received their medals, Tommie Smith and John Carlos lowered their

00:12:05.241 --> 00:12:12.421
heads and raised one hand, covered by a black glove and clenched into a fist.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.871
You will no doubt have seen this picture, but what you might

00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:21.401
have missed is some of the finer, more poignant details.

00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:26.811
Carlos and Smith had taken off their shoes and put on black socks

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:31.241
to symbolise the poverty in which many black American people lived.

00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:38.241
If you look closer at Carlos‘s neck you will see a bead necklace worn to represent

00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:44.121
the lynchings, the killings of black Americans, which were all too common at the time.

00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:47.821
The International Olympic Committee was furious.

00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:53.231
This was a political statement, and The Olympics were meant to be an

00:12:53.301 --> 00:12:57.931
apolitical event, politics weren’t meant to be involved in the games.

00:12:58.881 --> 00:13:03.511
The President of the IOC ordered for Carlos and Smith to

00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:08.571
be removed from the US Olympic team, but the team refused.

00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:15.711
Interestingly, when the President of the IOC was questioned about why this,

00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:21.141
what's called, Black Power salute, this gesture that Carlos and Smith had done

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:29.011
was unacceptable but why the Nazi salute was acceptable back in 1936, his response

00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:34.931
was that the Nazi salute was a national salute, and therefore was acceptable.

00:13:35.841 --> 00:13:39.811
Legally, one might say he was correct, it was a national

00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:44.041
salute, but morally it would be hard to make that argument.

00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:49.291
In any case, by this time, it was clear that it was going to be

00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:54.291
incredibly hard to actually make The Olympics a politics-free zone.

00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:59.131
Moving on to our next example, the political actions

00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:03.861
didn’t come from the athletes, but against the athletes.

00:14:04.821 --> 00:14:09.181
You may be familiar with the events of 1972 in Munich.

00:14:10.171 --> 00:14:13.761
11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken

00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:17.581
hostage by the Palestinian terror group Black September.

00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:23.611
This led to the so-called “Munich Massacre“ which resulted in the

00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:28.321
terrorists first killing two of the Israeli athletes and then other

00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:33.241
nine being murdered later on as special forces tried to rescue them.

00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:36.771
This was a different kind of political gesture.

00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:43.021
The world was watching, and people who had not known much about the ongoing conflict

00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:48.181
in the Middle East became fully aware as a result of these tragic circumstances.

00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:55.521
The Olympics became a live theatre for Middle-eastern Politics, and it was clear that

00:14:55.521 --> 00:15:01.151
it was an incredibly effective stage for getting one’s message across, or at least

00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:05.811
highlighting an issue that most people around the world might not have been aware of.

00:15:06.691 --> 00:15:13.781
Just four years later, in Montréal in 1976, we encountered a different kind of example.

00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:19.391
There is still the constant of The Olympic Games being used as a way to

00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:24.291
force political actions, and promote or discourage political beliefs in

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.961
countries thousands of miles away from where the games are taking place.

00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:34.691
This time though, we are talking about apartheid, the racist policy of the South

00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:40.321
African government that forced segregation between the white and black population.

00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:48.531
This was a system of institutionalised racial discrimination, which legislated for superior

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:55.611
facilities and opportunities for the minority white people and condemned the indigenous black

00:15:55.611 --> 00:16:03.521
population to inferior opportunities and therefore blatant, legalised and statutory discrimination.

00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:08.071
But these games don't include the South African Olympic team.

00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:13.471
South Africa was already not allowed to participate in the Olympics games, and

00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:20.391
hadn’t been since 1964, because of its policy of separating white and black athletes.

00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:26.601
Indeed, there was a worldwide sporting ban on South Africa, meaning that other

00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:30.511
countries weren’t allowed to play against the South African national team.

00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:35.991
But, the New Zealand rugby team had recently toured South Africa,

00:16:36.301 --> 00:16:39.621
they had broken this international boycott of the country.

00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:45.851
There was an outcry from multiple African nations, who said that New Zealand

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:50.201
should be banned from the Olympics in Montreal for breaking the boycott.

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:56.271
But, the IOC (the International Olympic Committee) didn’t ban New Zealand.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:05.101
And as a result, 29 countries, mostly African nations, pulled out of the competition in disgust.

00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:12.421
Another notable, but unrelated political event during these games was Taiwan pulling out.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:18.891
It had previously competed under the name The Republic of China, but was told by

00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:24.081
Canada that it couldn’t use that name, because it was too similar to The People’s

00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:28.971
Republic of China, which had been officially recognised by Canada in 1970.

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:35.651
This is, of course, an ongoing issue in the Olympics today, and Taiwan, otherwise

00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:40.221
known as The Republic of China, normally competes under the name Chinese Taipei.

00:17:41.371 --> 00:17:47.631
Now, Montreal in 1976 was an example of countries using The Olympics

00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:51.911
to take a political stance, or to make a political point, that is

00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:56.661
completely unrelated to the country in which the games are being hosted.

00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.921
But, what happens when the Olympics are hosted in a

00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:04.061
country that has not been behaving particularly well?

00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:09.921
We saw that it didn’t do any harm to Nazi Germany, and in fact gave it some

00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:15.591
credibility, but half a century later, had the world learned anything from this?

00:18:16.571 --> 00:18:21.651
Well, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow suggest that things did change.

00:18:22.181 --> 00:18:27.581
One of the last attempts of the USSR to assert its military might and

00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:32.061
political will as a superpower, even though it was a failing one at the

00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:38.631
time, was to invade Afghanistan, which it did on Christmas Eve of 1979.

00:18:39.741 --> 00:18:44.701
As a result of this, a large number of countries, including the USA,

00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:49.901
boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980, they didn’t take part in the games.

00:18:50.321 --> 00:18:59.011
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the USSR and 14 other nations, all Eastern Bloc satellite states and

00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:06.351
allies of the USSR, responded by boycotting the Los Angeles Games 4 years later, in 1984.

00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:14.311
As the English saying goes, it was a case of tit for tat, one action taken because of another.

00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:21.981
This leaves us neatly on to the next leg of this saga, which we will be our last one:

00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:31.141
For this one we will stay in Russia, and talk about doping in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:37.497
Vladimir Putin, boosted by the popularity he was enjoying as head of a Russian

00:19:37.497 --> 00:19:42.987
state that was prosperous with such strong global demand for oil and gas, had

00:19:42.997 --> 00:19:49.127
managed to persuade the IOC that Russia should host the Winter Olympics in 2014.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:58.037
Putin, himself a black belt in judo and a man whose own public image was heavily dependent on his

00:19:58.077 --> 00:20:05.067
own personal physical prowess, whether riding a horse shirtless or showing his skill and strength

00:20:05.077 --> 00:20:12.883
in judo, aimed to use the Winter Olympics in order to showcase Russia‘s strength in sporting terms.

00:20:13.953 --> 00:20:20.123
You can, with the benefit of hindsight, see this as part of a coherent and

00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:26.353
determined plan to assert Russian power, alongside its continued military strength

00:20:26.403 --> 00:20:32.913
and increasing willingness to intervene internationally, a tendency that became

00:20:32.963 --> 00:20:38.143
evident with military interventions in Syria, Ukraine and Crimea subsequently.

00:20:39.303 --> 00:20:45.683
Much to the embarrassment of Russia, the Russian Doping Scandal resulted in an independent

00:20:45.793 --> 00:20:54.363
report, the McLaren Report, concluding in 2016 that the collusion or secret cooperation between

00:20:54.533 --> 00:21:01.303
different elements of the Russian state had been complete and thorough – in other words this was a

00:21:01.313 --> 00:21:08.713
large-scale, top-down effort to ensure that Russian athletes were able to use performance-enhancing

00:21:08.723 --> 00:21:14.643
drugs and therefore to cheat with the assistance of the state at the very highest level.

00:21:15.195 --> 00:21:20.395
This resulted in a total of 47 Olympic medals being taken away from

00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:25.281
Russian athletes who had won them in the London 2012 Olympics and a

00:21:25.281 --> 00:21:29.741
two year ban on Russia competing in international sporting events.

00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:36.891
So, this is, of course, on one level just simple cheating, but on another

00:21:36.891 --> 00:21:42.191
level shows us how far some countries are prepared to go to win a competition.

00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:48.271
For Putin, winning a gold medal wasn’t just about the glory of being

00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:53.101
the best at a particular sport, it was about showcasing the strength

00:21:53.191 --> 00:21:58.211
of Russia, and of how the country had prospered under his leadership.

00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:03.351
And it was a little bit embarrassing when it completely backfired.

00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:09.431
So, I think that by now we have realised that politics and The

00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:13.931
Olympics go hand in hand, it is very difficult to separate the two.

00:22:14.731 --> 00:22:19.591
In fact, it is much harder now than it was even 20 years ago.

00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:25.581
Many Olympic athletes are celebrities in their own right.

00:22:25.581 --> 00:22:29.681
20 or 30 years ago they might have needed to wait until they were on the

00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:35.571
pitch, or receiving a medal, to make a gesture that symbolised their beliefs.

00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:41.351
Now, they can share it on their own social media channels and know that

00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:45.631
it can reach tens or hundreds of millions of people in minutes, there is

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:49.731
no longer anything between the athletes and the people who follow them.

00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:58.111
So, if we are in agreement that politics and the Olympics are inseparable, where does this leave us?

00:22:58.321 --> 00:23:03.431
What criteria should countries have to meet if they want to hold the Olympics?

00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:08.151
Should Olympic athletes have to meet certain criteria in terms

00:23:08.151 --> 00:23:12.171
of their political beliefs in order to represent their country?

00:23:12.781 --> 00:23:15.781
How should athletes be required to behave?

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:18.651
Is it different during The Olympics?

00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:22.341
Can they say one thing on their private social media accounts

00:23:22.341 --> 00:23:25.601
but have to say another thing when receiving a medal?

00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:30.701
Again, there are no easy answers to this, and I will leave you to make up your own mind.

00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:31.413
Let us give the last word on the subject to two

00:23:31.413 --> 00:23:35.998
contrasting characters: Vladimir Putin and George Orwell.

00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:49.508
At a news conference before the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Putin said that the banning

00:23:49.518 --> 00:23:55.558
of Russian athletes would be a “dangerous recurrence of politics interfering in sport."

00:23:56.608 --> 00:24:00.928
Or are you inclined to agree with one of my heroes, George

00:24:00.928 --> 00:24:06.368
Orwell, who described sport as “war minus the shooting”?

00:24:09.158 --> 00:24:16.515
OK then, that is it for today's episode on politics and the Olympic games I hope it's

00:24:16.515 --> 00:24:21.085
been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and when it comes to the

00:24:21.115 --> 00:24:26.445
upcoming games in Tokyo and Beijing, well, you’ll have a bit of background to it.

00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:30.855
Who knows what other political controversies might happens at these two..

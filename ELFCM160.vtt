Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:16.825
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:21.655
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.825
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.565
Olympic Games, and specifically, politics and the Olympic Games.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:36.805
The Olympic Games are, supposedly, a politics-free event.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:41.525
But history shows us that it is very difficult to separate the two.

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:46.525
With the upcoming summer Olympic games in Tokyo, then the Winter Olympic Games

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:52.605
happening in 2022 in Beijing, now is an excellent time to ask ourselves the

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:59.025
question of whether politics can, and should, ever be kept separate from the games.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:04.995
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:50.745
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:54.875
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:59.625
OK then, politics and The Olympics.

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:01.975
Let’s start with some history.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:07.385
Our story starts, as many great stories do, in Ancient Greece.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:11.305
Specifically, in the large peninsula in southern

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:15.265
Greece, the Peloponnese, and in the town of Olympia.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:21.225
When the first Olympics actually took place is not completely clear, but

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:29.895
the first written records date back to 776 B.C, almost 2,800 years ago.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:37.815
It started out, so historians believe, as a festival to honour the Greek God Zeus.

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:44.715
Although it was obviously significantly smaller, the general idea was similar to today’s

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:51.975
Olympic Games - a series of athletic competitions - running, jumping, wrestling, and so on.

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:56.335
Ancient Greece at this time was a collection of different

00:02:56.425 --> 00:03:00.005
city-states, which were often at war with each other.

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:07.035
These city-states would send their best athletes to Olympia to compete in the games.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:12.835
One can imagine that, as there is now, it would be a matter of great

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:18.805
pride if an athlete from your city-state, your athlete, won a competition.

00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:27.395
So, even from the outset, from the very first Olympic games, politics was an important part of it.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:34.505
There is a theory that these warring Greek city-states, these city-states that were fighting with

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:41.665
each other, would call a temporary truce, a temporary peace, in order for athletes to travel to

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:48.795
Olympia and take part in the games, but that is now believed to be a bit of a modern-day myth.

00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.715
In any case, the games became very popular.

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:59.215
They were held every 4 years between August 6 and September 19, and they

00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:04.575
were so important that ancient Greek historians actually used to use the

00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:10.415
four-year periods between the games as a reference point for historical events.

00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.311
The Ancient Olympics, as they are now called, continued for

00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:21.165
over a thousand years, and only stopped in the year AD 393.

00:04:22.255 --> 00:04:25.405
By this time, Ancient Greece had been conquered by

00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:29.145
Rome, and the Romans were in control of these games.

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:36.885
In 380AD, Christanity had become the only accepted religion in the Roman

00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:42.425
empire, and all other religions or belief systems were considered pagan.

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:47.935
As they were thought to be a celebration of the ancient Greek gods, the

00:04:47.935 --> 00:04:52.065
Olympics games were considered pagan, and were banned outright, they were

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:57.385
stopped, and there were no Olympics for one and a half thousand years.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.325
That was the end of the Ancient Olympics.

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:05.555
Now, let’s skip forward to the 19th century, and talk about

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:09.955
the rebirth of The Olympics, and the modern Olympic Games

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:15.905
To give you some additional context to this, Greek Independence

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:21.805
from the Ottoman Empire had been achieved in 1821, and there was a

00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:27.475
revival of national pride in things regarded as distinctively Greek.

00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:33.165
Athletic competitions similar to The Ancient Olympics had taken place

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:40.985
in 1859, 1870 and 1875, but they were all relatively small-scale.

00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:47.685
It wasn’t until the arrival of a French aristocrat, a man named Baron Pierre

00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:52.355
de Coubertin that the Olympic Games as we know them today were developed.

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:57.715
This young Frenchman was obsessed with the idea of physical

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:02.155
exercise as a way of preventing illness and keeping healthy.

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:07.955
He had travelled to Olympia, he knew about this ancient tradition, and

00:06:08.225 --> 00:06:15.005
proposed the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, partly with his mission of

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:20.705
promoting physical exercise and also just as a great international competition.

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:29.605
He was given the authority to restart the games, and in 1894, almost exactly 1,500 years

00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:36.615
after the last Olympic Games, The International Olympic Committee, the IOC, was formed.

00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:41.825
Now, back to the question of politics and the Olympic Games.

00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:49.295
The first Olympic Games in 1896 were held in Greece, in Athens, as one might expect.

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:55.265
The first question the organisers had to ask themselves was “well, who is invited?”

00:06:56.295 --> 00:07:02.075
As you may know, this period of history saw a number of big military clashes

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:09.055
within Europe; in 1870 the Franco-Prussian war had seen France heavily defeated,

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:13.975
and there were some question marks over whether Prussia would be invited.

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:21.355
But, to Baron de Coubertin’s credit, he did choose to include Germany in the first games.

00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:28.495
We will soon see though that participation in the games, both countries not

00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:33.355
being allowed to participate, and countries choosing not to participate for

00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:38.205
political reasons, will be a feature throughout the history of the modern games.

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:44.355
And indeed let’s jump to the Olympic Games in Berlin, in 1936,

00:07:44.545 --> 00:07:48.990
for our first modern example of a political Olympic Games.

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:56.415
In the Olympic Games of 1920 and 1924, as a punishment for its actions in World War

00:07:56.415 --> 00:08:02.495
I, Germany had been excluded, it had not been allowed to participate in the games.

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:09.845
But, in 1936 it was the host nation, the games were to take place in Germany.

00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:17.565
By 1936, the Nazi regime was in full control of the country, and it sought to use

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:23.495
the Olympic Games as a way of demonstrating both the fact that Nazi Germany was

00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:30.415
a functioning, successful country, and secondly that the Aryan race, the white,

00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:36.105
northern European people were superior in every way, particularly physically.

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:42.105
I imagine you may have seen pictures or video clips from this Olympic

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:47.175
Games, with people in the crowd doing the Nazi salute, with their

00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:51.545
right hands in the air, and people in their military uniforms.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:56.800
Now, at least when it comes to Hitler and the Nazis' theory of Aryan

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:04.210
superiority, that was clearly proved wrong, when Jesse Owens, the American

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.200
black athlete, won four gold medals and was the star of the competition.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.290
But the fact that the Olympics were held in the capital of Nazi

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.840
Germany helped legitimise the regime, and show it to the world.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:26.240
The Nazi emblem, the Swastika, was on full display, and there was implicit

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:31.250
endorsement, or support, given to the regime by the Olympic committee.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.970
Now, it is perhaps easy to say with retrospect, with the benefit of hindsight,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.380
that these games shouldn’t have been held in Berlin, but it does raise the

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.060
question of what types of countries should be allowed to hold the Olympics?

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.250
Yes, probably not countries with regimes that look like

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.750
they might commit genocide, but where do you draw the line?

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.300
One only needs to look at some of the countries that have been awarded

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:06.240
the Olympics in the past 20 years or so to find examples of countries

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.480
that have at least been accused of some pretty terrible crimes.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.060
Let’s move on to Mexico City, in 1968.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.340
These games actually have two important examples of politics

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.220
and the games, one domestic and the other international.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.370
Firstly, 10 days before the opening of the games there was a protest by

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.000
Mexican students against the amount of money that had been spent on the games.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:41.760
Instead, they believed that it should have been spent on domestic social programmes, that the money

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.720
should have been spent helping Mexicans, not building expensive stadiums for an international event.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.250
Eager to not have any disruption to the first Olympics in Mexico, and indeed

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.260
the first Olympics in Latin America, the Mexican police attacked the plaza

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.650
where the students were gathering, killing 200 people and injuring 1,000 more.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.270
But the most famous of the political events at these games

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.480
was to come during the actual events, and on the field.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.910
In America, the civil rights movement had been going on for almost 20 years.

00:11:22.366 --> 00:11:26.086
African Americans had been fighting for equal rights and

00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:30.046
had been struggling against systemic racism in the U S.

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:37.856
The podium for the 200m race was to become a centre of political demonstration,

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:43.966
and the scene of probably the most iconic photo in Olympic political history.

00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:47.926
An American, Tommie Smith, had won the race.

00:11:48.126 --> 00:11:50.566
An Australian, Peter Norman, came second.

00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:54.070
And another American, John Carlos, came third.

00:11:54.976 --> 00:11:59.836
Tommie Smith and John Carlos were both black, they were African Americans.

00:12:00.566 --> 00:12:05.516
As they received their medals, Tommie Smith and John Carlos lowered their

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:12.696
heads and raised one hand, covered by a black glove and clenched into a fist.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:17.146
You will no doubt have seen this picture, but what you might

00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:21.676
have missed is some of the finer, more poignant details.

00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:27.086
Carlos and Smith had taken off their shoes and put on black socks

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:31.516
to symbolise the poverty in which many black American people lived.

00:12:32.436 --> 00:12:38.516
If you look closer at Carlos‘s neck you will see a bead necklace worn to represent

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:44.396
the lynchings, the killings of black Americans, which were all too common at the time.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:48.096
The International Olympic Committee was furious.

00:12:48.596 --> 00:12:53.506
This was a political statement, and The Olympics were meant to be an

00:12:53.576 --> 00:12:58.206
apolitical event, politics weren’t meant to be involved in the games.

00:12:59.156 --> 00:13:03.786
The President of the IOC ordered for Carlos and Smith to

00:13:03.786 --> 00:13:08.846
be removed from the US Olympic team, but the team refused.

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:15.986
Interestingly, when the President of the IOC was questioned about why this,

00:13:16.176 --> 00:13:21.416
what's called, Black Power salute, this gesture that Carlos and Smith had done

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:29.286
was unacceptable but why the Nazi salute was acceptable back in 1936, his response

00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:35.206
was that the Nazi salute was a national salute, and therefore was acceptable.

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:40.086
Legally, one might say he was correct, it was a national

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:44.316
salute, but morally it would be hard to make that argument.

00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:49.566
In any case, by this time, it was clear that it was going to be

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:54.566
incredibly hard to actually make The Olympics a politics-free zone.

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:59.406
Moving on to our next example, the political actions

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:04.136
didn’t come from the athletes, but against the athletes.

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:09.456
You may be familiar with the events of 1972 in Munich.

00:14:10.446 --> 00:14:14.036
11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:17.856
hostage by the Palestinian terror group Black September.

00:14:19.006 --> 00:14:23.886
This led to the so-called “Munich Massacre“ which resulted in the

00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:28.596
terrorists first killing two of the Israeli athletes and then other

00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:33.516
nine being murdered later on as special forces tried to rescue them.

00:14:34.086 --> 00:14:37.046
This was a different kind of political gesture.

00:14:37.506 --> 00:14:43.296
The world was watching, and people who had not known much about the ongoing conflict

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:48.456
in the Middle East became fully aware as a result of these tragic circumstances.

00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:55.796
The Olympics became a live theatre for Middle-eastern Politics, and it was clear that

00:14:55.796 --> 00:15:01.426
it was an incredibly effective stage for getting one’s message across, or at least

00:15:01.556 --> 00:15:06.086
highlighting an issue that most people around the world might not have been aware of.

00:15:06.966 --> 00:15:14.056
Just four years later, in Montréal in 1976, we encountered a different kind of example.

00:15:15.046 --> 00:15:19.666
There is still the constant of The Olympic Games being used as a way to

00:15:19.676 --> 00:15:24.566
force political actions, and promote or discourage political beliefs in

00:15:24.566 --> 00:15:28.236
countries thousands of miles away from where the games are taking place.

00:15:29.186 --> 00:15:34.966
This time though, we are talking about apartheid, the racist policy of the South

00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:40.596
African government that forced segregation between the white and black population.

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:48.806
This was a system of institutionalised racial discrimination, which legislated for superior

00:15:48.806 --> 00:15:55.886
facilities and opportunities for the minority white people and condemned the indigenous black

00:15:55.886 --> 00:16:03.796
population to inferior opportunities and therefore blatant, legalised and statutory discrimination.

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:08.346
But these games don't include the South African Olympic team.

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:13.746
South Africa was already not allowed to participate in the Olympics games, and

00:16:14.076 --> 00:16:20.666
hadn’t been since 1964, because of its policy of separating white and black athletes.

00:16:21.206 --> 00:16:26.876
Indeed, there was a worldwide sporting ban on South Africa, meaning that other

00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:30.786
countries weren’t allowed to play against the South African national team.

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:36.266
But, the New Zealand rugby team had recently toured South Africa,

00:16:36.576 --> 00:16:39.896
they had broken this international boycott of the country.

00:16:40.756 --> 00:16:46.126
There was an outcry from multiple African nations, who said that New Zealand

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:50.476
should be banned from the Olympics in Montreal for breaking the boycott.

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:56.546
But, the IOC (the International Olympic Committee) didn’t ban New Zealand.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:05.376
And as a result, 29 countries, mostly African nations, pulled out of the competition in disgust.

00:17:06.376 --> 00:17:12.696
Another notable, but unrelated political event during these games was Taiwan pulling out.

00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:19.166
It had previously competed under the name The Republic of China, but was told by

00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:24.356
Canada that it couldn’t use that name, because it was too similar to The People’s

00:17:24.356 --> 00:17:29.245
Republic of China, which had been officially recognised by Canada in 1970.

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:35.926
This is, of course, an ongoing issue in the Olympics today, and Taiwan, otherwise

00:17:35.926 --> 00:17:40.496
known as The Republic of China, normally competes under the name Chinese Taipei.

00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:47.906
Now, Montreal in 1976 was an example of countries using The Olympics

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:52.186
to take a political stance, or to make a political point, that is

00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:56.936
completely unrelated to the country in which the games are being hosted.

00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:01.196
But, what happens when the Olympics are hosted in a

00:18:01.226 --> 00:18:04.336
country that has not been behaving particularly well?

00:18:05.206 --> 00:18:10.196
We saw that it didn’t do any harm to Nazi Germany, and in fact gave it some

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:15.866
credibility, but half a century later, had the world learned anything from this?

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:21.926
Well, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow suggest that things did change.

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:27.856
One of the last attempts of the USSR to assert its military might and

00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:32.336
political will as a superpower, even though it was a failing one at the

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:38.906
time, was to invade Afghanistan, which it did on Christmas Eve of 1979.

00:18:40.016 --> 00:18:44.976
As a result of this, a large number of countries, including the USA,

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:50.176
boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980, they didn’t take part in the games.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:59.286
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the USSR and 14 other nations, all Eastern Bloc satellite states and

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:06.626
allies of the USSR, responded by boycotting the Los Angeles Games 4 years later, in 1984.

00:19:07.806 --> 00:19:14.586
As the English saying goes, it was a case of tit for tat, one action taken because of another.

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:22.256
This leaves us neatly on to the next leg of this saga, which we will be our last one:

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:31.416
For this one we will stay in Russia, and talk about doping in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

00:19:32.266 --> 00:19:37.771
Vladimir Putin, boosted by the popularity he was enjoying as head of a Russian

00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:43.261
state that was prosperous with such strong global demand for oil and gas, had

00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:49.401
managed to persuade the IOC that Russia should host the Winter Olympics in 2014.

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:58.311
Putin, himself a black belt in judo and a man whose own public image was heavily dependent on his

00:19:58.351 --> 00:20:05.341
own personal physical prowess, whether riding a horse shirtless or showing his skill and strength

00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:13.157
in judo, aimed to use the Winter Olympics in order to showcase Russia‘s strength in sporting terms.

00:20:14.227 --> 00:20:20.397
You can, with the benefit of hindsight, see this as part of a coherent and

00:20:20.627 --> 00:20:26.627
determined plan to assert Russian power, alongside its continued military strength

00:20:26.677 --> 00:20:33.187
and increasing willingness to intervene internationally, a tendency that became

00:20:33.237 --> 00:20:38.417
evident with military interventions in Syria, Ukraine and Crimea subsequently.

00:20:39.577 --> 00:20:45.957
Much to the embarrassment of Russia, the Russian Doping Scandal resulted in an independent

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:54.637
report, the McLaren Report, concluding in 2016 that the collusion or secret cooperation between

00:20:54.807 --> 00:21:01.577
different elements of the Russian state had been complete and thorough – in other words this was a

00:21:01.587 --> 00:21:08.987
large-scale, top-down effort to ensure that Russian athletes were able to use performance-enhancing

00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:14.917
drugs and therefore to cheat with the assistance of the state at the very highest level.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:20.670
This resulted in a total of 47 Olympic medals being taken away from

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:25.556
Russian athletes who had won them in the London 2012 Olympics and a

00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:30.016
two year ban on Russia competing in international sporting events.

00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:37.166
So, this is, of course, on one level just simple cheating, but on another

00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:42.466
level shows us how far some countries are prepared to go to win a competition.

00:21:43.396 --> 00:21:48.546
For Putin, winning a gold medal wasn’t just about the glory of being

00:21:48.546 --> 00:21:53.376
the best at a particular sport, it was about showcasing the strength

00:21:53.466 --> 00:21:58.486
of Russia, and of how the country had prospered under his leadership.

00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:03.626
And it was a little bit embarrassing when it completely backfired.

00:22:04.586 --> 00:22:09.706
So, I think that by now we have realised that politics and The

00:22:09.716 --> 00:22:14.206
Olympics go hand in hand, it is very difficult to separate the two.

00:22:15.006 --> 00:22:19.866
In fact, it is much harder now than it was even 20 years ago.

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:25.856
Many Olympic athletes are celebrities in their own right.

00:22:25.856 --> 00:22:29.956
20 or 30 years ago they might have needed to wait until they were on the

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:35.846
pitch, or receiving a medal, to make a gesture that symbolised their beliefs.

00:22:36.686 --> 00:22:41.626
Now, they can share it on their own social media channels and know that

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:45.906
it can reach tens or hundreds of millions of people in minutes, there is

00:22:46.106 --> 00:22:50.006
no longer anything between the athletes and the people who follow them.

00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:58.386
So, if we are in agreement that politics and the Olympics are inseparable, where does this leave us?

00:22:58.596 --> 00:23:03.706
What criteria should countries have to meet if they want to hold the Olympics?

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:08.426
Should Olympic athletes have to meet certain criteria in terms

00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:12.446
of their political beliefs in order to represent their country?

00:23:13.056 --> 00:23:16.056
How should athletes be required to behave?

00:23:16.086 --> 00:23:18.926
Is it different during The Olympics?

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:22.616
Can they say one thing on their private social media accounts

00:23:22.616 --> 00:23:25.876
but have to say another thing when receiving a medal?

00:23:26.716 --> 00:23:33.976
Again, there are no easy answers to this, and I will leave you to make up your own mind.

00:23:33.976 --> 00:23:37.687
Let us give the last word on the subject to two

00:23:37.687 --> 00:23:42.273
contrasting characters: Vladimir Putin and George Orwell.

00:23:42.273 --> 00:23:49.783
At a news conference before the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Putin said that the banning

00:23:49.793 --> 00:23:55.833
of Russian athletes would be a “dangerous recurrence of politics interfering in sport."

00:23:56.883 --> 00:24:01.203
Or are you inclined to agree with one of my heroes, George

00:24:01.203 --> 00:24:06.643
Orwell, who described sport as “war minus the shooting”?

00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:16.789
OK then, that is it for today's episode on politics and the Olympic games I hope it's

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:21.359
been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and when it comes to the

00:24:21.389 --> 00:24:26.719
upcoming games in Tokyo and Beijing, well, you’ll have a bit of background to it.

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:31.129
Who knows what other political controversies might happens at these two..

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to our second members-only English Learning for

00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:10.464
Curious Minds podcast.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:18.264
I guess by now you probably know who I am, but if you need a reminder, I'm Alastair Budge the

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:21.204
founder of Leonardo English and the host of the show.

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:26.904
Firstly, thank you very much for your continued membership to Leonardo English.

00:00:27.144 --> 00:00:30.834
It couldn't be possible without you and I really am truly grateful.

00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:36.994
Today we are going to be talking about the poets of World War One.

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.184
We'll talk about why this war inspired such great poetry.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:49.479
We'll talk about the types of poetry it did inspire, how this changed during the four years of the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:57.699
war and the impact it has left behind on how we think about this war and how we think about war in

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.089
general.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.369
And of course we'll read some extracts of some of the most iconic poems from World War One.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:15.265
I had tested out the idea for this podcast on my wife who is not a native speaker, and she said she

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:20.785
thought it was too niche and too hard, but I thought it was at least worth a shot.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.390
I have faith that you'll be able to understand and you'll have the transcript and key vocabulary

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.950
there to help if you need.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.776
What's more, because it is probably a little harder than most, if you have questions about it or

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:42.626
there's anything that you didn't understand, please just email me directly and I'll be more than

00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:43.736
happy to explain things.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:51.821
Plus, there will be another members-only podcast in a couple of weeks about effective ways to

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.921
memorise and remember vocabulary.

00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:58.931
So that's a slightly easier topic, a slightly less niche podcast.

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:01.871
Okay, then.

00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:06.821
The First World War was, of course, a war like no other.

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:13.481
Over 65 million people fought in it, of whom almost 10 million lost their lives.

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:21.356
Yes, there were wars before where more people were killed and wars after where more people were

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:21.746
killed.

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:28.526
But the First World War is quite unique in terms of how it exists in our collective memory.

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:37.436
And now that anyone who fought in the First World War is dead - the last soldier died in 2012 - one

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:44.186
of the main ways in which the war is remembered, in the English language at least, is through the

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:46.106
poetry that was left behind.

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:55.586
While we can't really lump together the British war poets into just one category, what we can do is

00:02:55.586 --> 00:03:01.856
talk about the poetry that came out of the First World War as a way of understanding how public

00:03:01.856 --> 00:03:07.706
sentiment, how people felt about the war, changed over its four year course.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:17.031
What we see through the eyes of the young men who were sent to war is that war as a concept quickly

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:24.718
goes from this intangible romantic idea to something that's completely futile, completely without

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:32.063
purpose, that only serves to destroy the lives and souls of the youngest and brightest men and women

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:32.603
in the world.

00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:41.249
So let's take a little walk through this journey and take a moment to think about what these young

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:51.283
men and women had gone through On the 28th of June, 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:55.983
And within two months, the entire of Europe was at war.

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:06.837
Young British men filled with patriotic ideals, signed up to support the war effort and the general

00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:12.957
consensus, the general feeling, was that the war would be over by Christmas.

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:20.832
The poetry that came from the start of this period echoes this sort of feeling.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.060
Here's an extract from a poem called The Soldier by Rupert Brooke.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.670
If I should die, think only this of me,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.150
That there's some corner of a foreign field

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.760
That is forever England.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.290
There shall be

00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:43.915
In that rich earth, a richer dust concealed.

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:54.845
So it's completely idealistic, promoting the idea that men should be happy to give their lives for

00:04:54.845 --> 00:05:01.037
the higher concept of England, that nothing should be more glorious than to give your life in

00:05:01.037 --> 00:05:02.417
service of your country.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:11.477
Now we'll never know whether Brooke, the, the poet would have turned a little more cynical after he

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.457
saw the real horrors of war.

00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:25.127
He died of an infected mosquito bite in 1915 at the ripe old age of 27, just three weeks after the

00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.857
newspaper, The Times, had published that poem.

00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:38.182
The true horror of the war soon became apparent, and while at the start of the war, the poems had

00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:45.922
focused on these sentimental ideals of dying for one's country, of the glory of England, as the war

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:52.732
continued, the poets wrote more about the futility of war, of the human tragedy, and of the

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:56.092
disappointment of an entire generation of young men.

00:05:58.227 --> 00:06:04.797
It's notable, it's worth remembering, that the enemy in the vast majority of these poems isn't the

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.887
Germans, the enemy on the battlefield.

00:06:08.877 --> 00:06:10.947
There are two main enemies.

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:20.217
Firstly, the generals, the superiors, the politicians who were sending young men in their millions

00:06:20.337 --> 00:06:20.997
to their deaths.

00:06:22.752 --> 00:06:26.112
And secondly, the concept of war itself.

00:06:26.742 --> 00:06:28.122
War was the enemy.

00:06:28.482 --> 00:06:33.092
War was what was destroying the youth on both sides of the battlefield.

00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:42.642
Let's take a look first at an example of a poem that talks about the generals as the enemy.

00:06:44.152 --> 00:06:48.772
This poem is called The General, and it's by Siegfried Sassoon.

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:52.867
"Good morning, good morning!"

00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:53.887
the general said

00:06:54.427 --> 00:06:57.307
When we met him last week on our way to the line.

00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:02.587
Now the soldiers, he smiled at are most of 'em dead

00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:06.877
And we're cursing his staff for incompetent swine

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:11.467
.
"He's a cheery old card," grunted Harry to Jack

00:07:12.337 --> 00:07:16.087
As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack.

00:07:17.282 --> 00:07:20.402
But he did for them both by his plan of attack.

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:29.939
So if you hadn't got that, this is the story of a general who gets two young soldiers killed despite

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:32.099
having smiled at them the week before.

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:39.839
It's pretty telling that the anger here isn't directed against the battlefield enemy.

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:48.774
The young men writing these poems know that their opponents across no man's land are in an equally

00:07:48.774 --> 00:07:56.924
hopeless position, pushed by their own superiors to get up over the top and be slaughtered in

00:07:56.924 --> 00:07:58.004
exactly the same way.

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:06.039
They, in fact have a shared enemy - the generals, the superiors, the politicians who are pushing

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:08.709
them forward in this hopeless war.

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:15.299
And then this brings us to war itself as the true enemy.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:24.899
There are many poems we could choose from here now, but I think one of the most powerful is called

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:32.219
Suicide In The Trenches by probably the most famous war poet Siegfried Sasson, the same poet who

00:08:32.249 --> 00:08:32.999
wrote The General.

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:42.179
The vocabulary in this one is a little bit more complicated, but it's such a beautiful, moving one

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.039
that I think it's worth sharing.

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:47.909
So this is called Suicide In The Trenches.

00:08:49.589 --> 00:08:51.869
I knew a simple soldier boy

00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:54.959
Who grinned at life in empty joy,

00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:59.009
Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:02.329
And whistled early with the lark.

00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:06.799
In winter trenches, cowed and glum,

00:09:07.249 --> 00:09:10.339
With crumps and lice and lack of rum.

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:13.399
He put a bullet through his brain.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.619
No one spoke of him again.

00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:20.449
You smug faced cowards with kindling eye

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.019
Who cheer when soldier lads march by,

00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:27.559
Sneak home and pray you'll never know

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:31.159
The hell where youth and laughter go.

00:09:33.394 --> 00:09:38.684
I know some of those words may be a little bit unfamiliar, but I hope you get the gist.

00:09:40.244 --> 00:09:47.934
Sassoon, the poet, is an example of someone who started out with these patriotic ideals, enlisting

00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:55.314
in the army at the outbreak of war in 1914 but then became one of the war's greatest critics.

00:09:56.814 --> 00:10:00.984
It's also worth pointing out that not all war poetry went this way.

00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:08.784
There was plenty that continued the patriotic themes talking about the glory of dying for one's

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:16.134
country, of the camaraderie of the front line and of the fact that staying at home was the coward's

00:10:16.134 --> 00:10:21.204
thing to do and brave patriotic men should be going to the front.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:30.879
But it's certainly the anti-war war poetry that has captivated our imaginations and that most people

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:33.429
now associate with the First World War.

00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:35.949
Why is this?

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:43.959
Well, there's little debate that the anti-war poetry was accurate in its descriptions of life on the

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:44.379
front.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:51.834
It was obviously horrific and there is nothing romantic about being filled with machine gun bullets

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:55.404
or killed by nerve gas in a cold, muddy field.

00:10:57.804 --> 00:10:59.984
An entire generation was destroyed.

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:07.664
Those who died on the battlefield didn't return, of course, and those who did return were in many

00:11:07.664 --> 00:11:14.264
cases, mutilated, damaged, both physically and mentally from their experiences.

00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:23.859
The cynic might say that the fact that the anti-war poets are now the voice of the First World War

00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:33.549
is just because that aligns with the post-war view of wars being a negative thing, and because the

00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:40.749
antiwar poems were much more beautifully written and captivating of our imagination than the

00:11:40.749 --> 00:11:41.799
patriotic stuff.

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:49.479
But to those people, I'd definitely say that it's no bad thing that we are constantly reminded of

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:57.819
the horrors of war, of the human cost, and of the scale of the tragedy so that we can do everything

00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:00.789
we possibly can to avoid it happening again.

00:12:02.849 --> 00:12:10.559
Nobody really wants to go to war if it's not necessary, and the words of these young men just remind

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:14.279
us quite the horrors that were faced when people had to do so.

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:21.979
Well, I hope that this has at least been an interesting look into the world of the British war

00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:22.549
poets.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:30.309
I know this might have been not the most upbeat, the most joyous, of our episodes, but the words of

00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:32.469
these poets are just so powerful.

00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:40.689
I also know that poetry in a foreign language is something that's particularly difficult, but I hope

00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:46.539
that if you have the transcript and key vocabulary in front of you, this has been a bit easier than

00:12:46.539 --> 00:12:47.619
it might have been otherwise.

00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:55.326
Let me just finish by reading what is perhaps the most famous war poem, and that's one that's read

00:12:55.386 --> 00:13:01.506
every November the 11th, Armistice Day, as a way of remembering the loss of life suffered by these

00:13:01.506 --> 00:13:02.376
young men and women.

00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:08.716
It's called "In Flanders Fields", and it's written by John McCrae.

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:13.366
In Flanders fields the poppies blow

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:16.426
Between the crosses row on row,

00:13:16.846 --> 00:13:20.206
That Mark our place; and in the sky,

00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:23.116
The larks, still bravely singing, fly

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:26.206
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:28.426
We are the Dead.

00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:30.076
Short days ago

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:34.521
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:38.931
Loved and were loved, and now we lie

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:40.611
In Flanders fields.

00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:44.341
Take up our quarrel with the foe:

00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:47.661
To you from failing hands we throw

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:50.961
The torch; be yours to hold it high.

00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:53.541
If ye break faith with us who die,

00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:56.751
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

00:13:57.201 --> 00:13:58.251
In Flanders fields.

00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:01.881
Quite something, right?

00:14:03.471 --> 00:14:06.711
Again, this was a little bit of a test, this podcast.

00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:14.511
I know that today's one might've been quite a bit harder than usual, but I hope you have enjoyed it

00:14:14.511 --> 00:14:15.441
and found it interesting.

00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:21.411
We'll have another members-only podcast for you in a couple of weeks, and I promise that this will

00:14:21.411 --> 00:14:23.331
be a lot less niche.

00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:25.131
Let me know though.

00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:27.381
I'd love to know what you thought of this one.

00:14:28.686 --> 00:14:33.006
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:14:33.246 --> 00:14:36.846
I'm Alastair Budge and I'll catch you in the next episode.

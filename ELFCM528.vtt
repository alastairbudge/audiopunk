Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.190
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.450
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about one of the most famous

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.230
and controversial psychological experiments of all time, the Stanford Prison Experiment.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.230
To some observers, it was seen as yet more proof of how otherwise

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.950
law-abiding, normal humans can do horrific things to each other.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.520
So in this episode, we’ll talk about the purpose of the experiment,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.240
what actually happened, what it tells us about human psychology, and why

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.300
its greatest critics think it doesn’t really tell us that much at all.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.821
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the Stanford Prison Experiment.

00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:11.958
An unfortunate truth about humanity is that we humans are capable of

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:17.178
committing acts against our fellow humans that are utterly inhumane.

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:22.818
Men and women, who might otherwise live normal, kind lives,

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:27.438
under certain conditions, sometimes do horrific things.

00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:33.808
Unfortunately, we have tens of thousands of years of human history that shows this to be true,

00:01:34.418 --> 00:01:40.268
it is still the case today, and no doubt it will still be the case in thousands of years to come.

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:43.038
But…why?

00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:48.778
What is it about certain situations that can change a person’s behaviour?

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:53.858
Can otherwise normal, rational people, be turned

00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:57.788
into monsters, if placed in particular circumstances?

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:07.958
In August of 1971, a Stanford professor named Philip Zimbardo sought to answer this question.

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:13.778
He put out an advertisement in the local newspaper, which read:

00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:18.038
Male college students needed for psychological study of prison life.

00:02:18.758 --> 00:02:23.498
$15 per day for one to two weeks, beginning August 14th.

00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:32.486
For further information and applications, come to room 248, Jordan Hall, Stanford University.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.179
Slightly ominous.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.489
Male college students needed for psychological study of prison life.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.769
$15 per day for 1–2 weeks.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.879
Now, $15 in 1971 is around $110 in today’s money.

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:56.179
Not a colossal amount of money, by Californian standards at least, but enough to attract

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:02.269
a few university students to participate in a “psychological study of prison life”.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.569
75 students applied.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.309
They were interviewed, screened to check that they didn’t have any serious

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.479
medical problems, any psychological conditions, or a criminal record.

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.139
In other words, they needed to be regular university students.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.295
The group was whittled down to 24 participants,  who were split into two groups.

00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:33.595
Half were randomly assigned to be guards, and half were assigned to be prisoners.

00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:40.415
These 24 young men, all considered to be healthy, well-adjusted,

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:45.123
and average in almost every way, were ready to begin the experiment.

00:03:46.513 --> 00:03:50.713
The “guards” were asked to report to Stanford University on the

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:54.663
first day of the experiment to begin their training and orientation.

00:03:55.283 --> 00:03:59.753
They were given uniforms, batons, and reflective sunglasses to wear,

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:04.633
along with instructions on their role: to maintain order in the prison.

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:11.063
The “prisoners,” however, were told to wait at home for further instructions.

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:18.483
What they didn’t know was that their participation would begin with a surprise arrest.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.350
Without any warning, real police officers—yes, actual police officers—showed up at their homes.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.420
They were “arrested,” handcuffed, and taken to a police station.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.940
There, they were fingerprinted, photographed, and charged with offences like armed robbery.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.790
Of course, the charges weren’t real, and the participants knew they were part of an experiment.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.660
But the realistic nature of the arrest was designed to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.240
make them feel as though they had truly lost their freedom.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.588
After this mock arrest process, the prisoners were blindfolded and transported to the basement

00:05:01.808 --> 00:05:07.188
of Stanford University’s psychology building, which had been transformed into a makeshift prison.

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:13.405
When they arrived, their blindfolds were removed, and they were made to strip down,

00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:19.745
sprayed with what was described as a “delousing spray,” and given prison uniforms to wear.

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:25.195
The uniforms were simple but designed to be humiliating.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:30.975
Prisoners wore smocks, which were like long, shapeless dresses,

00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:35.035
and on their heads, they had to wear a nylon stocking cap.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:40.115
Around their ankles, they had chains that rattled as they

00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:43.365
walked, a constant reminder of their lack of freedom.

00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:49.905
Each prisoner was assigned a number, which was sewn onto their uniform.

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:56.935
From that point on, they were no longer addressed by their names but only by their numbers.

00:05:58.455 --> 00:06:00.585
This was all intentional.

00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:06.375
The idea was to make them feel like they had lost their identity and their individuality.

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.765
Now, on the other side of this “prison” were the guards.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:18.415
The guards were dressed in khaki uniforms, they had reflective sunglasses to make eye contact

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:24.925
impossible, and were carrying batons—though they were told not to use them for physical punishment.

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:32.045
The guards had been given a very simple instruction: maintain order in the prison.

00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:37.245
Beyond that, they were largely left to figure things out for themselves.

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:42.095
And at first, things were relatively calm.

00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:47.705
The prisoners followed the guards’ instructions, the guards kept watch, and Zimbardo

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:52.345
and his team observed everything from behind hidden cameras and microphones.

00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:58.375
But it didn’t take long for things to spiral out of control.

00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:02.395
On just the second day, the prisoners rebelled.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:08.305
They tore off their numbers, refused to leave their cells, and shouted at the guards.

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:16.541
The guards, who had been unsure of their authority at first, suddenly became much more aggressive.

00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:21.671
They used fire extinguishers to force prisoners back into their cells.

00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:25.571
They stripped some prisoners naked as a form of humiliation.

00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:33.031
And they began to enforce strict rules—rules that seemed to come out of nowhere.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:39.211
For example, prisoners were only allowed to go to the toilet at certain times.

00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:43.611
If they broke the rules or annoyed the guards, they were punished.

00:07:44.491 --> 00:07:48.361
Some were forced to do physical exercises like push-ups.

00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:55.631
Others were put into solitary confinement—a tiny, dark closet that could barely fit one person.

00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:03.421
And as the days went on, the punishments became more creative…and cruel.

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:09.481
One guard made prisoners clean the toilets with their bare hands.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:14.491
Another forced them to simulate sexual acts as a way of degrading them.

00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:19.401
What was shocking is that none of this was planned.

00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:23.711
The guards came up with these punishments on their own as if the

00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:27.811
power they had been given unleashed something darker inside them.

00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:34.381
As for the prisoners, they quickly fell into the roles that had been assigned to them.

00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:39.151
Some became passive, obeying every command without question.

00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:43.691
Others broke down emotionally, crying and screaming to be let out.

00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:50.641
One prisoner, referred to only as Prisoner 8612, began to have

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:55.921
what seemed like a complete mental breakdown after just 36 hours.

00:08:56.841 --> 00:09:00.676
He screamed at the guards, yelled that he wanted to leave, and

00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:04.266
even told Zimbardo that he felt like he was losing his mind.

00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:10.156
Instead of ending the experiment, Zimbardo initially tried to

00:09:10.156 --> 00:09:14.056
convince him to stay, saying that leaving would disappoint the others.

00:09:15.306 --> 00:09:19.176
But eventually, Prisoner 8612 was allowed to go.

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:25.276
After Prisoner 8612 was released, you might think that things would have settled down.

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:29.426
But instead, the opposite happened.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:32.096
The guards became even harsher.

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:35.366
It was as though they felt their authority had been challenged,

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:39.466
and they needed to reassert control over the prisoners.

00:09:40.806 --> 00:09:44.776
One of the ways they did this was by targeting the prisoners

00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:49.636
who they saw as leaders—those who were more likely to resist.

00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:55.436
The guards singled them out for extra punishment, like longer periods

00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:59.586
in solitary confinement or forcing them to do degrading tasks.

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:06.604
And while some prisoners resisted, others started to turn on each other.

00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:12.404
Zimbardo and his team had planted the idea that some prisoners

00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:16.594
might be secretly working with the guards, acting as informants.

00:10:18.254 --> 00:10:22.006
This led to paranoia and division among the prisoners.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:25.756
Instead of uniting against the guards, they became

00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:29.396
suspicious of one another, which made them easier to control.

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:35.406
Now, let’s stop for a moment and remember that all of the participants,

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:40.406
both the guards and the prisoners, knew that this was a simulation,

00:10:40.796 --> 00:10:45.195
that they weren’t really inside a prison, and it was all an experiment.

00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:52.745
But on both sides, something about this situation and its power imbalance,

00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:57.645
one group in control and the other being subjugated, this seemed to flip

00:10:57.765 --> 00:11:02.875
something in their minds and make them almost forget that it wasn’t real.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:10.045
And day by day, the prison environment became more and more oppressive.

00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:14.605
The guards introduced something they called “privilege cells.”

00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:19.565
Prisoners in these cells were given slightly better treatment—they

00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:22.665
could eat better food, or they didn’t have to wear chains.

00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:29.955
But to stay in the privilege cell, prisoners had to obey the guards without question.

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:33.325
This was a psychological tactic.

00:11:33.715 --> 00:11:37.385
It created jealousy and mistrust among the prisoners,

00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:40.725
breaking down any sense of solidarity they might have had.

00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:46.375
By the fourth day, the situation had grown even darker.

00:11:47.825 --> 00:11:53.185
One prisoner, referred to as Prisoner 819, had an emotional breakdown.

00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:56.875
He cried uncontrollably and refused to eat.

00:11:58.068 --> 00:12:01.535
Zimbardo and his team decided to let him leave the experiment.

00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:06.585
But as he was preparing to go, something strange happened.

00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:12.305
While Prisoner 819 was in another room, one of the guards made

00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:16.505
the other prisoners chant: “Prisoner #819 is a bad prisoner.

00:12:16.765 --> 00:12:20.717
Because of what Prisoner 819 did, my cell is a mess, Mr.

00:12:20.727 --> 00:12:21.687
Correctional Officer.”

00:12:23.097 --> 00:12:27.467
Hearing this, Prisoner 819 broke down even further.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:35.127
He felt overwhelming guilt and begged to return to the prison to prove he wasn’t a bad prisoner.

00:12:36.197 --> 00:12:38.347
Zimbardo had to step in.

00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:42.897
He reminded Prisoner 819 that he wasn’t a real prisoner, that this

00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:46.707
was just an experiment, and that he could leave whenever he wanted.

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:51.107
Only then did Prisoner 819 agree to walk.

00:12:52.107 --> 00:12:55.547
For Zimbardo, this moment was a wake-up call.

00:12:56.227 --> 00:13:01.847
The line between reality and the roles they were playing had become dangerously blurred.

00:13:03.257 --> 00:13:07.817
The final turning point came when one of Zimbardo’s graduate students and

00:13:07.817 --> 00:13:12.564
his future wife, Christina Maslach, visited the prison on the sixth day.

00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:16.794
Maslach had come to observe the experiment.

00:13:17.224 --> 00:13:20.284
But what she saw shocked her.

00:13:21.104 --> 00:13:24.584
She watched as the guards humiliated the prisoners,

00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:28.818
screaming at them and making them perform degrading tasks.

00:13:29.628 --> 00:13:34.688
She confronted Zimbardo and demanded to know how he could allow this to continue.

00:13:35.478 --> 00:13:42.048
Maslach told him that the experiment was unethical and that the prisoners were suffering real harm.

00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:45.728
At first, Zimbardo resisted.

00:13:46.398 --> 00:13:51.548
He argued that the experiment was revealing important truths about human behaviour.

00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:56.548
But then, he realised that he had become part of the problem.

00:13:57.368 --> 00:14:02.498
He wasn’t just an observer—he was acting like the prison warden, and it

00:14:02.498 --> 00:14:07.188
was he who was enabling and encouraging the guards’ abusive behaviour.

00:14:08.698 --> 00:14:12.188
As the designer of the experiment, he should have been

00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:16.328
a neutral observer, but he was an active participant.

00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:22.198
That same night, Zimbardo made the decision to end the experiment.

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:28.648
It had been planned to last for two weeks, but it was stopped after just six days.

00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:35.321
When the experiment was over, Zimbardo and his team reflected on what they had seen.

00:14:36.621 --> 00:14:41.571
The results seemed to show that ordinary people could quickly conform

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:46.471
to roles of authority or submission, even in a short period of time.

00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:54.901
The guards, many of whom had never shown signs of cruelty before, became aggressive and sadistic.

00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.811
The prisoners, who were healthy and confident at the

00:14:58.811 --> 00:15:03.291
start, became passive, anxious, and even traumatised.

00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:10.241
Zimbardo called this the power of the “situation.” He argued that it wasn’t that

00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:16.198
the guards were bad people but that the situation itself brought out bad behaviour.

00:15:17.554 --> 00:15:22.564
It was a convenient explanation and would help rationalise the behaviour

00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:27.254
of things like prison guards in Nazi concentration camps, and later on,

00:15:27.504 --> 00:15:32.224
would be used to explain the atrocities at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.

00:15:32.764 --> 00:15:38.004
It was not the people who were fundamentally evil, but that the nature of

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:42.591
the situation brought out this capacity for evil that exists within us.

00:15:43.861 --> 00:15:48.031
But not everyone agreed with Zimbardo’s conclusions.

00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:55.551
And especially in recent years, the Stanford Prison Experiment has faced a lot of criticism.

00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:02.261
First of all, many people have questioned the scientific validity of the experiment.

00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:07.351
For an experiment to be scientifically valid, it needs to be

00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:11.161
carefully controlled, with clear instructions and procedures.

00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:16.541
However, critics argue that Zimbardo didn’t do this.

00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:21.961
For example, the guards were not given strict guidelines on how to behave,

00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:27.491
and some say that Zimbardo encouraged them to act more aggressively.

00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:34.151
One former guard, in an interview years later, said that Zimbardo had given them

00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:37.811
the impression that they were supposed to make life difficult for the prisoners.

00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:45.051
This has led some to argue that the experiment wasn’t really observing natural behaviour—it was

00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:50.801
almost like a performance, with the guards trying to live up to what they thought Zimbardo wanted.

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:57.379
Another related criticism is that the participants knew they were in an experiment.

00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:02.969
They were university students, not professional prison guards or actual prisoners.

00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:08.339
Critics argue that the participants might have been exaggerating their

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.709
behaviour because they felt like they were playing a role, like they were

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:17.209
expected to behave in a certain way, and therefore, that’s what they did.

00:17:17.989 --> 00:17:22.519
Given that they had no criminal record and no direct experience of prison,

00:17:22.969 --> 00:17:28.269
their only point of reference would probably have been prison movies, so one

00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:32.589
criticism is that they would have based their behaviour on what they had seen in

00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:37.829
films, which of course, is not a truly accurate representation of prison life.

00:17:38.899 --> 00:17:44.269
And on the subject of truly representing real life, there is the criticism that

00:17:44.269 --> 00:17:48.949
the participants in the experiment didn’t accurately reflect real-life prisons.

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:55.409
Real guards and prisoners come from very different backgrounds and have very different motivations.

00:17:56.109 --> 00:18:02.409
All the guards and all the prisoners were white, middle-class, psychologically healthy university

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:09.669
students, and that simply isn’t a representative sample of a prison, let alone society more widely.

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.059
And then there’s the question of ethics.

00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:18.299
Today, the Stanford Prison Experiment would never be allowed to happen.

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:24.952
Modern ethical guidelines for  psychological experiments would see it as far too harmful.

00:18:25.992 --> 00:18:30.622
The participants were subjected to extreme stress, humiliation, and

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:35.752
emotional trauma—all things that researchers today are required to avoid.

00:18:37.092 --> 00:18:41.982
In fact, after the Stanford Prison Experiment, the field of psychology

00:18:42.332 --> 00:18:46.762
tightened its rules for what could and couldn’t be done in experiments.

00:18:47.812 --> 00:18:52.382
Researchers now have to ensure the safety and well-being of their participants,

00:18:52.682 --> 00:18:57.292
and they must get approval from ethics committees before starting any study.

00:18:58.142 --> 00:19:02.192
Finally, there’s the question of what the experiment actually tells us.

00:19:03.162 --> 00:19:07.382
Zimbardo argued that it showed how ordinary people could

00:19:07.382 --> 00:19:10.992
commit cruel acts when placed in certain situations.

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:16.182
However, critics have said this conclusion is too simplistic.

00:19:16.912 --> 00:19:21.392
Human behaviour is complex, and the experiment doesn’t account for

00:19:21.432 --> 00:19:26.301
other factors like personality, individual morality, or personal choice.

00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:32.348
Yes, this experiment shows that people can behave in unusual ways

00:19:32.468 --> 00:19:37.308
in unusual situations, but it is not definitive proof of anything.

00:19:38.588 --> 00:19:42.768
Despite its flaws, the Stanford Prison Experiment has had a huge

00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:47.488
impact on how we think about human behaviour, power, and authority.

00:19:48.218 --> 00:19:52.878
It’s still widely discussed in psychology classes around the world, often as an

00:19:52.878 --> 00:19:58.028
example of both the power of social roles and the dangers of unethical research.

00:19:59.238 --> 00:20:02.648
The experiment also raised important questions about

00:20:02.648 --> 00:20:05.728
the systems and structures we create as a society.

00:20:06.488 --> 00:20:11.388
It highlighted how institutions—whether prisons, workplaces, or

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:15.108
even schools—can shape the behaviour of the people within them.

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:21.088
So, to wrap things up, what can we take away from the Stanford Prison Experiment?

00:20:21.748 --> 00:20:24.858
At the very least, it’s a reminder of how much our

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:28.068
environment and social roles can influence the way we act.

00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:32.758
It shows us that even ordinary people can behave in extraordinary

00:20:32.758 --> 00:20:38.388
ways—sometimes for the worse—when placed in situations of power or control.

00:20:39.448 --> 00:20:42.378
But it’s also a reminder to be critical.

00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:49.578
Not everything we see, even in famous experiments, is quite as straightforward as it seems.

00:20:51.428 --> 00:20:56.868
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Stanford Prison Experiment, one of the

00:20:56.868 --> 00:21:02.088
most famous psychological experiments of all time, but also one of the most controversial.

00:21:02.888 --> 00:21:05.818
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:06.148 --> 00:21:10.128
What conclusions do you think we can draw from this experiment, if any?

00:21:10.698 --> 00:21:15.338
Does it tell us anything we didn’t know already, or is it yet another reminder

00:21:15.478 --> 00:21:19.848
of how complex human behaviour is, and we shouldn’t read too much into it?

00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:23.819
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:17.142
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:21.712
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:28.442
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The British Empire.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:35.522
It’s the story of how one little island gained control over almost a quarter

00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:41.382
of the world’s population, a quarter of the total land area, and left a

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:46.292
lasting legacy that we are still struggling to properly come to terms with.

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:51.332
Now, the British Empire is a long and complicated subject,

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:55.962
and 20 minutes is far too little time to do it justice.

00:00:57.032 --> 00:01:02.522
In today’s episode we’ll go over how it started, the different stages of

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:08.502
the empire, what life was actually like under the British, and talk about

00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:13.572
some of the complications that the imperial legacy has left the world with.

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:17.832
So, without further ado, let’s get started.

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:24.302
There is a saying that the sun never set on the British Empire.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:32.762
At its zenith, at its greatest point, it stretched over huge swathes of the world,

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:41.342
covering 35 million kilometres squared, with 412 million people living under its rule.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:47.362
It propelled English to be the world’s lingua franca, the common language,

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:52.702
and if there were no empire, you probably wouldn’t be learning English today.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:02:00.222
The British Empire wasn’t the first empire, of course, Britain didn’t invent the concept of empire.

00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:06.602
From the Egyptians to the Romans, The Mongols to the Ottomans, societies

00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:11.902
had sought to expand their territory for all manner of different reasons.

00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:17.622
Indeed, large parts of Britain were conquered by other empires.

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:24.722
It was conquered by the Romans in 84 AD, then in 1066 it

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:28.542
was conquered again by William the Conqueror, a Norman.

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:35.522
At the start of the Middle Ages, Britain, as a unified country, didn’t exist.

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:39.602
England, Scotland and Wales were all separate countries.

00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:47.172
Then at the end of the 13th century England conquered Wales, and it wasn’t until

00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:54.632
1707 that England, Wales and Scotland united to become the Kingdom of Great Britain.

00:02:55.582 --> 00:03:00.422
In this episode I’ll normally refer to Britain, even if

00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:04.432
the Kingdom of Britain wasn’t actually formed until 1707.

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:13.332
Towards the end of the 15th century and during the 16th century Spain and Portugal had started their

00:03:13.372 --> 00:03:21.292
own global exploration, setting off across the Atlantic to the Americas, discovering large amounts

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:28.512
of precious metals, growing rich off the profits, and starting their own empires in Latin America.

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:35.802
Britain saw how profitable this naval exploration was for Spain and

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:42.102
Portugal, and started sending ships off to discover new, virgin territory

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:47.482
that could be claimed for Britain, to look for Britain’s El Dorado.

00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:56.372
This started as early as 1497, when the Italian Explorer John Cabot, or

00:03:56.682 --> 00:04:02.662
Giovanni Caboto, was sent by King Henry VIII of England across the Atlantic.

00:04:03.552 --> 00:04:09.262
He landed in what’s now Canada, but no great settlement was made.

00:04:10.422 --> 00:04:19.142
It wasn’t to be until just under 100 years later, in 1585, that the first English colonies were

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:27.032
formed in North America, when an explorer called Sir Walter Raleigh formed a settlement in Virginia.

00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:33.582
British settlers continued to land on the east coast of North America, claiming

00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:38.832
territory on behalf of the British monarch, on behalf of the British king.

00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:43.422
At the same time they ventured south, towards the colonies

00:04:43.672 --> 00:04:47.072
held by the Spanish and Portuguese in the Caribbean.

00:04:48.082 --> 00:04:51.922
At the start of the 17th century Britain took control of

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:55.752
the Caribbean islands of St Kitts, Barbados and Antigua.

00:04:57.182 --> 00:05:02.752
The British learned how to grow sugar, and built large plantations

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:07.152
on these islands using slaves who were brought over from Africa.

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:14.242
Now, the British Empire, especially in the Americas, was enabled by slavery.

00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:16.752
It wouldn’t have been possible without it.

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:23.902
It’s believed that British ships transported almost 3 million slaves from

00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:29.192
Africa to the Americas, out of a total of around 12 million Africans who

00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:34.462
were taken from their homeland, piled into ships and sold into slavery.

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:41.852
It’s one of the darkest parts of the story of the British Empire, which is often brushed under the

00:05:41.852 --> 00:05:48.842
carpet and not spoken about, it’s conveniently forgotten, when discussing the empire in Britain.

00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:55.992
Especially with the Black Lives Matter movement there has been a renewed need to

00:05:55.992 --> 00:06:03.902
confront and discuss quite how awful this was, and there’s renewed discussion of how

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:09.602
we treat people who had previously been considered masters of the British Empire.

00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:16.042
You’ve probably seen clips of statues being torn down in Britain, and

00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:20.882
debates about things like whether names of buildings should be changed.

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:28.032
Evidently, it’s a very complicated subject, but it’s certainly a good thing that there is a

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:35.122
growing understanding of quite how inseparable the British Empire and the slave trade were.

00:06:36.322 --> 00:06:41.292
Boosted by favourable conditions for growing products like cotton and sugar,

00:06:41.712 --> 00:06:47.392
and powered by slave labour, Britain’s power and wealth continued to grow.

00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:52.322
It was growing rich off the proceeds of its plantations and

00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:55.852
colonies, which were paying taxes to the British monarch.

00:06:56.842 --> 00:07:02.682
And up until the mid 18th century, the going was pretty good for Britain.

00:07:03.512 --> 00:07:08.292
Its colonies included most of the eastern part of what’s now the US

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:14.112
and Canada, as well as Caribbean islands such as Jamaica and Barbados.

00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:19.542
But for the colonies that were paying taxes to the British, and having

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:25.142
their natural resources sent back to Europe, this wasn’t a great deal.

00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:27.452
They weren’t getting much in return.

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:34.012
For the Caribbean colonies, there wasn’t a huge amount they could do about this.

00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:41.792
But the American colonies were growing stronger, and in 1776 thirteen American

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:47.822
colonies joined together and declared that they would stop paying taxes to the

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:53.352
British monarch, and they would club together to form the United States of America.

00:07:54.702 --> 00:08:00.292
The British king, King George III, didn’t think much of this, so sent

00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:04.942
troops to fight the Americans, starting the American War of Independence.

00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:09.162
It wasn’t just the British against the Americans though.

00:08:09.612 --> 00:08:15.482
The French, the Spanish and the Dutch joined forces with the Americans as a way to

00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:22.252
undermine British power and ultimately the Americans won the war, gaining independence

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:29.012
from Britain on the 4th of July 1776, a day that’s now celebrated as Independence Day.

00:08:30.322 --> 00:08:34.582
For Britain, and the British Empire, this was a big problem.

00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:40.422
These 13 colonies formed the largest and most powerful part of

00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:45.212
its empire at the time, and they were now gone, never to return.

00:08:46.582 --> 00:08:53.132
The loss of America to the empire is often considered the end of the first

00:08:53.152 --> 00:08:58.632
British Empire, but it most definitely wasn’t the end of The British Empire.

00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:05.592
Britain had experienced the power that empire brings, so started

00:09:05.592 --> 00:09:10.172
to focus its attention elsewhere, and specifically, to the east.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:15.802
In 1787, as you may have learned about in the last episode on

00:09:15.842 --> 00:09:20.342
Penal Colonies, the first settlement was established in Australia.

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:26.032
But Australia was really a minor feature in the British Empire.

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:31.172
The jewel in the crown, as it was nicknamed, was India.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:37.452
There had actually been British settlers in India since 1608,

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:43.192
and Britain had been building up trading outposts near the coast.

00:09:44.412 --> 00:09:50.922
Unlike in the Americas, it didn’t go in and immediately enslave the local population.

00:09:51.402 --> 00:09:56.332
The British Empire in India was also really pushed forward by a

00:09:56.492 --> 00:10:01.822
semi-private company, not by the British government itself directly.

00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:08.122
This company was called the East India Company, and had actually been set

00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:14.702
up in the year 1599 for the purposes of trade with India and East Asia.

00:10:15.412 --> 00:10:23.042
Although it was a private company, it became heavily involved with politics, and it also had its

00:10:23.182 --> 00:10:30.342
own private army, with over a quarter of a million soldiers, a larger army than the British army.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:39.382
It grew and grew in power in India, exporting spices and tea back to Europe, and also getting

00:10:39.392 --> 00:10:46.752
heavily involved in the opium trade, triggering the Opium Wars with China in the mid-19th century.

00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:52.042
As the East India Company continued to grow and grow in strength, it

00:10:52.052 --> 00:10:57.062
started stretching its military muscles against the local population.

00:10:57.192 --> 00:11:03.392
After a series of battles, it proved victorious over the local rulers,

00:11:03.772 --> 00:11:10.192
and morphed from a purely trading company to a political and governmental

00:11:10.422 --> 00:11:15.572
organisation, essentially taking over the administration of India.

00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:24.712
This period, called Company Rule, when most of what’s now India was controlled by a British company,

00:11:25.162 --> 00:11:33.962
began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when the rule of India was passed to the British crown.

00:11:35.402 --> 00:11:40.542
Both during the Company Rule period and while it was under the rule

00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:45.822
of the crown, the British imposed British cultural norms on the

00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:50.822
local population, and created British-style institutions in India.

00:11:52.072 --> 00:11:56.942
Although there was some pretty awful treatment of the local Indian population,

00:11:57.412 --> 00:12:03.372
a major difference between the treatment of the Indians vs the non-British

00:12:03.372 --> 00:12:10.022
population in places like the Caribbean was that the Indians were viewed more as

00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:15.292
equals to the British, perhaps with less developed institutions, a different view

00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:20.292
of the rule of law, but a people to deal with on a similar level nonetheless.

00:12:21.432 --> 00:12:27.852
In the Caribbean, the black, enslaved, population was viewed as inferior,

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:32.872
viewed as property to be bought and sold, not even in the same category.

00:12:34.052 --> 00:12:38.062
You can put this down to simple racism, which of course, it is.

00:12:38.662 --> 00:12:43.062
There’s also the factor that India was initially viewed as a trading

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:48.452
partner, merchants to do business with, rather than completely virgin

00:12:48.452 --> 00:12:53.872
territory to exploit full of culturally and racially inferior people.

00:12:55.052 --> 00:13:00.702
It’s a subject that historians are still debating, but the point is that there’s

00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:07.172
no one blanket answer to how the British treated the people living in its colonies.

00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:12.802
But the British weren’t content just with India though, and in the 19th century

00:13:13.002 --> 00:13:19.142
large parts of Africa and SouthEast Asia were also swept up into the British empire.

00:13:20.752 --> 00:13:27.122
There are almost too many to name, but modern day Cameroon, Egypt, The Gambia,

00:13:27.212 --> 00:13:33.542
Ghana, Kenya, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Malta, Myanmar, Mauritius, Oman, Pakistan,

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:39.552
South Africa, Sudan and Zimbabwe, along with many others, were all British colonies.

00:13:40.682 --> 00:13:46.152
The heyday, the peak for the British Empire came at the start of the 20th

00:13:46.172 --> 00:13:52.262
century, which is quite mad to think - this was only just over 100 years ago.

00:13:53.202 --> 00:13:57.222
Britain controlled a quarter of the Earth’s land area, with

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:01.072
a quarter of its population ruled by the British monarch.

00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:05.642
But beneath the surface, things were starting to crumble.

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:11.442
Throughout British colonial history there had been uprisings.

00:14:12.582 --> 00:14:16.032
Some had succeeded, like the American War of Independence.

00:14:16.782 --> 00:14:20.522
Others had been brutally crushed, like the Baptist

00:14:20.522 --> 00:14:25.812
War in Jamaica in 1831 or the Indian Mutiny of 1857.

00:14:27.392 --> 00:14:33.922
But even those that were crushed, often with a large human cost, they created even

00:14:33.972 --> 00:14:40.542
more animosity in the local population towards their British rulers, and triggered

00:14:40.552 --> 00:14:46.552
debate back in Britain about whether it was indeed right to have such a large empire,

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:52.772
and to keep so many people of different cultures and traditions under British rule.

00:14:54.072 --> 00:15:00.717
The Declaration of The Rights of Man and The Citizen had come in 1789, and there

00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:06.702
had been an increasing understanding of people’s rights to be treated as human

00:15:06.702 --> 00:15:11.892
beings, to control their own destiny and not be under the control of others.

00:15:13.172 --> 00:15:18.172
Indeed, at the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 one of the big

00:15:18.312 --> 00:15:23.882
concepts promoted was the right for a country to administer itself.

00:15:25.122 --> 00:15:31.502
It was hard, and certainly hypocritical, for Britain to promote this idea while

00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:36.912
it was the largest administrator of other countries in the history of the world.

00:15:38.122 --> 00:15:41.472
Maintaining an empire was also very expensive.

00:15:42.412 --> 00:15:49.362
It did of course bring in large amounts of money through trade and taxes, but controlling

00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:55.392
the local population and stopping uprisings was a difficult and expensive task.

00:15:56.512 --> 00:16:01.452
At the end of the Second World War, Britain was financially in a pretty

00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:06.842
poor position and it could no longer really afford to keep its empire.

00:16:08.422 --> 00:16:14.012
There was also a growing feeling among several colonies that had contributed hundreds

00:16:14.012 --> 00:16:19.612
of thousands of soldiers to the war effort that they had deserved the right to

00:16:19.642 --> 00:16:26.592
independence, and pro-independence movements started to bubble up across the globe.

00:16:27.822 --> 00:16:34.302
Long story short, one by one the vast majority of Britain’s colonies were either

00:16:34.542 --> 00:16:41.542
given independence by Britain or there were rebellions, and independence was declared.

00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:50.232
Now there are only 14 colonies left, they’re called British Overseas Territories, and they’re

00:16:50.232 --> 00:16:56.862
mainly small islands, tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

00:16:58.182 --> 00:17:03.442
Although the legacy of British colonial rule is undeniable, what is still

00:17:03.452 --> 00:17:08.422
very much debated is how much was positive and how much was negative.

00:17:09.922 --> 00:17:15.592
Of course, it’s impossible to generalise here, and opinions will differ

00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:20.012
hugely depending on the country and of course within the country.

00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:26.512
Some of the advantages that colonial rule is said to have brought include the

00:17:26.822 --> 00:17:32.742
implementation of bureaucratic institutions and the building of infrastructure.

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:41.202
India, for example, is now the world’s largest democracy, and the East India Company built a

00:17:41.202 --> 00:17:47.372
large railway network throughout the country that of course was left behind when the British left.

00:17:48.472 --> 00:17:55.272
But the argument that Britain brought infrastructure, stability and culture to so

00:17:55.272 --> 00:18:02.022
called ‘barbarian’ regions is countered by the fact that we have no way to know what

00:18:02.022 --> 00:18:07.102
would have happened to these countries if they hadn't been subjected to British rule.

00:18:07.982 --> 00:18:12.792
Japan, for example, was never colonised by the British, and has

00:18:12.812 --> 00:18:16.702
managed to develop into one of the world’s most successful countries.

00:18:17.522 --> 00:18:24.052
And looking at countries that were colonised by Britain vs those that weren’t, it’s hard

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:29.522
to make the case that being part of the British empire left them all in a better position.

00:18:30.782 --> 00:18:33.812
There are not many success stories that one can point

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:38.022
at of ex-colonial countries, especially in Africa.

00:18:38.812 --> 00:18:45.812
On the other hand, the one that is most commonly used as an example of a booming ex British

00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:53.512
colony is Singapore, but it’s hard to attribute its success to being part of the British Empire.

00:18:54.642 --> 00:19:00.472
Of course, the enslavement of millions of Africans is a hideous aspect of the British

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:07.242
Empire, as is the persecution of indigenous peoples in North America and Australia, and

00:19:07.512 --> 00:19:12.382
I don’t think there are any supporters of the British Empire that would try to deny that.

00:19:13.162 --> 00:19:16.742
So, was the British Empire a good or bad thing?

00:19:17.772 --> 00:19:21.002
The answer to that question is definitely ‘it’s

00:19:21.002 --> 00:19:24.542
complicated’, and it’s a bit of a silly question really.

00:19:25.522 --> 00:19:27.432
Good or bad for whom?

00:19:27.722 --> 00:19:28.612
And when?

00:19:29.112 --> 00:19:29.892
And where?

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:30.892
And why?

00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:33.492
One thing is for sure though.

00:19:33.942 --> 00:19:39.772
It certainly did happen, it’s very complicated, and trying to avoid

00:19:39.852 --> 00:19:45.462
talking about it and pretending that it didn’t happen doesn’t help anybody.

00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:50.292
OK then, that is it for The British Empire.

00:19:51.002 --> 00:19:56.212
It’s a fascinating subject, and we really have only just scratched the surface.

00:19:57.132 --> 00:20:02.632
I know we could do individual episodes on probably a hundred different aspects of the

00:20:02.632 --> 00:20:08.712
empire, all of which would be interesting in their different ways, but I hope that this

00:20:08.712 --> 00:20:14.922
has at least given you an overview of what happened, and quite how complicated it is.

00:20:16.192 --> 00:20:19.792
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

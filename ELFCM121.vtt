Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.180
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.760
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.660
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the time that Henry Ford, the boss

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.210
of the Ford Motor Company, tried to build a huge rubber plantation in the Amazon rainforest.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.670
The name of his creation was Fordlândia.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.600
It's a fantastic story, and I have to give a shout out to a member of Leonardo

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.950
English, an amazing lady called Susana, who requested an episode on it.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.010
So, thank you Susana, I hope you’ll enjoy today’s episode.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.800
OK, then, let’s get started.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:04.359
You will, no doubt, have heard of the Ford Motor Company,

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.249
the American car company, and its iconic founder, Henry Ford.

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:15.009
Henry Ford had introduced the Model T to the world in

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:20.479
1908, and created the first affordable, mass-market car.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.049
You need a lot of different products to make the body of a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.469
car, but that car isn’t going to go anywhere without tyres.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.169
And what do you need for tyres?

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.139
Rubber.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.849
Brazil had historically been the world’s capital for rubber.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.919
Rubber trees grew naturally in the Amazon rainforest, and up until the end of the 19th century

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:55.089
Brazil was the only country in the world that exported rubber in any serious quantities.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.459
Brazilians that owned rubber plantations grew fabulously wealthy as the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:06.389
demand for rubber increased, and it was a great boost for the economy.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.609
Indeed, this period was nicknamed the Amazon rubber boom.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:17.409
But just because Brazil was the only place that rubber grew naturally,

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.119
it didn’t mean it was the only country in the world where it could grow.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:32.029
In 1876 an intrepid Englishman called Henry Wickham managed to export a large batch of rubber tree

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:39.939
seeds out of Brazil, shipped them to London, and then took them to Malaysia, which was at the time a

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:46.479
British colony, as well as to other colonies such as Sri Lanka, which was called Ceylon at the time.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:54.029
Malaysia, and these other colonies, proved to be fantastic places for growing rubber.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.959
Rubber trees in Brazil were frequently attacked by pests and suffered from

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.579
disease, and this wasn’t nearly as much of a problem in places like Malaysia.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:13.139
The British, with their Malaysian trees, were able to produce just as much rubber

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:19.129
as the Brazilians could, at a lower price, and by the start of the 20th century

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:25.549
the Brazilian stronghold, the Brazilian monopoly on the rubber industry was over.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.519
Companies now bought British rubber, not Brazilian rubber.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.909
Naturally, given that he was selling 40% of all of the cars in America,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.339
and all these cars needed tyres, Henry Ford needed to buy a lot of rubber.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.969
But he didn’t like being dependent on the British, and their colonial rubber.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.439
Not only would the rubber take a long time to get to Ford’s factories

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.079
in the US, but he had no control over that part of the supply chain.

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:08.369
Henry Ford was reportedly a huge control freak, and he wasn’t happy with this situation.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:16.109
He also knew that the Brazilians were suffering, as their rubber industry had been hugely damaged.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.109
Brazil was a lot closer to America than East Asia was.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.589
Rubber grew naturally in Brazil, and there was a huge amount of land.

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:34.109
So, what if Ford applied the same business practices and skill that he had used to build

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:39.959
very efficient factories in America to build a new rubber plantation in the Amazon?

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.869
He would get his own supply of rubber, and wouldn’t be beholden to the British.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.199
The Brazilians would have a large customer, probably the world’s biggest

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:56.619
customer for rubber, and this would give their economy a much-needed boost.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:05.819
It sounded like a win-win situation, and in the early 1920s Henry Ford sent some of his employees

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:12.399
to Brazil to try to negotiate with the Brazilian government, and find some suitable land.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:18.099
As expected, the Brazilian government sensed an opportunity,

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:23.139
and offered Ford a huge patch of land in the Amazon rainforest.

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:31.089
Specifically, they offered him about 10,000 km squared to build a huge rubber plantation.

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.839
Ford wouldn’t have to pay any export taxes, but he would

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:43.259
have to pay the Brazilian government 9% of the profits.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:48.899
10,000 km squared is the kind of number that sounds large, but just to give

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:54.649
you an idea of how big that actually is, it’s about the size of Jamaica, it’s

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:00.699
about 10 times the size of Greater London and 20 times the size of Madrid.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.659
It was a huge amount of land.

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:11.039
But Ford wasn’t only interested in creating a place to produce rubber; he wanted

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.479
to create a community, he wanted to build more than just a rubber plantation.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:22.839
In Detroit, where Ford was based, the Ford factory had

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.999
been instrumental in creating the American middle class.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.899
The company paid a fair wage, it paid more than the

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.679
average salary, and it took care of its employees.

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:42.969
Henry Ford had this paternalistic view of the role of a company, that it was the role

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:48.659
of a company to look after its employees, not just to make as much money as possible.

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:57.749
That might seem like a slightly revolutionary idea now, but 100 years ago it was even more so.

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:05.669
Ford believed that he could recreate his successes in America in the Amazon,  so he

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:12.749
sought to build a kind of mid-western town, an American town, in the heart of the Amazon.

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:16.949
The name of that town was Fordlandia.

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:25.099
Fordlandia was to be built a day and a half’s boat ride up the Amazon, in a state called Para.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:32.249
For the non-Brazilians out there who need an explanation of where exactly that is,

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:38.739
it’s right at the north of Brazil, just a few hundred kilometres south of the equator.

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:46.569
Construction started and by 1928, Ford’s dream rubber city was completed.

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:52.769
It had schools, a hospital, a swimming pool, a golf course - everything

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:57.849
that Ford would have expected there to be in a civilised American town.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:01.869
And of course, there were huge rubber plantations.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.499
It was a daring move, a very bold move.

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:12.169
Henry Ford hadn’t even visited the site, and he hadn’t commissioned

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:17.679
any sort of real survey of the land before going ahead with the deal.

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:23.259
He also didn’t hire any botanists, or take any advice

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:26.909
from any experts on how to actually grow rubber.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:36.119
Reportedly he hated experts, and he had complete conviction in his own genius and business ability.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:43.979
He had essentially created the entire automobile industry, and became one of the richest

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:50.119
men in America, so he didn’t need to listen to any experts about what was and wasn’t

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:56.339
possible, especially when it came to something as simple as what was really just farming.

00:08:56.999 --> 00:08:58.609
Or so Ford thought.

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:04.029
Fordlandia was built, and managers from Ford America

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:07.589
were shipped down to manage Henry Ford’s creation.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:13.679
To work on the rubber plantation, the American managers hired local workers.

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:20.209
They paid them double the normal rate in Brazil, and understandably had no

00:09:20.229 --> 00:09:25.599
problem finding people willing to work on this new, exciting American development.

00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:33.159
Fordlandia was in the middle of nowhere, there was nothing around it but the Amazon rainforest.

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:38.789
So most of the workers lived, worked, and played in the complex.

00:09:39.939 --> 00:09:45.219
But they soon found that their ideas of how they wanted to live their lives,

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:51.119
and Ford’s idea of how a good life should be lived, weren’t exactly the same.

00:09:52.449 --> 00:09:58.059
With his paternalistic view of the role of a company, Ford believed that people

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:02.599
living in Fordlandia, whether those were the Americans or the Brazilians,

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:07.479
should live in a certain way, regardless of their cultural background.

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:12.299
There was no meat served, as Ford was a vegetarian.

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:18.449
Alcohol was banned - Ford had been a great supporter of prohibition in the US.

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:25.039
Prostitution was also banned - that wasn’t something that fitted with Ford’s moral beliefs either.

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:31.549
The Brazilian workers were required to adjust to American working customs.

00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:37.299
They had ID badges, and they were required to work at fixed, American

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:42.549
hours, not at the times that were necessarily best to collect rubber.

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:48.459
They were even expected to participate in activities like square

00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:53.099
dancing - this was a type of dance that was popular in America at the

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:58.559
time, and Ford had apparently met his wife at a square dancing party.

00:10:59.609 --> 00:11:06.419
As you might imagine, this custom was a little confusing for people who had grown up in the Amazon.

00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:12.959
They were paid a lot of money, compared to other opportunities, but because they

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:19.019
were stuck in Fordlandia with nothing really to spend their money on, this didn’t

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:24.789
matter that much, the only effect it had was making people more likely to leave.

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:31.879
Workers would stay for short periods, then disappear with their earnings to spend

00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:36.619
them elsewhere, only to come back weeks or months later, when the money ran out.

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:40.959
And they weren’t prepared to just stick to these

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:44.619
American customs and rules that were promoted by Ford.

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:49.439
There was a report of some of the workers building their

00:11:49.489 --> 00:11:53.619
own brothel, their own house with prostitutes and a bar.

00:11:54.619 --> 00:12:00.269
This was actually built on the river, it was built on stilts, and just

00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:05.344
outside the boundary of Fordlandia, so that it technically wasn't part

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:09.749
of Ford’s territory and the American managers couldn’t shut it down.

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:15.129
It was called, somewhat amusingly, the Island of Innocence.

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:22.509
So, there was a clash of cultures, a mismatch between the sort of life that Henry Ford

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:28.089
thought his workers should be living and the lives that they actually wanted to live.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:34.699
Henry Ford had essentially decided that everyone should live the life of

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:39.899
a midwestern car factory worker, no matter whether they lived in Detroit

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:44.949
or in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, and no compromises were made.

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:52.089
Indeed, this clash of cultures reached a new level when a change was

00:12:52.089 --> 00:12:56.419
made to how the workers would receive their food in the cafeteria.

00:12:57.099 --> 00:13:03.599
Traditionally, the workers had sat down at tables and had their food brought to them.

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:09.719
But Ford, ever the efficiency-expert, thought it would be more efficient

00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:15.289
for workers to queue up and collect their food at a sort of buffet system.

00:13:16.569 --> 00:13:18.009
Enough was enough.

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:24.499
The workers rebelled, there was a huge riot, and parts of the cafeteria were destroyed.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:31.839
They even pushed trucks into the river, and caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage.

00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:37.489
The riot was only stopped when the Brazilian army arrived, and some

00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:41.899
compromises were reached between the workers and their American managers.

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:48.279
It wasn’t just the local Brazilians that struggled to adapt to life in Fordlandia.

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:53.719
The Americans who were sent to manage the land had huge trouble.

00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:59.839
Firstly, to state the obvious, the climate was very different.

00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:02.909
The Amazon rainforest is not Detroit.

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:06.209
It was incredibly hot for most of the day.

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:12.569
There were poisonous snakes, bats, and all sorts of animals that they had to deal with.

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:17.439
The houses that were built in Fordlandia were American style

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:21.979
houses, the sort of houses you might see in the suburbs of Detroit.

00:14:22.909 --> 00:14:28.169
They had metal roofs, which turned them into ovens in the heat of the Amazon.

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:34.869
American managers came and went, and there was a huge turnover of staff.

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:39.509
And the problems weren’t limited to the people working in Fordlandia.

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:45.819
Ford had also not properly understood how rubber grows.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:52.529
Rubber is produced by rubber trees, but in its natural habitat, in the

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:58.599
Amazon, the trees grow in the rainforest, sheltered by other, larger trees.

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:06.119
Ford decided to plant all the rubber trees together, close to one another in huge fields.

00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:12.909
This meant that disease spread quickly from one plant to another, and

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:17.459
hundreds of thousands of rubber trees were ruined, they were unusable.

00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:25.259
The American workers thought that the location of Fordlandia might be the problem, so in

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:33.309
1934 they abandoned the original area and created a new settlement downriver called Belterra.

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:40.509
But that also proved to be not nearly as productive as Ford had hoped for.

00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:48.358
Indeed, the entire project was a far cry from Ford's vision of an Amazonian rubber

00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:53.698
utopia that not only solved the problem of producing enough rubber for all of the

00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:58.628
tyres in his cars, but also created a model society in the heart of the Amazon.

00:16:00.158 --> 00:16:04.858
After 17 years of Ford’s industrial experiment in the Amazon,

00:16:05.388 --> 00:16:11.058
the entire project was only able to produce 750 tonnes of rubber.

00:16:11.928 --> 00:16:19.798
That might sound like a lot, but it was less than 2% of Ford’s goal of 38,000 tonnes.

00:16:20.328 --> 00:16:25.278
And not a single gramme of it ever made it into a Ford car.

00:16:26.248 --> 00:16:33.608
Throughout Forlandia’s existence, strangely enough, its creator, Henry Ford, didn’t visit even once.

00:16:34.488 --> 00:16:38.098
It’s not clear exactly why he didn’t come.

00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:45.578
Perhaps he trusted his American lieutenants to fix it, perhaps he had too much else

00:16:45.608 --> 00:16:51.978
going on, or perhaps he just couldn’t bear to see that his project was a huge failure.

00:16:53.308 --> 00:16:59.638
And in 1945, after he handed control of the Ford Motor Company to his grandson,

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:05.048
Henry Ford II, all of the land was sold back to the Brazilian government.

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:13.038
The Brazilian government paid $250,000 for it, a pittance, a tiny amount of money.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:19.088
It’s estimated that Ford took a $20 million dollar loss on this investment,

00:17:19.398 --> 00:17:24.258
which would work out at almost $300 million dollars in today’s money.

00:17:25.288 --> 00:17:31.758
Amazingly enough, Fordlandia does still exist today, albeit mostly in ruins.

00:17:32.788 --> 00:17:38.918
If you take a 15 hour boat trip up the Amazon you can still see the abandoned American project.

00:17:39.678 --> 00:17:43.278
There are some clips on YouTube, and it's really amazing.

00:17:43.648 --> 00:17:48.278
I’d certainly love to visit if I ever find myself in that part of the Amazon rainforest.

00:17:49.788 --> 00:17:53.428
Now it’s just a monument to Ford’s industrial dream.

00:17:54.258 --> 00:17:59.688
He had made it work in Detroit, and had brought great prosperity to his workers in America.

00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:05.208
But, unfortunately for Ford and unfortunately for the workers in

00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:10.408
Fordlandia, Henry Ford hadn’t realised that just using the same formula

00:18:10.608 --> 00:18:15.128
in the Amazon as had worked in Detroit wasn’t the smartest of moves.

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:19.718
And indeed, this particular move ended up being a

00:18:19.718 --> 00:18:24.018
lesson that cost Ford $300 million dollars to learn.

00:18:26.928 --> 00:18:31.778
OK then, that is that is it for today's episode on Fordlandia.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:35.408
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:36.288 --> 00:18:40.348
We have quite a few Brazilian members, so I’d particularly

00:18:40.348 --> 00:18:42.558
love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:43.118 --> 00:18:44.178
Did you know about Fordlandia?

00:18:45.448 --> 00:18:47.788
What do you think of Ford’s plans?

00:18:48.468 --> 00:18:53.908
Are there other examples of American industrialists trying to do similar things in Brazil?

00:18:54.558 --> 00:18:55.238
I'd love to know.

00:18:55.638 --> 00:18:59.028

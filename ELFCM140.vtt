Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:16.543
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:20.773
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:26.873
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Cockney Rhyming

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:32.543
Slang, the dialect or perhaps even language used in the East End of London.

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:39.543
This is the second part of our mini-series on language invention, creation, and discovery.

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:44.813
The first episode, which you can find exclusively on the website, leonardoenglish.com,

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:50.033
was all about Invented Languages, and the people who construct their own language.

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:53.883
Today’s episode is part two, on Cockney Rhyming Slang,

00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:57.763
and the third part will be all about the Rosetta Stone.

00:00:58.063 --> 00:01:01.103
Again, you will be able to find that on the website next week.

00:01:02.093 --> 00:01:07.613
Before we get right into today’s episode, let me quickly remind you that you can follow along

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:13.243
to this episode with the subtitles, the transcript and its key vocabulary, so you don’t miss a

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:18.703
word and build up your vocabulary as you go, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:19.483 --> 00:01:24.123
The website is also home to all of our bonus episodes, including the first

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:28.433
and the last part of this mini-series, plus guides on how to improve your

00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:32.803
English in a more interesting way, and our amazing member-only community.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:38.393
So if you haven’t yet checked that out, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:42.443
Ok, Cockney Rhyming Slang.

00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:48.633
Cockney Rhyming Slang is a particular type of slang, of informal

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:53.513
language, that is used by some people in a very small part of East London.

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:58.013
I’m not from East London, so I’ll let some real East

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:01.193
Londoners give you some examples of Cockney Rhyming Slang.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.111
Dog and bone, Pony and trap, Ruby Murry, Plates of meat, I'm

00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:10.071
going for a Brad, Dickie Dirt, Cock and hen, Apples and pears.

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:16.561
Rosie Lee, Doily cart, Worry and strife or trouble and strife, A Richard the Third.

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.752
So, to repeat a few of the things they said.

00:02:21.122 --> 00:02:25.862
Mince pies, Dog and bone, Apples and pears, Ruby Murry,

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:31.052
Rosie Lee, Richard the Third, Trouble and strife, Pigs Ear.

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:36.872
Now, even if you might understand the literal meaning of these words and

00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:41.592
phrases, the actual meaning in Cockney Rhyming Slang is completely different.

00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:45.872
For example, ‘trouble and strife’ means ‘wife’.

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:48.292
Dog and bone means ‘phone’.

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:51.032
Ruby Murry means ‘curry’.

00:02:51.632 --> 00:02:54.262
And a pig's ear means ‘beer‘.

00:02:55.612 --> 00:03:00.802
In Cockney Rhyming Slang you have a phrase, of normally two words,

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:05.602
and the last word of that phrase rhymes with the word it replaces.

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:13.742
So, instead of saying “I am going up the stairs”, you might say “I'm going up the apples and pears”.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:17.482
Stairs has been replaced by “apples and pears”.

00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:23.202
In most cases, the phrase used in Cockney Rhyming Slang has

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:27.192
absolutely nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word.

00:03:28.352 --> 00:03:31.802
Pigs Ear has no connection to beer, right?

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:35.602
A dog and bone has no connection to phone.

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:39.452
And nor does apples and pears with stairs.

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:47.722
There is, occasionally, a connection, and it’s often a funny one, one that pokes fun at the meaning.

00:03:48.512 --> 00:03:51.272
So, ‘trouble and strife’ means ‘wife’.

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:53.962
Strife means ‘conflict’ or ‘fighting’.

00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:59.042
The fact that the expression for ‘wife’ in Cockney Rhyming Slang

00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:03.892
literally means difficulty and fighting is obviously a bit of a

00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:08.842
stereotypical thing that some men might say jokingly about their wives.

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:13.987
To make life even more difficult for someone trying to understand Cockney

00:04:14.362 --> 00:04:19.692
Rhyming Slang, the final word in the phrase, the one that rhymes with

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:24.292
the true meaning of the word, is often dropped, it isn’t said at all.

00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:31.442
For example, the expression ‘barney rubble’ is Cockney Rhyming Slang for trouble.

00:04:32.332 --> 00:04:36.842
But, people don’t always say ‘barney rubble’, they just say ‘barney’.

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:42.042
So, they’d say ‘we had a bit of a barney’, we had a bit of a fight.

00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:47.522
But given that the final words of the phrase, ‘trouble’, has been dropped, it

00:04:47.532 --> 00:04:52.152
is very hard to understand if you didn’t know the full phrase to begin with.

00:04:52.982 --> 00:05:00.522
And to make life even more complicated, in many cases the Cockney Rhyming Slang rhymes with a word

00:05:00.562 --> 00:05:07.082
that is slang itself, the word it is replacing isn’t even an official, standard word in English.

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:10.492
For example, battle cruiser.

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:16.212
Now a battle cruiser is a war ship, right, it’s a big navy ship.

00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:21.862
If I asked you if you wanted to go to the battle cruiser, or even if you

00:05:21.862 --> 00:05:26.182
wanted to go to the battle, would you have any idea what I was talking about?

00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:27.742
Probably not.

00:05:28.442 --> 00:05:32.462
I’m talking about a pub, battle cruiser is pub.

00:05:33.442 --> 00:05:40.592
But, you will have no doubt noticed that cruiser does not rhyme with pub, so what’s going on here?

00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:46.492
Cruiser does rhyme with another slang word for pub, which is

00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:51.182
boozer, a place which sells booze, a slang term for alcohol.

00:05:51.712 --> 00:05:53.922
So, battle cruiser, boozer.

00:05:54.672 --> 00:05:55.652
Confusing, right?

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:58.792
It’s even confusing for native speakers.

00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:04.502
Sometimes you can figure out the meaning through context, but often the

00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:09.872
word is so far removed from the actual meaning that it’s incredibly hard.

00:06:11.092 --> 00:06:14.942
And this brings us nicely on to the question of….why?

00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:20.452
Why is there this impossible-to-understand-unless-you-know version of English?

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:26.552
It doesn’t seem to serve any purpose - indeed, it’s more confusing, the

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:31.532
phrases often are longer than the original ones, so you aren’t saving any time,

00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:37.232
there doesn’t seem to be any logical, linguistic, reason for its existence.

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:43.062
One of the mysteries about Cockney Rhyming Slang is that there isn’t complete

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:47.982
agreement about where it actually comes from, and why it was invented.

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:56.082
We know it started in the mid 19th century, with the first evidence of it in the 1840s.

00:06:57.422 --> 00:07:02.922
It originated in, or very near to the East End of London, a small area

00:07:03.192 --> 00:07:08.212
about 2 km across, it’s the historical centre of London that is now

00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:11.602
quite far to the east of where you might think the centre would be.

00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:18.302
One theory about why it was created is that it was as a way for people who lived there to

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:23.682
have their own, secret language so that the police couldn’t understand what they were saying.

00:07:24.272 --> 00:07:30.322
If you are engaging in activities that the police would like to stop, well, it’s quite a useful

00:07:30.322 --> 00:07:36.912
thing to be able to speak out loud in a language that your friends can understand but is completely

00:07:37.012 --> 00:07:42.762
unintelligible to someone who doesn’t know the secret code, the way to translate what you’re saying.

00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:48.082
Now, this is one theory, but it doesn’t stand up to a huge amount

00:07:48.082 --> 00:07:51.732
of scrutiny, it doesn’t make complete sense when you think about it.

00:07:52.462 --> 00:07:56.092
The policemen working in London’s East End would have normally

00:07:56.092 --> 00:08:00.402
grown up in the area, and been part of the families living there.

00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:05.712
Cockney Rhyming Slang might be difficult to understand at the start,

00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:10.672
but once you figure out what different phrases mean, it’s not so hard.

00:08:11.722 --> 00:08:17.402
Presumably even if it was created for this reason, so that criminals could talk

00:08:17.412 --> 00:08:21.302
without the police understanding them, then that wouldn’t have lasted for long.

00:08:22.352 --> 00:08:26.142
There’s another theory that it was created by Irish dockworkers,

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:30.809
Immigrants who came over from Ireland to London to work on the docks

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.840
so that they could have a secret language to use between themselves.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.440
But again it probably wouldn’t have remained secret for long, and they could have

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.620
just spoken Irish between each other - many would have spoken Irish, so why bother

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.510
creating your own version of English just so people in London couldn’t understand you?

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.210
And there’s a final theory, which is normally considered the most plausible,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.430
the most believable, that the town criers, people who would stand on street

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.710
corners and recite news and tell stories might have started to use this type

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.120
of slang for a bit of fun, to develop an audience, and it developed from there.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.410
From a utility point of view, Cockney Rhyming Slang isn’t hugely useful.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.290
But what it is is a lot of fun, people like using it, it makes

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.740
language more interesting, and creates a shared sense of community.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:34.210
One can imagine these town criers making their speeches more interesting by

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.410
using these weird and wonderful phrases to describe something else, perhaps

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.100
explaining it to their audience, who might think it was clever and witty,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.440
and then they would start using it themselves with friends and family.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.350
And this theory would explain how Cockney Rhyming Slang has developed over the years.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.740
Unlike the invented languages that we heard about in Part 1, Cockney Rhyming Slang wasn’t the

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:07.120
product of one or a small group of people, it was something that was developed by a wider group, and

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:13.740
has been continually added to ever since, there are new Cockney Rhyming Slang phrases every year.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.610
Although this is one of the beauties of Cockney Rhyming Slang, it

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:24.330
makes actually trying to study it, and to write it all down, very hard.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:30.320
It now exists in pop culture, you’ll see it in films, TV series, on

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.140
social media, but there is no single organisation that is responsible

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.250
for it, nobody saying what is and isn’t Cockney Rhyming Slang.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:46.810
It’s in many ways a beautiful example of how languages develop, how different branches of languages

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:53.897
emerge, why they do, and what this actually tells us about our own relationship with language.

00:10:54.777 --> 00:11:00.839
Firstly, it shows us that there is just an awful amount of fun that you can have with language.

00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:04.999
People don’t speak Cockney Rhyming Slang instead of English,

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:08.369
they replace certain English words with Cockney Rhyming Slang.

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:14.839
So everyone who speaks Cockney Rhyming Slang can speak English, they might just choose

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:19.939
to use Cockney Rhyming Slang to describe something because it’s more fun, perhaps because

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:25.729
it comes more naturally to them, and to create a shared sense of belonging, of community.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:32.529
This is of course not unique to Cockney Rhyming Slang, it’s one of the reasons to continue to speak

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:39.219
any dialect when there is another more dominant language you could speak, but Cockney Rhyming Slang

00:11:39.409 --> 00:11:46.209
has the unique quality that it uses English words in a different way to convey meanings in English.

00:11:46.909 --> 00:11:52.139
If you had to compare it to another type of slang, it’s probably most similar

00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:58.009
to something like Verlan, the French slang where you invert the French word,

00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:02.489
you take the last part of the word and put it at the front of the word.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:09.099
So, to quickly explain to the non-French speakers out there, ‘femme’, the word for

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:16.789
woman in French, becomes ‘meuf’, Francais, the word for ‘French’ becomes ‘céfran’.

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:23.099
In both the case of Cockney Rhyming Slang and Verlan, the slang uses

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:27.599
the main language but changes it in a way that is hard to understand

00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:31.739
unless you know the code, you have the key to translate the meaning.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:37.079
In both cases, they are exclusive languages, or rather dialects.

00:12:37.749 --> 00:12:42.699
If you know how to use them, and in Cockney Rhyming Slang’s case if you are from

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:47.456
the small area of London where Cockney Rhyming Slang is spoken, you are part of a

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:53.399
small, close knit community brought closer together by a shared use of language.

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:57.099
And if you don’t know Cockney Rhyming Slang then you’re

00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:00.379
excluded, you aren’t part of this exclusive gang.

00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:05.339
Now, if you are wondering whether you need to know Cockney Rhyming Slang

00:13:05.599 --> 00:13:10.344
if you go to London, and if you are worried because you have just found out

00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:15.674
about an entirely new part of English that you never knew existed, fear not.

00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:18.864
There is absolutely no need for you to learn it, most

00:13:18.904 --> 00:13:21.654
Brits wouldn’t be able to understand most of it either.

00:13:22.184 --> 00:13:27.404
If you were to go into a pub in London’s East End and ask for Two King Lears

00:13:27.444 --> 00:13:32.604
and a Philharmonic, which is two beers and a gin and tonic by the way, I imagine

00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:36.934
the person behind the bar would look at you with a slightly strange face.

00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:40.094
And they might not even know what you were talking about either.

00:13:41.294 --> 00:13:45.394
But if you do want to learn more about Cockney Rhyming Slang, then you

00:13:45.394 --> 00:13:49.834
will find a load of fun resources if you just google Cockney Rhyming Slang.

00:13:50.244 --> 00:13:55.534
From dictionaries to video clips, it is a lot of fun to learn, and it is a

00:13:55.534 --> 00:14:00.644
veritable rabbit hole, it’s easy to waste hours learning Cockney Rhyming Slang.

00:14:01.404 --> 00:14:05.734
And this really is one of the great things about learning any language - that

00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:10.144
it will be easier and you’ll progress faster if it’s fun and interesting.

00:14:11.274 --> 00:14:16.704
Even if you have a particular goal in mind, getting a new job, getting a particular

00:14:16.714 --> 00:14:22.014
score in the IELTS, or just being able to speak with your next-door neighbour, sometimes

00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:27.474
it is a lot of fun to just get caught up in the magic of fun parts of language.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:31.904
And although Cockney Rhyming Slang really isn’t very useful

00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:35.054
for your day-to-day life, it is a huge amount of fun.

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:40.814
And if that isn’t a reason to learn some Cockney Rhyming Slang, then I don’t know what is.

00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:48.632
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cockney Rhyming Slang, part 2 of

00:14:48.632 --> 00:14:54.272
our three part series on unorthodox language invention, creation, and discovery

00:14:54.842 --> 00:14:58.432
As a quick reminder, part one was on invented languages,

00:14:58.722 --> 00:15:02.072
and part three is going to be on The Rosetta Stone.

00:15:02.602 --> 00:15:06.702
You can listen to both of those exclusively on the website, leonardoenglish.com.

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:12.042
And on that subject, here’s your quick final reminder that you can become a

00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:16.762
member of Leonardo English, listen to all of our bonus episodes, plus get the

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:21.212
transcripts, the subtitles, and all of the key vocabulary over on the website.

00:15:21.512 --> 00:15:27.382
You’ll be joining a community of curious minds from over 40 countries now, doing meetups,

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.942
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:35.782

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:47.952
share a little quiz on Cockney Rhyming Slang over in our community.

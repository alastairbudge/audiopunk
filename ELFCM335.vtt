Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:09.721
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.741
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:13.611
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:15.941
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.021
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:20.151
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.941
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.001
we are discussing genders.

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.461
But not whether a person is a

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.001
man, a woman, or another gender,

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.491
or what pronouns one should use.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.091
But rather, genders in language,

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.631
and specifically, we will focus on

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.871
genders in the English language.

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.369
38% of the world speak a gendered

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.329
language, meaning they group

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.919
nouns into categories like

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.239
masculine, feminine and neuter.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.179
English is something called a “natural

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.039
gender language”, meaning that

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.289
pronouns - he, she, and so on - do

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.709
have a gender, but objects do not.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.839
A chair is a chair, it isn’t masculine,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.879
it isn’t feminine, it’s just a chair.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.209
So why is this?

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:09.789
Why do most European languages

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.609
give inanimate objects

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.649
genders, but English does not?

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:15.579
Has this always been the case?

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:18.169
And is it really true that

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.359
there are no genders in English?

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.989
Let’s get right into it and

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.759
explore the surprising story behind

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.669
genders in the English language.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.689
When speaking about the German language,

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:36.049
the American author Mark Twain once said:

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.969
“Every noun has a gender, there is

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.579
no sense or system in distribution.”

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.609
“In German, a young lady has

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.279
no sex, while a turnip has.

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:50.749
Think what overwrought reverence, [or

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.249
great love] that shows for the turnip,

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.999
and what disrespect for the girl.”

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.259
Here, Twain humorously voices his

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.309
frustration at trying to understand

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:05.049
the German language and its seemingly

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.489
random categorisation of words.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.089
As our German listeners will

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.769
know, the German language

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.289
has three genders: masculine,

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.999
feminine and neuter, or neutral.

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.969
The word for a ‘girl’ is neuter , while

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.569
the word for ‘turnip’ is feminine.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.469
And Twain points out how strange this

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.079
is, at least for an English-speaker,

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:31.951
for a speaker of a language

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.664
without grammatical genders.

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:36.634
Why should a turnip have a

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.944
gender and a girl have none?

00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:41.564
A girl is clearly feminine,

00:02:41.564 --> 00:02:43.814
and a turnip is, well, it’s a

00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:46.414
vegetable, it’s neither feminine nor

00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:48.334
masculine in terms of its gender.

00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:52.794
Twain isn’t alone in being baffled,

00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:55.214
being confused, by this concept.

00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:58.104
It’s a challenging one for anyone

00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:00.744
learning a new language, especially if

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:03.194
their native language is a grammatically

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:05.384
non-gendered one, like English.

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:09.014
On the flip side, on the other hand,

00:03:09.214 --> 00:03:11.904
it can make English easier to learn

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:14.214
than languages that do have grammatical

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:17.024
genders, because you almost never

00:03:17.234 --> 00:03:19.084
need to worry about remembering

00:03:19.134 --> 00:03:20.934
what gender an object is in English.

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:24.294
There are a few exceptions, which

00:03:24.424 --> 00:03:26.724
we’ll touch on shortly, but as a

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:28.864
general rule, you don’t need to

00:03:28.864 --> 00:03:30.884
worry about whether a turnip is

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:33.644
masculine, feminine, or something else.

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:34.764
Or a tomato.

00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:35.954
Or a potato.

00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:38.314
Or a TV or a chair or a table.

00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:40.144
Or any object.

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:43.044
As you’ll know, non-human

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:45.164
objects in English don’t have a

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:47.124
gender, which makes life easy.

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:51.424
So, why is this, why do some

00:03:51.444 --> 00:03:54.594
languages have grammatical genders,

00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:56.964
and why is English not one of them?

00:03:57.884 --> 00:03:59.974
Well, we need to start by addressing the

00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:02.924
first question, of why some languages

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:05.394
have genders, before we can get to

00:04:05.394 --> 00:04:08.034
the specific question of English.

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.024
The first point to underline is that

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:14.704
it helps to try to mentally separate

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:17.414
the idea of grammatical gender from

00:04:17.684 --> 00:04:20.614
physical gender, and instead, to think

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:22.994
of grammatical gender more like a

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:25.794
category, or a way of putting different

00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:27.924
types of words in different types of

00:04:27.964 --> 00:04:31.234
boxes, a way of organising language.

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:34.334
Linguists believe that many

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.644
gendered languages stem from

00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:39.194
Proto-Indo-European, a language

00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:42.124
which existed around 6000 years ago.

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.514
This was the ancestor of European

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:47.244
languages and Western and

00:04:47.414 --> 00:04:49.164
Southern Asian languages such

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.854
as Hindi, Bengali or Kurdish.

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.944
And Proto-Indo-European categorised

00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:59.234
nouns into two groups: a group for

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:02.574
animate or living things and a group

00:05:02.574 --> 00:05:05.514
for inanimate things, or objects.

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:10.184
But over thousands of years many new

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:13.284
languages evolved and the categories for

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:17.154
words changed, becoming far more varied.

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:20.614
Words that had been classed merely

00:05:20.614 --> 00:05:23.674
as inanimate in Proto-Indo-European

00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:26.394
eventually became either masculine,

00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:27.391
feminine or

00:05:27.488 --> 00:05:27.807
neuter.

00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:29.397
Why?

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:32.247
Well, linguists believe that the

00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:34.737
reason for these changes in language

00:05:34.957 --> 00:05:36.877
can be attributed to the various

00:05:36.877 --> 00:05:39.427
belief systems of countries affecting

00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:41.507
how they thought about objects.

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:44.967
For instance, in the Siberian

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:47.697
language Ket, masculine words

00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:50.197
are often items actually related

00:05:50.197 --> 00:05:51.747
to the culture’s male-dominated

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:54.757
activities like hunting and building.

00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:57.807
For instance, their words for

00:05:57.997 --> 00:06:00.977
fish and wood are both masculine.

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:04.647
Meanwhile, words for more domestic

00:06:04.687 --> 00:06:08.067
things such as illnesses, body parts and

00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:11.457
plants are often feminine, reflecting

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:14.427
women’s position that particular society.

00:06:15.537 --> 00:06:18.537
So, while these inanimate objects

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.340
don’t, of course, have a gender,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.930
in their language their gender

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.510
corresponds to the real-life

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.560
people most associated with them.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.990
And the influence of real-life gender

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.520
is also present in the Alamblak

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.910
language of Papua New Guinea.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.980
In Alamblak, many masculine nouns

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.260
include the words for snakes, arrows,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.920
and trees, long straight shapes.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.865
I’ll leave you guess

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.980
why that one might be.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.790
These examples show how cultural

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.220
beliefs can affect language and the

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.720
ways we think and interact with words.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.550
And linguists believe that this

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.470
sort of thing happening over many

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.100
thousands of years slowly led to

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.950
the evolution of European languages

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.190
and their gender categories.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.200
But as any speaker of Spanish, German,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.440
French, Italian, or any other European

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.600
gendered language will know, these

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.580
cultural influences are often long gone.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.050
To go back to our example from Mark

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.260
Twain, a turnip is feminine in German.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.530
It’s also feminine in Italian, “la rapa”.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.360
But it’s masculine in French [“le

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.085
navet”] and in Spanish [“el nabo”].

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:40.725
If there’s a cultural reason why a

00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:42.925
turnip should be feminine in German

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:45.875
and Italian but masuline in French and

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:48.175
Spanish, well, I have yet to find it.

00:07:49.555 --> 00:07:52.555
Instead, words tend to be categorised

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.685
phonetically, words which sound the same.

00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:57.274
can be distinguished by

00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:58.404
their different genders.

00:07:59.574 --> 00:08:01.714
If we use the example of French

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:03.864
or Italian, similar-sounding

00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:05.884
words often have the same gender.

00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:09.825
In French, for example, words ending

00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:12.378
in things like "ant" tend to be

00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:15.814
masculine, whereas words ending in -asse,

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.704
-ace, or -esse tend to be feminine.

00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:22.924
And in Italian, words ending in an

00:08:23.164 --> 00:08:26.174
“o” tend to be masculine and words

00:08:26.364 --> 00:08:28.824
ending in an “ a” tend to be feminine.

00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:32.764
But these are guidelines more

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:35.634
than surefire certain rules, as

00:08:35.754 --> 00:08:37.804
any frustrated French or Italian

00:08:37.804 --> 00:08:39.334
learner will know all too well.

00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:42.594
Interestingly enough, some studies

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.934
suggest that grammatical genders do

00:08:44.994 --> 00:08:47.184
actually make it quicker and easier

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:48.674
for people to understand information.

00:08:49.694 --> 00:08:52.514
In other words, gender in language

00:08:52.634 --> 00:08:54.984
can give clues to your brain that

00:08:54.994 --> 00:08:57.084
help it retrieve information faster.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.944
For example, I’m sure you’ve had

00:08:59.954 --> 00:09:02.774
that annoying, niggling, feeling when

00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:04.934
you can’t quite remember the correct

00:09:04.934 --> 00:09:06.404
word to describe what you mean.

00:09:07.314 --> 00:09:09.074
Well, linguists propose that

00:09:09.074 --> 00:09:11.374
grammatical gender can actually help

00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:14.004
to eliminate this, with the grammatical

00:09:14.004 --> 00:09:16.024
gender providing clues to your

00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:18.464
brain to help you retrieve a word.

00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:23.254
This is, of course, only one theory, and

00:09:23.384 --> 00:09:25.194
there’s an equally valid argument to be

00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:27.704
made that genders in language make it

00:09:27.704 --> 00:09:29.764
more complicated to learn a language.

00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:33.544
After all, the most successful artificial

00:09:33.544 --> 00:09:36.564
language in history, Esperanto, completely

00:09:36.594 --> 00:09:39.564
avoided gendered language altogether, with

00:09:39.584 --> 00:09:42.144
its creator believing that any benefits

00:09:42.274 --> 00:09:44.494
that gender might have once you had

00:09:44.494 --> 00:09:46.759
learned the language were outweighed by

00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:49.494
the additional mental energy required to

00:09:49.494 --> 00:09:50.964
learn these genders in the first place.

00:09:51.964 --> 00:09:54.474
So, this brings us to English,

00:09:54.574 --> 00:09:56.514
a non-gendered language.

00:09:57.184 --> 00:10:00.474
Why doesn’t it have grammatical genders,

00:10:00.774 --> 00:10:02.674
especially considering that there is so

00:10:02.694 --> 00:10:05.194
much European influence in the language?

00:10:05.884 --> 00:10:08.224
Well, it hasn’t always been this way.

00:10:08.854 --> 00:10:10.924
It might surprise you to find out

00:10:11.154 --> 00:10:13.574
that up until the 11th century or so,

00:10:14.004 --> 00:10:17.104
English did have grammatical genders.

00:10:18.094 --> 00:10:20.804
Old English, or Anglo Saxon, had

00:10:21.304 --> 00:10:23.614
genders, every object was either

00:10:23.784 --> 00:10:25.794
masculine, feminine or neutral.

00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.934
This language had been brought to the

00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:32.324
British Isles by the Saxons, who came from

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:34.626
Northern Europe in the fourth century AD.

00:10:35.628 --> 00:10:37.454
After they settled in the South of

00:10:37.454 --> 00:10:40.034
England, Anglo Saxon quickly became the

00:10:40.044 --> 00:10:42.394
dominant language spoken in the British

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:45.274
Isles, so most people in Britain were

00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:47.574
speaking using grammatical gender.

00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:50.804
But just as one group of Northern

00:10:50.804 --> 00:10:52.914
European invaders brought genders

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:55.304
with them, another group of Northern

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:57.284
Europeans appeared several centuries

00:10:57.284 --> 00:11:00.429
later, and unintentionally wiped out

00:11:00.574 --> 00:11:02.924
the existence of genders in English.

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:05.584
These were the Vikings.

00:11:07.164 --> 00:11:09.244
Now, you probably know the Vikings

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:11.624
as fearsome warriors, bringing

00:11:11.624 --> 00:11:13.574
with them a reign of terror.

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:16.224
But they also brought with them

00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:18.904
their language, Old Norse, when

00:11:18.904 --> 00:11:20.504
they started to settle in Britain

00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:21.914
in the late ninth century.

00:11:23.134 --> 00:11:24.774
Old Norse, like Anglo

00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:27.054
Saxon, did have genders.

00:11:27.394 --> 00:11:29.954
It had masculine, feminine and neuter.

00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:32.764
The problem was that the genders

00:11:32.764 --> 00:11:34.694
given to objects weren’t always

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.394
the same in the two languages.

00:11:36.924 --> 00:11:38.424
A turnip might have been

00:11:38.424 --> 00:11:40.484
feminine in Old English but

00:11:40.714 --> 00:11:43.254
masculine or neuter in Old Norse.

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.624
Clearly, this made life confusing.

00:11:47.314 --> 00:11:49.944
So, over time, people in Northern

00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:52.024
England, where the Vikings first

00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:54.314
landed, started to leave out the

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:56.334
gendered parts of their language.

00:11:57.124 --> 00:12:00.014
And this trend slowly travelled down to

00:12:00.014 --> 00:12:03.004
the Anglo-Saxon south of England, and by

00:12:03.004 --> 00:12:05.704
the 11th century grammatical genders in

00:12:05.704 --> 00:12:08.538
English had, by and large, disappeared.

00:12:09.108 --> 00:12:12.024
A turnip became just a turnip.

00:12:13.264 --> 00:12:16.394
But there are some exceptions, some

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:18.844
objects still do have genders in

00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:21.454
English, or at least, semi-genders.

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:24.964
Now, this is not something you would learn

00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:27.344
in an English class, but it’s interesting.

00:12:27.904 --> 00:12:29.514
And this is the concept

00:12:29.764 --> 00:12:31.924
of metaphorical gender.

00:12:32.864 --> 00:12:35.764
For example, boats are often referred

00:12:35.764 --> 00:12:38.264
to as “she”, they are feminine.

00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:40.594
If you were talking about the

00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:42.564
Titanic, let’s say, you could

00:12:42.564 --> 00:12:45.124
say “she set sail to America”.

00:12:45.704 --> 00:12:48.024
You could also say “it set sail for

00:12:48.024 --> 00:12:50.364
America”, which wouldn’t be completely

00:12:50.364 --> 00:12:52.854
wrong, but it would sound very strange

00:12:52.854 --> 00:12:55.214
to say “he set sail for America”.

00:12:55.724 --> 00:12:58.094
So, a boat is either "it" or

00:12:58.094 --> 00:12:59.724
it's "she", it's never “he”.

00:13:00.804 --> 00:13:03.454
Interestingly enough, one theory about

00:13:03.454 --> 00:13:05.664
why this is, at least in the case of

00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:08.364
boats, is that it comes from the Latin

00:13:08.364 --> 00:13:11.544
word for boat, navis, which is feminine.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.879
Another is that  there is this idea of a

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:18.149
boat having a protective, maternal role

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:21.739
for its crew, or rather, her crew, and

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:24.189
that’s why boats are often given a gender.

00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:27.829
By the way, it’s not wrong at all to call

00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:31.249
a boat simply “it”, and indeed the Lloyds

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:33.559
Register of Shipping, which knows a thing

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:36.139
or two about boats, calls a ship “it”.

00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:39.809
And it’s not just ships that

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:41.539
get given genders in English.

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:45.259
Cars and machines are often feminine

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:47.489
in English, but typically only when

00:13:47.489 --> 00:13:49.649
the person talking about them has some

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:51.619
kind of close relationship with them.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:55.419
All that being said, this is a pretty

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:58.949
niche, unusual, way of speaking, so for

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:01.229
all intents and purposes, it is safe

00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:03.609
to assume that there are no genders

00:14:03.729 --> 00:14:05.879
used to describe objects in English.

00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:09.279
There are, of course, still gendered

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.739
terms used to describe people.

00:14:12.409 --> 00:14:14.539
Now, this is perhaps controversial

00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:16.319
territory we’re getting into here,

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:19.229
but the English language historically

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:22.439
has male and female pronouns that are

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:25.809
used to describe people - he/him, and

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:29.109
she/her, with the third person plural,

00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:32.399
they, being used when the gender of

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:35.279
a person is unspecified or unknown.

00:14:36.469 --> 00:14:39.459
And in English, nouns describing

00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.109
the job someone does have

00:14:41.109 --> 00:14:43.199
historically been slightly different

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:45.739
depending on that person's gender.

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:48.359
Headmaster or Headmistress.

00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:50.509
Policeman or Policewoman.

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:52.739
Actor or Actress.

00:14:53.009 --> 00:14:54.479
Waiter or Waitress.

00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:58.659
In most cases, the male variant

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.849
is the dominant one, and the

00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:03.549
female version is an alternative.

00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:06.649
Clearly, this is problematic.

00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:09.816
If a young girl only hears about

00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:13.565
policemen, or firemen, or postmen

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.836
or businessmen, or even if a young

00:15:16.856 --> 00:15:19.396
boy hears these terms as standard,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.666
it suggests that these are things

00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:23.556
that can only be done by men.

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:26.946
Over the past few decades, there has

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:29.176
been a move to try to standardise

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:31.096
these terms in English, to try

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:33.626
to create more inclusive language

00:15:34.856 --> 00:15:37.786
In some cases, the male variant is

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:39.996
chosen as the standard, so there

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:42.566
are, for example, no longer actors

00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:45.126
and actresses, simply “actors”.

00:15:46.286 --> 00:15:49.926
In other cases, a new, non-gendered term

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:52.796
is chosen, so there aren’t Policemen and

00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:55.784
Policewomen, but rather police officers.

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:57.746
All good so far.

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:01.976
Perhaps even more strangely, in American

00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:04.536
English a decision has been taken to

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.366
change the Spanish language, when used

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.716
in English, so someone is no longer

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:13.192
Latino or Latina, they are Latinx.

00:16:14.116 --> 00:16:16.356
The idea of creating an inclusive

00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:18.817
term does, it appears, come

00:16:18.817 --> 00:16:20.746
from a place of good intentions.

00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:23.276
But this particular example of

00:16:23.576 --> 00:16:26.826
“Latinx” has largely been ridiculed

00:16:26.836 --> 00:16:28.536
by the Hispanic population.

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:33.106
Only 2-3% of Hispanic people reportedly

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:35.416
use the term to describe themselves,

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:38.076
and it has been criticised as an

00:16:38.076 --> 00:16:41.126
example of linguistic imperialism, of

00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:44.066
non-Spanish-speaking Americans changing

00:16:44.096 --> 00:16:46.886
Spanish to solve a non-existent problem.

00:16:47.896 --> 00:16:50.366
And as to the question of what is

00:16:50.366 --> 00:16:52.496
the effect of a language having

00:16:52.506 --> 00:16:55.036
grammatical gender or not, and what

00:16:55.066 --> 00:16:57.026
is the effect of English having

00:16:57.026 --> 00:16:59.306
gendered pronouns but not grammatical

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:02.036
gender, well this is a tricky one.

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:06.456
There was a prominent study from 2011 that

00:17:06.456 --> 00:17:09.816
looked at gender equality in 111 different

00:17:09.816 --> 00:17:12.536
countries and found that countries where

00:17:12.536 --> 00:17:15.176
gendered languages were spoken tended

00:17:15.196 --> 00:17:17.626
to have lower levels of gender equality.

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:20.346
So, if you live in a country that

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:23.706
assigns genders to objects, you are more

00:17:23.706 --> 00:17:26.056
likely to experience gender inequality.

00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:30.136
You might think, well, if that’s the case,

00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:33.076
then presumably countries with no gender

00:17:33.246 --> 00:17:35.816
in their language would be beacons of

00:17:35.816 --> 00:17:38.476
gender equality, would be great places in

00:17:38.476 --> 00:17:41.546
terms of equality between men and women.

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:44.966
Some, Finland, for example,

00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:47.166
score very highly on this count.

00:17:47.956 --> 00:17:50.706
Finnish is a language without any genders,

00:17:50.866 --> 00:17:53.076
neither grammatical nor in personal

00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:55.646
pronouns, and Finland is a country

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:58.156
with high levels of gender equality.

00:17:59.356 --> 00:18:01.996
Others, Cameroon, China and

00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:04.036
Turkey, for example, do not.

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:07.256
These countries don’t use gendered

00:18:07.256 --> 00:18:09.606
language, but they don’t score very

00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:11.516
well in terms of gender equality.

00:18:12.586 --> 00:18:14.886
Interestingly, countries where Natural

00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:16.526
Gender languages like English are

00:18:16.526 --> 00:18:19.186
spoken, where pronouns have gender

00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:22.246
but objects do not, score highest

00:18:22.526 --> 00:18:24.786
overall, they are generally the best

00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:26.896
places in terms of gender equality.

00:18:27.996 --> 00:18:30.346
Clearly, the language spoken in the

00:18:30.346 --> 00:18:33.296
country is only one factor here, but

00:18:33.406 --> 00:18:35.326
it is certainly an interesting piece

00:18:35.326 --> 00:18:38.196
of research, and shows that even if

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:40.906
your language has no inbuilt gender

00:18:40.956 --> 00:18:43.396
inequality, it certainly doesn’t mean that

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:45.296
this will be the case for your society.

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:48.546
So, what does this all

00:18:48.556 --> 00:18:50.226
mean for English learners?

00:18:50.766 --> 00:18:52.346
Well, not a lot, really..

00:18:52.996 --> 00:18:54.636
The good news for you is that

00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:56.726
grammatical gender is one less

00:18:56.726 --> 00:18:58.146
thing you need to worry about.

00:18:58.966 --> 00:19:01.926
When you talk about a turnip, call it it.

00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:03.206
When you talk about a

00:19:03.206 --> 00:19:05.596
chair, call it “it” too.

00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:07.676
And when you’re talking about

00:19:07.676 --> 00:19:10.286
a boat, well the truth is that

00:19:10.286 --> 00:19:12.486
you can call it “it” as well.

00:19:14.518 --> 00:19:17.098
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:19:17.118 --> 00:19:20.158
episode on gender in language, and

00:19:20.218 --> 00:19:22.488
in particular, gender in English.

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.718
I hope it was an interesting one, and

00:19:24.968 --> 00:19:26.308
that it might have left you thinking

00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:28.098
a bit about your native language.

00:19:28.818 --> 00:19:30.698
Did you grow up speaking a grammatically

00:19:30.698 --> 00:19:33.778
gendered language like French or Spanish,

00:19:34.018 --> 00:19:36.648
a non-gendered language like Turkish

00:19:36.648 --> 00:19:39.518
or Mandarin, or a naturally gendered

00:19:39.518 --> 00:19:42.438
language like English, Danish or Swedish?

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:45.038
How do you think this affected you,

00:19:45.218 --> 00:19:47.398
and the society you grew up in?

00:19:47.998 --> 00:19:49.938
I would love to know, so let’s

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:51.268
get this discussion started.

00:19:51.698 --> 00:19:52.688
You can head right into our

00:19:52.688 --> 00:19:54.228
community forum, which is at

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.748
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:19:56.748 --> 00:19:59.048
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:19:59.888 --> 00:20:01.598
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:01.608 --> 00:20:04.348

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:16.011
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.251
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:25.599
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is going to be an unusual episode.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:29.359
It’s unusual because you might think you've heard it before.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:36.049
The first episode I ever made was called “Meet The English Learning for Curious Minds podcast”.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.109
Perhaps you’ve already listened to hundreds of episodes

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.369
and you think you’ve already “met” the podcast.

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:49.169
But don’t worry, this will be a bit different, or at least it will be significantly updated.

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:53.369
In this episode I’m going to talk about myself, and about this podcast.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.616
I'll talk about how things have developed since I started it.

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:01.976
I'll give you a bit of a private, “behind the scenes” look at how the sausage is made,

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:07.876
and I’ll tell you a little bit about what I’ve learned in the past three and a half years.

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:11.316
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:15.476
So, perhaps you have already listened to the very

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:18.726
first episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:23.516
Perhaps you've listened to every episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:26.246
If so, you’re amazing, thank you.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:31.716
No matter whether this is the first episode you've ever listened to, or you’ve listened to every

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:37.126
single one of them, let me start by telling you a little bit about me, the host of the podcast.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.886
I’m Alastair, Alastair Budge.

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:46.026
As you might be able to tell from my accent, I’m from the UK, I’m British.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.776
I grew up in a bunch of different places in the UK, from

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.096
the south of England to just outside Edinburgh, in Scotland.

00:01:55.056 --> 00:02:00.326
I’ve lived most of my life in London, but I’d definitely not call myself a Londoner.

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:03.366
I'm not actually in the UK right now.

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:08.026
In fact, I haven't actually lived in the UK for quite a long time.

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:13.436
For the past six years, I've been living on a tiny island called

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:17.396
Malta, which is in the Mediterranean Sea, just south of Sicily.

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:22.356
Your next logical question might be… Why?

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:26.386
That seems like an unusual place to be, so what are you doing there?

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:32.396
The answer is actually quite simple: my wife was offered a job at the university here.

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:36.806
We knew absolutely nothing about Malta, I didn’t even really know where it was,

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:42.936
but we thought, well why not, and packed up everything from London and moved.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:48.516
Her job was originally a one year contract, which turned into two years, three

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:53.916
years, and well, life can surprise you, we're still here six and a half years later.

00:02:54.856 --> 00:03:00.276
So, let me tell you a bit about this podcast, about English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:06.666
I started it at the end of 2019, three and a half years ago.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:11.446
To be completely honest with you, I started it as a bit

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:14.366
of an experiment, to see whether anyone would listen.

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:23.326
The idea behind it came from my own experience, not as an English teacher but as a language learner.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:31.526
See, like you, I imagine, I think of myself more as a language learner than as a teacher.

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:35.856
I’ve learned lots of different languages to varying degrees.

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:41.446
Like lots of people of my generation in Britain, I learned French at school.

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:47.026
But as any French person who meets a British tourist will know, the

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:51.756
general standard of language teaching in Britain is..not very good.

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:59.326
In any case, I loved languages, and tried to find every opportunity I could to pursue this.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:04.496
I ended up studying French and Italian at university, to what I guess would

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:09.856
be a C1 or C2 level, then going on to do a Masters in Chinese Studies.

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:16.676
As part of these studies, I spent a year studying at both French and Italian universities,

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:22.846
and I also taught English in China, so I know what it’s like both to teach and to learn.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:29.436
In all these years both as a student and a teacher, observing my own behaviour,

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:34.776
that of my friends and that of my students, the people I was teaching, one

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:40.856
thing was abundantly clear: learning is 100 times easier if you are actually

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:44.496
engaged with what you are learning, if you find it really interesting.

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.066
I saw this with my own behaviour.

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:53.616
When it came to textbook-based learning, I always did the minimum amount of work.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.359
I knew I could pass the exams by doing this, and there were many more fun

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:03.009
things to be doing at university than sitting down with a grammar book.

00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:10.099
But when I found something that I actually cared about, when I found a book or a film

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:16.299
director I loved, I would consume everything I could, and it didn’t feel like studying.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.549
Now, what does this have to do with English Learning for Curious Minds?

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:27.269
Well, in my native language, English, I read a lot, I watch documentaries, go down

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:32.399
Wikipedia rabbit holes, I'd describe myself as being quite obsessive in terms of

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:37.499
enjoying learning about history, politics, economics, about how the world works.

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:43.669
So, I thought, what if there was a way to combine this thirst

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.929
for knowledge, for information, with learning a language?

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.339
As to the format of how this could be delivered, I had never had much success with

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.959
apps or gamified style learning, streaks and stars and all that kind of stuff.

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:06.399
Reading and watching films or series both have their advantages, but they are imperfect.

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.209
If you are simply reading, you don’t have the oral element, you can’t hear spoken language.

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:17.039
And if you are watching something you either have subtitles, which

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.509
are tempting to read, or you have no subtitles and you can miss words.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.929
But what is the best of both worlds?

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.789
Something where you can listen and have a transcript to refer to to check

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:33.579
what has been said, which helps you remember new words and expressions.

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.719
So, I thought, as a language learner myself, I know that listening and learning

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.559
about interesting stuff is the most effective way for me to learn a language.

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.999
Not only do you listen to real, native content, but you learn about

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.799
stuff that you would be curious about in your own native language.

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:59.119
Surely I can’t be the only person in the world who would like this…

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:07.239
I figured that the only way to test it was by trying, so I wrote the scripts for five episodes,

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:13.549
asked a friend for a microphone, recorded them, built a basic website and hit publish.

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.089
The first one came out in December 2019, it was the first

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:21.509
“Meet the English Learning for Curious Minds” episode.

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:26.579
And you can still listen to it now, if you like, it’s episode number one.

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:32.999
Right from the start, I wanted to offer people the ability to pay a small amount

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.999
of money to access all of the learning materials, the transcripts and vocabulary.

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:44.859
I knew from my own experience that these resources are incredibly helpful, valuable,

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:50.659
and can be a crucial part of going from passive consumption to active learning.

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.199
So I figured, well I would happily pay for something like

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.679
this, I thought perhaps other people might do so too.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.779
Now, fast forward to today, the podcast has been listened to over

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:08.509
4 million times by people in literally every country in the world.

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:12.929
I checked and there've even been listeners in the Vatican City,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:17.519
but I can neither deny nor confirm that the pope is a listener.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:22.399
That’s actually a privacy thing - all you can see in the podcast

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:25.299
analytics is the country, nothing about the individual person.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:31.189
So, let me tell you a little bit about what has happened since I recorded the first

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:36.109
one, so I can take you on a bit of a journey through the history of this show.

00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:41.199
I told you I started this as a bit of an experiment.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:46.969
I gave myself three months, thinking “if it doesn’t go anywhere, if nobody listens

00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:52.809
and nobody becomes a customer, well I’ve only lost three months, and it won’t

00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:56.829
be a waste of three months because I'm sure I'll have fun and learn something”.

00:08:58.189 --> 00:09:02.389
After these three months the show had about 50,000 downloads,

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:05.909
and paying members from a dozen or so different countries.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.389
It was off to a good start!

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:13.479
But it was still, to a certain extent, not my full-time job.

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:21.399
When I first started, I was still working part-time as a marketing consultant, to pay the bills.

00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:27.679
See, before starting this podcast, and the business behind it, I had a

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:31.659
relatively successful career working in technology startups in London,

00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:36.559
so when I started the podcast, I was also consulting on the side.

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:43.029
Anyway, about six months after starting this podcast, I decided to go

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:48.859
all-in, to fire myself from the consulting jobs, and focus on making

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:53.539
the best possible product for curious independent learners, for you.

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.589
Things got a little bit more professional.

00:09:58.439 --> 00:10:03.199
Now we have a professional editor, professional researchers, scriptwriters,

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:07.799
and teachers working to create the learning materials that come with the show.

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:13.069
There are now hundreds of thousands of people who listen every

00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:17.149
month and we have paying members from almost 100 countries.

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:24.349
Now, let me tell you a bit more about the journey to get to today, where we are now,

00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:29.619
and what we have planned for the future of this podcast, and for Leonardo English.

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:35.279
When I first started making the podcast, it was super unprofessional.

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:38.869
I knew absolutely nothing about how to make a podcast.

00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:45.529
Naively, I thought it was not much more complicated than getting a microphone and pressing record.

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:51.289
Of course, you can’t do a podcast without pressing the record button and talking

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:56.119
into a microphone, but there is a lot more that goes into making one than that.

00:10:56.879 --> 00:11:00.699
In fact, I listened to the first version of this episode, back from

00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:04.639
December 2019, and I felt pretty uncomfortable listening to it.

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:11.629
Part of me thought it would be better to remove that episode completely, and replace it with

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:17.499
an updated one, but I always think it is fun to see where people and companies have come from.

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:20.159
It makes it all a bit more real, you know?

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:25.969
So, anyway, I’ve left the old versions up for you to see, for posterity’s sake.

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:32.499
We are at almost 400 episodes now, and ever since that first episode we have made

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:37.919
two new ones every single week, covering all sorts of weird and wonderful topics.

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:44.039
As for the process of going from an idea to a finished episode is

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:47.389
actually quite a lot more complicated than you might think it is.

00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:53.379
First, there’s the idea, the concept for the episode, or for the series.

00:11:54.219 --> 00:11:59.319
I’m often asked how we come up with the ideas, but the truth is that I have

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:03.899
a massive list of potential ideas, plus we have lots of great suggestions

00:12:03.909 --> 00:12:08.099
from members, so there is absolutely no shortage of potential ideas.

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:14.489
Then, we plan out the structure for the episode, the research team does amazing

00:12:14.489 --> 00:12:18.679
work researching the subject matter at hand and then writing an outline.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:24.069
Next up is the scriptwriting itself, where we try to

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:27.099
turn an interesting subject into a compelling story.

00:12:28.229 --> 00:12:32.669
Sometimes this is really easy, if there’s a story about someone’s

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:36.999
life, or a particular historical event with lots of twists and turns.

00:12:38.249 --> 00:12:43.999
Sometimes it’s a bit trickier, for example if it’s about a political or philosophical

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:50.349
concept, but we try to draw out the human elements of it, to turn it into a nice story.

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:55.049
When the script is complete, I’ll normally leave it for

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:58.449
a few days then go back and rewrite large parts of it.

00:12:59.489 --> 00:13:00.909
Then comes the recording.

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:06.519
That bit is not so complicated, it is literally a case of having a microphone and pressing record.

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:11.299
But I hadn’t appreciated until starting this podcast that

00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:14.889
it is actually quite difficult to get good quality sound.

00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:21.729
I live in Malta, which is essentially a 24/7 construction site, so

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:26.009
finding a time where there are no hammers or drills is difficult.

00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:34.019
I also live across the street from a pub and have two young children, so finding a time when

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:40.279
there are no drills, no children, and no people drinking beer across the street is…not easy.

00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:46.149
In fact, for about six months I had to record every episode after 11 o’

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:50.369
clock at night, as that was the only time when there was relative peace!

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:54.659
Anyway, after the recording comes the editing.

00:13:55.659 --> 00:14:01.059
Up to episode number 100, I think it was, I did all of the editing myself.

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:07.009
Now we have a professional editor, so if you’ve been listening since the start and you’ve

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:12.419
noticed the sound quality getting better, well you have our editor, Eze, to thank for that.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:19.889
After the editing, we go through and create the worksheets, including custom definitions for

00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:26.369
advanced vocabulary, vocabulary explanations, and as of recently a series of comprehension

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:32.039
and vocabulary questions, a quiz to test your knowledge after listening to the episode.

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:38.509
We write a description of the episode, write a summary, find a relevant image, add tags to it

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:44.139
so people can find it easily on the website, create a little YouTube video, then upload it.

00:14:45.089 --> 00:14:52.559
All in all, from start to finish, one episode can take anything from 8 to 20 hours to make.

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:55.409
And this happens twice a week.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:15:01.359
You get to enjoy the finished product, but there is a lot of work behind the

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:06.461
scenes with making this style of highly researched and produced type of podcast.

00:15:07.499 --> 00:15:10.649
Now, if this is one of the first episodes you’ve listened

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:14.099
to, you might be wondering “where should I start?”

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:16.509
It is a good question.

00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:20.769
There are already literally hundreds of hours of episodes to listen to.

00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:23.229
Should you start with the first one?

00:15:23.739 --> 00:15:24.499
The last one?

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.059
Somewhere in the middle?

00:15:27.099 --> 00:15:32.949
It’s tricky, because many traditional language courses have a clear start and end.

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:39.179
You start on lesson one, you go on to lesson 20, or whatever it is, and then you have

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:43.829
completed it, you get a nice little certificate that makes you proud, and you’re done.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.459
With English Learning for Curious Minds there is no

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:52.709
clear “start”, and there will never be a clear “end”.

00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:56.219
This is by design, it’s on purpose.

00:15:56.699 --> 00:16:00.069
It’s also how language learning works in the real world.

00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:03.229
There is no finish line, it’s about the journey.

00:16:04.819 --> 00:16:07.809
So, back to the question, where to start?

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:12.989
I would certainly not recommend that you start from the first episode, because

00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:16.949
I think the quality of our episodes has continued to improve over time.

00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.639
I might even say that the first one is the worst one!

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:26.689
I’d say that you should start from the episodes that seem the most interesting to you.

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:32.069
It’s well documented that it’s easier to learn a language if you are interested

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:37.289
in the subject matter, and it’s also just blindingly obvious, so start

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:41.269
with the episodes that are most interesting to you, and work from there.

00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:46.489
The best way of finding interesting episodes is through searching on

00:16:46.489 --> 00:16:50.779
the Leonardo English website, as you can type in anything - “gangsters”,

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:55.809
“queens”, “British humour” - and you’ll see episodes about that topic.

00:16:56.839 --> 00:17:02.239
Listen to what you are interested in, ignore what you are not, and that is a

00:17:02.239 --> 00:17:07.499
surefire way of staying motivated, which is half the battle with language learning.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.979
I’m biassed here, of course, but I think you should also

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:15.249
try to listen with the interactive transcript and subtitles.

00:17:16.219 --> 00:17:21.169
If you’re wondering what an “interactive” transcript looks like, it’s much more than just text.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.419
The transcript has translations in 12 languages, so you can tap

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:30.579
on any word or expression and get the definition in your language.

00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:38.229
This also works with the subtitles, so if there is any word, expression, or even sentence

00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:43.529
you don’t understand, you can tap on it and you’ll see a translation in your language.

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:47.209
Now, why am I saying you should use them?

00:17:47.929 --> 00:17:53.289
Well, even if you can understand most of what is being said without the transcript,

00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:58.319
seeing the words written down at the same time as hearing them will help your

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:02.189
reading comprehension, your spelling, and therefore your written English.

00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:07.169
And the fact that you have all of the advanced words and phrases explained

00:18:07.179 --> 00:18:10.919
for you means you have extra help if you don’t understand something.

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:18.279
Now, the final point I want to say is that, even though we’ve been going for three and a half years,

00:18:18.479 --> 00:18:25.139
and we’re almost at episode number 400, I see this as right at the beginning of an exciting journey.

00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:30.899
Not only are we working hard to make two fascinating episodes of English Learning

00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:35.259
for Curious Minds every single week, but we’re working on new challenges,

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:41.119
new shows, like Pioneers Of The Continuum, and new ways of helping curious

00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:46.109
independent learners, like you, improve their English in a more interesting way.

00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:51.029
There are clearly a million different ways for someone to learn a

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:55.409
language, listening and learning with this podcast is just one of them.

00:18:56.429 --> 00:19:00.379
So the last thing I want to say to you is thank you.

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:06.789
Your time is valuable, you’ve either already chosen, or are perhaps at the start of choosing,

00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:12.099
to listen and learn with English Learning for Curious Minds, and this is a wonderful thing.

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:18.849
When I made the first episode I had no idea that so many people, including

00:19:18.849 --> 00:19:23.459
you, would listen and learn with something I made as a bit of an experiment.

00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:31.779
And knowing that it’s helping you, and people like you, well that makes me very happy indeed.

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:40.959
OK then, that is it for this unusual episode, “Meet English Learning for Curious Minds version two”.

00:19:41.535 --> 00:19:45.146
I hope it was interesting nonetheless and whether you have indeed been

00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:48.686
listening from right at the beginning, or whether this was the first

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:52.046
episode you’ve ever listened to, well I hope it was an interesting one.

00:19:53.296 --> 00:19:58.026
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode, I’d love to hear from you.

00:19:58.556 --> 00:20:01.686

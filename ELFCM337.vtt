Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.662
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:11.832
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:13.722
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.102
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:18.162
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:20.352
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:23.902
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:25.542
going to be talking about something

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:27.442
called the “Penny Dreadful”.

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:31.472
A penny is, as you may know, the smallest

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:34.082
denomination of the British pound, and

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:37.792
dreadful means awful, very bad, terrible.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:41.092
And put together, a “Penny Dreadful”

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:43.332
was a type of short horror story

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:45.572
popular during the Victorian era.

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:48.932
It’s a genre that has all but died

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:51.252
out today, in its original format at

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:54.312
least, but was one of the biggest crazes

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:56.702
of 19th Century Britain, even being

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.082
called “the Victorian equivalent of

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.052
video games”, and being described as

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.922
“Britain’s first taste of mass-produced

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:06.642
popular culture for the young".

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:10.582
So let’s get right into it and talk about

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:12.842
the phenomenon of the penny dreadful.

00:01:15.192 --> 00:01:17.392
“The rising moon was just peeping

00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:19.472
above the horizon, and a few

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.272
faint, sickly beams of light shot

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:24.492
up from it into the night sky.

00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:26.912
Standing in the middle of the

00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:29.282
road […] was a horse and rider.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:32.082
The moonlight shimmered upon

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:33.842
both with a strange effect.

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:37.602
The rider was tall and muscular and sat

00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:40.462
in the saddle with an ease and grace.

00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:43.682
The steed, [or horse] , which

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:45.952
he rode was none other than the

00:01:45.952 --> 00:01:48.962
celebrated ‘Black Bess’, her rider

00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:51.422
went by the name of Dick Turpin.”

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.032
The horseman was leaning forward

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:55.792
in his saddle and intensely

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:58.022
listening as a carriage approached.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.742
Inside the carriage were a man

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:02.692
and wife and they were travelling

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.022
with a rare treasure, a golden

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:07.232
cup, which they had been closely

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:08.862
guarding throughout their journey.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.012
As the couple made their way towards

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:13.972
Turpin, they suddenly heard a

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:16.692
gunshot and got so frightened that

00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:18.712
their golden cup fell to the floor.

00:02:19.762 --> 00:02:22.352
Then they heard a voice: “pull up,

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:24.592
coachman, or you are a dead man!”

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:27.922
It was Turpin, and when the coach

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:29.492
stopped he approached the window.

00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:32.032
The husband’s terror was clear

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.172
on his face and he asked if

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:35.612
Turpin was going to kill them.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.282
Turpin assured that he was not

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:40.432
before he lifted his hat and said

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:42.332
“I am sorry to trouble you, but

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:44.702
this is really a case of necessity.”

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:46.842
He then demanded their money,

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:48.992
jewellery and the golden cup.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.852
Fearing Turpin and his gun, the couple

00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:55.252
did as they were told and got out

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:57.332
of the carriage to give their riches

00:02:57.452 --> 00:02:59.162
to the robber while the coachman,

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:01.682
or driver, had ran off to get help.

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:04.322
As they struggled to remove their

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:06.832
jewellery and grab the golden cup from the

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:09.422
floor of the carriage, an army of around

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:12.992
12 police emerged from around the corner…

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.742
This is the story from the very first

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:20.422
instalment, or episode, of Black Bess,

00:03:20.662 --> 00:03:22.922
a series that would go on to become the

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:25.162
most popular of the Penny Dreadfuls.

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:29.712
The sudden ending, or cliffhanger, was

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:32.152
typical of these stories as they had

00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:34.442
to keep their readers eagerly awaiting

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:36.612
the next episode the following week.

00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:40.302
And this strategy was clearly a

00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:43.212
success, as Black Bess continued

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:46.162
for a whopping 254 books.

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:49.072
People couldn’t get enough of the

00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:51.862
adventures of Dick Turpin, the highwayman

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:53.642
who lived a century before these

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:56.142
tales made him famous in the 1860s.

00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:00.572
And Turpin was not alone, for tales

00:04:00.592 --> 00:04:02.872
about highwaymen were the longest lasting

00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:05.182
trend within penny dreadful literature.

00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:09.262
By the time Turpin rode onto the scene in

00:04:09.492 --> 00:04:13.042
1868, penny dreadfuls had been around for

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:16.332
roughly 30 years, and there were more than

00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:18.532
a million copies being sold every week.

00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:21.942
Given that many would be bought and

00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:24.372
read aloud to groups of multiple

00:04:24.382 --> 00:04:26.512
people, it’s safe to assume that the

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:29.012
number of people who either read or

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:31.302
listened to a Penny Dreadful story

00:04:31.372 --> 00:04:33.032
would be several times this number.

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:36.306
And when you think that the entire

00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:39.436
population of England and Wales was 17

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.946
million people in 1851, we are likely

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:46.016
talking about the vast majority of

00:04:46.016 --> 00:04:48.016
the teenage population of the country.

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:50.996
But what was so special

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:52.146
about these stories?

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.546
And how did they get so popular?

00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:58.476
Well, as the name suggests, penny

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:01.526
dreadfuls were sold for a single penny.

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:05.186
Sure, a penny back in the 19th century

00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:07.176
was worth a lot more than it is

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:09.716
today, but it was still very cheap.

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.106
One penny is about 25p now, it's

00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:16.806
a quarter of a pound, but perhaps

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:19.366
a better comparison is that one

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:21.696
instalment of these books was about

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.046
the same price as a loaf of bread.

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:27.206
And to give you another point of

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:29.946
comparison, this genre was very

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.386
cheap compared to normal books,

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:34.206
books you may well have heard of.

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:38.086
For example, an instalment of a Charles

00:05:38.086 --> 00:05:40.846
Dickens novel such as Oliver Twist would

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:43.976
cost around 12 pennies, or 1 shilling.

00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:47.026
Before you’re thinking, hang on,

00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:49.326
these Penny Dreadfuls are just short

00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:51.846
stories or chapters of a book, no

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:54.066
wonder Oliver Twist was more expensive,

00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:56.974
it's an entire book, remember that

00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:59.004
Charles Dickens also published

00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:01.364
his books in the same, serialised,

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:03.924
format, with new instalments coming

00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:06.204
out over a period of weeks or months.

00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:09.944
So, each instalment of a Penny Dreadful

00:06:09.954 --> 00:06:12.774
was incredibly cheap, less than

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:15.329
1/10th of the cost of a normal book.

00:06:16.757 --> 00:06:20.154
As you might expect, this low price tag

00:06:20.304 --> 00:06:22.854
did a great deal to expand the number

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:25.554
of people who were able to read or, if

00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:27.524
they were illiterate, listen to these

00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:30.674
stories, and in so doing for the first

00:06:30.684 --> 00:06:33.894
time it opened up literature to society’s

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.424
poorest, which in Victorian England,

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:38.594
was the majority of the population.

00:06:39.484 --> 00:06:41.254
So, how was it possible

00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:42.514
to make them so cheap?

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:45.177
Well, partly, automation.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.055
Innovations in printing technology

00:06:48.295 --> 00:06:50.215
allowed for mass produced prints

00:06:50.235 --> 00:06:52.515
on very cheap and thin paper.

00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:55.205
With the invention of the steam

00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:58.605
powered press in 1814, printing had

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:00.925
become mechanical and automated.

00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:04.775
It was 5 times faster than the at-the-time

00:07:04.775 --> 00:07:07.075
revolutionary Gutenberg printing press.

00:07:07.765 --> 00:07:10.325
Paper was cheap, for once, and the

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:12.475
process of printing onto the paper,

00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:14.325
and then putting it all together,

00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:16.721
was more efficient than ever before.

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.051
To keep costs low, they did not

00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.851
have fancy thick book covers,

00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:25.671
they were simply 8 to 16 pages of

00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:28.051
thin paper with columns of text.

00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:30.471
Really, they were more like a

00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:33.291
modern-day magazine or comic book.

00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.991
And let’s not forget the cost

00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:38.271
of actually writing the stories.

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:42.061
This genre, much like what is

00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.871
disparagingly called “airport novels”

00:07:45.121 --> 00:07:48.091
nowadays, was written quickly, often

00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:51.281
with generic and formulaic characters.

00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.981
Authors working for publishing houses

00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:56.881
would write tirelessly, often being paid

00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:00.081
a penny per line and being responsible

00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:03.011
for up to 10 stories at the same time.

00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:06.371
As a result, Penny Dreadfuls

00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:08.071
were criticised for their lack

00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:10.011
of literary merit, for not

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.771
being particularly good books.

00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.991
We’ll come to some of the results of

00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.381
this shortly, but the point to remember

00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:19.451
here is that they were very cheap

00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:21.341
to make, meaning that they could be

00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:23.466
sold for the cost of a loaf of bread.

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:26.536
And the result of these penny

00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:28.756
dreadfuls being so affordable was,

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:30.766
of course, that they could be bought

00:08:30.926 --> 00:08:33.176
and enjoyed by people who would never

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.076
have been able to buy a book before.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:39.026
The 19th century was, after all, a time

00:08:39.046 --> 00:08:41.426
of booming literacy rates in Britain,

00:08:41.816 --> 00:08:43.506
principally due to the widespread

00:08:43.546 --> 00:08:45.796
availability of schooling for children.

00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:51.056
In the 1830s, under 50% of women and

00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:53.966
only around 60% of men could read.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:58.746
Within just 40 years, by the mid 1870s,

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:02.596
90% of the British population could read.

00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:06.316
And despite these better education

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:08.466
outcomes for children, as you may

00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:10.906
know, life in Victorian Britain was

00:09:11.106 --> 00:09:14.136
pretty tough and miserable, especially

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:16.186
at the start of the 19th century.

00:09:17.226 --> 00:09:21.236
In 1821, almost half of the entire

00:09:21.246 --> 00:09:24.276
workforce was under the age of 20

00:09:24.736 --> 00:09:27.176
and the average age children began

00:09:27.186 --> 00:09:29.456
working was just 10 years old.

00:09:30.476 --> 00:09:32.606
They would work in factories, on

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:35.376
farms, as chimney sweeps, in all

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.896
manner of tough and dangerous jobs.

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:41.276
Even Charles Dickens, who became the

00:09:41.276 --> 00:09:43.626
most celebrated and successful of

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:46.016
Victorian writers, worked as a child

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:48.686
in a factory that produced boot polish.

00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:51.766
Throughout the 19th century, the

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:54.686
British government did pass legislation

00:09:54.706 --> 00:09:56.966
to improve the plight of the working

00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.306
poor, but it was a slow process.

00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:03.716
In 1833, for example, the “Factory

00:10:03.716 --> 00:10:06.506
Act'' was celebrated as a wonderful

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:09.426
thing for children, but what did it say?

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:11.906
Only that you had to be 9

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:13.666
years old to legally work.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:17.416
In any case, even if it did improve,

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:20.606
slightly, life as a child in Victorian

00:10:20.606 --> 00:10:22.456
Britain was somewhat miserable.

00:10:22.942 --> 00:10:26.133
And suddenly, along came this option

00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:28.273
of reading stories of adventure,

00:10:28.693 --> 00:10:31.333
mystery, murder, and the supernatural,

00:10:31.743 --> 00:10:33.583
all at a price that wouldn’t break the

00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:35.415
bank, that you could actually afford.

00:10:37.085 --> 00:10:40.295
As such, these books provided a welcome

00:10:40.295 --> 00:10:43.385
escape from the drudgery, boredom and

00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:46.115
hardship of factory life or classroom

00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:49.085
learning, and they were a massive hit.

00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:52.395
So, you are probably wondering, what

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:54.375
were these stories actually about?

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.585
Well, you heard a bit of one at the

00:10:57.585 --> 00:10:59.675
start of this episode, and you may

00:10:59.675 --> 00:11:01.295
have heard of some of the others.

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:04.695
Sweeney Todd, which was turned into a Tim

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.345
Burton movie starring Johnny Depp, was

00:11:07.345 --> 00:11:09.585
one of the most famous Penny Dreadfuls.

00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:12.065
If you haven’t heard the story, or

00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:15.745
seen the 2007 film, this tale is

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:18.775
all about a barber, a hairdresser,

00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:21.615
who killed his customers by slitting

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.195
their throats with his razor.

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:26.655
And the customers weren’t just killed,

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:29.625
they were turned into meat pies and

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:32.395
sold to unwitting members of the public.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.415
Then there was Black Bess, which we

00:11:35.415 --> 00:11:36.765
heard at the start of the episode.

00:11:37.285 --> 00:11:39.435
And these are just to name a few.

00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:42.245
Before long, increasing amounts of

00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:44.095
penny dreadfuls emerged and there

00:11:44.095 --> 00:11:46.405
was a huge choice of which weekly

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:48.865
tale or scandalous character whose

00:11:48.865 --> 00:11:50.605
adventures its readers could follow.

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:55.745
Between 1830 and 1850 there were up to 100

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:58.665
publishers offering these cheap stories.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:02.475
In the beginning, the stories were

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:05.005
usually about highwaymen like Dick

00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:07.205
Turpin, men who stopped people

00:12:07.305 --> 00:12:08.595
on the roads and robbed them.

00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:12.165
Indeed, the very first penny dreadful

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:15.635
which came out in 1836 was a collection

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:18.015
of biographies called The Lives

00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:19.805
of the Most Notorious Highwaymen.

00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:22.645
As a quick side note, if you

00:12:22.795 --> 00:12:24.135
haven’t listened to our episode

00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:26.175
on Highwaymen, it’s quite a fun

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:28.705
one, it’s episode number 197.

00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:31.855
Over time, though, other

00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:34.355
characters and storylines began

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.095
to increase in popularity, it

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:37.945
wasn’t only about criminals.

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:42.055
The most popular series was The Mysteries

00:12:42.105 --> 00:12:44.725
of London, which published a new episode

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:48.775
every week for 12 years, each one selling

00:12:48.805 --> 00:12:50.905
around a quarter of a million copies.

00:12:52.285 --> 00:12:54.295
These stories were based in the

00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:57.285
Victorian slums, or poor areas of the

00:12:57.285 --> 00:12:59.855
city where many of the readers lived,

00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:02.645
and they turned the grim surroundings

00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:05.255
into adventurous sites of mystery.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:09.525
Whether it was a murder or a scandalous

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:12.115
plot against a rich and evil superior,

00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:15.495
readers loved these sensational tales.

00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:19.965
As to the question of why, well, you

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.425
only have to take a look at the most

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:24.935
popular genres on YouTube or Netflix to

00:13:24.935 --> 00:13:28.225
see that this genre, this style, this

00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:31.035
type of story, is still equally popular.

00:13:32.305 --> 00:13:35.515
True crime, mysteries, the supernatural,

00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:38.845
we can debate the reasons why, but

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:41.315
modern series like True Detective or

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:45.005
Stranger Things are, in some ways, simply

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:48.015
developments, and certainly more expensive

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:50.485
developments, on the Penny Dreadful genre.

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.655
And the serialised format certainly

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:56.515
helped boost their popularity.

00:13:57.435 --> 00:14:00.015
Just like if your favourite TV series

00:14:00.115 --> 00:14:02.685
ends on a cliffhanger, ends with something

00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:04.575
exciting happening that might change

00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:07.415
the plot completely, well this was

00:14:07.415 --> 00:14:09.575
exactly the same with the Penny Dreadful.

00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:12.845
People would save their money, eagerly

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:15.025
awaiting the next instalment so they

00:14:15.025 --> 00:14:16.665
could see what would happen next.

00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:20.485
There were even stories of book clubs

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:23.265
being formed, kids who couldn’t afford

00:14:23.275 --> 00:14:25.515
the 1 penny price tag would club

00:14:25.515 --> 00:14:28.525
together and buy a book to share, and

00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:30.465
even those children who weren’t able

00:14:30.465 --> 00:14:33.265
to read would join the club and listen

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:35.435
to the story being read out loud.

00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:38.915
Initially, the subjects tended to be

00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:42.095
believable but “real-life” style stories

00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:46.125
- murderers, adventure, and so on, but all

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.745
within the confines of the “real” world.

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:51.915
As time went on, Penny

00:14:51.915 --> 00:14:54.455
Dreadfuls started to become more

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:56.445
supernatural as well, involving

00:14:56.735 --> 00:14:59.135
supernatural beasts and goings-on.

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.738
There were vampires, ghosts, evil

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:05.982
spirits, all of whom would commit gruesome

00:15:06.002 --> 00:15:08.502
crimes to the delight of their readers.

00:15:09.792 --> 00:15:13.332
But, as with any new craze, especially

00:15:13.332 --> 00:15:16.472
one that captivates the hearts and minds

00:15:16.492 --> 00:15:19.142
of the young, it wasn’t long before there

00:15:19.142 --> 00:15:21.572
were as many critics as there were fans.

00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:25.742
Much like horror movies or violent

00:15:25.742 --> 00:15:27.572
video games today, there were

00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:30.072
adult critics who feared the impact

00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:32.072
that devouring these stories would

00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:34.042
have on the children of the time.

00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:37.972
Victorians were famously moralistic,

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:40.512
with the upper classes feeling like

00:15:40.512 --> 00:15:42.928
they had a moral duty to protect

00:15:42.968 --> 00:15:46.118
their supposed inferiors from moral

00:15:46.118 --> 00:15:48.508
decay, and the phenomenon of the

00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:50.468
Penny Dreadful was really the first

00:15:50.478 --> 00:15:53.508
time that society en masse had had

00:15:53.538 --> 00:15:55.678
access to this kind of entertainment.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.888
It’s hard to overstate the fear and

00:15:59.888 --> 00:16:02.258
moral panic that ensued, with one

00:16:02.268 --> 00:16:05.598
newspaper in 1886 even declaring

00:16:05.768 --> 00:16:08.158
that penny dreadfuls were, I quote,

00:16:08.538 --> 00:16:10.628
“the poison which is threatening to

00:16:10.628 --> 00:16:13.218
destroy the manhood of democracy”.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.817
Why?

00:16:15.587 --> 00:16:18.298
Well, just like video games, people

00:16:18.298 --> 00:16:21.348
feared that simply reading about crime

00:16:21.538 --> 00:16:23.658
would mean that someone was more likely

00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:26.148
to commit crimes, that reading violent

00:16:26.158 --> 00:16:29.018
stories could inspire violent acts.

00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.738
And in the final two decades of the 19th

00:16:32.768 --> 00:16:35.068
century, after the penny dreadful craze

00:16:35.068 --> 00:16:37.508
had reached its height, people were

00:16:37.518 --> 00:16:39.928
increasingly blaming the stories for

00:16:39.928 --> 00:16:42.438
crimes actually committed by children.

00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:45.378
Almost every month, there would be

00:16:45.568 --> 00:16:48.548
news stories of crimes or acts that

00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:50.258
were blamed on Penny Dreadfuls.

00:16:51.758 --> 00:16:54.458
In 1892 there was one of some

00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:57.548
schoolboys who ran away with a gun and

00:16:57.548 --> 00:16:59.358
were caught with a note which read:

00:17:00.058 --> 00:17:01.538
“Steal the money; go to the

00:17:01.538 --> 00:17:02.998
station and get to Glasgow.

00:17:03.368 --> 00:17:04.828
Get boat for America”.

00:17:06.198 --> 00:17:08.568
People believed the boys were inspired

00:17:08.588 --> 00:17:10.878
by tales such as Jack Harkaway’s

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:13.408
Schooldays, which was about a boy who

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.618
ran away to begin a life of adventure.

00:17:16.948 --> 00:17:19.378
In the same year, the suicide of a

00:17:19.428 --> 00:17:21.868
12-year-old boy who hanged himself

00:17:21.968 --> 00:17:24.268
was also blamed on penny dreadfuls.

00:17:25.018 --> 00:17:27.408
In court, the verdict was announced

00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:30.708
as “suicide during temporary insanity,

00:17:31.028 --> 00:17:33.708
induced by reading trashy novels”.

00:17:35.268 --> 00:17:38.198
But tensions really hit an all-time

00:17:38.218 --> 00:17:41.558
high in 1895, when the body of a

00:17:41.558 --> 00:17:43.888
woman was found in a house in London.

00:17:45.018 --> 00:17:46.918
The police didn’t have to search far

00:17:47.048 --> 00:17:49.408
for her killers, as they were, in

00:17:49.408 --> 00:17:52.568
fact, her 12- and 13-year-old sons.

00:17:53.728 --> 00:17:55.758
The elder boy had insisted that

00:17:55.798 --> 00:17:57.638
his brother told him to stab their

00:17:57.638 --> 00:18:00.058
mother to death, and when the police

00:18:00.088 --> 00:18:02.958
investigated, they found a huge collection

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:05.088
of penny dreadfuls in the house.

00:18:06.288 --> 00:18:08.428
The copies were used as evidence in

00:18:08.428 --> 00:18:11.438
the case and in court a judge called

00:18:11.438 --> 00:18:14.378
for laws to “stop the inflammable and

00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:16.308
shocking literature that is sold.”

00:18:17.898 --> 00:18:20.018
All of these controversies were the

00:18:20.018 --> 00:18:22.148
beginning of the end for the penny

00:18:22.148 --> 00:18:25.018
dreadful craze, as publishers began to

00:18:25.028 --> 00:18:27.368
distance themselves from problematic

00:18:27.368 --> 00:18:29.648
material and real-life tragedies.

00:18:30.258 --> 00:18:32.208
It’s not exactly good for business

00:18:32.248 --> 00:18:33.998
if you’re being blamed for causing

00:18:33.998 --> 00:18:35.848
terrible murders and suicides.

00:18:37.118 --> 00:18:39.608
As a result, there was a gap in the

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:42.318
market for more uplifting stories for

00:18:42.318 --> 00:18:45.401
children, stories that included moral

00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:48.148
or educational lessons, stories that

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.638
ended well, stories without murder,

00:18:50.968 --> 00:18:53.398
violence or brutality, stories that

00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:55.728
a parent would be much happier to buy

00:18:55.738 --> 00:18:57.618
for their child than a Penny Dreadful.

00:18:58.718 --> 00:19:01.048
The patriotically named The Union

00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:03.908
Jack was one of them, and in fact the

00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:06.448
entire objective of The Union Jack

00:19:06.608 --> 00:19:10.068
was, and I’m quoting directly, to “put

00:19:10.258 --> 00:19:12.268
the Penny Dreadfuls out of business”.

00:19:13.348 --> 00:19:15.238
The Union Jack had another

00:19:15.318 --> 00:19:17.458
large advantage - its price.

00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:20.898
It cost half a penny, half as

00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:22.648
much money as a Penny Dreadful.

00:19:23.948 --> 00:19:25.958
For a budget-conscious audience,

00:19:26.318 --> 00:19:28.838
clearly this was a big advantage.

00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:32.258
What’s more, there was a shift away

00:19:32.258 --> 00:19:34.718
from serialised-fiction towards

00:19:34.858 --> 00:19:37.118
full-length books, so when you could

00:19:37.128 --> 00:19:39.778
buy a full novel of a few hundred

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.358
pages for the price of a handful of

00:19:42.358 --> 00:19:44.654
Penny Dreadfuls, and the quality of the

00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:47.429
narrative was a lot better, this option

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.659
suddenly wasn’t so expensive at all.

00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:53.299
And on the other end of the spectrum,

00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:56.866
during the 1870s there was a boom in

00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:59.476
comic books, illustrated books, Which

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:01.606
were even more accessible than penny

00:20:01.606 --> 00:20:03.796
dreadfuls, because there were pictures.

00:20:05.146 --> 00:20:06.936
The Penny Dreadful genre was

00:20:07.096 --> 00:20:09.256
being squeezed from all sides.

00:20:09.736 --> 00:20:11.966
Everything that had made it so popular

00:20:12.386 --> 00:20:15.946
- its price, its accessibility, its blood

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:19.176
and gore - was now available in different

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:22.236
formats, formats that were often preferred

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:24.296
by readers that had once snapped up

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:26.386
every Penny Dreadful on the shelf.

00:20:27.606 --> 00:20:29.609
By the turn of the century, the Penny

00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:31.889
Dreadful had practically died out.

00:20:33.229 --> 00:20:36.259
Now, when it comes to the legacy of the

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:38.909
Penny Dreadful, fortunately the fears

00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:41.509
about the genre destroying all morality

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:44.279
and poisoning democracy didn't come true.

00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:47.351
Perhaps they might have inspired

00:20:47.641 --> 00:20:50.951
some reckless behaviour, even violent

00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:53.331
acts, but did they turn an entire

00:20:53.331 --> 00:20:56.411
generation into rampant serial killers?

00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:57.681
They did not.

00:20:58.701 --> 00:21:02.141
In fact, many commentators now point to

00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:04.391
the positive impact of the Penny Dreadful.

00:21:05.421 --> 00:21:08.081
Sure, they may not have had the literary

00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:10.781
merit of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens,

00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:13.741
or Shakespeare, but they did encourage a

00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:16.111
generation of children to start reading.

00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:19.911
As one professor put it, penny

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:21.931
dreadfuls gave children “an

00:21:21.931 --> 00:21:24.551
incentive to require literacy”.

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:26.491
In other words, they gave

00:21:26.491 --> 00:21:28.501
children a reason, or some

00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:30.331
motivation to learn to read.

00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:33.311
They didn’t want to be left out when

00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:35.061
everyone else was talking about the

00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:38.171
latest robbery by Dick Turpin or who

00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:40.261
Sweeney Todd’s latest victim was.

00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:44.501
Now, it’s clearly an overstatement to say

00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:47.401
that the Penny Dreadfuls single-handedly

00:21:47.421 --> 00:21:49.281
increased literacy rates in Victorian

00:21:49.281 --> 00:21:51.641
Britain, as there were plenty of other

00:21:51.651 --> 00:21:54.011
factors that taught children how to read.

00:21:54.741 --> 00:21:57.771
But, the Penny Dreadfuls did inspire a

00:21:57.771 --> 00:22:00.911
generation to keep reading, to use the

00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:02.731
skills that they had learned at school.

00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:06.841
So, despite the critics and fears for the

00:22:06.841 --> 00:22:10.031
morality of Victorian youth, and fears

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:11.861
that they would lead to the destruction of

00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:14.811
the very fabric of society, it certainly

00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:17.241
seems that there are many worse things

00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:19.971
a Victorian child could have done than

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:22.068
getting addicted to Penny Dreadfuls.

00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:26.971
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:29.281
episode on Penny Dreadfuls.

00:22:29.571 --> 00:22:30.921
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:22:30.971 --> 00:22:32.621
and that you learned something new.

00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:35.281
As always I would love to know what

00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:36.891
you thought about this episode.

00:22:37.471 --> 00:22:38.941
Are there equivalents of the

00:22:39.241 --> 00:22:41.441
Penny Dreadful in your language?

00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:42.951
Do you think that the concerns

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.831
about violent video games or

00:22:45.111 --> 00:22:47.081
films are any different to the

00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:48.931
concerns about Penny Dreadfuls?

00:22:49.591 --> 00:22:51.011
If so, why?

00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:53.661
I would love to know, so let’s

00:22:53.661 --> 00:22:55.241
get this discussion started.

00:22:55.521 --> 00:22:56.601

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:15.666
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:19.926
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:23.966
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.556
a fantastic mathematician, a man called Srinivasa Ramanujan.

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:36.576
He was one of the most famous mathematicians of all time, and his story, from hunger and starvation

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:42.906
in India through to the most prestigious of Cambridge colleges is fascinating and inspiring.

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:49.156
So, let’s waste no time, and learn about the brilliant life of Ramanujan.

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:57.309
At the end of January 1913 a mathematician at the University of Cambridge, the most

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.189
prestigious university in the UK, if not the world, for mathematics, received a letter.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.849
He opened it up, and started reading.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:09.119
It began like this:

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:10.549
dear Sir,

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:16.169
I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.339
of the Port Trust Office at Madras on a salary of only £20 per annum.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:26.399
I am now about 23 years of age.

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:32.829
I have had no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course.

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:39.939
After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.359
I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:50.559
in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself.

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:57.229
I have made a special investigation of divergent series in general and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.829
the results I get are termed by the local mathematicians as "startling".

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:08.349
The letter then continued to present some amazingly profound and interesting

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.969
ideas about mathematics, about investigations that this young man had made,

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:19.369
proofs that he was working on, and startling discoveries that he had found.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.279
The letter was signed S.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.139
Ramanujan, and it was addressed to G.H.

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:31.899
Hardy, who was at the time one of the world’s leading pure mathematicians.

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:38.269
It was to be the start of an amazing relationship, an enduring friendship, and

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:43.429
the discovery of one of the greatest mathematical geniuses of the 21st century.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.339
To understand Ramanujan though, we need to go a little back.

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:54.499
He was only in his 20s when he wrote that letter, so we don’t need to go back too far.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:05.419
Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on the 22nd of December 1887 in the town of Erode, in South East India.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.119
His father was an accounting clerk, and his mother sang at a local temple.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.169
His family were of the Brahmin caste, the Hindu caste of priests, and scholars.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.199
It was a high caste, but they were not rich by any standards.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.969
From an early age, Ramanujan showed a real gift for mathematics.

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.569
By the age of 10 he was the top student in his class, and he soon spent

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.109
every spare hour devouring the mathematics textbooks in his school’s library.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:45.459
By the age of 12, he was working his way through advanced mathematical ideas.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.079
It was clear that the boy was incredibly talented, but

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.309
it was by no means obvious what this could lead to.

00:03:54.179 --> 00:04:00.179
When he was 16 he managed to get his hands on a copy of a book of mathematical theories

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.719
from a Cambridge professor, a book that opened up a whole new world for Ramanujan.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:13.119
He was just a 16 year old boy from a poor family in a town in India, and this

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:18.549
book gave him a view into some of the most advanced ideas in mathematics.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:24.169
The book laid out some of the main theories of the day, which we won’t

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.519
go into because they are obviously very complicated and this is an

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:32.729
episode about the humans behind the story, rather than the mathematics.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.209
But the point is that, with mathematical research,

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.789
you need to show the proof of why something is true.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:46.479
The book that Ramanujan found only showed the theories, and so

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.199
he understandably thought that that was how you did mathematics.

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.669
So when it came to the letter he was later to send Hardy, he sent his mathematical

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:03.049
theories without proof, in the same style of the book that he had found when he was 16.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:10.369
Anyway, to get back to our story, Ramanujan quickly started working on his own mathematical ideas.

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:15.779
He wasn’t content to merely understand what others had found, he

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:19.909
was working on his own problems, his own mathematical theories.

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:26.499
He was too poor to afford much pen and paper though, so he would do most

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.959
of his work on slate with chalk - a slate is a kind of rock - and then he

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:37.179
only wrote on pen and paper when he had actually figured something out.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.029
As he was clearly a genius, not just ‘top of his class’ but really ‘in

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.519
a different league’, he won a scholarship to a Government Arts College.

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.629
However, he devoted all of his attention to mathematics, which meant that

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.469
he failed his non-mathematical exams, and ended up losing his scholarship.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.369
He transferred to what was then Madras, and is now called Chennai, to

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.829
enrol in another college, but again he failed his non-mathematical exams.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:18.199
He was miserably poor, and had completely devoted himself to the study of mathematics.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.659
Every last piece of money he had he used to pay for

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.649
pen and paper, and he was said to be constantly hungry.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.299
Nevertheless, he was making substantial mathematical developments,

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.856
despite working almost completely on his own, thousands of miles away

00:06:37.066 --> 00:06:41.396
from the centres of mathematical scholarship in Europe and North America.

00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:50.296
By 1910 or so, when he was 23, he found some odd jobs as a mathematics tutor,

00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:55.416
started to join circles of people who were also interested in mathematics,

00:06:55.796 --> 00:07:00.606
and stumbled across some good fortune by meeting a government official

00:07:00.856 --> 00:07:05.876
called Ramaswamy Aiyer, who had founded the Indian Mathematical Society.

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:13.306
Aiyer was amazed at the work that Ramanujan had done, and was still doing, and put

00:07:13.336 --> 00:07:19.226
him in touch with another of his mathematical friends, a man called Ramachandra Rao.

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:27.856
Rao initially couldn’t believe that the work was real, and thought that Ramanujan must be a fraud.

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:35.786
It was only after talking to him, and witnessing his genius that he was persuaded that

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:43.396
Ramanujan was the real deal, and offered him a job at the Port of Madras as an accounting clerk.

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:51.996
An accounting clerk was, essentially, a human calculator, and Ramanujan, who had dazzled his school

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:59.356
friends by being able to recite Pi to hundreds of digits, was an incredibly good human calculator.

00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:03.716
But of course, just doing calculations for the Port

00:08:03.736 --> 00:08:07.586
of Madras was a huge waste of Ramanujan’s talents.

00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:13.626
Luckily, he was able to continue his research, and he also met several other keen

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:20.586
mathematicians, many of whom British expats, who soon realised that he had some special talents.

00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:27.056
The most important of these was a man called Francis Spring, an Irish

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:31.776
engineer, who had been living in British India for most of his adult life.

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:38.026
He recognised the genius of Ramanujan, put him in touch with other expat

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:43.916
mathematicians, and started writing to mathematicians in the UK to see

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:47.796
whether they were interested in the work that Ramanujan had been doing.

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:50.876
Initially there wasn’t much interest.

00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:57.316
Ramanujan was, after all, merely an accounting clerk for the Indian government.

00:08:58.096 --> 00:09:04.446
His theories were often messy, not as detailed as these professional academics were used to.

00:09:05.636 --> 00:09:09.546
You can understand why - Ramanujan was almost completely

00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:12.716
self-taught, he hadn’t even completed university.

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:20.066
On the 16th of January, 1913, Ramanujan took it upon himself to write to G.H.

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:25.026
Hardy, a professor of mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, the most

00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:29.706
famous college of the most famous university for mathematics in the world.

00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:33.936
Hardy was struck by the contents of the letter.

00:09:34.886 --> 00:09:41.756
The theories proposed by Ramanujan were astounding, and he thought that if this was the sort of

00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:48.926
thing that this young man could come up with without any real support or help, just imagine what he

00:09:48.926 --> 00:09:55.126
might be capable of if he were allowed to come and continue his studies at a place like Cambridge.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:58.916
Ramanujan couldn’t afford to leave, of course.

00:09:59.126 --> 00:10:04.266
He had an annual salary of around £20, and there was no

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:08.326
way he could ever be able to leave without external help.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:15.806
Hardy replied to the letter, saying “I was exceedingly interested by your letter and by

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:21.996
the theorems which you state”, but that he wanted to see proof of Ramanujan’s theories.

00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:27.186
There was a bit of back and forth, a bit of an exchange of letters.

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:33.036
Showing proofs was a bit of a problem for Ramanujan because he hadn’t really

00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:38.206
been used to this way of working, and a lot of his research was through

00:10:38.386 --> 00:10:44.566
intuition - he just instinctively knew, or at least believed, something to be true.

00:10:45.726 --> 00:10:49.546
As this exchange of letters was happening, Hardy was trying to

00:10:49.806 --> 00:10:53.856
set the wheels in motion for Ramanujan to come to Cambridge.

00:10:54.906 --> 00:10:55.906
It wasn’t easy though.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:01.386
Firstly, despite showing signs of being one of the best mathematical

00:11:01.396 --> 00:11:06.776
brains in the world, Ramanujan hadn’t actually got an undergraduate degree.

00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:11.696
How could Cambridge give him a position as a postgraduate

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:15.216
if he hadn’t actually completed undergraduate university?

00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:19.096
The problems weren’t just on the British side though.

00:11:19.686 --> 00:11:26.036
When the suggestion was raised of Ramanujan coming to Cambridge, he initially rejected it.

00:11:26.956 --> 00:11:30.326
His family were in India, his mother and his young wife.

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:36.696
His religious beliefs also prohibited him from leaving India, and the idea of

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:41.766
going to a country on the other side of the world was of course a big decision.

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:46.536
Eventually, Ramanujan was persuaded, Cambridge offered him

00:11:46.536 --> 00:11:50.426
a scholarship for two years, and he set sail for London.

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:58.126
Two weeks later, on April 14th 1914 he arrived, was picked up by

00:11:58.136 --> 00:12:03.156
Hardy and whisked up to Cambridge to begin his postgraduate studies.

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:08.816
Life in Cambridge was, to state the obvious, a big change to Madras.

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:15.696
From the evident cultural differences to the fact that Ramanujan was a strict vegetarian,

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:21.526
adjusting to life at a British university took a while for this brilliant young man.

00:12:22.446 --> 00:12:26.636
Then, two months after he arrived, World War I broke out.

00:12:27.426 --> 00:12:31.116
Many of his fellow academics joined the war effort, and

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:34.426
were sent off to be killed on the fields of Northern France.

00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:39.226
Ramanujan continued to publish, making startling discoveries.

00:12:40.346 --> 00:12:44.786
Now that he was attached to Cambridge University, doors were open that

00:12:44.786 --> 00:12:48.816
never were when he was a mere accounting clerk at the Port of Madras.

00:12:49.746 --> 00:12:53.606
He was taken seriously, and his reputation continued to grow.

00:12:54.636 --> 00:13:02.006
However, he had always suffered from bad health, likely due to a poor diet earlier on in life.

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:08.146
In 1917 he fell very ill with a liver infection, thought to be

00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:12.206
caused by a parasite that had been with him since he left India.

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:18.439
No British doctors could diagnose what was wrong with him, and this infection

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:24.699
caused him great pain for months on end, making him depressed and even suicidal.

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:32.339
Despite his sickness, he continued his research, publishing and publishing, and became a Fellow, a

00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:40.019
member, of something called the Royal Society, the country’s top scientific society, in May 1918.

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:46.979
He was still unwell though, and so traveled back to India in March 1919.

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:55.209
He continued his studies from India, but unfortunately he died a year later, aged only 32.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:14:01.429
He left a huge legacy in the field of mathematics, and indeed many

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:05.629
of his theories have only relatively recently come to be understood.

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:13.439
He couldn’t always prove them, but it seems that he had a rare ability for just knowing

00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:18.949
when something was right, even if he couldn’t always understand why it was right.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:24.639
He has become the poster boy for Indian genius, and his story

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:29.859
certainly is amazing, inspiring, albeit tragic in its end.

00:14:30.922 --> 00:14:36.202
So there you have it, Ramanujan, the boy from the town in South East India with

00:14:36.202 --> 00:14:41.232
an empty stomach so that he had enough money for paper who, despite all the

00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:46.682
odds, became one of the most famous mathematicians of the 20th century, and whose

00:14:46.682 --> 00:14:52.212
work has had and will have an impact for generations of mathematicians to come.

00:14:52.972 --> 00:14:55.812
It’s a brilliant story, and who knows what he could have

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.092
achieved if he had only lived just a little bit longer.

00:15:01.152 --> 00:15:06.112
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Srinivasa Ramanujan.

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:09.772
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:10.892 --> 00:15:13.992
If you are interested in mathematics, then there is

00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:16.752
obviously a huge amount of his work for you to read up on.

00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:23.432
I guess if you’re a mathematician you will know his story already, but as I was researching

00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:28.882
this episode I have to confess I did get quite sidetracked reading some of his work.

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:30.672
It is, of course, fascinating.

00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:35.062
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:15:35.192 --> 00:15:38.172

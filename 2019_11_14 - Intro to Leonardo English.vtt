Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.660
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.060
This is the inaugural episode, so it'll be a little different to the rest of them.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:28.440
In this episode, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the English Learning
for Curious Minds podcast, about me and about what you can expect from the show.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.100
I'll also give you a few tips on how you can use these podcasts to maximize your English learning.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.515
A lot of these tips will be valid for almost any English podcast you listen to, whatever your level.

00:00:44.953 --> 00:00:55.903
If you like what you hear, well, you can hit subscribe and you'll have the podcast in your pocket so
you can learn English while learning fascinating things about the world, wherever you are, whatever

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:56.613
you are doing.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:09.303
You can also find all of the episodes plus transcripts and key vocabulary
for everything on the website, which is www.leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:21.955
So let's get cracking and start with the first question you may be asking yourself,
who the hell am I and why should you care about anything that I have to say?

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:24.565
Well, excellent question.

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.846
My name is Alastair Budge.

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:32.626
I'm 32 years old and I'm currently recording this podcast from Malta.

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:37.516
If you don't know where that is, it's a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.876
If you can't tell from my accent, I'm English.

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:46.236
I grew up all over the UK actually, but spent most of my life in London.

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:49.654
Like you, I'm a language learner.

00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:51.894
I speak fluent French and Italian.

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:56.234
My Italian's actually a little better than my French now, and I have a Master's in Chinese.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:10.006
Over the years, I've learnt quite a few other languages, including Russian, Japanese, and Latin and
Greek, and I've tried loads of different ways to learn languages, both formal and informal through

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:14.566
books, films, and of course my favorite method podcasts.

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:17.448
I'm now married to an Italian.

00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:28.698
I live in Malta and have a little baby who can't speak just yet, but I speak English to him and his
mother speaks Italian to him and in school he learned Maltese so we're at least trying to bring up a

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:29.848
trilingual baby.

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.086
In addition to being an avid language learner, I've also been an English teacher.

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:42.421
So I've experienced language learning both from the
teaching side and from the language learner side.

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.231
So I know what works and more importantly, I know what doesn't work.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:57.663
What doesn't work, and by this I mean what isn't really going to help you
get to any level of fluency, are grammar books and vocabulary exercises.

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:08.689
You might end up being able to pass a test and the scoring high on an IELTS exam, but
it's not going to do a huge amount to actually help you communicate with native speakers.

00:03:09.737 --> 00:03:16.396
Listening, on the other hand is the number one thing that will help you learn, in my experience.

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:23.706
And by this I mean listening to native speakers, exposing yourself to how English speakers speak.

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:33.841
This is of course, especially important if you don't have the chance to meet English
native speakers that often, let's say you live in a non English speaking country.

00:03:35.343 --> 00:03:43.523
Now, if you're listening to this podcast, you probably don't need someone
to convince you that using podcasts to learn a language is a good idea.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:45.613
So I'll save you most of that part.

00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:57.833
But what I will do is tell you a little bit about Leonardo English and the English Learning for
Curious Minds podcast, why I started it, what I hope you can get out of it, and the sort of things

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.673
that you can expect from the show.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:05.709
Okay, so what is the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast and who is it for?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:14.420
I started the podcast quite simply because I wished that something
like this had existed for me when I started out as a language learner.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:29.257
What always frustrated me was that when, I was learning French and Italian at least, there only
seemed to be the choice between this boring listening exercise style stuff and content that was

00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:39.177
actually aimed at native speakers, which was often spoken really fast with
multiple different speakers and was quite unforgiving to a language learner.

00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:47.087
I thought, if I was learning a language, what would I want my ideal podcast have.

00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:53.597
Well for starters, it would be about something that was actually interesting to me.

00:04:54.487 --> 00:05:05.737
I'm not interested in scripted conversations about people going shopping or talking about
their family members or hobbies, nor am I really interested in small talk conversations.

00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:18.247
I'm the kind of person who really wants to learn interesting things about the way the world
works as I learned the language, I just get bored with small talk and scripted conversation.

00:05:20.127 --> 00:05:26.367
So that was one must, that the podcast would teach people something over and above language.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:33.465
Secondly, it would have to have some additional materials to help me if I got stuck.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:41.935
Now, this doesn't mean that every word would have to be
translated, but it would mean that there was something to help me.

00:05:42.372 --> 00:05:50.042
A transcript is a must and also some highlighted vocabulary so
that I wasn't always having to look things up in a dictionary.

00:05:51.917 --> 00:06:04.327
I'm the kind of person who quickly loses attention if I have to be constantly looking things
up in a dictionary, and so some way of avoiding this was necessary for this dream podcast.

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:11.537
So I looked around and nothing really existed like this for English language learners.

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.037
So I thought, okay, I'll make it.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:19.377
Now, what can you expect from this podcast?

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:23.017
On one level, it's quite simple.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:25.715
Podcasts for the curious mind.

00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:33.515
Listening to the podcast will help you improve your English
communication while you learn fascinating things about the world.

00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:38.295
And if you don't know what I mean by a curious mind.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.110
I just mean someone who's always curious, whose mind is constantly whirring away.

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.809
They just want to know the way things work.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:57.529
They want to know how and why, And they're the kind of person who has
this innate thirst for knowledge, just wants to absorb information.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:03.179
If this is you, then this will all be pretty familiar, I guess.

00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:09.798
All of the podcasts we produce are aimed squarely at English learners with curious minds.

00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:21.513
They are all thoroughly researched and we aim to condense fascinating stories
or concepts into manageable podcasts each between 10 and 20 minutes long.

00:07:22.444 --> 00:07:30.674
But don't expect the vocabulary, grammar, or sentence structure
to be dulled down just because they're for non-native speakers.

00:07:32.064 --> 00:07:42.774
Yes, the speed of the podcasts and the speed of the speech may be a little slower
than if you are listening to the news or content aimed directly for native speakers.

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:54.919
And I'll make sure that I or any of the guests on the podcast speak clearly,
but it won't be artificially slow, as that's just not how you learn effectively.

00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:00.843
We'll use vocabulary in a way that's engaging, authentic, and non-trivial.

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:09.710
You can follow everything in the key vocabulary or transcript on the website if you have
trouble and we'll cover exactly how you can use those towards the end of the podcast.

00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:16.800
We want every podcast to teach you something new, for
you to finish listening to it and go, wow, that was cool.

00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:30.397
We're going to be doing episodes on a whole range of subjects from black holes to a see that
disappeared from talking about the greatest prison escapes of all time, to the fascinating history

00:08:30.397 --> 00:08:31.707
of the English breakfast.

00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:36.717
If it's not interesting, well, we're just not going to make a podcast about it.

00:08:38.842 --> 00:08:47.282
We'll release at least two podcasts a week, one on a Tuesday, one
on a Friday, and there will be bonus longer episodes once a month.

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.987
The podcasts will all be relatively short.

00:08:51.367 --> 00:09:01.637
Most will be around 10 minutes and everything will be under 20 so they're just the right
length that you can fit them into your day without having to carve out a huge amount of time.

00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:07.626
Now getting onto the next part, how should you actually use podcasts to learn English?

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:12.313
Well, there is a mammoth guide on this on the blog.

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:19.203
I think it's almost 5,000 words long, so if you really want to
read up about this, then I'd recommend checking out that guide.

00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:29.498
I'll also add it into the show notes, and there's another podcast coming out on how to
use podcasts to learn English so that will have a whole load of information as well.

00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:34.908
But I just wanted to touch on a few simple ways that you can use podcasts, learn English.

00:09:36.128 --> 00:09:41.018
I should point out that all of these tips apply to any podcasts you listen to, not just this one.

00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:42.498
Okay.

00:09:42.528 --> 00:09:50.998
Number one tip is, if you can, to listen without distractions
so make sure you're listening actively, not passively.

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:52.918
What do I mean by this?

00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:59.843
Well, active listening means sitting down with a notebook,
writing down interesting phrases or words you don't understand.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.556
It can mean doing things like trying to transcribe the podcast or shadowing.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:08.466
So speaking out loud at the same time as I am.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.821
You can find the transcript on the website, that's Leonardoenglish.com.

00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:17.961
You can also print that out and use it as an aid to help you as you go along.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:28.921
The main difference between active and passive listening is active listening
is when you're listening and you're completely focused on the podcast.

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:33.226
Passive listening is when you're doing it while you're doing something else.

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:46.216
So perhaps your running, driving in the car, doing the dishes, doing whatever it might be, but it's
quite difficult, especially when you're listening to a podcast in a second language to actively

00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:48.336
concentrate when you're doing something else.

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:55.856
Second tip is to set aside a time every day or week and stick to it.

00:10:57.186 --> 00:11:00.936
It's the easiest thing in the world to say to yourself, okay, cool.

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:12.196
I'll start listening to a podcast to learn a language, but if you don't set aside time in your day,
you're much less likely to actually do it, even if it's just 10 minutes after your shower in the

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:14.796
morning or 20 minutes during your lunch break.

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.791
Set aside the time for it and actually do it.

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:27.424
And the final tip, and this is of course not revolutionary,
is to find other people to listen to the podcast with.

00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:38.774
If there's a friend or colleague who has a similar level to you, then listen to it
together, discuss it in English, of course, and use it as a way to practice speaking.

00:11:40.644 --> 00:11:47.814
Podcasts are such an incredible language learning tool,
but they're so underused by most English language learners.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:50.601
They teach you listening, of course.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:55.589
But if you use them properly, they can also help your speaking, reading and writing.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:02.200
Plus they live on your phone, you can access them whenever
you want, and you get to hear directly from native speakers.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.660
So just think about it.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:16.360
People spend thousands of dollars to go and do intensive language immersion courses in places where
native speakers are, but they could get immediate access 24 hours a day to native speakers directly

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.230
in their ears, through their headphones, through a podcast for free.

00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:32.037
As I'm sure you can guess, I'm a bit of a fan of podcasts, but that's just because I know how
powerful they can be and I hope through listening to this podcast and learning with Leonardo English

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:36.807
and the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast, you'll come round to my way of thinking too.

00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:39.222
Right.

00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:41.622
This episode has just been a taster.

00:12:42.372 --> 00:12:52.462
Yes, you could of course say that this first one hasn't been a fascinating story that has
taught you about the way the world works, but I hope it has given you an idea of things to come.

00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:55.092
So should you hit subscribe?

00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:56.622
Well, that's up to you.

00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:59.322
All I can say is that we have big plans.

00:12:59.642 --> 00:13:09.962
There's going to be a load of interesting stuff coming up over the next few weeks, and if you want
something that is far more interesting than phrasal verbs or vocabulary books, then I hope we tick

00:13:09.962 --> 00:13:10.432
this box.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.230
I also want to say that Leonardo English isn't some huge, faceless corporation.

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:26.944
I want you to be a part of it, and if you've got an idea for an episode, you have some feedback
on the podcast, or there are any questions that you might have, then come and say, hello, we don't

00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:27.244
bite.

00:13:27.705 --> 00:13:36.795
You can say hello on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com on the Learn English
with Podcast group on Facebook, so just search, learn English with podcasts on Facebook.

00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:39.395
Or on Instagram at LeonardoEnglishapp.

00:13:39.995 --> 00:13:43.605
I would love to hear from you, and all feedback is good feedback.

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:45.085
Okay.

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:47.755
So that's it for episode number one.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:51.095
I hope you've enjoyed it and that it's given you a taste of things to come.

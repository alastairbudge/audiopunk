Hello, and welcome to Leonardo English - English
learning podcasts for the curious mind, I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:15.327
This is the inaugural episode, so it'll be a little different from the rest of them.

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:23.467
In this episode, I'm going to tell you a little bit about Leonardo
English, about me, and about what you can expect from the podcast.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:30.287
I'll also give you a few tips on how you can use these podcasts to maximize your English learning.

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:36.337
A lot of these tips will be valid for almost any English podcast you listen to, whatever your level.

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:47.707
If you like what you hear, well, you can hit subscribe and you'll have Leonardo English in your
pocket so you can learn English while learning fascinating things about the world, wherever you are,

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:48.587
whatever you're doing.

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:56.457
You can also find all of the episodes plus transcripts
and key vocabulary for everything on the website.

00:00:56.877 --> 00:00:58.597
That's Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:10.227
So let's get cracking and start by their first question you may be asking
yourself: who the hell am I and why should I care about anything you have to say?

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:12.327
Well, good question.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.181
My name is Alastair.

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:19.401
I'm 32 years old and I'm currently recording this podcast from Malta.

00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:23.391
If you don't know where that is, it's a tiny rock in the middle of the Mediterranean.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.361
If you can't tell from my accent, I'm English.

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:32.421
I grew up all over the UK actually, but spent most of my life in London.

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.211
Like you, I'm a language learner.

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:39.861
I speak fluent French and Italian, my Italian is actually better than my French now.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:49.636
I've got a Master's in Chinese, and over the years I've learnt quite a few
other languages, including Russian, Japanese, Spanish, Latin and Greek.

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:59.396
And I've tried loads of different ways to learn languages, both formal and
informal, also through books, films, and of course my favorite method podcasts.

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:10.476
I'm now married to an Italian live in Malta, and we've got a little boy, who can't speak just yet,
but I speak English to him, his mother speaks Italian to him and in school he'll speak Maltese.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:13.476
So trying to bring up a trilingual baby.

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:15.836
I've also taught English.

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.796
I've been an English teacher over the period of four years.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:26.426
So what I'm trying to say is I know what it's like to learn a foreign
language, and I also know what it's like to teach a language to others.

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:30.536
I know what works, and more importantly, I know what doesn't work.

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:42.551
I also know how important it is to actually listen to native speakers, especially if you're someone
who doesn't have the chance to listen to native speakers that often, perhaps you don't live in an

00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:43.551
English speaking country.

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:51.711
Now, if you're listening to this, you probably don't need someone to
convince you that using podcasts to learn a language is a good idea.

00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:53.413
So I'll save you that part.

00:02:54.343 --> 00:03:04.721
But what I will do is tell you a little bit about Leonardo English, why I started the podcast,
what I hope you can get out of it, and the sort of things that you can expect from the show.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:07.504
Okay, so Leonardo English.

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:17.074
I started the podcast quite simply because I wished that something
like this had existed for me when I started out as a language learner.

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:31.741
What always frustrated me is that when I was learning French and Italian, at least, there only
really seem to be a choice between boring, tedious listening exercises- type stuff and content aimed

00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:38.341
actually at native speakers, which was often spoken
really fast and was unforgiving to a language learner.

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:45.217
So I thought, if I was learning a language, what would I want my ideal podcast to have?

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:50.944
Well, for starters, it would be about something that was actually interesting to me.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:04:01.369
I'm not interested in listening to scripted conversations about people going
shopping or talking about their family members or booking a room at a hotel.

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.179
Nor am I really interested in small-talk conversations.

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.359
I'm the kind of person who wants to learn interesting things about the world.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:15.399
As I learn a language, I get bored with small-talk and scripted conversation.

00:04:16.414 --> 00:04:22.974
So that was one must, that the podcast would teach people something over and above language.

00:04:24.434 --> 00:04:25.104
Secondly.

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:31.979
This dream podcast would have some additional materials to help me if I got stuck.

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:38.739
Now, this doesn't mean that every word would be translated,
but it would just mean that there was something to help me.

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:46.409
A transcript is a must and also some highlighted vocabulary so
that I wasn't always having to look things up in a dictionary.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:48.949
That was one of the things that really frustrated me.

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:55.219
But nothing really existed like this for English language learners.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.039
So I thought, okay, I'll make it, and here we are.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.350
Now, what can you expect from Leonardo English?

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.230
On one level, it's simple podcasts for the curious mind.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:19.720
Listening to the podcast will help you improve your English communication while you
learn fascinating things about the world And curious mind, what do I mean by this?

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:29.880
So if you don't know what I mean by a curious mind, I just mean
someone who is always curious, whose mind is constantly whirring away.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.690
They want to know the way things work.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.350
They want to know how and why.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.840
They are the kind of person who just has an innate thirst
for knowledge, who just wants to absorb information.

00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:48.315
If this is you, then this will all be very familiar I guess.

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:56.725
All of the podcasts that we produce are aimed squarely at English learners with curious minds.

00:05:57.295 --> 00:06:05.795
They're all thoroughly researched and we aim to condense
fascinating stories or concepts into manageable podcasts.

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:12.665
But don't expect the vocabulary or grammar to be dulled
down just because they're for non-native speakers.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:26.960
Yes, the speed of the podcasts may be a little slower than if you are listening to the news and I'll
make sure that I, or any of the guests on the podcasts speak clearly and don't eat our words as many

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.420
English speakers do, but it won't be a podcast where
we speak like this, like it's a listening exercise.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.430
We'll use vocabulary in a way that's engaging, authentic, and non-trivial.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:50.200
You can follow everything in the key vocabulary and transcript on the website if you
have trouble, we'll cover exactly how you can use those towards the end of the podcast.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:07:01.480
And the podcast app you're listening to this on should allow you to speed
up or slow down the speed of the audio if it's too easy or if it's too hard.

00:07:03.128 --> 00:07:12.498
We want every podcast to teach you something new for you to finish listening
to it and go 'hey, wow, that was interesting', and tell people about it.

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:28.162
We're going to be doing episodes on a whole range of subjects from black holes to a sea that
disappeared, from explaining how bonds work to talking about the history of the English breakfast.

00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:32.322
If it's not interesting, well, we're not going to make a podcast about it.

00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:42.947
We'll release at least one podcast a week and there will be bonus
longer episodes for members, for subscribers of Leonardo English.

00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:45.417
Those are available exclusively on the website.

00:07:46.847 --> 00:07:54.937
Members get the transcript and key vocabulary for all of the podcasts, and
you can find out more about that on the website, so Leonardoenglish.com.

00:07:55.627 --> 00:08:08.708
If you're really serious about learning English with podcasts, and I hope you are, then there are a
load of resources on the website: guides, tips and tricks, plus also more information on how you can

00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:09.297
become a member.

00:08:10.747 --> 00:08:13.177
The podcasts will all be relatively short.

00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:17.769
Most will be around 10 minutes and everything will be under 20 minutes.

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:24.701
So they're just the right length that you can fit them into
your day without having to carve out a huge amount of time.

00:08:25.842 --> 00:08:31.282
Now getting onto the next part, how should you actually use podcasts to learn English?

00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:38.632
Well, there is a mammoth guide on the Lenardo English blog, I think it's almost 5,000 words long.

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:50.279
So if you really want to read more about this, then I'd recommend checking out that article, but
I just want to touch on a few of the ways you can use podcasts and you can use Leonardo English.

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:56.819
I should point out though, the vast majority of these tips
apply to any podcasts you listen to to improve your English.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.540
Okay?

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:08.625
Number one is, if you can of course, to listen without distractions
and make sure you're listening actively, not passively.

00:09:10.044 --> 00:09:11.134
What do we mean by this?

00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:18.604
Active listening means sitting down with a notebook, writing
down interesting phrases or words you don't understand.

00:09:19.304 --> 00:09:27.814
It means doing things like trying to transcribe the podcast
or shadowing, so speaking out loud at the same time as I am.

00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:32.478
You can find the transcript on the website so leonardoenglish.com.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:37.162
You can also print that out and use it as an aid to help you as you go along.

00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:39.352
So you can circle words you don't know.

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:44.322
You can use the transcript in a way that you get the most benefit from.

00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:53.572
Secondly, and this might sound like a generic tip, but I think it's
quite important because it's neglected by the vast majority of people.

00:09:54.587 --> 00:09:59.036
Set aside a time every day or every week and stick to it.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:03.656
It's the easiest thing in the world to say to yourself, okay, cool.

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:11.606
I'll start listening to a podcast to learn a language, but if you don't
set aside time in your day, you're much less likely to actually do it.

00:10:12.304 --> 00:10:20.682
Even if it's just 10 minutes after your shower in the morning or 20
minutes during a lunch break, set aside the time for it and actually do it.

00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:30.537
The final tip, and this is of course not revolutionary,
is to find other people to listen to the podcast with.

00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:43.771
If there's a friend or colleague who who is a similar level to you in English, then listen to the
podcast with them, listen to it together, discuss it in English, of course, and use it as a way to

00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:45.331
practice your speaking.

00:10:46.126 --> 00:10:49.616
Podcasts are such an incredible language learning tool.

00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:57.176
They teach you listening, obviously, but if you use them
properly, they can help your speaking, reading and writing.

00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:59.286
Plus they live on your phone.

00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:03.802
You can access them wherever you want and you get to hear directly from native speakers.

00:11:05.827 --> 00:11:06.817
As I'm sure you can guess.

00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:18.817
I'm a bit of a fan of podcasts, but that's just because I know how powerful they can be and I hope
through listening to this podcast and learning with Leonardo English, you'll come round to my way of

00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:19.587
thinking too.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.290
Okay.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.460
This inaugural episode has been just a taster.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.370
Yes.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.670
You could of course say that this first one hasn't been
a fascinating story that has taught you about the world.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.120
But I hope it has given you an idea of things to come.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.298
So should you hit subscribe?

00:11:37.358 --> 00:11:38.768
Well, that's up to you.

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:43.269
All I can say is that we have big, big plans at Leonardo English.

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:54.370
There's going to be a lot of interesting stuff coming up over the next few weeks, and if you want
something that is far more interesting than phrasal verbs or vocabulary books, then I hope we'll

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.270
tick this box.

00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:01.365
I also just want to say that Leonardo English isn't some huge faceless corporation.

00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:11.355
I want you to be a part of it, and if you have an idea for an episode or you have some
feedback on the podcast, or there's any questions you have, then come and say, hello.

00:12:11.445 --> 00:12:11.935
I don't bite.

00:12:13.225 --> 00:12:21.275
You can say hello on the website, so that's Leonardoenglish.com on
the Learn English with Podcast group on Facebook or on Instagram.

00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:22.595
Just search for Leonardo English.

00:12:24.575 --> 00:12:26.525
That's it for episode number one.

00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:31.175
I hope you've enjoyed it and that it's given you a taste of things to come.

00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:38.715
You've been listening to me, Alastair Budge, and this has been
Leonardo English, English learning podcasts for the curious mind.

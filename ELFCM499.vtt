Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.839
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.040
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:25.034
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about vaping.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.690
It was billed as a solution to the world’s unstoppable addiction to smoking cigarettes,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.629
a way for people to stop smoking and get their nicotine hit in a safer, more healthy way.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
Countless lives would be saved, its creators and proponents proudly boasted.

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.130
But, as we’ll see, it wouldn’t be quite so simple.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.160
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the rise of the vape.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.549
California has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.170
United States, second only to the Mormon hotspot of Utah.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.660
Fewer than 10% of Californians smoke, half that of cigarette-loving West Virginia.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.439
And in the design facility of California’s Stanford

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.730
University, even 20 years ago, practically nobody smoked.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.300
To health-conscious Stanford students, smoking was a filthy habit, it was

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.430
far from cool, and the few smokers there would be forced to go outside, far

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.920
away from any university building to light up and get their nicotine hit.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.080
Two such students were James Monsees and Adam Bowen.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.900
They were both in their early 30s and were doing a Masters in

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.740
Product Design at Stanford’s world-famous school of design.

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.350
They had started smoking in their youth, and try as they might, neither could kick the habit.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.470
As two of the only smokers in their class, they often found

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.940
themselves outside, puffing away during breaks from class.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.560
They talked about a plethora of different things, but they couldn’t shake the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.609
idea of designing a product that captured all of the things they liked about

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.779
smoking–the ritual of smoking cigarettes and the physical feeling they got from

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.220
doing so–but without the health risks that they both knew cigarette smoking posed.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.300
Now, before we get into what happened next, let’s

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.200
just remind ourselves briefly about how smoking works.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.510
On a practical basis, the way smoking works is as follows.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.739
You light a cigarette, the dry tobacco leaves inside burn,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.570
releasing smoke which contains a chemical called nicotine.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.910
Nicotine is the so-called “good” bit, it’s the bit that can make you feel relaxed.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.840
But it’s also the addictive bit, it can create a physical dependence, leaving you wanting more.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.390
The problem with cigarette smoking isn’t the nicotine, though.

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.995
It’s all the other stuff that comes in the smoke that contains the nicotine.

00:03:15.773 --> 00:03:22.013
The smoke contains tar and all sorts of other chemicals that can cause heart disease, lung

00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:29.293
cancer, and all manner of nasty stuff that kills almost 10 million people every single year.

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:34.623
The nicotine itself, on its own, is not directly harmful.

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:40.103
So, thought Monsees and Bowen, our two Stanford students, when puffing

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:45.123
on their cigarettes, what if there were a way of creating a smoking-like

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:49.613
experience where you got the nicotine but none of the dangerous stuff?

00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:54.413
They knew that burning tobacco and inhaling the nicotine-filled

00:03:54.413 --> 00:03:57.973
smoke that comes from it wasn’t the only way to get nicotine.

00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:02.463
It is actually relatively easy and cheap to extract

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:06.203
nicotine from tobacco without creating any smoke.

00:04:07.403 --> 00:04:11.373
The process typically involves soaking the tobacco leaves in a

00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:16.473
solvent like water or alcohol to create a nicotine-infused solution.

00:04:17.253 --> 00:04:21.023
This solution is then processed to purify the nicotine,

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:25.013
separating it from other harmful substances present in tobacco.

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:30.573
And ta-da, you have purified nicotine, which can then be used

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:34.863
in various forms, such as nicotine patches or chewing gum.

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:42.293
It gives a nicotine hit, just like a cigarette, but without the tar and dangerous chemicals.

00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:50.563
However, as any smoker knows, and as Monsees and Bowen knew all too well, it isn’t the same.

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:57.093
If putting a nicotine patch on or chewing nicotine gum gave you everything

00:04:57.123 --> 00:05:01.733
that smoking a cigarette does, then why did so few smokers do this?

00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:07.063
Why had nicotine patches and nicotine gum remained unpopular,

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:10.523
only used in desperation by smokers trying to quit?

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:16.353
Monsees and Bowen knew that a big part of the reason that smoking was so

00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:22.163
addictive was because of the ritual of smoking, the act of smoking itself.

00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:29.773
There is nothing fun or bonding about sticking on a nicotine patch, but–as Monsees and Bowen knew

00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:35.403
from the activity that had brought them together–the very act of smoking, of lighting up with

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:41.863
a morning coffee or going for a cigarette break at university, and the very basic, perhaps even

00:05:42.073 --> 00:05:48.453
Freudian act of sticking something in your mouth and sucking it, this was what they knew they

00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:54.323
needed to recreate if they wanted to have any chance of weaning people off cigarette smoking.

00:05:55.743 --> 00:05:59.813
Now, this wasn’t a revolutionary idea by any means.

00:06:00.453 --> 00:06:05.623
The first concept for what would become known as the e-cigarette goes back to the

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:12.123
1960s, to a scrap metal dealer and heavy smoker himself, a man named Herbert A.

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:12.653
Gilbert.

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:19.146
He patented something called "a smokeless non-tobacco cigarette" that involved

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:24.036
"replacing burning tobacco and paper with heated, moist, flavoured air".

00:06:25.516 --> 00:06:29.596
The problem was that it wasn’t clear how it would work in practice,

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:33.756
and he couldn’t persuade any major tobacco company to invest in it.

00:06:34.816 --> 00:06:40.756
After all, it sounded complicated and this was before the famous surgeon

00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:44.906
general’s report that, yes, smoking might actually be bad for you.

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:50.946
Tobacco companies back then had little incentive to create smoke-free

00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:53.876
cigarettes, because people were very content to smoke normal

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:58.136
cigarettes, unaware of the multitude of health risks they presented.

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:04.826
As awareness of the dangers of smoking increased, and tobacco companies realised that

00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:10.526
they wouldn’t be able to sell cigarettes forever, they started to sit up and take notice.

00:07:11.816 --> 00:07:16.536
The tobacco industry started to spend literally billions of dollars trying

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:22.286
to create a smoke-free cigarette, but none managed to create anything viable.

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:28.076
The American tobacco company RJR Nabisco tried to create a

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:32.696
smokeless cigarette called the Premier, but it was a huge flop.

00:07:33.516 --> 00:07:36.866
It was difficult to use, it didn’t release as much

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:40.056
nicotine, and it didn’t taste as good as a cigarette.

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:45.776
If you have seen the film Barbarians At The Gate, you’ll remember that one

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:50.206
of the criticisms of the Premier, which was passed verbatim right up to the

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:55.186
boss of the company was, and I’m quoting directly, “this tastes like shit”.

00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:00.786
This was in the late 1980s, and it was the highest-profile flop.

00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:05.226
It wasn’t until the early 2000s that significant progress

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:09.096
was made, and this was in the smoke-loving nation of China.

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:15.016
A Chinese pharmacist and heavy smoker called Han Li built on the

00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:19.446
original idea for a smoke-free cigarette but gave it his own twist.

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:24.516
The nicotine would be delivered by a tiny battery in the cigarette,

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:29.426
heating nicotine-infused water and turning it into steam, which the

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.066
user would then suck in, like they would suck in cigarette smoke.

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:38.466
It was a big success but still, it wasn’t perfect.

00:08:39.396 --> 00:08:44.286
Indeed even its creator, Han Li, never managed to completely quit

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:49.116
smoking, instead smoking both e-cigarettes and normal cigarettes.

00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:56.186
Now, we must cross the Pacific Ocean again and return to the Stanford School of Design.

00:08:57.508 --> 00:09:02.448
Monsees and Bowen got to work on designing a new type of e-cigarette.

00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:05.958
It was ugly and impractical at first.

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:10.378
It was difficult to use, and required people to adjust various

00:09:10.388 --> 00:09:14.808
settings, check the temperature and replace bits of the devices.

00:09:16.128 --> 00:09:20.928
When compared to the incredibly simple and idiot-proof act of putting a

00:09:20.938 --> 00:09:25.048
cigarette in your mouth and clicking a lighter, it failed to take off.

00:09:26.648 --> 00:09:30.578
What’s more, their early designs were criticised because they could be

00:09:30.628 --> 00:09:35.338
easily modified to smoke marijuana, which, for a device that was trying

00:09:35.338 --> 00:09:39.558
to portray itself as a positive for public health, wasn’t a great look.

00:09:40.688 --> 00:09:45.908
However, they iterated and iterated, conducted tonnes of focus groups,

00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:51.676
and 8 years later the device they created would go on to be called Juul.

00:09:52.778 --> 00:09:56.748
You may well have heard of it, perhaps you've even tried a Juul yourself.

00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:03.648
It was revolutionary at the time in that it didn’t try to mimic every element of a cigarette.

00:10:05.048 --> 00:10:10.378
For starters, it didn’t try to look exactly like a cigarette, instead, it

00:10:10.378 --> 00:10:16.068
was shaped more like a mini USB stick, and looked sleek and futuristic.

00:10:16.508 --> 00:10:21.448
And Monsees and Bowen managed to get rid of all of the fiddly elements,

00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:25.648
the adjustable coils, the need to change batteries, and so on.

00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:33.508
Their new device could be recharged via USB, and all you needed to do was buy little cartridges

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:38.848
containing the liquified nicotine, which came in all sorts of innocent and friendly-sounding

00:10:38.858 --> 00:10:45.658
flavours: peach was the most popular, but there was also cool cucumber and even creme brulee.

00:10:46.168 --> 00:10:49.908
And for those who wanted to try Juul but still wanted a

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:53.174
cigarette-like taste, there was a Virginia Tobacco flavour.

00:10:54.068 --> 00:11:00.498
With Juul, they had succeeded in creating a device that people, finally, wanted to use.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:07.298
And, unlike previous e-cigarettes, it was incredibly effective at delivering nicotine,

00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:13.718
smokers, or vapers I guess we should say at this point, got a real hit of nicotine.

00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:18.348
As to how it worked, it was very similar to a cigarette.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:23.798
The user just needs to suck, this activates the battery and heats

00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:27.578
the e-liquid, creating a vapour, which contains the nicotine.

00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:34.048
It was an almost immediate success, with its founders passionately believing

00:11:34.248 --> 00:11:37.578
that they might just have invented the device that would stop people from

00:11:37.578 --> 00:11:42.808
smoking cigarettes, thereby saving literally millions of lives every year.

00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:51.118
They were forced to stop short of claiming that Juul was “safer”, but it was marketed as a cleaner

00:11:51.258 --> 00:11:57.538
alternative to smoking, and a way of getting smokers, like Monsees and Bowen, to kick the habit.

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:05.648
But before long they found huge success with an unexpected section of society.

00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:08.868
Teenagers, high school students.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:19.048
According to one study, vaping among teenagers increased by 1,800% from 2011 to 2019.

00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:26.378
14% of high school students vape, compared to less than 2% that smoke.

00:12:27.938 --> 00:12:33.982
Instead of vaping being primarily a way for adult smokers to stop smoking, what

00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:40.211
appeared to be happening was that teenagers who had never smoked before started vaping.

00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:43.338
There were all sorts of reasons for this.

00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:47.978
It was heavily promoted on social media by other teenagers, it was

00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:54.318
something you could do inside and quickly, and it was seen as cool and new.

00:12:55.748 --> 00:13:00.658
What was at this time still a bit of an unknown, though, were the health risks of vaping.

00:13:01.618 --> 00:13:06.508
Now, vaping was not smoking, it seemed safer than smoking

00:13:06.508 --> 00:13:10.668
cigarettes, but the long-term effects of vaping were unknown.

00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:13.108
Was it completely safe?

00:13:13.358 --> 00:13:15.008
Was it incredibly dangerous?

00:13:15.168 --> 00:13:17.608
Or was it somewhere in between?

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:23.198
What was undeniable was that only a small proportion of the teenagers

00:13:23.258 --> 00:13:27.528
who vaped were aware of the fact that vaping contains nicotine.

00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:33.929
According to one report, 63% of teen Juul users said

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:36.379
that they didn’t know the product contained nicotine.

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:42.189
And it doesn’t just contain a little bit of nicotine, e-cigarettes,

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:46.579
Juuls in particular, can have relatively high levels of nicotine.

00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:53.239
When you take into account how effective Juul is at delivering nicotine compared to

00:13:53.239 --> 00:14:00.209
cigarette smoking, one Juul pod has the same amount of nicotine as in a packet of cigarettes.

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:07.192
And because of how easy it is to vape, to Juul, how you can do it inside,

00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:12.062
all the time, many young people were consuming very high levels of nicotine,

00:14:12.562 --> 00:14:17.232
sometimes the equivalent of smoking multiple packs of cigarettes every day.

00:14:18.602 --> 00:14:24.672
Soon enough, there were reports of teenagers being hospitalised with collapsed lungs after heavy

00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:30.812
use of vapes, which had often been modified or were using bootlegged, unofficial ingredients.

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:36.792
Concerned parents wrote to schools and contacted local leaders, and in

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:44.402
December 2018 vaping was declared an epidemic by the US Surgeon General.

00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:51.782
By this time, hundreds of other e-cigarette companies had popped up, but Juul was the

00:14:51.822 --> 00:14:57.432
clear market leader in the United States, with something like a 75% share of the market.

00:14:58.402 --> 00:15:00.102
Business was booming.

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:07.642
In the same month that vaping was declared an epidemic, Juul also sold a 35% stake in the

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:16.534
company to Altria, the company that owns cigarette brands such as Marlboro, for $12.5 billion.

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:22.813
Overnight, Monsees and Bowen, the founders of Juul, were turned into

00:15:22.813 --> 00:15:27.962
billionaires, but this transaction caught the attention of the regulators.

00:15:28.992 --> 00:15:32.862
If Juul was an alternative to smoking, if they were

00:15:32.862 --> 00:15:36.212
the good guys, why did they sell to the bad guys?

00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:43.762
They used to bill themselves as anti-big tobacco, but now they were big tobacco.

00:15:45.182 --> 00:15:49.362
There was a series of investigations by the authorities, they were accused

00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:53.862
of marketing directly to children, huge fines were imposed on the company,

00:15:54.122 --> 00:15:58.702
and Juul was forced to make sweeping changes to the way it did business.

00:15:59.972 --> 00:16:05.812
Now, this episode is partly about Juul, because it was instrumental in the creation of the

00:16:05.812 --> 00:16:11.872
vaping industry, but we need to move on to talk about vaping and e-cigarettes more generally.

00:16:13.012 --> 00:16:15.862
How bad actually is it for your health?

00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:20.545
What sort of restrictions have governments placed on e-cigarettes and vaping,

00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:26.762
and how much should it be promoted, if at all, as an alternative to smoking?

00:16:28.412 --> 00:16:35.842
According to the British Public Health Service, e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than

00:16:35.892 --> 00:16:41.962
normal cigarettes, and the position of most national health services, including the World

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:48.252
Health Organisation, is that using e-cigarettes is safer than traditional cigarettes.

00:16:49.678 --> 00:16:54.328
But, partially because of the negative press around vaping, talk of it

00:16:54.328 --> 00:16:58.948
becoming an epidemic and stories of addicted teenagers rushed to hospital with

00:16:58.948 --> 00:17:04.358
collapsed lungs, many smokers think it is more dangerous than it actually is.

00:17:05.688 --> 00:17:13.088
According to one survey from last year, 57% of cigarette smokers said that they thought vaping

00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:20.928
was equally or more harmful than smoking, while only 27% thought e-cigarettes were less harmful.

00:17:22.288 --> 00:17:27.418
In other words, smokers who might otherwise switch to vapes are not doing

00:17:27.418 --> 00:17:31.378
so because they believe that there are no health benefits from doing it.

00:17:32.298 --> 00:17:37.078
And it isn’t just individual smokers who are cautious about switching to e-cigarettes.

00:17:37.748 --> 00:17:43.818
In many countries, 34 at the last count, e-cigarettes are completely banned.

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:49.798
Perhaps astonishingly, if you believe the view of the UK government that vaping

00:17:49.808 --> 00:17:54.758
is 95% less harmful than cigarette smoking, several of the countries that ban the

00:17:54.758 --> 00:17:59.968
sale of e-cigarettes have some of the world’s highest levels of cigarette smoking.

00:18:01.638 --> 00:18:09.108
In India, for example, 42% of adult men smoke, and smoking causes a million deaths a year.

00:18:10.308 --> 00:18:14.818
Turkey has practically the same prevalence of smoking, 42% of

00:18:14.818 --> 00:18:19.748
adult males, but e-cigarettes were banned in February 2020.

00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:25.698
Now, perfectly reasonably, these countries want to prevent young people from

00:18:25.698 --> 00:18:30.148
getting hooked on vapes, they fear that it could lead them to develop addictive

00:18:30.228 --> 00:18:34.748
tendencies, that it could lead them to start smoking cigarettes, and that

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:38.638
there could also be unknown health consequences from e-cigarettes themselves.

00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:41.848
These are perfectly valid concerns.

00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:46.668
But vaping is a proven effective alternative to smoking,

00:18:47.028 --> 00:18:50.228
a way to get smokers to stop smoking cigarettes.

00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:55.088
It might not be completely safe, and the long-term effects are still not

00:18:55.158 --> 00:19:00.348
completely clear, but it is a whole lot less dangerous than smoking cigarettes,

00:19:00.658 --> 00:19:04.288
20 times less dangerous if you believe the British Public Health Service.

00:19:05.548 --> 00:19:09.878
Ultimately, governments around the world want to reduce the percentage of their

00:19:09.878 --> 00:19:15.438
population that smokes, but there is a lack of consensus over the best way to do this.

00:19:16.248 --> 00:19:19.908
Is it by legalising and encouraging the use of e-cigarettes?

00:19:20.678 --> 00:19:26.608
Or is this a dangerous path that encourages teenagers to pick up an e-cigarette, which could

00:19:26.608 --> 00:19:31.568
lead to an addiction first to e-cigarettes, then cigarettes, and perhaps something more?

00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:39.798
The first Juul came out in 2015, almost 10 years ago now, and in 2024

00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:45.498
there are an estimated almost 100 million people who use e-cigarettes.

00:19:46.668 --> 00:19:51.898
It is a lot, but it’s a fraction, less than 8%, of

00:19:51.898 --> 00:19:55.228
the 1.3 billion cigarette smokers around the world.

00:19:56.658 --> 00:20:02.178
To the greatest proponents of e-cigarettes, they have the potential to save literally hundreds

00:20:02.178 --> 00:20:07.658
of millions of lives and be one of the most effective public health tools of the 21st century.

00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:13.788
To their greatest critics, they threaten to hook a generation on nicotine products,

00:20:14.058 --> 00:20:19.568
and may well bring with them a plethora of unknown and unexpected health problems.

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:22.818
Time will only tell which is right…

00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:29.759
OK then, that is it for today's episode on vaping, e-cigarettes, and Juul.

00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:32.688
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:33.778
Do you vape?

00:20:34.348 --> 00:20:40.018
If so, did you smoke cigarettes before, and how has vaping changed your cigarette consumption?

00:20:40.498 --> 00:20:44.958
What role do you think e-cigarettes should play, if any, in society?

00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:48.298
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

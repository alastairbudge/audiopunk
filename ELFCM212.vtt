Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:17.095
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:21.465
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:27.495
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Childhood,

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:32.475
and how ideas about children and childhood have changed over the years.

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:39.565
We’ll start by looking at early ideas about the role of children and the concepts of childhood,

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:46.605
then we’ll look at when and why this started to change, how the modern ideas of childhood came

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:53.765
about, how this was in conflict with industrialisation, and the resolutions that were made.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:59.405
Then we'll look at the creation of the idea of the teenager, and why

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:04.485
the idea of the adolescent didn’t really exist in the same way before.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:10.165
And finally we’ll reflect on modern and future childhood and ask

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:14.475
ourselves whether it really is true that the childhood of children

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:19.535
today is not as innocent and carefree as yours or mine might have been.

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:25.481
OK then, A Short History of Childhood.

00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:31.881
Now, with this show we often cover big, momentous topics or

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:36.971
historical events: the French Revolution, Fake News, Pirates.

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:43.061
In today’s episode we’re covering something that is, on one level, a lot less

00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:49.121
monumentous, a lot less covered in the history books: children and childhood.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:54.921
Yet for each and every one of us, we have experienced childhood.

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.481
We have all been children.

00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:02.251
Perhaps if you are one of our younger listeners you might still consider yourself a child now.

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:08.201
Even if you aren’t a younger listener, perhaps you would still consider yourself a child.

00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:14.081
And for those of us who are no longer children, perhaps we have our own

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.941
children who are still in their childhood, perhaps they are now young

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:23.531
adults, or perhaps they have grown up and had children of their own.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:28.951
The point is that childhood, or at least being a child, is

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:33.571
something that unites us all, and this is what we’ll explore today.

00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.661
We’ll focus on the ideas of childhood in Britain, but

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:43.011
will also touch on ideas of childhood further afield too.

00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:49.581
There are some important questions to think about before we start on this journey.

00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:52.091
What exactly is a child?

00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:54.201
What is childhood?

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:59.191
When do you stop being a child, and for what reasons?

00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:03.871
And when you stop being a child, what do you become?

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:09.291
We will explore all of these questions in due course, but I raise

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:13.721
them now to get us thinking, before we dive into the history.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:19.461
Now, historians are in fact somewhat divided over the idea of

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:23.981
childhood before the Enlightenment, around three hundred years ago.

00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:31.951
The French historian Phillipe Ariès, who wrote the seminal 1960 book “L’Enfant et la

00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:37.811
Vie Familiale sous l’Ancien Régime”, which was translated into English as “Centuries

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:44.081
of Childhood”, simply believed that childhood didn’t exist until the 17th century.

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:51.551
Famously he wrote that “in medieval society, the idea of childhood did not exist".

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:57.541
Firstly, infant mortality was so high, with anywhere

00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:02.631
from 30-50% of babies dying before their first birthday.

00:04:03.351 --> 00:04:09.611
Given that such a high proportion of children would die, it simply wasn’t practical to

00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:16.531
devote your emotional energy towards them nor to invest time and effort in their growth.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:24.441
This certainly isn’t to say that Medieval parents were cruel, emotionless, and felt no love

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:31.991
for their children, but rather that death was so commonplace that the death of a child was not

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:38.581
unexpected, and therefore was less of a tragedy than the death of an infant would be today.

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:46.339
In Medieval times, so the theory goes, if a child was lucky enough to survive

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.639
its first few years it would help its parents with household work and farming.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:58.939
There simply was little time to play or develop creatively, as we encourage children to

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.579
do today, nor was there the belief that this was an important thing for children to do.

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:11.669
Children didn’t tend to celebrate their birthday, they celebrated their Saint’s

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.269
day, the day on which the saint they would be named after was celebrated.

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.009
For this reason many people didn’t really know how old they were.

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.639
What’s more, there was this puritanical Christian idea of original sin, the idea that

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:36.529
man comes into the world in sin, and so newborn babies needed to be freed from this.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:43.289
A baby needed to be baptised and then redeemed through Christian instruction.

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:50.429
If they were lucky enough to be born into a relatively wealthy family and to

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.658
survive past their first birthday, they might receive a religious education,

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.139
but the purpose of this wasn’t to allow them to expand their mind and think for

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.789
themselves, it was to help them on their journey towards Christian salvation.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:15.439
Thus for most of the Medieval era at least, if you were poor, which would mean the majority of

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:22.339
the population, your young life, your childhood would consist of helping your parents around the

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:29.329
house and working, and if you were born into a wealthy family, it might involve some religious

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:36.929
instruction, but there was no developed idea that children needed to be treated greatly differently.

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:44.519
In both cases, so Ariès’ theory goes, there was no concept of childhood,

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:49.555
or it being a unique, important stage of a person’s development.

00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:55.565
Now, things started to change at the start of the Enlightenment, when

00:06:55.765 --> 00:07:01.925
philosophers and thinkers all over Europe started to question assumed beliefs.

00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:09.175
When it comes to childhood, the first “revolutionary” idea came from the Englishman

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:16.505
John Locke, who proposed that an infant, a newborn child was a tabula rasa,

00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:22.915
a blank sheet of paper, in need of education and instruction from his elders.

00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:29.285
Thus it was the parents’ responsibility to educate and nurture their

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:34.545
children, to make sure that they were able to make their way in the world.

00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:42.275
Fast forward a few decades and across the English Channel the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:50.385
Rousseau proposed another new and revolutionary idea relating to the development of children.

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:59.745
He proposed that children had their own innate natural way of developing, guided by their emotions.

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:08.575
The idea was that by nurturing children in the right way, and allowing them to explore

00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:15.955
on their own, they could start to reason, and being able to reason was the aim for man.

00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:23.895
They should be free, but there should also be a closer bond between mother and child.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:31.585
At this time especially mothers from wealthy families wouldn’t breastfeed their children, instead

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:38.395
sending them to wet nurses, female servants who would breastfeed them instead of the mother.

00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:44.175
Rousseau placed a great importance firstly on the child having its

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:50.495
own freedom to explore, but also on the bond between mother and child.

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:56.405
This was crucial to a healthy, happy and successful childhood.

00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:02.625
Rousseau even defined three stages of childhood development:

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:10.035
Stage one was up to the age of twelve, when children should be guided by their feelings.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:15.705
Stage two was from twelve to around sixteen, and this

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:19.405
is when they start to develop their own sense of reason.

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:25.085
And stage three is from sixteen onwards, when the child

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:29.355
becomes an adult, marries and has children of their own.

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:37.005
Most of this comes from his 1762 book “Emile, or On Education”, and is still

00:09:37.045 --> 00:09:43.638
influential today - you can see similar ideas at work in places like Montessori schools,

00:09:43.798 --> 00:09:49.728
and his theories are an important part of many progressive educational theories.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:57.824
So, the Enlightenment gave us these two opposing views of childhood, but they at least

00:09:57.854 --> 00:10:04.663
recognised that children have unique needs and that childhood is of vital importance.

00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:11.473
Strange enough as it might seem to us now, this is something that appears not to

00:10:11.473 --> 00:10:17.773
have been a real consideration beforehand, at least Ariès, the first historian to

00:10:17.773 --> 00:10:23.573
write about childhood, believes the concept simply didn’t exist in the Medieval era.

00:10:24.843 --> 00:10:29.933
The Romantics, who appeared towards the end of the 18th century, went

00:10:30.033 --> 00:10:34.953
a step further than the Enlightenment thinkers, imaging children as

00:10:35.163 --> 00:10:41.093
free, pure and innocent, only to be corrupted by the rules of society.

00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:47.143
Starting with people like the English poets William Wordsworth and William

00:10:47.153 --> 00:10:52.323
Blake at the turn of the 19th century, in the late 18th and early 19th

00:10:52.323 --> 00:10:59.131
century, children were seen as free, unencumbered by the norms of society.

00:10:59.803 --> 00:11:05.873
Children should be spontaneous, free to do what they want, to learn from

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:11.083
what is around them rather than being forced to learn from textbooks.

00:11:11.703 --> 00:11:20.143
Children also started to appear in works of art, often naked and smiling, showing their innocence.

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:25.863
The English Romantic poets linked childhood to the power of

00:11:25.863 --> 00:11:31.153
imagination, and believed that children were closer to God than adults.

00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:35.513
Children were capable of things that adults were not,

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:39.793
and the adult world corrupted the innocence of children.

00:11:41.193 --> 00:11:48.333
We can see how this is so very different to the original ideas of childhood, and even of John

00:11:48.343 --> 00:11:54.573
Locke’s vision, where he suggested that children were blank slates that needed instruction.

00:11:55.743 --> 00:12:02.573
Now, through the Romantic movement in Britain, childhood became almost holy, a

00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:09.213
time of innocence, the only time in a human’s life where he or she was completely

00:12:09.213 --> 00:12:15.993
free, and thus it was a time to be cherished, a time of vital importance.

00:12:16.713 --> 00:12:23.003
But, at the same time as the Romantic poets the Industrial Revolution was just getting started.

00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:30.603
Great Britain was a deeply unequal society, and the creation of factories and lack

00:12:30.623 --> 00:12:37.083
of any kind of real social security system pushed more and more children into work.

00:12:38.093 --> 00:12:43.343
While in the Medieval times children might have worked alongside their parents in

00:12:43.343 --> 00:12:49.443
the fields or around the house, in the late 18th and early 19th century children

00:12:49.633 --> 00:12:56.653
might spend 12 hours a day 7 days a week, literally half their lives and almost all

00:12:56.813 --> 00:13:03.863
their waking hours working away in dangerous factories doing repetitive, menial work.

00:13:04.603 --> 00:13:10.503
Just while the Romantics were pushing this idea that children should be free and

00:13:10.503 --> 00:13:15.863
that childhood was a crucially important time for the development of children, the

00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:22.703
luxury of having this type of childhood was restricted only to the richest in society.

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:28.233
As these awful conditions became better known, in part through

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:33.463
novelists such as Charles Dickens who documented the plight of working

00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:38.843
children, there was an increasing movement to restrict child labour.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:47.573
In 1833, a law was passed to say that children working in the cotton or

00:13:47.573 --> 00:13:53.063
woolen industries needed to be more than 9 years old and that nobody under

00:13:53.063 --> 00:13:58.963
the age of 18 could work more than 10 hours a day or eight hours on a Sunday.

00:13:59.613 --> 00:14:05.583
Now, that gives you an idea of how bad it was before that there was a law that was

00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:12.663
put in place to stop children who were under 9 from working more than 68 hours a week.

00:14:13.573 --> 00:14:19.143
The Victorians did try various methods to get children into education,

00:14:19.373 --> 00:14:24.323
including making education free, but children who worked in factories

00:14:24.483 --> 00:14:30.123
would often be too tired to go to school, and would fall asleep in class.

00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:36.303
Children in much of Victorian Britain were breadwinners, they were responsible for

00:14:36.473 --> 00:14:42.523
bringing money into the house, and so simply not working wasn’t an option for them.

00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:51.233
Since the 1833 law numerous more forward-thinking laws were created to increase the

00:14:51.233 --> 00:14:58.983
working age and reduce the hours, but even in 1901 a 12 year old could still legally work.

00:15:00.013 --> 00:15:05.028
Although for the average child in Victorian Britain a childhood wasn’t

00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:10.073
much of a childhood at all, the Victorians were very influential

00:15:10.223 --> 00:15:14.693
in creating the modern idea of what a childhood should look like.

00:15:15.773 --> 00:15:22.113
For starters, there was this new genre of children’s literature, of books and

00:15:22.113 --> 00:15:28.513
stories for children that served not primarily to educate, but to entertain.

00:15:29.233 --> 00:15:35.123
Prior to this the prevailing view had been that children should learn from books.

00:15:35.563 --> 00:15:38.933
Yes, there were books for children, but they taught

00:15:38.973 --> 00:15:43.883
them morals, how to behave, and how to live in society.

00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:51.363
Authors such as Lewis Carrol and J.M Barrie, who wrote Alice’s Adventures in

00:15:51.363 --> 00:15:56.733
Wonderland and Peter Pan respectively, created magical worlds for children.

00:15:57.483 --> 00:16:01.703
There might be some morals in there, but they were hugely

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:07.693
entertaining and magical, and existed to make children hope and dream.

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:14.433
Childhood was a time to be prized, because when it was gone, it was gone.

00:16:15.223 --> 00:16:21.383
Indeed in Peter Pan, the boy Peter Pan is a boy who never wants to grow

00:16:21.383 --> 00:16:27.173
up and Never Never Land is a place where children don’t need to grow up.

00:16:28.303 --> 00:16:33.753
Childhood became a place for children to explore, to create

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:37.834
their own magical worlds, to have their own adventures.

00:16:38.614 --> 00:16:44.194
This might sound familiar to you now because it is the prevailing view of much

00:16:44.214 --> 00:16:49.884
of Western society, that childhood is a time for children to explore and to

00:16:49.894 --> 00:16:55.874
have fun, not a time to be forced to behave in a particularly “adult” way.

00:16:56.654 --> 00:17:02.554
Moving into the 20th century, we see compulsory schooling, we see children being

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:08.984
required to have an education and the banning of child labour in Britain at least.

00:17:09.844 --> 00:17:16.284
It is widely agreed that an education is an important part of a child’s development, and of

00:17:16.284 --> 00:17:24.694
childhood, but numerous different ideas about what this education should consist of emerge.

00:17:24.694 --> 00:17:29.124
Indeed, what “education” should look like is certainly not something that

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:35.184
any country seems to have figured out, and certainly how to effectively

00:17:35.234 --> 00:17:39.994
help children learn foreign languages still is a hot topic of debate.

00:17:40.813 --> 00:17:45.183
Moving on to childhood in the 20th century, there is one very

00:17:45.213 --> 00:17:49.453
important addition to childhood that we haven’t touched on yet.

00:17:50.343 --> 00:17:52.433
The invention of the teenager.

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:59.643
The term “teenager” started to be used in 1944 to identify children

00:17:59.643 --> 00:18:06.143
in adolescence, technically children who are from 13-19 years of age.

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:12.063
Previously, children in this age group weren’t given any special

00:18:12.063 --> 00:18:16.003
treatment, they weren’t considered any differently really.

00:18:16.573 --> 00:18:22.033
The term adolescent had started to be used in the late 19th century,

00:18:22.163 --> 00:18:27.943
but it mainly referred to the period of transition between childhood and

00:18:28.003 --> 00:18:33.813
adulthood rather than giving children of this age a distinct identity.

00:18:34.793 --> 00:18:38.243
The teenager was a new invention entirely.

00:18:38.643 --> 00:18:45.373
The post-war period in America gave teenagers their own identity, their own freedoms.

00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:50.333
Films were made for teenagers, and companies realised that they could

00:18:50.473 --> 00:18:55.693
sell products to this discrete audience that was different to “children”.

00:18:56.893 --> 00:19:03.773
There was a New York Times article from 1945 called “A Teen-Age Bill of Rights”,

00:19:03.803 --> 00:19:08.583
which outlined 10 rights that children in this particular age group should

00:19:08.593 --> 00:19:14.163
have, from “the right to make mistakes” to “the right to question ideas”.

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:21.953
Given that teenagers no longer needed to work in factories they were free to explore the world

00:19:22.183 --> 00:19:29.103
on their own, to rebel against their parents, to have sexual relationships, to do things that

00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:36.403
teenagers previously had simply never been able to do, because they had either been working or, if

00:19:36.403 --> 00:19:42.803
they came from a wealthy family, they were rarely allowed out of their own little familiar bubble.

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:48.823
When you combine this with the mass production of cars, in America

00:19:48.823 --> 00:19:54.068
at least teenagers suddenly had a way to gain independence from their

00:19:54.143 --> 00:19:58.653
parents, they literally had a vehicle that could take them anywhere.

00:19:59.543 --> 00:20:03.523
And this cult of the teenager has only got stronger.

00:20:04.033 --> 00:20:08.943
Billion dollar companies exist solely with teenagers as customers,

00:20:09.383 --> 00:20:14.873
authors write for teenagers, films are made for teenagers, the teenager

00:20:14.993 --> 00:20:20.063
is a discrete part of childhood that simply didn’t exist 100 years ago.

00:20:21.193 --> 00:20:28.033
Now, coming to the question of modern childhood, and how childhood now is different from

00:20:28.033 --> 00:20:33.403
the childhood that you might have experienced, and why that is, I’ll just invite you

00:20:33.403 --> 00:20:38.703
to think about your own childhood for a minute, you can even press pause if you like.

00:20:39.813 --> 00:20:44.333
OK, if you paused and thought about your childhood for a bit, well done.

00:20:45.363 --> 00:20:53.283
For many of us we think of our childhoods as being the happiest, most carefree period of our lives.

00:20:53.923 --> 00:20:58.853
You might think of being able to get the school bus home without a care in the

00:20:59.043 --> 00:21:05.363
world, of a world without mobile phones or social media, perhaps a world where your

00:21:05.573 --> 00:21:10.503
mother kicked you out of the house at 8 o’ clock in the morning and told you to come

00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:17.083
back for tea, a world that was safer, more innocent, a happier place to grow up.

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:23.433
When compared to the childhood that many adults believe children are living

00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:30.223
today, it seems simpler, easier, safer, and you might even say better.

00:21:31.103 --> 00:21:39.443
And in the UK a lot of the media outlets, especially right-wing media outlets, relish stories about

00:21:39.453 --> 00:21:47.423
the decline of childhood, about how the innocent youth that Brits used to enjoy is gone forever.

00:21:48.493 --> 00:21:55.423
Indeed, there’s a story by a famous historian called Professor Hugh Cunningham, who is the author of

00:21:55.423 --> 00:22:02.243
an excellent book called “Children and Childhood in Western Society since 1500”, where he recounts

00:22:02.423 --> 00:22:08.643
being offered to write an article for the Daily Mail newspaper about the history of childhood.

00:22:09.257 --> 00:22:16.233
He was offered about £1 a word, and told that the article should be around 2,000 words.

00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:22.573
That would be around £3,000 in today’s money, so around €4,000

00:22:22.573 --> 00:22:25.923
for an article that he could probably write in his sleep.

00:22:26.983 --> 00:22:34.373
He said “sure, I'll write it”, but was told that the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, a man

00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:41.483
called Paul Dacre, would only publish it if it showed that childhood had got worse since the 1950s.

00:22:42.493 --> 00:22:48.153
Cunningham’s view was that childhood hadn’t got worse, so the article was never published.

00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:53.113
The point is that Dacre knew exactly what his audience wanted,

00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:57.963
and that was to be told that the past was better than the present.

00:22:58.503 --> 00:23:03.423
If Cunningham wasn’t willing to say this, well, the article wouldn’t be published.

00:23:04.143 --> 00:23:07.383
And this brings us to the very real question of whether

00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:11.633
childhood is better or worse today than it was in the past.

00:23:12.283 --> 00:23:17.063
Well, of course it really depends on how far back in the past you go.

00:23:18.053 --> 00:23:25.293
If we are talking about the Medieval or Victorian era, or even childhood in the first half of the

00:23:25.323 --> 00:23:32.513
20th century when you might have finished school at 13 and started working, well I think I’d prefer

00:23:32.543 --> 00:23:38.923
to try my luck with the pressures of social media over working 12 hours a day in a coal mine.

00:23:39.473 --> 00:23:44.903
But if we are talking about a childhood in the 1970s, let’s say, then

00:23:45.083 --> 00:23:49.283
it’s probably safer to say that the problems are simply different.

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:53.153
Children today have opportunities that simply didn’t

00:23:53.163 --> 00:23:56.923
exist even 10 years ago, let alone 50 years ago.

00:23:57.513 --> 00:24:01.763
From opportunities to connect with other children from all over

00:24:01.763 --> 00:24:06.183
the world to the opportunities to access any information they want.

00:24:07.463 --> 00:24:13.433
These opportunities come with their fair share of risks, but it seems too

00:24:13.443 --> 00:24:19.023
binary and shortsighted to say childhood now is simply better or worse.

00:24:20.423 --> 00:24:25.553
At least we can be happy in the knowledge that most societies have recognised that

00:24:25.553 --> 00:24:32.223
childhood is a fundamental part of a human’s life, a time for adventure, a time to

00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:38.823
be curious, a time to learn, a time to play, a time to laugh, a time to experiment.

00:24:39.983 --> 00:24:45.658
Childhood has certainly come a long way since its creation, if you are to believe Phillipe

00:24:45.793 --> 00:24:52.533
Ariès, remember he was the French historian who said it didn’t exist until the 17th century.

00:24:53.273 --> 00:24:58.993
And as our idea of what is a correct and proper childhood has continued to

00:24:58.993 --> 00:25:04.283
evolve, this would suggest that it will continue to evolve in the years to come.

00:25:05.243 --> 00:25:09.953
Childhood is a process of figuring out how the world works, what

00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:13.733
sort of person you are, and what sort of person you want to be.

00:25:14.683 --> 00:25:20.713
It’s perhaps appropriate that even as adults, and as a wider society, we

00:25:20.713 --> 00:25:25.033
are still figuring out what sort of childhood is right for our children.

00:25:27.653 --> 00:25:32.773
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Childhood.

00:25:33.133 --> 00:25:36.343
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that it’s made you

00:25:36.353 --> 00:25:39.833
think about your own childhood in a slightly different way.

00:25:41.013 --> 00:25:44.713
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:49.963
How do you think childhood is different from what it was when you were growing up?

00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:54.333
Is it better, worse, the same, or just different?

00:25:54.863 --> 00:25:59.303
And as we mainly dealt with childhood in Britain today, how

00:25:59.493 --> 00:26:02.803
is the evolution of childhood in your country different?

00:26:03.263 --> 00:26:04.603
I would love to know.

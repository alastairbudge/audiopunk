Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.490
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.620
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.340
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our mini-series on fertility.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.240
In case you missed them, in part one we talked about the world’s shrinking

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.900
population, and how contrary to the fears of demographers and economists

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.729
throughout history, the world’s population is set to get smaller, not bigger.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.050
Then in part two, we looked at the medical marvel that is IVF, in vitro fertilisation, and hinted

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.019
at some of the ways in which this is changing the way that people think about having babies.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.779
And in the final part, part three, we are going to talk about the future of fertility, and

00:00:55.779 --> 00:01:01.139
explore some of the wackier plans and ideas that some people believe will become reality.

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:06.031
OK then, the future of fertility.

00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:14.131
If I were to ask you what narwhals, orcas–killer whales–and beluga

00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:19.861
whales had in common, you would probably look at me with an odd look.

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:25.691
They all live in the sea, they breathe air, they swim in a majestic fashion.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:31.191
Or you might say, well, they’re all whales, that’s what they have in common.

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:39.781
But if I asked you what narwhals, orcas, beluga whales and humans had

00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:44.471
in common, you might have a bit more trouble finding a common thread.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:51.251
Interestingly enough, the thing that we and these types of whales

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.911
have in common, something that doesn’t affect any other animal to the

00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:02.471
same degree, is that our ability to bear children decreases with age.

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:09.298
Unlike elephants or dogs or cats or any other mammal for that matter, as

00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:14.538
we both know, a woman’s ability to conceive a child doesn’t last forever.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:23.768
It starts to decrease after the age of 30 or so, and decreases even more sharply after 40.

00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:27.458
It is an unfortunate fact of life.

00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:33.888
And as we talked about in the last episode, IVF, or in vitro

00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:39.618
fertilisation, is one tool that can help us overcome this natural cliff.

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:44.288
It is wonderful, and has led to more than 12 million

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:47.338
births that might not have been possible without it.

00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:52.308
For the parents of IVF children, it is a miracle.

00:02:53.638 --> 00:03:01.688
And of course, when the first IVF baby arrived in 1978, it did seem like a miracle for everyone.

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:09.238
An egg fertilised in a petri dish and successfully implanted back into the mother.

00:03:09.618 --> 00:03:11.298
It had never been done before.

00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:18.448
But since that first birth, IVF has become mainstream in many developed

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:24.168
countries, and now there is more than one IVF baby born every minute.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.415
IVF is almost undoubtedly the greatest gift to fertility in the modern

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:37.735
era, but on one level it is not revolutionary: it helps pregnancy

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:43.365
along, it doesn’t fundamentally change the way that humans reproduce.

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:50.575
For an IVF baby to be born, an egg needs to be taken from a woman, combined

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:55.635
with sperm from a man, and then implanted back into the womb of a mother.

00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:01.925
Yes, the process is complicated and painful, physically and emotionally,

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:08.205
but it mimics a natural pregnancy, where the same thing happens, just

00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:12.895
in a slightly different place, exclusively inside a woman’s body.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:19.155
Some of the ideas about future fertility technologies and procedures are very

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:25.005
different, completely reshaping our ideas about how humans can reproduce.

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:32.585
Most of these developments are tackling the biggest issue with human fertility: that a woman

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:39.625
has a limited number of eggs, and with age, the quality and quantity of these decrease.

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:47.305
And to make a baby, you need an egg, and that egg needs to come from a woman.

00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:49.295
Or does it?

00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:55.955
In 2016, two Japanese researchers managed to successfully

00:04:55.985 --> 00:05:01.425
create an egg cell out of skin cells from the mouse’s tail.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:09.955
The egg cells were fertilised, and then implanted into the uterus of a group of female mice.

00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:18.065
The mice had babies, 10 in total, who came out and were perfectly normal and healthy mice.

00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:22.925
These mice were able to reproduce themselves in a normal

00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:26.555
way, and all of their babies were perfectly normal.

00:05:28.007 --> 00:05:34.857
Now, to get technical, this is called “in-vitro gametogenesis”, or IVG for short.

00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:42.727
“In-vitro” means in a test tube, or in some kind of dish outside a living organism.

00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:50.637
And “gametogenesis” refers to the process in which a cell turns into a “gamete”, which are the

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:57.117
male or female cells which are able to unite with a cell of the opposite sex and reproduce.

00:05:58.437 --> 00:06:04.107
Now, IVG has, to date, only been successfully accomplished in mice.

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:09.847
But, according to one Brown University professor, it is a

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:15.377
question of when, not if, the same can be accomplished in humans.

00:06:16.817 --> 00:06:22.167
This would be revolutionary for all sorts of medical treatments - you could grow

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:27.197
new cells for areas of the body that have been damaged, you could create tissues

00:06:27.227 --> 00:06:32.517
or organs in a laboratory, it would be revolutionary in all manner of ways.

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:39.047
But coming back to the matter at heart, it could and almost certainly would

00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:44.917
revolutionise fertility, and the way in which people think about having children.

00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:49.767
As we talked about in the last episode, IVF is

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:54.497
fantastic, but it requires “normal” eggs from the mother.

00:06:55.397 --> 00:07:00.907
If these eggs are either not of sufficient quality or simply do not exist,

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:06.997
for all the wonders of IVF, a pregnancy cannot be magicked out of thin air.

00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:15.957
But IVG, creating an egg from a cell from your thumb or chest or leg, well that

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:20.377
removes the need for an egg to be removed from the mother in the first place.

00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:28.369
It would remove a painful step from IVF, and remove an age cap, as theoretically

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:34.109
a healthy egg could be created from a skin cell of a 100-year woman.

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:39.069
Now, I imagine that the last thing a 100-year woman would want

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:44.089
to do is to have a baby, but the technology to do so will almost

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:49.629
certainly exist, whether that’s in 5 years or 50 years, it is coming.

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:56.799
Another way that this could change the future of fertility is for same-sex couples.

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:03.499
At the moment, if a same-sex couple wants to have a child, whether it’s a male-male couple

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:09.580
or a female-female couple, they need to get either the egg or the sperm from another person.

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:14.129
To state the obvious, women don’t have sperm and men

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.349
don’t have eggs, and you need both to make a baby.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:25.039
Theoretically, and let’s take a female-female couple here, sperm could be

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:30.009
created from the cells of one of the women, and implanted into the other one,

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:35.589
so you would have a child that was the biological child of the two parents.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:42.509
Of course, with a male-male couple you would have the additional complication of requiring

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:48.339
a woman who was willing to carry the child, but an egg could be created from one of

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:54.139
the men, while the other gave the sperm, and it was implanted into the host woman.

00:08:55.219 --> 00:09:01.199
So, single-sex couples could have children and both be the biological parents.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:08.059
And in what might sound like a step too far to some people, this could

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:14.659
theoretically allow for a single parent to provide both the sperm and

00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:20.309
the egg, so that a single person can be both the mother and the father.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:27.719
And if the technology also existed to strip out any potential complications given the

00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:33.919
similarity in DNA between the two, well some people believe that it is perfectly possible.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:41.249
Ethically problematic, perhaps, and of course it would radically change society if a person could

00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:49.609
reproduce without the need for a partner, but perhaps in 50 or 100 years, this will be a reality.

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:57.389
Now, if technology will “solve” the problem of the sperm and the egg, what about the

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:03.669
process of actually taking a fertilised egg and turning it into a fully functioning baby?

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:10.459
To do that, you need a womb, and wombs are only found in women.

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:17.669
Well, that is also something that may not be the case in 10 or 50 years from now.

00:10:18.729 --> 00:10:22.109
There is a lot of work being done at the moment on creating

00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:26.889
artificial wombs, and significant breakthroughs have been made.

00:10:28.369 --> 00:10:32.279
These artificial wombs are aimed at solving a particular

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:37.029
problem, and that is with babies who are born prematurely.

00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:44.719
“Premature” technically means born before the 37th week of pregnancy, so 3 weeks early.

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:51.829
Globally, this affects about 10% of babies, so that’s 15 million

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:56.419
babies a year, but we are not talking about all premature babies.

00:10:57.439 --> 00:11:02.329
For many, especially those born only just premature, in

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:06.559
the 36th week, let’s say, survival rates are excellent.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:13.719
In fact, in the UK at least, for a baby born at 34 weeks, the survival

00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:19.489
rate is exactly the same as for a baby born at term, at 40 weeks or more.

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:26.949
But as you will know, the more premature a baby is, the worse their chances.

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:33.969
For babies born at 22 weeks, sadly, they only have a 10% chance of survival.

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:38.809
They will be put in an incubator, given every possible chance at life,

00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:44.009
but their little lungs are underdeveloped and not ready to breathe air.

00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:50.309
Yes, they stand a significantly better chance of survival in an incubator

00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:55.609
than anywhere else, but what they really need to be is back in the womb.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:12:01.729
And this is exactly what an “artificial womb” is trying to solve.

00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:08.439
When a baby is in the womb, their only source of nutrients is the umbilical

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:15.629
cord, so theoretically if a baby could be put into a womb-like container, and

00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:20.919
attached to a cord that supplied exactly the same nutrients as the mother would

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:26.639
supply, then they should be able to develop healthily as if they were in the womb.

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:34.145
This switch, from the mother’s natural womb to an artificial womb, would need

00:12:34.155 --> 00:12:40.168
to be done very quickly - via caesarean section, and the umbilical cord cut

00:12:40.168 --> 00:12:45.115
and immediately connected to the artificial one, and the baby transferred

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:48.815
into the artificial womb without ever thinking that anything has changed.

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:52.435
But theoretically, it is possible.

00:12:54.105 --> 00:13:01.425
And practically, it is working, or at least it has been tested on baby lambs successfully.

00:13:02.735 --> 00:13:08.125
To date, there have been no human trials, but in both the EU and the

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:12.075
United States there are discussions about how to move these forward.

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:18.355
Of course, finding a parent willing to give it a shot might be tricky.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:24.905
The survival rates of these extremely premature babies might overall be low, but

00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:30.115
as a parent, of course you would always hope that your baby would be in that 10%

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:36.785
that did survive, so no doubt it would take a very brave parent to say, “yes, I’m

00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:41.375
willing to be the first”, knowing full well that it was an experimental procedure.

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:48.295
If it does work safely, and becomes as routine as putting babies in

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:54.545
incubators or as IVF, then it will be wonderful, and save the lives

00:13:54.595 --> 00:13:58.975
of an estimated 1 million babies who die prematurely each year.

00:14:00.605 --> 00:14:06.995
It would save their lives, and of course save the parents the heartbreak of losing a child.

00:14:07.935 --> 00:14:13.235
Undoubtedly, this would be a wonderful thing, but there are those who fear

00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:19.085
where this could lead, and imagine baby factories where hundreds of thousands

00:14:19.085 --> 00:14:24.585
of foetuses were being farmed in artificial wombs, forged from the cells of

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:28.345
people who might never have known that their cells had been taken from them.

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:38.305
Or perhaps even more dystopian, and thinking about what IVG may make possible, some mad despot who

00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:45.295
has decided to have 1,000 children, and has provided the egg and sperm from his own skin cells.

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:51.885
Now, to reiterate, the scientists working on these artificial wombs have been very

00:14:51.885 --> 00:14:56.665
clear about the fact that they are designed to save the lives of premature natural

00:14:56.665 --> 00:15:02.785
babies, fears of them being used to create baby factories are completely unfounded.

00:15:03.765 --> 00:15:10.015
Growing a fertilised egg into a functioning foetus is a completely different problem, and

00:15:10.265 --> 00:15:16.660
there has been no mainstream serious work done on making this possible outside a human womb.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.760
But many technological developments, including IVF,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.170
have been completely impossible until they weren’t.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:32.710
If pregnancies could happen outside the womb, and if a mother was no longer

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.710
required to carry a baby for 9 months, how many people would opt not to do it?

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.480
If you are a woman listening to this and you have been pregnant, or perhaps you

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.430
are pregnant at this moment, you may well have very strong views on the subject.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:57.420
I am clearly not a woman, therefore I only have an outsider’s perspective on what it’s

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:03.990
like to be pregnant, but having watched my wife go through it twice, it is obviously

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.160
very hard work, and that’s before we get to the actual process of giving birth.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.790
What’s more, it’s dangerous.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.610
Pregnancy still kills a woman every two minutes, almost 300,000 women a year.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.740
It is a health risk, it is a huge strain on a woman’s body that a

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:32.070
man doesn’t ever have to contemplate, so if a woman could opt not

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:37.040
to carry their baby in their womb, I for one can understand why.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.190
Now, to wrap up this episode, and this mini-series in general, yes, there have been many

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.370
amazing technological and medical advances, meaning that pregnancy is safer than ever and

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:58.030
is more likely than ever before in history to lead to the birth of a happy, healthy baby.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.770
Despite all of this, people are having fewer babies than ever before.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.940
So, what happens next?

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:13.200
Do humans simply stop reproducing, or reproduce in a completely different way?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.200
In 2016, a Stanford academic published a book called The End of Sex and

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.690
the Future of Human Reproduction, where he imagines the consequences

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.320
of a society where people stop having sex for reproductive purposes.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.940
The author believed that this would happen in the next

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:41.410
20 to 40 years, so as early as 2036, 12 years from now.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.740
If he is right, well, things are about to get very interesting.

00:17:50.253 --> 00:17:55.513
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the future of fertility, and with

00:17:55.523 --> 00:18:00.143
that comes the end of this mini-series on fertility in the 21st century.

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:02.913
As always, I would love to know what you thought about

00:18:02.933 --> 00:18:05.583
this episode, and of this mini-series more generally?

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:09.773
For the current and future mothers, if you knew that using

00:18:09.773 --> 00:18:13.393
an artificial womb was completely safe, would you do it?

00:18:14.063 --> 00:18:17.343
What do you think some of the implications would be for a

00:18:17.353 --> 00:18:20.723
world where people didn’t need to have sex to have babies?

00:18:21.213 --> 00:18:24.523
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:24.963 --> 00:18:27.553

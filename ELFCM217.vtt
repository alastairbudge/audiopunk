Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:16.306
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:20.606
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.480
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part series on Fast Food.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.740
So, after part one where we looked at how the fast food industry got started in the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.060
US, and then embedded itself in all aspects of American life, in today’s episode

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.460
we are going to look at when, how, and with what effect fast food went global.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.720
We’ll talk about the tactics that fast food companies used to get

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.550
the world eating burgers and fries, when this worked well and when

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.340
it didn’t, and how fast food had to adapt to a non-US audience.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.940
We have a lot to get through, so let’s get started right away.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.490
As we agreed in part one, “fast food” as a concept is nothing new.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.690
The Romans had it, the Greeks had it, the ancient Chinese had it.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.475
Even the British had it, and you could certainly claim that fish & chips

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:27.125
and even the sandwich were some of the earliest versions of fast food.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:34.355
What I mean was that it was certainly no innovation to produce ready to eat, affordable food.

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:39.955
The benefits of this are clear, and there is nothing uniquely American about it.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:47.325
But what is special about the fast food of 20th century America was its ability

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:53.315
to create an industrial process of the creation of quick and cheap food, to the

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:58.205
extent that practically an entire country would eat at fast food restaurants.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:06.605
So, when it was clear that fast food had won over the hearts, minds, and more importantly stomachs

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:13.305
of citizens of the United States, these American fast food companies started to look abroad.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:18.595
The first forays, the first adventures, outside of the United

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:23.563
States for fast food companies were relatively unadventurous.

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:30.215
Burger King opened a branch in Puerto Rico in 1963, and four years later, in

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:36.745
1967 McDonalds had followed suit, opening restaurants in Puerto Rico and Canada.

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:43.515
Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States and Canada is, well, not so different

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:49.305
from the US when it comes to eating habits, so these were certainly baby steps.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:56.085
For McDonald’s, the real adventures didn’t start until the early 1970s, when

00:02:56.215 --> 00:03:01.415
it expanded to The Netherlands, Australia, Germany, France, the UK and Japan.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:08.515
Now, walking around London, Paris or Tokyo today you might think that the golden

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:14.935
arches of McDonald’s look perfectly normal, they are part of life in any large city,

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:20.655
but when McDonald’s first launched in these countries it didn’t always go to plan.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:27.785
For starters, the entire strategy about where to put restaurants had to change.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:34.795
In London, Paris or Tokyo there isn’t the same car culture, and Brits, French

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:39.645
and Japanese weren’t familiar with this idea of driving to a restaurant

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:44.505
and picking up a meal for takeaway, and then later on the drive-thru.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:48.745
So, restaurants had to be placed in city-centre

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:52.305
locations, areas where lots of people would pass through.

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:57.105
In London the first McDonald’s restaurant was actually in an

00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:01.175
area called Woolwich, quite far to the south east of the city.

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:09.875
On its first day staff waited anxiously, but apparently nobody actually came into the restaurant.

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:14.595
And when people finally did start turning up, they needed

00:04:14.615 --> 00:04:19.019
to be educated about how ordering fast food actually worked.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.929
Brits were used to the idea of a traditional restaurant,

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:26.709
where you sit down and someone comes to take your order.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:32.009
But in McDonald’s, of course, it doesn’t work that way, so there was a lot of

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.659
confusion - the public needed to be educated about how to actually order in a McDonald’s.

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:45.389
Meanwhile in Japan the McDonald’s brand was brought to the country by an energetic

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.959
entrepreneur called Den Fujita, who famously claimed that "the reason Japanese people

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:56.259
are so short and have yellow skins is because they have eaten nothing but fish and

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.489
rice for two thousand years; if we eat McDonald's hamburgers and potatoes for a

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:07.209
thousand years we will become taller, our skin will become white and our hair blonde".

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:11.769
Now, he was an eccentric character, but he knew the

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.219
Japanese customer, and how to cater for their needs.

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:21.839
The McDonald's menu was adapted for Japanese tastes, meaning you could order

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:28.163
an Ebi Filet-o burger, a Teriyaki McBurger, or later even french fries with

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:32.203
chocolate sauce, which I’ve actually tried and have to say are quite good.

00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:37.063
In Japan there was less of an emphasis placed on

00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:40.483
having supersized portions, like there was in the US.

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:45.913
Fujita hoped to see 10,000 McDonald’s in Japan by 2010.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:53.323
He didn’t live to see that day - there are still only just under 3,000, but

00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:58.713
Japan was until very recently McDonald’s most popular country outside the US.

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:05.873
China only recently overtook it, but the population of China is 11 times that of Japan.

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:13.053
Now, although McDonald’s is the most popular and famous fast food chain in the world, it was

00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:19.253
certainly not the only one that was exploring outside of its native land, outside the US.

00:06:19.743 --> 00:06:26.273
Kentucky Fried Chicken, or KFC, had arrived in Japan a year before McDonald’s, in 1970.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:33.213
As any Japanese listener, or anyone who has been to Japan will know, like many east

00:06:33.213 --> 00:06:39.183
Asian countries, Japan already has some excellent traditional “fast food” restaurants,

00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:45.191
places where you can go and get a bowl or rice and meat or vegetables, or piping hot

00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:51.321
ramen, it is prepared very quickly, it is delicious and comes at a very affordable price.

00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:57.511
So while these Western fast food restaurants did have the advantage of seeming

00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:04.761
exotic and strange, of allowing Japanese customers to try this American cult food,

00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:10.161
it wasn’t like there weren’t excellent fast food options already available in Japan.

00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:18.311
So American brands had to get creative, and the example of KFC is particularly interesting.

00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:26.331
In Japan, Christmas Day isn’t a national holiday, and only around 1% of the population is Christian.

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:34.781
But KFC has magically managed to turn Christmas into a holiday where people eat KFC.

00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:42.101
This was thanks to a brilliant marketing campaign in 1974 called “Kurisumasu

00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:47.191
ni wa kentakkii!”, or “Kentucky for Christmas”, which turned going to

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:52.611
KFC on Christmas Day into somewhat of a national tradition in Japan.

00:07:53.611 --> 00:08:00.011
It all comes from, reportedly, when a group of foreigners weren’t able to find turkey for Christmas

00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:07.661
day, and KFC seized this opportunity to turn eating KFC chicken into a traditional activity.

00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:11.991
There was a big marketing campaign, and it worked.

00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:18.031
Every year since, people order their KFC in advance, there are queues of up

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:23.861
to 2 hours long and KFC Japan records its biggest sales on Christmas Day.

00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:30.411
Another interesting story of US fast food chains expanding abroad comes from Russia.

00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:34.271
Perhaps some of our Russian listeners might even remember this.

00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:39.501
When McDonalds opened its first outlet in Moscow, Russia, in 1990,

00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:44.271
just months after the fall of the Berlin wall, it was a huge event.

00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:49.391
It was one of the only Western stores to exist in the entire country,

00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:54.911
and on its opening day there were huge queues outside while 5,000

00:08:54.911 --> 00:08:59.151
people waited to get a glimpse of what western capitalism looked like.

00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:06.501
There’s a funny video from this day where a journalist interviews people waiting in line - several

00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:11.491
of them don’t know what everyone else is queueing for, they just saw a line and joined it.

00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:19.121
And in fact just to work at McDonald’s, which is now not the most desirable job in the world,

00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:26.011
there were 25,000 applicants to work at the Moscow location when it announced it was hiring.

00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:32.101
Now our story turns to the home of fine dining, the birthplace of haute cuisine,

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:37.991
and a nation that is particularly proud of its culinary heritage: France.

00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:44.451
The French, as any French listener will know better than me, and anyone who has been

00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:50.931
to France will have seen, tend to enjoy taking time to savour and enjoy their meals.

00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:57.644
The two-hour lunch was a common feature, especially in the 1970s and 80s.

00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:03.081
Food was something to be enjoyed with friends, family or colleagues, something

00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:08.011
that should be cooked properly, perhaps even enjoyed with a glass of fine wine.

00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:12.701
The idea that you would rush into a restaurant, order something quickly

00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:17.851
and be given it on a tray, then you would have to eat it yourself without

00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:23.141
a knife and fork out of a paper box was, well, not very French at all.

00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:28.511
Yet now France is one of the most popular countries in the world for

00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:34.281
McDonald’s, indeed it's only behind China and Japan, outside of the US that is.

00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:38.731
There are now 1,500 McDonald’s restaurants in France

00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:44.821
while there are only 335 Burger Kings and only 250 KFCs.

00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:52.401
But it wasn’t an immediate success - despite McDonald’s launching in France only two years after

00:10:52.411 --> 00:11:01.901
launching in the UK, by 1988 it only had 67 restaurants in France vs the 270 it had in the UK.

00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:09.071
So, what changed, and why has McDonald’s now managed to succeed where others have failed?

00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:17.461
Put simply, it adapted to local tastes, while other restaurants assumed that the American version

00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:23.171
would be so aspirational that it would appeal to anyone, regardless of where they were from.

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:28.211
Burger King, for example, just replicated the US dining

00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:31.941
experience in France, with busy, crowded restaurants.

00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:36.951
McDonald’s, on the other hand, recognised that the French like to take

00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:42.051
their time, and made their restaurants more spacious and better decorated.

00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:46.171
They offered things like croissants with jam, something

00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:49.701
you would never find on the menu back in the United States.

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:56.631
And they put a particular emphasis on the quality of the ingredients that went into their produce.

00:11:57.361 --> 00:12:01.831
Of course, French McDonald’s is still McDonald’s, it is a fast food

00:12:01.831 --> 00:12:06.911
restaurant not a fine dining experience, but these changes have led

00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:11.971
the French to accept McDonald’s in a way that surprised many onlookers.

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:18.251
But when it comes to the global expansion of American fast food outlets, it hasn’t

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:24.561
always gone to plan, and there are numerous examples of times where local customs,

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:30.711
competition or a myriad of other factors, lots of other factors, have meant that

00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:36.761
countries have been able to resist the gravitational pull of burgers and fries.

00:12:37.711 --> 00:12:43.481
In Vietnam, for example, McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in 2014.

00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:47.671
The first outlet was managed by the Prime Minister’s

00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:52.211
son, and when it first opened, it was a huge success.

00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:59.511
Within 24 hours 22,500 people had eaten at the restaurant, and Vietnamese

00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:06.771
diners chomped their way through 61,980 Big Macs in the first month.

00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:09.071
A great success, you might think.

00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:16.311
But since opening 7 years ago McDonald’s in Vietnam has been a huge flop, and

00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:22.231
there are only 22 restaurants in the country - one for every 4.4 million people.

00:13:23.241 --> 00:13:28.731
Compare this to the United States, for example, there is one McDonald’s for every 22,000

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:35.701
people, there are almost 200 times more McDonald’s per person in the United States than Vietnam.

00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:38.611
So, what went wrong?

00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:45.091
Well, as anyone who has been to Vietnam will know, the country already has very high quality

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:52.021
and very affordable fast food in the form of soups, meat and vegetables with rice and baguettes.

00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:57.561
This type of local fast food was already being sold by over half a

00:13:57.651 --> 00:14:02.801
million different individual vendors, so it was very widely available.

00:14:03.001 --> 00:14:05.481
And it was cheaper than McDonald’s.

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:12.561
Eating a meal at McDonald’s cost the equivalent of just under $5, whereas an

00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:18.161
equivalent meal from a local food vendor might cost $2.50, and it tasted far better.

00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:23.921
So, faced with the choice of paying double for a

00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:26.931
meal that simply wasn’t as nice, why would you do it?

00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:33.671
Another factor that is thought to have gone into the failure of McDonald’s to capture

00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:39.621
the imagination of the Vietnamese is that the local culture has a strong emphasis on

00:14:39.621 --> 00:14:45.991
sharing food, and the nature of McDonald’s is that it’s not really food for sharing.

00:14:46.641 --> 00:14:50.851
You’ll note that this is something that also applies to other Asian cultures,

00:14:51.001 --> 00:14:56.241
for example the Chinese eating culture, and is thought to be one of the reasons

00:14:56.361 --> 00:15:01.631
that KFC is more successful than McDonald’s in China - because it’s easier

00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:06.441
to share a bucket of chicken with a group of people than to share a burger.

00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:12.575
One of the other reasons, by the way, is that KFC understood that even

00:15:12.595 --> 00:15:17.434
within China there are very distinct food cultures and tastes, and the

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:22.925
company adapted its menu within China to cater for local differences.

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:30.335
When KFC first launched in China, diners from a province called Hunan, which is famous

00:15:30.335 --> 00:15:36.035
for its spicy food, complained that the chicken was too bland, that it wasn’t spicy

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:42.835
enough, while diners from Shanghai, complained that the very same chicken was too spicy.

00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:48.952
So, KFC adapted its recipes, making the chicken spicier in Hunan

00:15:49.262 --> 00:15:53.857
and less spicy in Shanghai, adapting it to these local tastes.

00:15:54.337 --> 00:15:59.357
Now, KFC might have managed to crack the Chinese market, but in

00:15:59.357 --> 00:16:03.337
several countries it found local traditions too hard to overcome.

00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:06.627
One example of this is in Israel.

00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:12.017
KFC opened its first branch in Israel in 1980, thinking

00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:15.347
it could recreate the success it had found elsewhere.

00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:23.117
After 32 years trying to make it work, including closing and reopening all of its locations four

00:16:23.117 --> 00:16:30.961
times, it left the country in 2012, and only returned to give it another try at the start of 2020.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:32.537
What went wrong?

00:16:33.257 --> 00:16:37.797
Well, the chicken at KFC, their most famous fried chicken,

00:16:38.087 --> 00:16:42.437
is cooked in a batter that uses milk as an ingredient.

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:48.057
Kosher cooking, the Jewish law about the preparation of food, requires

00:16:48.057 --> 00:16:53.667
that you shouldn’t mix meat and milk, so by default KFC’s most

00:16:53.697 --> 00:16:58.507
popular dish, its fried chicken, wasn’t allowed under kosher rules.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:06.517
As you may know, not all Israelis follow kosher rules, but Israel is the country in the world

00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:13.047
with the highest proportion of Jewish people, and 80% of the Israeli food industry is kosher.

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:21.347
KFC was reasonably popular with Israelis who didn’t keep kosher rules, but when your signature

00:17:21.357 --> 00:17:27.077
product is forbidden by a religious law of a country, well that’s a bit of a problem.

00:17:28.187 --> 00:17:29.347
So, what do you do?

00:17:30.017 --> 00:17:32.997
Well, one solution is to change the recipe.

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:38.847
KFC experimented with changing the milk in its batter to soya

00:17:38.847 --> 00:17:42.457
milk, so that it was kosher and could be eaten by everyone.

00:17:43.477 --> 00:17:46.967
But this was a lot more expensive and customers

00:17:46.997 --> 00:17:49.887
thought it simply didn’t taste as good as the original.

00:17:50.897 --> 00:17:53.429
So, KFC was faced with a choice.

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:59.685
Do you switch back to the original recipe, knowing full well that this means a sizable

00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:05.095
proportion of the country won’t be able to eat at your restaurant or do you stick with the

00:18:05.095 --> 00:18:10.834
recipe that means everyone can eat there, but it isn’t as tasty and it's more expensive?

00:18:11.994 --> 00:18:17.741
KFC chose the latter option, it stuck with the soya milk recipe, kosher fried

00:18:17.741 --> 00:18:23.891
chicken, but sales plummeted, and it was forced to leave the country in 2012.

00:18:24.711 --> 00:18:29.651
When it returned at the start of 2020 it switched strategy, and isn’t

00:18:29.681 --> 00:18:33.911
offering kosher chicken, so we will have to wait to see whether it’s

00:18:33.921 --> 00:18:38.531
fourth attempt at conquering Israel is any different to the previous three.

00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:44.241
Now, Vietnam and Israel are certainly exceptions, they are countries where

00:18:44.241 --> 00:18:49.211
these American fast food companies haven’t managed to replicate their success.

00:18:49.811 --> 00:18:51.991
Almost everywhere else, they have.

00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:56.051
Like them or loathe them, American fast food companies

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:59.081
have done an incredible job at conquering the planet.

00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:04.121
Hundreds of millions of people gobble down their products every day, they have

00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:09.871
successfully adapted their products to meet the tastes of unique cultures and culinary

00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:15.241
traditions from almost every country, and they have become incredibly successful.

00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:21.401
And this brings us to where we are today, a world where 1% of the population

00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:26.501
eats at McDonald’s every single day, a world where children are more likely

00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:31.682
to recognise Ronald McDonald or Colonel Sanders than Jesus, a world where

00:19:31.702 --> 00:19:35.790
our bellies are bulging and our hearts are pumping faster and faster.

00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:41.141
And that, my friends, will be what we’ll cover in part three of this mini-series.

00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:47.721
OK then, that’s it for part two, taking fast food global.

00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:51.841
I hope it's been an interesting one, and whether you live in the UK,

00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:56.641
France, Vietnam, Israel or any other country that has felt the impact

00:19:56.791 --> 00:20:00.371
of these American fast food giants, I hope you’ve learned something new.

00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:04.271
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:08.191
How popular are different fast food chains in your country?

00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:10.541
How has this changed over time?

00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:14.691
When have they succeeded and failed, and for what reasons?

00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:20.961
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started; you can head right into our community

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.039
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.340
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.390
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part mini-series on nuclear power.

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:32.300
In case you missed it, in part one we talked about early nuclear power,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.650
Dwight Eisenhower’s famous Atoms for Peace speech, and the early enthusiasm

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.100
mixed with fear that much of the developed world had for nuclear power.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.820
In the next episode, part three, we are going to talk about the state of nuclear power today

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.950
and tomorrow, now and in the future, and try to understand why some people believe it to be

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.860
a key weapon in the fight against climate change while others still vehemently oppose it.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.560
And in today’s episode, part two, we are going to talk about the incident that has done

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.710
more than any other to change public opinion on nuclear power: The Chernobyl Disaster.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.500
You can, of course, listen to this episode without having listened to the last one, but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.700
it will probably make a little more sense if you have listened to part one, so if you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.800
haven’t done so already, I’d recommend you press pause and listen to that one first.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.040
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.100
most deadly disaster in the history of nuclear power.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.189
If you were a kid growing up in the 1990s, like me, you might well have played the game SimCity.

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:53.840
The game required you to build a city.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.630
You would choose where to place roads, residential areas,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.760
business areas, industrial areas, schools, and hospitals.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.630
As your city grew, you made more money, which you would then spend on building more infrastructure.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.800
And as your city developed and got richer, your city would modernise.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.480
Basic houses would become shining skyscrapers.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.760
Smoke-billowing factories would turn into high-tech business zones, and so on.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.730
And of course, you needed to plan your utilities.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.270
Water, transport, and electricity.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.140
There were certain types of power plants you could build: coal, wind, and nuclear.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.310
You had to balance your city’s need for power with where you were going to put the power plant,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.650
because if you put a coal-powered plant next to a residential area, nobody would want to live there.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.080
Nuclear power plants were good, but they were quite expensive to build and there

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.550
was the threat of a tornado or earthquake that would damage the plant, causing the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.340
nearby area to be contaminated by nuclear waste and property values to plummet.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.360
If, like me, you spent hundreds of hours of your childhood playing

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.420
this game, you will know firsthand why it was so addictive, and if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.500
you have never heard of it, just trust me, it was seriously good fun.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.260
Now, not such a long time before the first SimCity game was released, central planners in

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.114
the USSR were playing their own, real-life and–of course–infinitely more complicated version.

00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:58.524
The USSR covered a whopping 22.4 million square km, 17% of the world’s total land area.

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:06.484
It had an abundance of natural resources, coal, oil and natural gas, but

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:11.814
the largest known deposits were in Siberia, in the eastern part of the

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:16.884
country, while the majority of the population was in the west of the country.

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:21.777
Nuclear power offered a convenient solution.

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:27.507
A nuclear power plant could be placed anywhere, more or less.

00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:35.357
They need a lot of water, so they are typically placed near rivers, lakes, or seas.

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:41.257
And they should ideally be placed away from populated areas, in case anything goes

00:04:41.257 --> 00:04:48.415
wrong, but with 22.4 million square kilometres, the USSR had plenty of options.

00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:55.924
The USSR was, in fact, the first country to successfully open a nuclear power

00:04:55.924 --> 00:05:04.844
plant, which it did in June of 1954, and by 1982 it had a total of 26 nuclear

00:05:04.844 --> 00:05:11.194
reactors across 10 different plants, which produced 6.5% of the country’s power.

00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:16.978
One of these was at the town of Pripyat, close to the town of

00:05:16.978 --> 00:05:21.508
Chernobyl, in northern Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union.

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:26.058
The plant at Chernobyl was home to four nuclear

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:31.327
reactors, which had been built between 1977 and 1983.

00:05:32.188 --> 00:05:39.108
Now, as a quick and very superficial reminder of how a nuclear power plant works, there

00:05:39.108 --> 00:05:45.168
is a controlled nuclear fission reaction in the core of a reactor, which gives off

00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:51.215
huge amounts of heat, which boils water, which creates steam, which turns a turbine.

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:56.600
The turbine is connected to a generator, which then converts the

00:05:56.643 --> 00:06:01.048
mechanical energy from the spinning turbine into electricity.

00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:09.358
The principle is the same as in an oil or gas power station; water is heated so

00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:14.388
that it boils, the steam turns a turbine, and a generator produces electricity.

00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:23.931
A core difference, however, is that the balance in a nuclear reactor is much more sensitive.

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:30.771
In an oil or gas plant, if something goes wrong, the fuel supply

00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:35.181
can simply be cut off, stopping the reaction almost immediately.

00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:40.953
But in a nuclear reactor, the process is far more complex

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:44.233
and can’t just be shut down with the flip of a switch.

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:49.933
The nuclear fission reaction relies on a delicate balance of

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:54.503
control rods, cooling systems, and a stable core temperature.

00:06:56.113 --> 00:07:03.193
The control rods absorb neutrons, which slow down or even stop the reaction when needed.

00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:09.991
These rods are carefully adjusted to control the rate of fission.

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:16.651
The cooling system, meanwhile, ensures that the reactor doesn’t overheat,

00:07:16.962 --> 00:07:21.596
keeping the reaction in check and preventing the fuel rods from melting.

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:25.636
This balance is critical.

00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:32.967
If anything disrupts it—whether it’s an issue with the control rods, a cooling failure, or operator

00:07:33.017 --> 00:07:40.847
error—the chain reaction can accelerate dangerously, leading to a buildup of heat and pressure.

00:07:42.047 --> 00:07:47.407
And if it goes too far, the consequences can be catastrophic.

00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:55.107
This is what made nuclear energy both powerful and, in the eyes of many, terrifying.

00:07:56.117 --> 00:08:01.007
While it offered a seemingly limitless supply of energy without the pollution of fossil

00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:07.477
fuels, it also demanded a level of precision and caution unlike any other energy source.

00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:14.597
And on the night of April the 26th, 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear

00:08:14.597 --> 00:08:19.937
Power Plant in northern Ukraine, this delicate balance was lost.

00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:25.967
It all began as a routine safety test designed to verify

00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:30.708
procedures in case of a power loss during an emergency shutdown

00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:37.088
The purpose of this test was simple in theory but critical in practice.

00:08:38.638 --> 00:08:43.318
If there was an emergency shutdown, there were backup diesel generators

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:48.742
that would kick in, but this wasn’t an automatic and instant process.

00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:51.222
It took 45 seconds or so.

00:08:52.482 --> 00:08:57.722
The nuclear scientists had calculated that there was enough residual energy

00:08:57.802 --> 00:09:02.142
in the reactor’s turbines to continue running and generating electricity

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:05.712
for the cooling pumps while the backup generators started working.

00:09:06.987 --> 00:09:12.497
Of course, the cooling pumps needed to continue pumping water, because if

00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:16.707
they stopped working, the nuclear reactor could overheat uncontrollably.

00:09:17.927 --> 00:09:23.427
The scientists had calculated that this wouldn’t be an issue, they had proved it

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:29.177
on paper, but they had never actually demonstrated it live, in the power plant.

00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:32.817
So this was the purpose of the test.

00:09:33.487 --> 00:09:39.051
They were proving that in the event of a complete power loss, the remaining energy in

00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:44.791
the turbines would buy them enough time until the backup diesel generators kicked in.

00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:48.381
So, this is what they did.

00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:54.281
The operators began by reducing the reactor’s power to a low level.

00:09:55.421 --> 00:09:59.731
This was part of the test’s procedure, intended to simulate what

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:03.361
would happen if there were a sudden need to shut down the reactor.

00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:08.811
But as they did so, things started to go wrong.

00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:15.041
The power dropped to dangerously low levels—far lower than they had planned

00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:19.691
for, and much lower than what the reactor was designed to handle safely.

00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:26.581
In an attempt to bring the power up, the operators withdrew almost all of the

00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:31.601
control rods—rods that were essential for slowing down the nuclear reaction.

00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:37.361
This move put the reactor in a highly unstable state.

00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:44.601
At these low power levels, a gas called xenon started to build up in the reactor.

00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:51.291
This gas absorbed neutrons, which slowed the reaction down even more,

00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:56.111
making it harder for the operators to raise the power to a stable level.

00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:01.371
The operators, perhaps under pressure to complete the test,

00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:05.404
ignored the warning signs and continued with the procedure.

00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:10.461
By 1:23 a.m., they were ready to start the test.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:19.301
But the reactor was already in a volatile state, balanced precariously on the edge of control.

00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:26.431
At this critical moment, they pressed the button to initiate the emergency shutdown.

00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:32.081
The control rods, which were designed to slow the reaction by

00:11:32.111 --> 00:11:36.701
absorbing neutrons, were rapidly inserted back into the core.

00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:44.841
But there was a deadly flaw in the reactor’s design: the tips of these control rods were

00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:51.701
made of graphite, a material that actually increased reactivity rather than decreased it.

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:56.391
Instead of shutting down the reaction, the insertion

00:11:56.421 --> 00:12:00.351
of the control rods created a sudden spike in power.

00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:05.621
Within seconds, the reactor’s power surged uncontrollably,

00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.711
reaching levels a hundred times higher than normal.

00:12:09.631 --> 00:12:15.431
The heat built up rapidly, and the pressure in the reactor core became immense.

00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:22.711
The cooling water turned to steam, building up pressure until the pipes burst.

00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:29.901
A series of huge explosions rocked the reactor, blowing off the thousand-tonne

00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:34.361
steel and concrete lid that protected the nuclear core from the outside world.

00:12:35.691 --> 00:12:43.691
The core was exposed, and a massive fire ignited, shooting radioactive material high into the air.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:51.260
Now it was a race against time to put out the fires threatening the rest of the power plant.

00:12:52.499 --> 00:12:58.149
Remember, the accident happened only at reactor number four, and there were three others.

00:12:58.854 --> 00:13:02.544
If the fires got to the other reactors, then they too

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:06.654
would be threatened, and the entire plant could explode.

00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:15.014
At 1:45 a.m., 22 minutes after the explosion, the first batch of firefighters arrived on the scene.

00:13:16.264 --> 00:13:21.274
They rushed in to put out the fires, without proper protective equipment, thus

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.690
inadvertently exposing themselves to incredibly dangerous levels of radiation.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:32.875
It was a fire like no other, and when the firefighters were unable

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:37.025
to successfully extinguish it, the Soviet army was called in.

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:44.535
With the core still melting at over 2,000 degrees Centigrade, helicopters dropped

00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:50.485
more than 5,000 tonnes of sand, lead and clay onto the reactor, in a bid to cover it.

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:57.685
It didn’t work, and this huge, molten mass of radioactive material kept seeping

00:13:57.685 --> 00:14:02.255
through the reinforced concrete, inching closer to the huge water tanks below the

00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:07.955
reactor, which, under normal conditions, would pump water to cool the reactor.

00:14:09.605 --> 00:14:16.415
Now, if the melting radioactive material reached the water, it would spell even greater disaster.

00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:22.775
The water would immediately turn to steam, turning the plant into a huge

00:14:22.845 --> 00:14:27.515
pressure cooker and blowing even more radioactive material into the atmosphere.

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:33.255
Fortunately, this crisis was averted by workers who waded into the

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:38.225
water tanks and managed to find the tap to drain them, but in so

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:43.334
doing exposing themselves to extremely dangerous levels of radiation.

00:14:44.794 --> 00:14:50.110
Now, for the first almost 48 hours after the explosion, there was no

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.840
official word from Moscow, no public statement about what had happened.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.330
The residents of the closest town, Pripyat, had been evacuated, and an exclusion zone

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.230
had been created around the plant, but there was no official word from the Soviet state.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:15.610
It wasn’t until 9 pm on April 28th that the announcement came, but

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.300
it was short and fairly nondescript: there has been an accident,

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.200
one of the reactors was damaged, we are helping anybody affected.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.440
But even before this announcement, there were suspicions

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.710
outside the Soviet Union that something had happened.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:40.780
At a nuclear power plant in Forsmark, two hours north of Stockholm in Sweden, 1,300

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:46.760
kilometres from Chernobyl, scientists had noted higher than usual levels of radiation.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.580
Initially, they thought this must be some kind of mistake,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.210
but after further analysis, it was clear that it was not.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:04.310
Wind from the southeast was blowing radioactive material towards Sweden, and after consulting

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:10.240
meteorological colleagues, it was concluded that this must have come from the Soviet Union.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:17.280
The usual diplomatic channels were followed, but Swedish diplomats reported that they had

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.450
been told that there had not been any kind of nuclear test or malfunction at a nuclear plant.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.610
The Swedes said, in the most diplomatic way possible, “we don’t believe

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.660
a word you’re saying”, and told their Soviet counterparts that they were

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.600
going to file an official alert with the International Energy Agency.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.520
And shortly after came the official announcement

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.790
from Moscow, yes, there had in fact been an accident.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.720
And not just any accident.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.680
The disaster at Chernobyl is to date–and one must hope it will

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.490
remain–the worst and most expensive disaster in nuclear history.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:06.352
As you may know, it took decades to clean up, even today there is an exclusion zone

00:17:06.362 --> 00:17:13.532
around it, and one estimate puts the cost of the disaster at $700 billion dollars.

00:17:15.672 --> 00:17:22.022
The explosion itself was not so deadly, with only two engineers being killed in

00:17:22.022 --> 00:17:28.082
the blast, but a further 29 would die in the subsequent weeks, from a mixture

00:17:28.102 --> 00:17:32.712
of acute radiation sickness and burns sustained trying to put out the fires.

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:42.402
At around 30 direct deaths, this would be a tragic but relatively unhistoric industrial accident.

00:17:43.452 --> 00:17:47.672
The reason Chernobyl is different is that it didn’t just affect the people

00:17:47.682 --> 00:17:52.029
working in the power plant, it didn’t just affect those in the nearby blast

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:57.769
radius, it created a cloud of radioactive material that was blown across much of

00:17:57.769 --> 00:18:03.579
Europe, spreading silently across borders, with the result that higher than usual

00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:09.619
doses of radiation were measured in the United States, Canada, China and Japan.

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:17.828
Although these levels were low, it showed how far radiation from a nuclear disaster could travel.

00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:23.185
And nuclear radiation, as you will know, is not good news.

00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:29.775
It can cause all sorts of irregularities, cancers, organ damage, and death.

00:18:31.275 --> 00:18:37.405
Now, the impact of Chernobyl, in terms of its human cost, is still hotly debated.

00:18:38.525 --> 00:18:46.065
An official United Nations report puts the estimated total deaths at 4,000, but other estimates

00:18:46.265 --> 00:18:52.945
are up to 16,000, and one even puts it at several hundred thousand, if you take into account

00:18:53.015 --> 00:18:58.010
everyone around the world who might have been exposed to higher-than-usual doses of radiation.

00:18:59.224 --> 00:19:02.574
The difference comes down to how you measure it, and

00:19:02.734 --> 00:19:05.784
what you define to be an acceptable dose of radiation.

00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:13.854
Lots of stuff we do in our daily lives exposes us to radiation, from going on an aeroplane to

00:19:13.934 --> 00:19:20.814
having an x-ray, so just because someone was exposed to some radiation from a nuclear disaster

00:19:20.864 --> 00:19:26.423
thousands of kilometres away, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will have any impact on their health.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:32.602
But, and it is a big but, the Chernobyl disaster was a

00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:36.762
huge disaster for the public perception of nuclear power.

00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:43.862
The public around the world had been told that nuclear power was safe, it was the way of the future.

00:19:45.112 --> 00:19:50.352
And then this reality was shattered, at least in the public’s mind.

00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:56.408
There were stories of radioactive clouds, genetic mutations, terrible

00:19:56.428 --> 00:20:01.978
cancers, sterility, and of course nobody wanted to live anywhere near a power

00:20:01.978 --> 00:20:06.568
plant that might explode and subject them to lethal levels of radiation.

00:20:08.068 --> 00:20:11.918
Perfectly understandably, across the world public support

00:20:11.928 --> 00:20:15.228
for new nuclear power plant construction plummeted.

00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:22.748
The year after the Chernobyl Disaster, Italy held a referendum on nuclear power, and

00:20:22.908 --> 00:20:29.568
Italians voted resoundingly against it, shutting down all nuclear power plants by 1990.

00:20:30.948 --> 00:20:35.158
It was also a major boon to the anti-nuclear Greens in Germany,

00:20:35.498 --> 00:20:40.658
increasing their share of the vote to 8.3% in the 1987 election.

00:20:42.318 --> 00:20:47.298
Interestingly enough, since the Chernobyl Disaster, Russia has in fact

00:20:47.468 --> 00:20:52.258
increased not just the total amount of energy that it gets from nuclear but

00:20:52.298 --> 00:20:57.128
also the percentage of its total energy needs that come from nuclear sources.

00:20:58.443 --> 00:21:06.889
In 1986 it was 12.5% of the country’s total power, but that number is now more than 20%.

00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:11.367
Russia is now the fourth largest nuclear producer in

00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:15.137
the world, after the United States, China and France.

00:21:16.017 --> 00:21:22.325
To the nuclear sceptics, this is a dangerous situation to be in and Russia, of all

00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:27.553
countries, should be acutely aware of what happens when nuclear power goes wrong.

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:34.613
To the supporters of nuclear power, it is an admirable commitment to what is now a considerably

00:21:34.643 --> 00:21:40.786
safer power source, and one that is an important stepping stone to a carbon-free future.

00:21:41.562 --> 00:21:47.173
And that, my friends, is what we will talk about in much more detail in the next episode.

00:21:48.713 --> 00:21:53.143
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the Chernobyl Disaster.

00:21:53.433 --> 00:21:56.783
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:57.403 --> 00:22:02.673
As a reminder, this is part two of our three-part mini-series, the last one was

00:22:02.673 --> 00:22:07.733
on early nuclear power and the next one will be on the future of nuclear energy.

00:22:08.173 --> 00:22:13.816
And if you want to get really deep into the theme of nuclear and atomic energy, and you are

00:22:13.816 --> 00:22:19.696
ready for a more destructive subject, we also made a three-part mini-series on the atomic bomb.

00:22:20.056 --> 00:22:26.336
That’s episodes 284, 285 and 286 if you haven’t listened to them already.

00:22:27.216 --> 00:22:31.846
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:22:32.406 --> 00:22:37.646
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

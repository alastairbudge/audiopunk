Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:15.888
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:19.948
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:23.948
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of a mini-series

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:28.278
all about The Quest To Find The Origin of The River Nile.

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:33.238
This was originally going to be a standalone episode, a single one, but

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:37.718
there is so much to this story that we’ve split it into three parts.

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:44.328
In this episode, part one, we’ll set the scene and tell the story of the first major

00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:49.458
expedition by a pair of British explorers, Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke.

00:00:49.878 --> 00:00:54.898
This is an absolutely amazing story of rivalry, exploration,

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:59.098
near death experiences and the most almighty feud.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:04.048
Then in part two, which is going to be one of our member-only ones, we’ll learn about

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:09.792
Dr David Livingstone, the Scottish explorer who disappeared off the face of the Earth,

00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:14.832
and it was only a plucky young Welshman who was brave enough to try to find him.

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:21.452
And in the final episode, part three, we’ll learn about Henry Morton Stanley, the man

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:26.722
who provided a definitive answer to the question and is perhaps the greatest explorer

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:33.102
of the 19th century, or of all time, but a man whose legacy is debated to this very day.

00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:38.382
OK then, The Quest To Find The Origin of The River Nile

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:46.098
the quote “geography is destiny” is often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:52.158
He found this out the hard way in 1812, after experiencing the

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:57.698
Russian winter and losing a reported 300,000 men in the process.

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:04.456
But 14 years prior to this, Napoleon had invaded another country

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:09.776
for which “geography is destiny” is even more applicable: Egypt.

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.376
Egypt is one large desert.

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:18.316
To be precise, 96% of the country is desert, dry sand

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:22.586
and rocks, inhospitable terrain for all but the hardiest.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:30.266
But a small part of the country contains lush pastures, arable land, capable of producing

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:36.076
grain, fruits and vegetables, and even cotton, a notoriously water-intensive plant.

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:44.136
This was only made possible by The Nile, the vast river that flows through the country

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:49.436
and provides the country with not just enough water to sustain its population, but

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:55.436
would also flood every year and cover the nearby pastures with nutrient rich soil.

00:02:56.106 --> 00:03:01.376
So, understandably, the source of this water was of interest not just

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:05.846
to the Ancient Egyptians, but anyone who set foot in the country.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:12.906
The Ancient Egyptians attributed the annual floods to the gods, believing that it must be some

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:19.396
divine being that caused so much water to flow down, literally providing life for the people.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:26.946
Numerous Roman leaders, from Julius Caesar to Nero, sent expeditions to try to find

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:32.036
where all this water was coming from, but they never managed to make much progress.

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:37.806
You might think that finding the source of a river is relatively simple.

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:41.746
You start at the mouth, where the river meets the sea, and

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:45.386
just keep on sailing up the river until you find your answer.

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:51.166
Unfortunately, in the case of The Nile, it isn’t quite that simple.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:58.826
Firstly, in modern South Sudan, around 2,500 kilometres south from where the Nile

00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:04.046
meets the Mediterranean, the Nile passes through a vast swamp called the Sudd.

00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:12.246
It is more than 50,000 kilometres squared, impenetrable to all but the smallest of boats, and

00:04:12.556 --> 00:04:19.516
anyone who got there was forced to turn around and return back downstream with the current.

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:25.476
And on the subject of currents, the currents in the river Nile can be very

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:30.996
strong, so especially in an era when boats would be reliant on man or wind

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:36.266
power, in many parts the current was too strong, a boat simply couldn’t pass.

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:41.346
You might think, ok, well if that’s the case then you can lift the boat

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:45.536
out of the water and carry it around until the current is less strong.

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:51.526
That is possible in some parts of The Nile, the part in modern-day Egypt for

00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:56.616
example, but let’s remember that The Nile is the longest river in the world.

00:04:57.286 --> 00:05:01.096
Well, in fact, there are some Brazilian researchers who are now saying

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:06.173
that The Amazon is longer, but the point remains that The Nile is vast.

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:10.393
It’s over 6,600 km long.

00:05:11.113 --> 00:05:18.703
If you imagine a river that went all the way from London to India, The Nile would still be longer.

00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:25.143
So you can certainly imagine how an expedition to try to find the source of

00:05:25.143 --> 00:05:30.123
The Nile, the “end” of the river, would require some serious preparation.

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:36.063
Now, let me give you a little bit of a spoiler here, and tell you that

00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:42.153
The Nile has two sources, two origins: The Blue Nile and The White Nile.

00:05:43.023 --> 00:05:49.143
Roughly halfway up The Nile, in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum the river splits in two.

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:55.403
The so-called Blue Nile goes to the East, and originates in Lake Tana

00:05:55.473 --> 00:06:00.273
in Ethiopia, while The White Nile continues south and originates,

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:04.023
well, that was the mystery and that’s what we’ll talk about today.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:09.963
See, The Blue Nile was the tributary that brought the flood water every

00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:15.903
year, and its source was discovered relatively early, potentially as early as

00:06:15.903 --> 00:06:22.743
1618 by a Spanish missionary, and certainly by a Scottish explorer in 1770.

00:06:24.043 --> 00:06:27.663
It turned out that the Blue Nile came from this large

00:06:27.663 --> 00:06:31.153
lake, which was full to the brim during the rainy season.

00:06:32.483 --> 00:06:35.963
The White Nile, however, was more mysterious.

00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:42.243
Its waters flowed all year round, but nobody knew for sure where it started.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.753
There were various theories, but these were all they were: theories.

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:52.653
The prevailing theory about where it came from actually dates

00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:56.583
back all the way to Ptolemy, the 2nd century mathematician.

00:06:58.143 --> 00:07:03.413
Ptolemy had heard from a travelling merchant that the source of the water for the Nile

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:09.823
was a group of large snow-capped mountains which he called the “mountains of the moon”.

00:07:11.123 --> 00:07:16.813
For almost two thousand years, it was believed by Europeans that there was a huge

00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:22.243
range of mountains that went through the middle of Africa, and it was the melting

00:07:22.313 --> 00:07:27.833
ice from these mountains that supplied the water for the continent’s largest river.

00:07:28.863 --> 00:07:34.343
See, European map makers had a relatively good understanding of the geography of the

00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:41.033
coast of Africa, but had very limited knowledge of the terrain inside this vast continent.

00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:48.513
It was a mystery, so for centuries Ptolemy’s version of these “mountains

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:53.933
of the moon” was taken as gospel, and you can find maps of Africa

00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:59.643
even as late as 1813 with a huge mountain range that cuts through it.

00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:05.303
But, as European explorers started to travel further into

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:09.293
Africa, there was no sign of this huge mountain range.

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:14.103
If this huge mountain range didn’t exist–which of course

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:17.883
it doesn’t–the source of the Nile must be elsewhere.

00:08:19.413 --> 00:08:24.133
And, as you may know, in the 19th century there was a growing interest in all

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:28.973
things Ancient Egyptian, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, as well as a

00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:34.683
general European imperialist notion of exploring the world and claiming territory.

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:41.443
So, it was only natural, you could say, that with this came a renewed desire

00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:46.813
to answer the question of the true source of The White Nile once and for all.

00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:52.323
And it's here that I must introduce you to the protagonist of

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:56.203
today’s episode, or at least one of the two lead characters.

00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:00.393
He was an Englishman called Richard Francis Burton.

00:09:01.703 --> 00:09:06.633
He had already made a name for himself for managing to travel to Mecca, in Saudi

00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:12.683
Arabia, at a time when non-Muslims were not allowed, and if caught, would be executed.

00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:20.493
He was also a linguist, reportedly fluent in Arabic as well as 24 other languages and 12 dialects.

00:09:21.543 --> 00:09:28.413
In 1854, he was chosen by the British Royal Geographical Society to lead a mission to the

00:09:28.453 --> 00:09:34.393
“Lake regions of Central Africa”, where he would look for the origins of The White Nile.

00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:40.743
Given the many difficulties of travelling up The Nile by boat, from

00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:45.703
the strong currents to the swamps, rocky waters and waterfalls, Burton

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:51.513
decided to land in Aden, in Somaliland and head west through Ethiopia.

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:58.873
By this time, it was hypothesised that the source of the White Nile was probably a huge lake

00:09:58.873 --> 00:10:06.253
of some sort, so the mission was to go west into Africa, find a huge lake, then go all the way

00:10:06.263 --> 00:10:11.263
around the lake to see if there were large rivers flowing out of it that would lead to the Nile.

00:10:12.793 --> 00:10:19.823
Described like that it sounds almost easy, but as you’ll see, it most certainly wasn’t.

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:24.413
When Burton arrived in Africa, he was joined by

00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:28.083
another Englishman by the name of John Hanning Speke.

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:33.833
And, little did the pair know it, but this would be the start of

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:39.013
one of 19th century exploration’s greatest rivalries and feuds.

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:45.503
See, Burton and Speke were both Victorian explorers, united by

00:10:45.523 --> 00:10:49.463
an imperial mission, but they couldn’t have been more different.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:55.703
Burton was English, but he was treated as a foreigner in his own country.

00:10:56.663 --> 00:11:00.783
He had dark skin and a large bushy moustache, he looked

00:11:00.783 --> 00:11:03.533
more like an Arab than a 19th century Englishman.

00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:10.243
I mean, he had even managed to travel to the heart of Islam, Mecca, without anyone thinking he

00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:15.923
was anything other than a devout Muslim pilgrim, so that gives you an idea of his appearance.

00:11:17.153 --> 00:11:21.563
He was also a deeply cultured man, seeking knowledge for knowledge’s

00:11:21.563 --> 00:11:25.603
sake, or at least that is how he is remembered by some historians.

00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:30.003
Speke was an entirely different individual.

00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:34.323
He was more in the style of the classic imperial Victorian explorer.

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:38.903
He was a light-haired aristocrat with a large country house in England.

00:11:40.473 --> 00:11:44.273
He had served in the British Army in India, and had travelled to

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:48.923
Mount Everest and Nepal, so he was well-used to harsh conditions.

00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:55.511
He wanted to make a name for himself as an explorer, he wanted to take trinkets back to his

00:11:55.511 --> 00:12:01.411
family home in England, and so he had volunteered to join Burton on his African expedition.

00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:06.861
And to underline, the mission was Burton’s, he was the leader,

00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:10.971
but this was something that Speke would never fully accept.

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:15.121
Speke considered himself to be Burton’s equal, and

00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:18.291
did not like the idea of being “second in command”.

00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:22.481
So, this gives you some idea of the characters of the pair.

00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:27.051
And of course, these two were far from alone.

00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:32.831
When they arrived in Africa, they hired as many local men as they could, literally

00:12:32.971 --> 00:12:38.421
hundreds of people to carry their belongings, cook for them, protect them, and guide them.

00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:44.291
And when I say “carry their belongings”, I mean it in the literal sense.

00:12:45.571 --> 00:12:51.311
A fly called the tsetse fly carried a disease that would kill horses and cows, so

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:56.761
these explorers needed to hire humans to carry all of their possessions for them.

00:12:58.243 --> 00:13:03.093
As you can imagine, an expedition like this was an incredibly expensive affair.

00:13:04.273 --> 00:13:09.123
Now, the expedition didn’t get off to a great start when its camp was attacked

00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:14.103
by a group of Somali warriors, killing one of the explorers and leaving Burton

00:13:14.313 --> 00:13:18.253
with a spear that literally went through one cheek and out of the other.

00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:26.033
Speke was caught, tied up and stabbed 11 times with a spear before managing to escape.

00:13:26.623 --> 00:13:28.823
And a third member was killed.

00:13:30.102 --> 00:13:33.613
Burton was forced to abandon the mission, but in

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:38.003
1857, just a few years later, he would be back again.

00:13:39.583 --> 00:13:44.163
This time, Burton understandably opted to avoid Somaliland,

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:48.893
instead landing further south in Zanzibar, and then heading inland.

00:13:50.243 --> 00:13:53.503
In case you need a reminder, Zanzibar is an island

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:56.623
off the east coast of Africa, in modern day Tanzania.

00:13:58.263 --> 00:14:02.303
Once on the mainland, the group followed paths that had been used for

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:06.853
centuries by Arab traders, but the journey was not exactly simple.

00:14:07.853 --> 00:14:11.563
Both Burton and Speke got malaria and were struck by other

00:14:11.563 --> 00:14:15.573
tropical diseases, and were carried for large parts of the journey.

00:14:17.164 --> 00:14:23.354
On February 13th of 1858, 253 days after having set

00:14:23.354 --> 00:14:27.424
off, they set eyes on the most amazing body of water.

00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:32.624
Lake Tanganyika, the second largest lake in Africa, and one

00:14:32.624 --> 00:14:36.614
that stretches almost 700 kilometres from top to bottom.

00:14:37.694 --> 00:14:43.944
Burton was amazed, believing that this huge body of water must be the source of the Nile.

00:14:45.447 --> 00:14:48.284
Speke, on the other hand, didn’t see anything.

00:14:49.274 --> 00:14:53.490
He had been temporarily blinded by a tropical disease, so he

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.254
had to take Burton’s word for it, he had to accept what he said.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.617
In fact, Speke wasn’t just temporarily blind, he was deaf as well, after

00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:07.377
a particularly gruesome incident that isn’t directly relevant to our

00:15:07.377 --> 00:15:11.757
story, but does give you some sense of what these men were going through.

00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:17.717
One evening, there was a huge storm and Speke’s tent was blown away.

00:15:18.747 --> 00:15:22.887
He tried to light a candle to see what was going on, but when

00:15:22.887 --> 00:15:27.077
he lit the candle, he was attacked by a swarm of beetles.

00:15:28.247 --> 00:15:34.057
There seemed to be nothing he could do to get them away, so he lay down and tried to get to sleep.

00:15:35.677 --> 00:15:39.517
As he was sleeping, a beetle crawled into his ear.

00:15:40.277 --> 00:15:44.987
Not just around his ear, but properly into his ear canal, and

00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:48.697
it was burrowing deeper and deeper, digging at his ear drum.

00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:52.636
Speke did everything he could to try to get it out.

00:15:52.976 --> 00:15:58.926
Shaking and scratching, and he even melted butter, but it was all to no avail.

00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:05.726
Eventually, he was so desperate that he got his knife and thrust it into his ear.

00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:10.946
He managed to kill the beetle, but it made him go deaf in the process.

00:16:11.966 --> 00:16:15.516
And apparently for months afterwards, he continued to

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.426
find little pieces of beetle coming out of his ear.

00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:20.376
Disgusting, I know.

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:27.036
Now, by the time they had arrived at Lake Tanganyika, Burton was so ill

00:16:27.226 --> 00:16:30.816
that he was content enough to accept that this was the source of the Nile.

00:16:32.176 --> 00:16:35.916
After all, it looked like a big lake, it was roughly in the right

00:16:35.916 --> 00:16:40.722
place, and the men had gone through hell, had almost died multiple

00:16:40.722 --> 00:16:45.142
times, and Burton probably felt like he was going to die any day.

00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:51.992
It’s hardly surprising that he was happy to say “ok, that’s good enough for me, let’s head home”.

00:16:53.272 --> 00:16:56.292
Speke, on the other hand, wanted to keep going.

00:16:56.912 --> 00:17:02.052
Yes, it was a big lake, but this wasn’t proof that it was the source of the Nile.

00:17:03.602 --> 00:17:09.382
The pair split, with Burton staying put and Speke continuing north until he reached

00:17:09.382 --> 00:17:14.228
an even bigger lake a few hundred kilometres to the north east, Lake Nyanza.

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:20.632
Speke, in the imperialist tradition, decided to give it a completely different name,

00:17:21.052 --> 00:17:26.042
declaring that it was to be called Lake Victoria, after the British queen at the time.

00:17:27.605 --> 00:17:32.065
And as a reminder of where we are in Africa, Lake Victoria is

00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:36.335
just over 700 kilometres inland from the east coast of Africa.

00:17:37.043 --> 00:17:40.201
Most of it is split between modern day Tanzania and

00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:43.991
Uganda, but there’s a little slither in Kenya as well.

00:17:45.294 --> 00:17:51.274
Now, by the time Speke had got to Lake Victoria, he was a wreck, as was his group.

00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:56.234
His vision was almost gone, the mapping equipment they had

00:17:56.244 --> 00:18:00.644
brought had been lost or stolen, they had barely anything left.

00:18:01.654 --> 00:18:06.194
They also didn’t have the right boats to properly explore the lake, so they

00:18:06.194 --> 00:18:11.164
couldn’t go around it to properly map it and see if it really did lead to the Nile.

00:18:12.544 --> 00:18:17.354
One thing that Speke was able to do, however, was boil water.

00:18:18.944 --> 00:18:23.754
He noticed that it took longer to boil water here than at Lake

00:18:23.794 --> 00:18:27.194
Tanganyika, which meant that it must be higher in altitude.

00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:34.348
And if it was higher and further north, it was more likely to be the ultimate source of The Nile.

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:41.738
Speke returned to Burton, declaring that he had discovered the source of The Nile.

00:18:43.276 --> 00:18:46.831
Burton said something along the lines of “ok, certainly

00:18:46.841 --> 00:18:50.071
could be”, but insisted that they needed more proof.

00:18:51.011 --> 00:18:55.751
What Speke had found was interesting, but not conclusive, according to Burton.

00:18:57.143 --> 00:19:03.571
Speke was deeply offended that Burton hadn’t accepted his conclusion, there was a huge argument.

00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:11.151
The feud was so great, in fact, that the two men travelled in separate ships back to the UK.

00:19:12.738 --> 00:19:17.238
Speke, it would turn out, rushed back to London so that he could

00:19:17.248 --> 00:19:21.658
present his findings to the Royal Geographical Society before Burton,

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:26.648
claiming the glory of “discovering” the origin of The Nile for himself.

00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:33.378
And it worked, or at least his findings were accepted by the Royal Geographical

00:19:33.378 --> 00:19:39.158
Society, and he was even given further funding to go on another expedition to Africa.

00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:46.648
Burton was incensed, and would later claim that Speke and he had agreed to

00:19:46.648 --> 00:19:51.588
present their findings together, but his former colleague had betrayed him

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:56.938
and gone back on his word, which was a serious no-no in Victorian England.

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:03.638
Meanwhile, in 1860 Speke had returned to Africa, gone

00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:07.418
to Lake Victoria, and this time was better equipped.

00:20:08.578 --> 00:20:14.068
He managed to go all the way around Lake Victoria, and on the north side he found a

00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:19.998
waterfall that led to a large river that he claimed was the start of the White Nile.

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:26.068
He returned to London, boasting about his findings, but there was still doubt.

00:20:27.218 --> 00:20:31.448
Burton said that the discovery of this waterfall and river didn’t mean

00:20:31.448 --> 00:20:35.478
anything, because Speke didn’t follow it all the way down to the Nile.

00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:43.631
The matter was to be solved once and for all, or at least publicly debated, at the Royal

00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:51.071
Geographical Society on the 16th of September 1864, 9 years after the first expedition.

00:20:52.191 --> 00:20:59.171
It would be a clash of the titans, Speke, in one corner, proposing that Lake Victoria was the true

00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:05.951
source of the White Nile, and Burton in the other, proposing that it was, in fact, Lake Tanganyika.

00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:15.411
And to make matters even more dramatic, the pair loathed one another, and hadn’t spoken for years.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:20.507
But it’s here that the story takes a dark turn.

00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:27.891
The day before the debate, Speke was out hunting at a friend’s estate when he was crossing a fence.

00:21:29.191 --> 00:21:32.761
His cousin was with him, and he heard a gunshot.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:38.381
He rushed over, and found Speke lying on the ground,

00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:42.791
covered in blood, shot in the chest by his own gun.

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:47.939
A jury would later declare that it was an unfortunate accident;

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:52.599
Speke was crossing the fence and the gun had accidentally gone off.

00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:58.669
But Burton took no time to question this, suggesting that his former

00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:04.219
partner had killed himself out of shame, to, and I’m quoting directly,

00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:09.519
avoid “exposure of his misstatements in regard to the Nile sources.”

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:16.129
Speke was dead, and Burton was too weak to go on a similar expedition.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:21.879
And the mystery of the true origin of the Nile, was still unsolved.

00:22:23.193 --> 00:22:26.663
OK then, that is it for part one of this mini-series

00:22:26.823 --> 00:22:29.933
on the quest to find the true origin of The Nile.

00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:34.563
Next up will be Part Two, and in it we’ll meet a very different type of

00:22:34.563 --> 00:22:39.083
British explorer, the Scottish missionary, Sir David Livingstone, a man who

00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:44.083
disappeared off the face of the Earth in his search for the origin of the Nile.

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:49.383
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:22:49.893 --> 00:22:54.973

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:16.708
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.728
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:24.998
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:29.008
about a man you may have heard of before - Malcolm X.

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:35.998
He was one of the most influential African-American civil rights leaders of the 1950’s and 1960’s.

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:43.318
An inspiration to some, a violent thug to others, for many Malcolm X is still the most

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:49.718
important symbol of black power, African-American identity, liberation, and anti-racism.

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:54.328
His legacy lives on in fights against prejudice, oppression, and

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:57.948
colonialism not just in the United States, but across the world.

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:03.498
So, let’s get right into it and talk about the life and legacy of Malcolm X.

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:09.198
It was a crisp February afternoon in 1965.

00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:16.508
Malcolm X was in Manhattan to address an Organization of African-American Unity meeting.

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:22.468
As he was about to begin his speech, there was an altercation in the crowd.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:29.108
As bodyguards tried to remove a man from the hall, there was a moment of confusion, and a pause.

00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:35.168
Then, suddenly, a man appeared from the crowd with a sawed-off shotgun.

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:42.718
He walked slowly towards Malcolm and with a thunderous boom, shot him in the chest.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.798
The shot ripped through Malcolm X’s body and sent him flying backwards.

00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:51.088
The crowd panicked.

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:57.428
More men emerged from the crowd firing semi-automatic weapons towards Malcolm X.

00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:01.518
The hall was filled with screams and shouts, and people

00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:04.158
dropped to the floor, trampling over one another.

00:02:04.638 --> 00:02:09.018
Chairs were overturned as people scrambled for the exits.

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:15.798
In the front row, Malcolm X’s four daughters and his pregnant wife cowered in fear.

00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:18.188
But it was too late.

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:25.818
Shortly after arriving at the hospital, at the age of 39, Malcolm X was pronounced dead.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:28.928
But who killed Malcolm X?

00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:35.278
Why did they want him dead, and why had our protagonist himself predicted that this would happen?

00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:39.688
Before we get into all of that, we should talk about his life,

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.648
and how he ended up speaking at that meeting in the first place.

00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:49.058
Our first stop will be his life before he became Malcolm X.

00:02:49.558 --> 00:02:53.988
Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska,

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:59.078
on the 19th of May, 1925, to Earl and Louise Little.

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:05.438
Earl, his father, was an outspoken Baptist preacher, and along

00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:08.888
with his mother was involved in black nationalist groups.

00:03:09.738 --> 00:03:14.358
Both were admirers of Pan-African leader Marcus Garvey, who

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:19.288
advocated separating the races and creating black-only states.

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:26.308
The Littles gave their many children a deep sense of black pride at a time

00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:32.038
when simply being black could, and often did, make life very difficult.

00:03:33.148 --> 00:03:38.518
After the Ku Klux Klan harassed and threatened Earl about his pro-black

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:43.798
nationalist work and sermons, he moved the family briefly to Milwaukee for

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:48.818
a couple of years and then to Lansing, Michigan, in order to escape them.

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:54.958
But the harassment continued in Lansing, and after buying a house in

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.258
a white neighbourhood, Earl Little was taken to court and evicted.

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:03.058
But before they could even leave the property, the

00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:06.698
house was burnt down with the whole family inside.

00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:12.738
Fortunately, they escaped without any injuries but Malcolm X’s father

00:04:12.938 --> 00:04:18.778
suspected, and it has long been accepted by historians, that a white supremacist

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:23.188
offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan called the Black Legion were responsible.

00:04:24.378 --> 00:04:27.878
The Little family’s escape to Michigan hadn’t quite worked as

00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:32.458
planned - white supremacists seemed to follow them wherever they went.

00:04:33.688 --> 00:04:41.528
Then, in 1931, when Malcolm was six years old, his father, Earl Little was killed in suspicious

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:48.288
circumstances in a streetcar accident, his body found strewn on the street beside the tracks.

00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:55.958
Louise, and later Malcolm, believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion, and

00:04:56.128 --> 00:05:01.668
rumours spread around town that his death had not been an accident, like the authorities

00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:06.888
quickly declared that it was, but that he had been killed by white supremacists.

00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:14.068
The life insurance company, on the other hand, didn’t accept that anyone had killed Earl Little.

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:19.188
They said he had killed himself, he had committed suicide, and as a

00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:23.558
consequence they refused to pay out to Earl Little’s wife and family.

00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:28.185
As if this wasn’t enough bad luck, Louise,  Earl’s

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:32.055
wife, suffered a breakdown and was admitted to hospital.

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:36.515
The Little children were split up and put into foster care.

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:43.145
After initially doing well in school, Malcolm Little became disillusioned

00:05:43.145 --> 00:05:47.555
with education when a white teacher ridiculed his dreams of becoming

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:52.275
a lawyer and told him that it “was no aspiration” for a black boy.

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:58.815
Instead, he dropped out and moved to Boston, where he lived with his half-sister.

00:06:00.278 --> 00:06:05.785
After a string of uninspiring jobs he became a petty criminal, and

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:11.135
in 1943 he moved to Harlem, in New York City, where he worked on

00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.365
the railroad and continued various criminal activities on the side.

00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:21.825
In order to avoid military service during World War War Two, he pretended to be

00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:27.325
mentally ill and told the nurse assessing him that the reason he wanted to join the

00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:34.295
army was that so he could, quote, “steal us some guns and kill crackers.” - crackers,

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:39.175
by the way, doesn't mean biscuits, it's a derogatory term towards white people.

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:45.935
Later on, in his autobiography, Malcolm X would write that at that time of his life,

00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:51.705
"the only three things in the world” that scared him were "jail, a job, and the Army."

00:06:53.215 --> 00:07:00.225
His trick worked, however, and he was disqualified from military service on October 25th, 1943.

00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:08.575
When he returned to Boston in 1945 he began doing burglaries in wealthy neighbourhoods and,

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:15.015
in 1946, he was arrested while trying to collect a stolen watch he had taken to be repaired.

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:22.375
As a result, he was convicted of burglary and theft and sentenced to ten years in prison.

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:27.445
And it would be in prison that Malcolm Little entered

00:07:27.475 --> 00:07:31.455
a period of intense self-reflection and education.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:37.625
He became a big reader and developed a thirst for knowledge and meaning in his life.

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:45.065
Around this time, in the late-1940’s and early-1950’s, a religious movement known

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:49.885
as the Nation of Islam was gaining popularity in the African-American community.

00:07:50.635 --> 00:07:55.605
The Nation of Islam preached black self-reliance; that black people

00:07:55.715 --> 00:08:00.975
were the original and superior race; and that Christianity was a white

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:05.845
man’s religion forced onto black people by their white slave masters.

00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:13.205
The group wanted the return of African-Amerians to Africa, where they could live freely from

00:08:13.205 --> 00:08:19.515
white domination, and the group believed the demise of the entire white race was approaching.

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:27.245
Nation of Islam ideas were not only popular in US prisons, but with the Little family too.

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:34.755
His brother Reginald, himself a recent convert, encouraged Malcolm to convert to the

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:40.505
Nation of Islam, and he began reading the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, the group’s leader.

00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:48.265
Malcolm spent hours in the prison library, and improved his public speaking in prison debates.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:54.725
In 1948 he gave up smoking and eating pork, in keeping with Nation

00:08:54.725 --> 00:08:58.755
of Islam teachings, and wrote to its leader Elijah Muhammad.

00:08:59.675 --> 00:09:04.145
Muhammad encouraged him to renounce his past and convert.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:10.725
Shortly after Malcolm duly converted and he became a member of the Nation of Islam.

00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:18.285
When he left prison in 1952, Malcolm Little dropped his last name and adopted

00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:24.195
‘X’ - as was customary for many members of the Nation of Islam - the ‘X’

00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:30.125
symbolised what he believed was his true ancestral surname lost to slavery.

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:36.663
He finally met Elijah Muhammad in person that same year, and took on a

00:09:36.673 --> 00:09:40.943
leading role in spreading the Nation of Islam’s teachings across the country.

00:09:41.653 --> 00:09:48.403
He organised and established temples in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and in towns and

00:09:48.403 --> 00:09:54.193
cities across the south, spreading the world of Elijah Muhammad and recruiting members.

00:09:55.433 --> 00:09:59.563
Every month hundreds more African-Americans were joining the Nation

00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:05.333
of Islam, and Malcolm X, as he was now known, was largely credited

00:10:05.493 --> 00:10:09.663
with the group’s rise in membership during the 1950’s and 1960’s.

00:10:10.613 --> 00:10:14.723
He would even go on to recruit the famous heavyweight world champion

00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:19.493
boxer, Cassius Clay, who would go on to change his name to, well,

00:10:19.783 --> 00:10:22.613
you may have guessed it if you didn’t know it already, Muhammad Ali.

00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:29.673
Now, there is some dispute among historians as to the exact numbers of recruits during

00:10:29.673 --> 00:10:35.513
that period, but whatever the figures, Malcolm X began to earn himself a reputation

00:10:35.743 --> 00:10:42.013
as a reliable recruiter and a powerful public speaker noted for his physical presence.

00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:50.633
At 6’3, over 1 metre 90, with a powerfully built frame, Malcolm X’s public speeches

00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:57.523
captivated audiences and inspired African-Americans to fight back against racial oppression.

00:10:58.543 --> 00:11:00.993
Here’s a short clip of him speaking:

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:08.806
We declare our right on this Earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected

00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:14.086
as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society on this

00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:20.666
earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence by any means necessary.

00:11:22.988 --> 00:11:24.028
Powerful stuff, right?

00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:30.848
Although Malcom X was well known in Nation of Islam circles by now, he had not

00:11:30.878 --> 00:11:35.798
yet made his mark on the wider American public, nor indeed the authorities.

00:11:36.948 --> 00:11:41.938
He soon became a public figure, however, in 1957, when a Nation of

00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:46.098
Islam member was visciously beaten by police officers in New York.

00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:51.168
The man, Hinton Johnson, stumbled across the officers

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.368
beating another African-American man in the street.

00:11:55.498 --> 00:11:59.798
Sadly, this was not such an uncommon occurrence at the time.

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:06.668
After trying to intervene, Johnson and his friends were then themselves

00:12:06.668 --> 00:12:11.764
beaten; with Johnson so badly beaten that he had a brain haemorrhage.

00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:18.528
All four of the men, the men who were trying to help stop the original beating, were arrested.

00:12:19.978 --> 00:12:26.308
When he heard about what had happened, Malcolm X gathered a small group of Nation of Islam followers

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:32.488
and went down to the 28th Precinct headquarters police station in Harlem, demanding to see Johnson.

00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:38.808
The crowd grew to 500 and the police eventually allowed Malcolm X to

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:43.288
speak with Johnson, who said he needed to be taken to hospital right away.

00:12:44.538 --> 00:12:48.978
When Johnson returned from the hospital, the crowd had grown to four

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:54.078
thousand and the situation became tense as Malcolm X and other Nation

00:12:54.078 --> 00:12:58.438
of Islam members tried to negotiate Johnson and the other men’s bail.

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:01.488
Police feared a riot could start.

00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:05.508
Johnson’s bail was denied until the next day.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:11.558
After coming to an agreement with the police, Malcolm X left the station and signalled

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:16.748
with his hand that the crowd should disperse, that everyone should just go home.

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:24.038
And with that one gesture, the angry mob did indeed disperse, everyone went away.

00:13:25.068 --> 00:13:29.908
The man’s control over the crowd did not go unnoticed by the authorities.

00:13:31.058 --> 00:13:35.888
In the New York Amsterdam News, one police officer was quoted as saying of

00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:41.098
Malcolm X’s hold over the crowd that "No one man should have that much power.”

00:13:42.178 --> 00:13:45.608
Coverage of the incident in the press not only brought Malcolm

00:13:45.608 --> 00:13:50.248
X to the attention of the public, but to the police and the FBI.

00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:56.808
Shortly after the Hinton Johnson incident the New York City Police Department started

00:13:56.808 --> 00:14:03.958
keeping Malcolm X under surveillance, and the FBI, which reportedly had a file open on him

00:14:04.118 --> 00:14:11.258
since as early 1953, now focused on him as a "key figure" in the Nation of Islam movement.

00:14:12.548 --> 00:14:17.458
It was at around this time that he began to take some of his first international

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:23.888
trips, including visits to Egypt, Ghana, Sudan, Nigeria, Syria and Iran.

00:14:25.108 --> 00:14:29.478
In Egypt, he even met with the president, President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:35.508
And in 1960, he met with Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:39.478
Malcolm X was becoming a big deal.

00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:46.898
Or, as he put it in his autobiography, "it seems that everywhere I went telephones were ringing."

00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:55.358
And in 1961, Elijah Muhammad made it official: making him the ‘national representative’

00:14:55.488 --> 00:14:59.848
of the Nation of Islam - the second most senior position in the organisation.

00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:05.738
He began lecturing on university campuses and taking part in debates on

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:11.288
television and radio, but his rising popularity did not please everyone.

00:15:12.538 --> 00:15:18.798
As is often the case in any organisation, his popularity did not always please the boss.

00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:25.528
In Malcolm X’s case, the boss was Elijah Muhammad, whose closest advisers feared

00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:30.868
that Malcolm X was becoming too influential and would become the next leader.

00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:37.018
The rift between them would only get worse, and proved fatal for Malcolm X.

00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:42.308
His increasing prominence wasn’t just upsetting rivals within the Nation of

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:47.595
Islam, or frightening the authorities or those in the country’s white community.

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:53.905
His brand of black nationalism fused with Islamic teaching was also at odds with

00:15:53.905 --> 00:15:58.155
the broader Christian civil rights movement in the United States at the time.

00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:05.995
Led by Martin Luther King Jr, the civil rights movement promoted nonviolent resistance to

00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:13.915
segregation, a multi-racial coalition, and promoted patience and respect on the road to equality.

00:16:15.275 --> 00:16:19.935
Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, however, didn’t buy any of that.

00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:26.235
Whereas King and other civil rights leaders wanted to end the racial segregation

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:32.655
of society, Malcolm X wanted the opposite: he called for the complete separation

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:37.805
of blacks and whites, and even proposed that African-Americans should return

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:42.345
to Africa, just like his parents’ political hero, Marcus Garvey had done.

00:16:43.765 --> 00:16:48.055
Where King called for nonviolent protest, Malcolm X

00:16:48.155 --> 00:16:51.355
wanted his members to fight back and defend themselves.

00:16:52.575 --> 00:16:57.585
“The only people in this country who are asked to be nonviolent,” he said, “are black people."

00:16:58.725 --> 00:17:04.065
Malcolm X was publicly critical of King and the mainstream civil rights movement.

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:10.935
King was, he said, ‘a chump’–a fool or an idiot–and he claimed that he

00:17:10.955 --> 00:17:15.215
and other mainstream civil rights leaders were ‘stooges’ of the white man.

00:17:15.925 --> 00:17:19.695
A stooge is a word for someone used by someone else.

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:27.835
He would go on to call the famous 1963 March on Washington led by King, ‘the farce on Washington.’

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:33.735
Marches like the 1963 one were, in his eyes, "run by whites.”

00:17:34.905 --> 00:17:38.345
And the media played on the difference between the two men.

00:17:38.995 --> 00:17:44.775
Much of the American media portrayed Malcolm X as a violent threat to American society.

00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:50.595
The New York Times described him as, quote: "an extraordinary

00:17:50.615 --> 00:17:55.565
and twisted man, turning many true gifts to evil purposes.”

00:17:56.876 --> 00:18:02.895
But at the time many African-Americans felt that Malcolm X’s brand of direct

00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:09.025
resistance was more appealing than King’s long-game of peaceful protest, and that

00:18:09.035 --> 00:18:14.445
his outspoken nature better voiced their concerns than the calm, respectful King.

00:18:15.765 --> 00:18:21.125
But behind the scenes, things were not as they seemed in the Nation of Islam.

00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:27.485
Tension was bubbling between different factions, and starting in the early-1960’s

00:18:27.855 --> 00:18:33.135
Malcolm X began to question the Nation of Islam and his place within it.

00:18:34.245 --> 00:18:37.825
A number of incidents caused him to doubt the organisation.

00:18:38.955 --> 00:18:44.215
First, in 1962, the Los Angeles Police Department beat Nation

00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:48.115
of Islam members outside a temple in south-central Los Angeles.

00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:53.465
After fighting between temple members and police spilled inside,

00:18:53.785 --> 00:18:59.155
LAPD reinforcements arrived and shot seven unarmed Muslims.

00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:03.865
The Temple’s secretary, Ronald Stokes, was shot dead

00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:06.745
as he raised his hand above his head in surrender.

00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:15.145
After an all-white jury decided that Stokes’ killing was a "justifiable homicide" and

00:19:15.415 --> 00:19:21.885
actually indicted several Nation of Islam members for assault, Malcolm X declared revenge.

00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:25.775
Speaking in front of two thousand people at Stokes’

00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:29.345
funeral in Los Angeles, he called for a response.

00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:34.795
He wanted to encourage more hardline elements within the Nation of Islam,

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:40.915
and he sought approval from Elijah Muhammad to get revenge on the police.

00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:47.355
But he was shocked when Muhammad refused, and many within the organisation

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:52.125
pointed to this moment as the beginning of the end of their relationship.

00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:58.655
The second incident that tested his commitment to the Nation of Islam also

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:03.455
involved Elijah Muhammad, but this time it was a much more personal matter.

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:10.045
Later on that same year, rumours began to emerge that Elijah Muhammad was having affairs

00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:14.735
with several of his secretaries, and that he had even fathered illegitimate children.

00:20:15.835 --> 00:20:22.705
This was a direct contradiction of Nation of Islam teachings, and when Muhammad asked him to help

00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:29.338
cover-up the scandal, Malcolm X began to seriously question the legitimacy of the Nation of Islam.

00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:37.938
In 1963 a third incident confirmed the rift between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad.

00:20:39.068 --> 00:20:40.568
When president John F.

00:20:40.638 --> 00:20:45.168
Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, in November of that year,

00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:50.258
Malcolm X made unsympathetic comments about his death in the press.

00:20:51.428 --> 00:20:56.178
JFK’s death, he said, was simply ‘chickens coming home to roost.’

00:20:57.058 --> 00:21:00.958
The phrase chickens coming home to roost, by the way, means when

00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:05.978
past mistakes or wrongdoings will eventually be the cause of present

00:21:05.988 --> 00:21:10.618
troubles, so Malcolm X implied that Kennedy deserved to be killed.

00:21:11.798 --> 00:21:18.008
The Nation of Islam’s official position was very different and Elijah Muhammad had sent the group’s

00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:24.768
condolences to the family and banned its ministers and members from commenting on the assassination.

00:21:26.058 --> 00:21:30.378
When Malcolm X made his comments, Muhammad was furious

00:21:30.468 --> 00:21:33.728
and banned him from public speaking for three months.

00:21:35.238 --> 00:21:38.118
Disillusioned with both Muhammad and the Nation of

00:21:38.118 --> 00:21:42.908
Islam, in March 1964 Malcolm X left the organisation.

00:21:43.878 --> 00:21:48.688
The next month, he gave a speech in Detroit now known as ‘The Ballot

00:21:48.928 --> 00:21:52.858
or the Bullet’ speech that outlined his black nationalist ideology.

00:21:53.628 --> 00:22:00.158
A ballot is a voting system, and the bullet is, well, it’s the thing that you fire from a gun.

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:06.878
In this speech, he advised African-Americans to vote for change but

00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:11.858
also that it might be necessary for them to take up arms, to fight.

00:22:13.178 --> 00:22:17.008
He also started his own organisation, Muslim Mosque

00:22:17.028 --> 00:22:20.488
Incorporated, a direct rival to the Nation of Islam.

00:22:21.938 --> 00:22:25.718
In response the Nation of Islam demanded that he surrender

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:29.178
all of his property, including his house in Queens.

00:22:30.498 --> 00:22:36.408
The house was eventually burned to the ground, many people believed, by Nation of Islam members.

00:22:37.668 --> 00:22:41.148
Once again, Malcolm X’s family home had been destroyed.

00:22:42.218 --> 00:22:45.431
When he was a boy in Michigan, by white nationalists;

00:22:45.778 --> 00:22:49.138
now as an adult in New York, by black nationalists.

00:22:50.418 --> 00:22:53.988
Feeling threatened and needing inspiration, he went abroad.

00:22:54.478 --> 00:22:59.268
He made another tour of Africa, speaking at universities and meeting with

00:22:59.408 --> 00:23:04.098
heads of state, and stopped to take part in debates in Paris and London.

00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:10.948
When he was in Oxford to speak in a debate in December of 1964, Malcolm

00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:14.718
X predicted that he would soon be killed by the Nation of Islam.

00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:21.768
He also made a pilgrimage to the holy site of Mecca, and when he saw Muslims of "all

00:23:21.788 --> 00:23:27.198
colours, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans" making the pilgrimage together,

00:23:27.438 --> 00:23:32.748
he started to believe that Islam could be a way in which racism could be overcome.

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:37.588
Perhaps complete segregation wasn’t the answer after all.

00:23:38.988 --> 00:23:42.998
The experience had such a transformative effect on him that he

00:23:42.998 --> 00:23:48.870
converted to Sunni Islam and took a new name: el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz.

00:23:49.984 --> 00:23:53.368
When he returned to the United States, he publicly renounced

00:23:53.378 --> 00:23:56.728
the teachings of the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad.

00:23:57.878 --> 00:24:03.129
He founded the Organization for Afro-American Unity, and was repeatedly

00:24:03.139 --> 00:24:07.959
threatened by Nation of Islam members: the FBI intercepted a phone call

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:12.969
in which his wife was told that her husband was, quote, "as good as dead.”

00:24:14.199 --> 00:24:18.039
And the threats continued throughout the rest of 1964.

00:24:18.849 --> 00:24:23.449
Elijah Muhammad said publically that, quote, "hypocrites like Malcolm

00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:27.569
should have their heads cut off,” and an edition of the widely read

00:24:27.569 --> 00:24:32.399
magazine Muhammad Speaks featured a cartoon with Malcolm’s severed head.

00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:38.279
In early 1965 Malcolm X returned to England to address the

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:41.739
first meeting of the Council of African Organizations in London.

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:45.859
A few weeks after his return to the United States, on the

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:50.419
21st of February, 1965, he was assassinated in New York.

00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:56.639
In the aftermath of his murder, rumours spread about who had killed Malcolm X.

00:24:57.379 --> 00:25:01.802
Some suggested it was local drug dealers, others the FBI.

00:25:03.383 --> 00:25:05.709
But it was pretty clear who was responsible.

00:25:06.489 --> 00:25:11.049
A few days after the assassination, Elijah Muhammad denied that the Nation

00:25:11.049 --> 00:25:15.729
of Islam was involved but said that "Malcolm X got just what he preached."

00:25:16.929 --> 00:25:19.539
Shortly after, the cops found the killers.

00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:23.929
Three Nation of Islam members were arrested, charged with

00:25:23.949 --> 00:25:27.739
murder, found gulty and sentenced to twenty years in prison.

00:25:29.229 --> 00:25:35.509
Like so many other pivotal figures of 1960’s America - Malcolm X was assassinated.

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:39.189
And just three years later Martin Luther King.

00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:44.529
Jr was also assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, and the two main, but

00:25:44.739 --> 00:25:48.699
very different leaders of the Civil Rights movement were silenced.

00:25:50.069 --> 00:25:56.829
King’s enduring legacy was that of nonviolent protest and pacifism in the face of oppression.

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:02.289
Malcolm X's approach was clearly different, he may be less well

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:06.329
known than Martin Luther King, but he was of huge importance.

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:11.579
He was foundational in the fight against racial oppression and many of the

00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:16.319
civil rights movements can be traced back to the life and work of Malcolm X.

00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:23.229
As the famous black theologian James Cone put it, “Malcolm changed how black

00:26:23.229 --> 00:26:28.249
people thought about themselves… After Malcolm, he helped us become black.”

00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:34.419
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Malcolm X.

00:26:34.649 --> 00:26:38.179
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:42.029
Malcolm X and his life before today, or this was the first time you'd

00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:46.029
heard anything really about him, well I hope you learned something new.

00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:50.189
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:55.529
What do you think about the differing approaches of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King?

00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:57.899
Which approach was more effective?

00:26:58.499 --> 00:27:02.189
What might Malcolm X have gone on to do if he hadn't been killed?

00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:06.169
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

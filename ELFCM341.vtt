Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.830
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.039
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.060
The show where you can listen to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.779
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.150
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.529
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.950
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.800
going to be talking about Norse Mythology.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.859
When you think of mythology,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.920
perhaps you think of the Romans

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.360
or Greeks, their stories of gods

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.269
and goddesses and epic battles.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.930
But there was another European

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.880
civilisation to the icy north,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.610
another civilisation with its unique

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.519
set of stories and myths that are

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.160
equally, if not more fascinating.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.980
So, in today’s episode we’ll come

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.070
across stories of revenge, of mythical

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.710
beasts, of love and of betrayal.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110
We’ll start with an explanation of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.360
some of the key figures in Norse

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.359
mythology before moving on to look

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.689
at the impact that it has had on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.150
language and culture more widely.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510
We’ve got a lot to get through,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.470
so let’s get right into it.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.009
You might already know a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.679
lot about Norse mythology.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.780
You might know nothing about it.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.400
Even if you are in that second category,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.240
and you think you know nothing about

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.080
it, and have never encountered any links

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.769
with Norse mythology, then let me start

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.029
by reminding you that the signs of Norse

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.170
mythology are everywhere around us.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630
If you’ve met anyone named Freya,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.479
you’ve ever done anything on a Tuesday,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.979
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, or

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.960
you are listening to this episode

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.270
on Bluetooth headphones, all of

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.450
these have links in Norse Mythology.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.370
So, before looking at its impact on

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.500
our lives today, let’s take a look

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.100
at who these Norse gods actually

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.509
were, what they did, and why.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.870
Our story begins in Scandinavia, a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.510
huge, snowy area in Northern Europe

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.859
which includes the modern countries

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.390
of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.780
Importantly, Scandinavia doesn’t include

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.140
Finland, which is a common misconception.

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.350
Nowadays, these countries are

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.250
famous for many things, a strong

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.690
welfare system, a successful fishing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.699
industry, Spotify, the invention of

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.340
Minecraft, and flat-pack furniture.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.369
But a thousand years ago, Scandinavia

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.910
was clearly a very different place.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.250
Back then, the countries of Sweden,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.260
Norway and Denmark were home to a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.820
fierce race of people: the Vikings.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.840
Now, the history books don’t look

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.349
particularly kindly on the vikings,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.419
they don’t have a great reputation.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.700
There’s a very good reason

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.730
for this, of course.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.620
From the 9th century to the 11th

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.820
century, they attacked countries

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.480
all over Europe, burning down towns,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.470
stealing anything of value and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.560
killing anyone who got in their way.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.510
As a quick side note - we do have

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.480
an episode just on the vikings,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.170
so if you would like to listen to

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.930
that one, it’s episode number 96.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.080
But aside from raping and pillaging, and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.619
frightening the life out of anyone living

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.349
near the coast of Britain or Northern

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.140
France, the Vikings were actually a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.500
highly cultured and developed people.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.329
They were brilliant sailors, who

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.030
may have travelled to America

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.980
long before Christopher Columbus.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.240
They made beautiful jewellery

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.739
and complicated wooden carvings.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.409
Alongside this, they also had a vibrant

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.970
set of religious beliefs, which was

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.000
known at the time as “the Tradition”,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.850
and is what we’ll be focussing on today.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.350
Now, the Tradition was a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.540
polytheistic religion, meaning

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.939
that it had lots of different gods.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.049
The most powerful of these gods was Odin,

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.140
the god of wisdom, magic and poetry.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.073
He was an old man with a beard, who

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.590
was blind in one eye, rode a horse with

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.169
eight legs, and had two pet ravens who

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.829
perched, who sat, on either shoulder.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.849
Odin’s wife was a goddess named Frigg.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.040
Just like him, she was very wise, and she

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.400
even had the power to see into the future.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.290
Odin and Frigg had several children.

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.360
One of these children was

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.430
Thor, the god of thunder.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.909
He was brave and strong, with

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.150
a magical hammer which returned

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.030
to his hand after he threw it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.140
And their other child was Balder.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.090
He was known as the most beautiful of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.840
all the gods, so pure and perfect that

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.439
he couldn’t be damaged by anything.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.900
Well, there was one thing, but

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.230
we’ll get to that in a minute.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.270
Then there was Loki, the god of

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.049
chaos and trickery, a naughty god who

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.599
wasn’t so keen on following the rules.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.349
Sometimes, he acted as an ally, a

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.669
friend, to the other gods, helping

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.719
them to come up with clever plans.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.580
At other times, he tricked the other gods.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.799
The most famous of Loki’s tricks, if

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.989
you can really call it a trick, was the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.669
murder of Balder, who remember, was Odin

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.209
and Frigg’s perfect son, the one who

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.530
couldn’t be damaged or hurt by anything.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.150
Anything, that is, except for a

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.700
piece of mistletoe, a poisonous

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.030
plant with white berries, the one

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.340
people kiss under at Christmas time.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.630
When Loki learned about Balder’s weakness,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.480
he tricked one of the other gods into

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.160
throwing a piece of mistletoe at Balder.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.380
Balder was killed, and when Odin

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.490
found out what had happened, he

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.940
was furious, and set out to punish

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.900
Loki in the most terrible way.

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.760
According to the stories, Loki was

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.630
tied to a rock and dropped into a

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.050
cave, where a venomous snake would drip

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.230
poison on his face for all eternity.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.590
There were plenty of other gods as well.

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.400
Hel, the goddess of death,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.690
who only had half a face.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.109
Tyr, the god of warriors, whose

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.780
hand was bitten off by a giant wolf.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.470
Freya, the goddess of love and beauty,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.549
who rode a chariot pulled by cats.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.890
Nobody knows for certain how many gods

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.440
there were altogether, but some historians

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.370
think there were almost a hundred.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.200
Certainly too many for me to talk about

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.951
here, but I hope this has been a useful

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:08.541
overview of some of the main characters.

00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:11.141
Perhaps you can already see some

00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.231
similarities in gods in other

00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:15.821
mythological stories, or some more

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:18.341
modern characters who bear a striking

00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:21.481
resemblance to these ancient, Norse, gods.

00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.111
So, how about where they actually lived?

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.151
The Greek and Roman Gods famously

00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:30.461
lived on Mount Olympus, which is,

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:32.451
in fact, a real mountain - it’s

00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:34.241
the highest mountain in Greece.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.221
In Norse mythology, the Gods lived

00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:40.331
in a different world altogether.

00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:43.591
It was called Asgard, and it

00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:45.241
was a beautiful place full of

00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:47.401
extravagant palaces where the

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.731
gods would spend their time.

00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:51.171
Alongside Asgard, there

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:52.951
were eight other worlds.

00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:55.651
One of these worlds was Midgard,

00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.991
the home of human beings, the

00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.331
world that you and I live in.

00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:02.091
And the world the Vikings

00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:02.951
lived in, of course.

00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:06.661
Another world was called Jotunheim, and

00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:09.641
it was home to evil, powerful giants.

00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:13.181
As well as Asgard, Midgard and

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.861
Jotunheim, the vikings also believed

00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.111
in a place called Alfheim, which

00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.701
was a world full of elves, and

00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:23.781
Nidavellir, a world full of dwarves.

00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:26.071
Now, perhaps you think this all

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.471
sounds wonderful and you have decided

00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:30.031
that you are going to convert and

00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:32.451
become a believer in Norse mythology.

00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:33.951
Perhaps you think it

00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:35.971
sounds somewhat strange.

00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:37.371
Interesting, but not

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:39.061
particularly believable.

00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:43.171
In any case, there are only a few thousand

00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:46.731
people in the entire world today who still

00:08:46.741 --> 00:08:49.551
worship the Norse gods, or believe in the

00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:51.971
theory of the Nine Worlds, as it's called.

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.131
It’s no longer a popular religion

00:08:55.131 --> 00:08:57.741
by any means, so what went wrong?

00:08:58.451 --> 00:09:01.451
Well, for this we have to thank,

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:03.941
or blame perhaps, Christianity.

00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.291
As the Vikings started to raid Britain,

00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:09.971
they came into contact with Christianity,

00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:12.811
which was the dominant religion in Britain

00:09:12.951 --> 00:09:14.868
by the time of the Vikings’ arrival.

00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:17.758
Historians believe that there are

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:20.048
several possible reasons that the

00:09:20.048 --> 00:09:23.108
Vikings embraced Christianity so quickly.

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:25.738
Perhaps it could have been to do with

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:27.818
the fact that the Christian ideals

00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:30.908
of love and acceptance, of going to

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:33.178
heaven and not having to constantly

00:09:33.178 --> 00:09:35.558
fight people in bloody battles, that

00:09:35.778 --> 00:09:38.458
this was alluring, it was attractive.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.608
Perhaps it was due to the fact that the

00:09:41.608 --> 00:09:45.068
Vikings wanted to assimilate, to blend

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:47.928
in, with the native, Christian population.

00:09:48.768 --> 00:09:50.948
Perhaps it was after pressure

00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:52.928
from Germans to the south.

00:09:53.668 --> 00:09:55.298
Perhaps it was because they already

00:09:55.298 --> 00:09:57.638
had a hundred or so gods, and they

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.628
figured that adding another one to

00:09:59.628 --> 00:10:01.908
believe in wouldn’t be such a big deal.

00:10:03.508 --> 00:10:06.248
Whatever the true reason, or whatever

00:10:06.248 --> 00:10:09.278
the mix of reasons, relatively soon

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.208
after the Viking raids started,

00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:14.058
the Vikings increasingly started

00:10:14.058 --> 00:10:17.138
to worship a blend, a mixture, of

00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:19.278
Christianity and Norse Mythology.

00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:22.508
Even when the first Christian churches

00:10:22.508 --> 00:10:24.778
were built in Scandinavia, there were

00:10:24.788 --> 00:10:28.148
often Norse gods and creatures carved

00:10:28.168 --> 00:10:30.678
into the wood alongside the pictures of

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.878
Jesus and the cross, and archaeologists

00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:36.788
have also found gravestones with

00:10:36.788 --> 00:10:39.238
the cross of Jesus on one half, and

00:10:39.248 --> 00:10:41.998
the hammer of Thor on the other.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.148
And with time, Norse mythology

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:49.248
eventually faded away almost entirely,

00:10:49.368 --> 00:10:51.878
with Christianity taking its place.

00:10:52.748 --> 00:10:55.348
By the fourteenth century, Jesus was

00:10:55.348 --> 00:10:58.208
the dominant force in Scandinavia, and

00:10:58.388 --> 00:11:01.098
the viking gods never really recovered.

00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:05.008
This being said, while belief

00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:07.398
in Norse gods has now all but

00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:09.418
disappeared, their legacy and

00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:11.588
influence is everywhere we look.

00:11:12.378 --> 00:11:14.938
The English language, for example, is

00:11:14.938 --> 00:11:18.018
dotted with references to Norse gods.

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.478
The days of the week are the

00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:22.138
most obvious example of this.

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:25.458
“ Tuesday” is named after Tyr, the

00:11:25.578 --> 00:11:27.488
god of warriors, the one whose hand

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:29.068
was bitten off by a giant wolf.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:32.038
It literally means the Day of Tyr.

00:11:33.028 --> 00:11:34.958
And it isn’t the only example.

00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:37.808
“Wednesday” is named after Odin,

00:11:38.108 --> 00:11:40.188
who was also known as Wodin.

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.388
“Thursday”, of course,

00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:44.028
is named after Thor.

00:11:44.478 --> 00:11:45.608
And finally we have

00:11:45.818 --> 00:11:47.748
Friday, named after Frigg.

00:11:48.768 --> 00:11:51.098
The other days of the week, as you

00:11:51.098 --> 00:11:53.268
may know, have different origins:

00:11:53.498 --> 00:11:55.418
“Monday” is named after the moon,

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:57.598
“Sunday” is named after the sun, and

00:11:57.778 --> 00:12:00.148
“Saturday” is named after Saturn.

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.838
But the Norse gods still gave their names

00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:06.268
to more than half of the English days

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:08.318
of the week, which is pretty impressive

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:10.838
for a belief system that all but died

00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:13.368
out in Britain over 1,000 years ago.

00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:16.108
And it’s not the only

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:17.718
influence on English.

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:19.938
We can see the influence of Norse

00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:22.438
mythology in English place names too.

00:12:23.398 --> 00:12:26.038
In Britain, there are 39 places

00:12:26.198 --> 00:12:29.058
which are named after Odin, or Wodin.

00:12:29.858 --> 00:12:32.338
Places like Wanstead, Wanston and

00:12:32.468 --> 00:12:34.828
Wambrook are all references to the

00:12:34.848 --> 00:12:37.398
old Norse god, even though if you went

00:12:37.398 --> 00:12:39.468
and asked someone on the street there,

00:12:39.478 --> 00:12:42.108
I imagine most wouldn’t realise it.

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:44.928
And what about the names of people?

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:46.788
Well, unless you live in

00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:48.758
Scandinavia, you probably don’t

00:12:48.758 --> 00:12:51.448
know anyone called Odin or Thor.

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.188
But do you know anyone called Freya?

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:57.348
The goddess with a chariot pulled by cats?

00:12:58.098 --> 00:13:00.268
For the past few years, “Freya”

00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:02.288
has been one of the top twenty

00:13:02.288 --> 00:13:04.248
baby names for girls in England.

00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:07.128
I know plenty of Freyas, and it’s

00:13:07.128 --> 00:13:09.078
becoming more and more popular in

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.798
non-English speaking countries too.

00:13:11.728 --> 00:13:14.008
And these are just a few of the

00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:15.878
references to Norse mythology

00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:17.128
in the English language.

00:13:17.768 --> 00:13:20.208
Most people don’t even realise they’re

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:22.398
doing it, but there’s a good chance that

00:13:22.398 --> 00:13:25.418
an English speaker unwittingly mentions

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:28.238
a Norse god at least once every day.

00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:31.098
We can also see its influence

00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:33.198
very strongly in stories.

00:13:33.628 --> 00:13:35.928
This ancient religion has inspired

00:13:35.928 --> 00:13:37.408
some of the most successful

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:39.888
books and films ever made.

00:13:40.508 --> 00:13:41.958
If you look at a list of the

00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:44.008
bestselling books of all time,

00:13:44.168 --> 00:13:46.788
you’ll find JRR Tolkein’s The

00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:48.448
Lord of the Rings at number three.

00:13:48.948 --> 00:13:52.288
It has sold over 150 million copies

00:13:52.518 --> 00:13:56.478
since it was published in 1954.

00:13:56.478 --> 00:13:57.658
Perhaps you bought one of them,

00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.078
and if you didn't, you may well

00:14:00.078 --> 00:14:01.478
have watched the films instead.

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:05.288
If you know the story, either by reading

00:14:05.288 --> 00:14:07.398
the book or watching the films, you

00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:09.798
may well have noticed some similarities

00:14:09.818 --> 00:14:12.288
between the characters in Tolkein’s books

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:15.058
and some of the gods I described earlier.

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:17.818
Tolkein was incredibly

00:14:17.928 --> 00:14:20.008
interested in Norse mythology.

00:14:20.468 --> 00:14:22.568
He started a group called The

00:14:22.568 --> 00:14:24.598
Viking Club, where he would study

00:14:24.618 --> 00:14:26.398
Norse mythology with his friends.

00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:29.118
And these Norse influences

00:14:29.388 --> 00:14:31.418
are everywhere in his writing.

00:14:32.648 --> 00:14:34.838
Remember, in Norse mythology there

00:14:34.838 --> 00:14:37.588
are different races: gods, humans,

00:14:37.748 --> 00:14:40.448
giants, elves, trolls and dwarves.

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.038
In Norse mythology, the dwarves lived

00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:46.338
in mountains and deep underground.

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.398
They were famous for their

00:14:48.568 --> 00:14:49.968
mining and metalwork.

00:14:50.468 --> 00:14:52.998
In Norse mythology, the elves had

00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:55.968
magical powers and supernatural beauty.

00:14:56.718 --> 00:14:59.118
In Norse mythology, there was Odin,

00:14:59.168 --> 00:15:01.308
the wise old man with the beard.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.898
If you have read any Tolkein, and you know

00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:06.828
the story of Lord of the Rings, you will

00:15:06.828 --> 00:15:09.408
be able to clearly see the links between

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.298
Tolkein’s world and the real, or at

00:15:12.298 --> 00:15:15.228
least believed, world of Norse mythology.

00:15:16.058 --> 00:15:17.788
And this is also true for

00:15:17.788 --> 00:15:19.218
hundreds of other books.

00:15:19.558 --> 00:15:21.738
Norse mythology’s magical races

00:15:21.918 --> 00:15:24.168
have inspired so many authors,

00:15:24.348 --> 00:15:26.708
including another of the best-selling

00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:28.328
writers of all time, one that

00:15:28.498 --> 00:15:31.243
came a little later: JK Rowling.

00:15:31.808 --> 00:15:34.198
If you’ve read Harry Potter, or

00:15:34.348 --> 00:15:35.938
you've seen the movies, you’ll

00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:37.668
remember that there are elves

00:15:37.668 --> 00:15:39.998
and giants, and a wise old man.

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:43.238
Rowling even named one of her characters,

00:15:43.378 --> 00:15:46.558
an evil werewolf, Fenrir Greyback.

00:15:47.538 --> 00:15:49.778
If you think back to the wolf I mentioned

00:15:49.868 --> 00:15:52.758
earlier, the one who bit off Tyr’s hand.

00:15:53.198 --> 00:15:55.948
That wolf was also called Fenrir.

00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:59.498
So, these influences are everywhere

00:15:59.598 --> 00:16:01.008
if you look carefully enough.

00:16:01.938 --> 00:16:04.088
And in some cases, you don’t even

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:05.838
have to look carefully at all.

00:16:06.628 --> 00:16:08.698
If you are a fan of Marvel,

00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:10.438
you’ll know that two of the main

00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:12.928
characters are Thor and Loki.

00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:16.058
Just like the Thor in Norse mythology,

00:16:16.368 --> 00:16:19.108
the Thor in the Marvel movies is the god

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:22.048
of thunder, with a magical hammer which

00:16:22.108 --> 00:16:24.478
returns to his hand after he throws it.

00:16:25.338 --> 00:16:28.088
His father is Odin, his mother is Frigg,

00:16:28.318 --> 00:16:30.728
and he comes from a world called Asgard.

00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:34.498
And as for Loki, he’s the son of a

00:16:34.498 --> 00:16:36.958
giant, who sometimes works on Thor’s

00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.578
side, and at other times betrays him.

00:16:40.038 --> 00:16:42.348
It’s pretty much the same story,

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:44.548
with a 21st century twist!

00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:48.148
And now, before we finish, we just

00:16:48.148 --> 00:16:50.268
have time for another interesting

00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:52.348
fact about the impact of the

00:16:52.348 --> 00:16:54.108
vikings on the modern world.

00:16:54.628 --> 00:16:57.568
And this is a legacy that you may well

00:16:57.578 --> 00:17:00.898
be using at this very moment, if you are

00:17:00.898 --> 00:17:02.868
listening to this with headphones without

00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:05.848
wires, on AirPods or something like that.

00:17:06.638 --> 00:17:08.088
I’m talking about Bluetooth,

00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:10.258
the wireless technology.

00:17:11.268 --> 00:17:13.483
Bluetooth was named after a

00:17:13.483 --> 00:17:15.697
Viking king, Harald Bluetooth.

00:17:16.127 --> 00:17:18.207
He was the King of Denmark at the end

00:17:18.397 --> 00:17:20.657
of the 10th century, and he wasn’t

00:17:20.697 --> 00:17:22.907
particularly good at brushing his teeth.

00:17:23.817 --> 00:17:26.317
One tooth got so rotten

00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:27.597
that it turned blue.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.997
That’s where this nickname comes from.

00:17:30.607 --> 00:17:33.787
So, why name this technology after

00:17:33.787 --> 00:17:35.907
this dentist-hating Danish king?

00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.327
Well, Harald Bluetooth was famous

00:17:39.337 --> 00:17:41.957
for connecting Denmark and Norway

00:17:41.957 --> 00:17:44.517
into one kingdom, just like Bluetooth

00:17:44.547 --> 00:17:47.877
technology connects phones to computers

00:17:47.907 --> 00:17:49.607
or headphones or things like that.

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:52.987
If you are listening to this episode via

00:17:52.987 --> 00:17:55.567
Bluetooth, or you have a Bluetooth-enabled

00:17:55.567 --> 00:17:57.897
phone or computer nearby, take a

00:17:57.897 --> 00:18:00.417
look at the Bluetooth logo now.

00:18:01.337 --> 00:18:03.847
It looks a bit like two triangles

00:18:03.897 --> 00:18:05.857
with lines sticking out of the

00:18:05.857 --> 00:18:07.817
left, or maybe you think it

00:18:07.817 --> 00:18:10.057
looks a bit like the letter “B”.

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:13.727
The Bluetooth logo is actually a

00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:17.257
pair of viking runes, or Old Norse

00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:19.917
symbols - Hagall and Bjarkan.

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:21.927
H and B, if you were to

00:18:22.147 --> 00:18:23.417
convert them to English.

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:26.807
These letters were Harald Bluetooth’s

00:18:26.837 --> 00:18:29.357
initials, his initials now forever

00:18:29.357 --> 00:18:32.217
embedded on a technology used by billions

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:34.627
of people around the world every day.

00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:38.177
So, next time you turn on your Bluetooth,

00:18:38.337 --> 00:18:41.447
you meet a lady called Freya, or you need

00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:43.937
to arrange anything for a weekday except

00:18:43.967 --> 00:18:46.697
Monday, just remember that the remnants of

00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:49.227
Norse mythology are everywhere around us.

00:18:49.947 --> 00:18:52.097
And if this story has really

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:54.267
captured you, I’m glad to hear it.

00:18:54.727 --> 00:18:56.837
Maybe even next Wednesday, or

00:18:56.837 --> 00:19:00.037
Wodin’s Day, you’ll decide to spare a

00:19:00.047 --> 00:19:02.787
thought for that wise, one-eyed god,

00:19:03.117 --> 00:19:05.487
Wodin, and his eight-legged horse.

00:19:07.797 --> 00:19:10.317
Ok then, that is it for today's

00:19:10.337 --> 00:19:12.337
episode on Norse mythology.

00:19:12.687 --> 00:19:14.027
Now that you know what you’re looking

00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:16.297
for, hopefully you’ll be able to spot the

00:19:16.297 --> 00:19:18.557
influence of the vikings and their ancient

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.667
gods in all kinds of unexpected places.

00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:24.847
As always, I would love to know

00:19:24.847 --> 00:19:26.227
what you thought about this episode.

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:28.787
Which one of the Norse gods did

00:19:28.787 --> 00:19:29.917
you find the most interesting?

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:31.437
Can you think of any other

00:19:31.697 --> 00:19:33.837
books or films which have been

00:19:33.957 --> 00:19:35.577
influenced by Norse mythology?

00:19:36.064 --> 00:19:38.124
How do you think the vikings would feel

00:19:38.254 --> 00:19:40.464
to know the impact that their religion

00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:42.664
and culture has on the modern world?

00:19:43.314 --> 00:19:45.144
I would love to know, so let’s

00:19:45.154 --> 00:19:46.564
get this discussion started.

00:19:46.844 --> 00:19:47.804
You can head right into our

00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:49.574

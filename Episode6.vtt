Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:14.031
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be looking at a Russian oligarchs.

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.781
Specifically, how did they get so incredibly rich?

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:26.623
At the end of the Soviet Union there were 150 million people living in Russia all, in theory at

00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:30.955
least, equal as private property had largely been abolished.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:41.258
Within a few years, 22 individuals ended up owning 39% of the entire economy with a large part of

00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:43.688
the rest of the population living in poverty.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.563
Today, we are going to be looking at how that happened.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.380
But before we get right into it, I just want to remind those of you listening to this podcast on

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.488
Spotify, Apple Podcasts or whatever other podcasts that you might be listening to it on that you can

00:00:59.488 --> 00:01:04.908
get a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which is

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:06.128
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:12.683
The website is also full of loads of helpful tips, tricks, and guides about learning English with

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:13.453
podcasts.

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:17.743
So if you haven't checked that out, it's well worth doing so, if I may say so myself.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.395
If you're already listening to this on the website, then congratulations.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:24.375
You're one step ahead of the game already.

00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:27.592
Okay, so oligarchs.

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:30.695
The word oligarchy comes from the Greek.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:35.130
Oligoi means few, and arkhein means to rule.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:41.755
So it means the rule of a few, and an oligarch, well, an oligarch is one of the few who rule.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:49.385
When we talk about a Russian oligarchs, we're talking about the men, and I'm afraid it is almost

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:56.429
exclusively men who managed to achieve vast wealth after the fall of the Soviet union in 1991.

00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:04.466
Names you may be familiar with include Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky, Friedman or the owner of Chelsea

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:06.596
football club, Roman Abramovich.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:13.959
To properly understand how the oligarchs managed to amass such riches, it's important to understand

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.429
a bit, not just about Russia, but also the world in 1991.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.200
The Soviet Union or the USSR was formed in 1922.

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:31.476
For almost 70 years it has existed as a socialist republic and in the postwar period it had been

00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:38.606
pretty economically stagnant while much of neighbouring Western Europe and arch rival the US had

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.696
been enjoying the economic spoils of capitalism.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:49.132
In 1991 Russia was still a very poor country, or rather, Russians were very poor.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.799
GDP per capita was three and a half thousand dollars, about a seventh of that of America.

00:02:56.655 --> 00:03:02.372
When the USSR collapsed, Russia wanted some of that economic growth that the West had been enjoying.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:08.175
However, private ownership as a concept didn't exist in the same way.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:13.361
Everything from schools to shops to the factories you worked in.

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.901
Everything was owned by the state.

00:03:17.103 --> 00:03:23.453
Although some privatisation initiatives had been launched by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s it

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:29.050
wasn't until the early 1990s that the real push towards privatisation began.

00:03:30.448 --> 00:03:36.645
As everything had historically been owned by the Russian state, the state had to figure out a way to

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:41.935
transfer ownership from itself directly to the people.

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:50.634
In theory, the aim for this was to be as equitable, as equal, as possible, but in practice it was

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:51.654
far from it.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.390
They didn't want to sell the state assets to the highest bidder as they feared that this would lead

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.660
to ownership being concentrated among the Russian mafia and bureaucrats.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.790
So they had to figure out a way of transferring ownership away from the state in a way that gave it

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.420
directly to the Russian people.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.292
Although they went about this in a number of ways, one of the most interesting, and one of the ways

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:23.742
in which the oligarchs managed to get so much power in such a short period was through something

00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:25.232
called the voucher system.

00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:28.907
The system was actually pretty simple.

00:04:29.357 --> 00:04:36.605
To transfer assets from the state to the people, the Russian government gave a voucher to every man,

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:37.775
woman, and child.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:45.974
These vouchers formed 30% of the state owned enterprises in Russia, of the state businesses in

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:46.254
Russia.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:52.946
The idea here was that the Russian state was passing ownership back to the people.

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:58.976
Ultimately the state belonged to the people, and this was a way of formalising the transfer of

00:04:58.976 --> 00:04:59.386
ownership.

00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:07.141
The vouchers had a nominal price of around $20 and there were 150 million of them.

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:14.754
If you're doing the maths, this means that there were a total of $3 billion worth of vouchers for

00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:21.364
almost a third of the Russian economy making the entire Russian economy worth $10 billion.

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.839
For a country that now has an economy of one and a half trillion dollars, and with a quarter of the

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:34.819
world's natural gas reserves and 10% of the world's oil, that's quite a bargain price.

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:41.881
As most normal russians didn't have any real understanding of how share ownership worked, it wasn't

00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:45.121
really clear that they could do anything with these vouchers.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:52.235
And they had more pressing concerns, like having enough food and drink, and a huge number of these

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:57.775
vouchers were sold off to other enterprising Russians who would typically then sell them off for a

00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:58.505
small profit.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:05.742
Ultimately, these shares from the voucher scheme ended up in the hands of a small group of investors

00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:12.101
and powerful individuals, who managed to get ownership of 30% of the Russian economy and paid

00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:15.171
significantly less than what the assets were actually worth.

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:20.791
It's exactly the opposite of what was intended, at least in theory by the Russian state.

00:06:22.128 --> 00:06:23.908
That wasn't the only way though.

00:06:24.348 --> 00:06:30.318
By the time this had happened, a small group of men had managed to amass a large amount of wealth,

00:06:30.618 --> 00:06:34.468
through a series of what some might call ingenious schemes.

00:06:34.778 --> 00:06:39.208
Others might call well, somewhere between scheming and plain theft.

00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:46.263
As we know, Russia was transitioning from a centrally planned and state run economy to a market

00:06:46.263 --> 00:06:46.713
economy.

00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:54.975
Very few people in Russia had any idea of how to do this, and there were many, many loopholes that

00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:57.625
were exploited by enterprising Russians.

00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:05.221
Khodorkovsky, for example, one of the most famous oligarchs and one who ended up getting on the

00:07:05.221 --> 00:07:12.024
wrong side of Vladimir Putin, managed to set up his own bank after having found a loophole in

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:15.727
factory subsidies, and he amassed a pile of cash.

00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:19.115
As one of the only private banks in Russia.

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:26.060
He managed to get vast amounts of money from the Russian state, with which he would then speculate

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.290
on the currency markets and make a sizable profit from.

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.941
Others had managed to make millions through arbitraging the cost of Russian goods.

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:42.762
That means they would buy something that was cheap in Russia and cheap, typically because it was

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:48.252
subsidised by the state, and then sell it on the world markets where it could command a much higher

00:07:48.252 --> 00:07:48.642
price.

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:57.035
By the mid 1990s there were around two dozen incredibly wealthy oligarchs in Russia, a group of whom

00:07:57.285 --> 00:07:59.525
controlled practically all of the media.

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:07.709
At the same time the president Boris Yeltsin was deeply unpopular with the Russian people and

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:11.369
heading for defeat in the presidential elections of 1996.

00:08:12.423 --> 00:08:19.403
Yeltsin's challenger was a man called Gennady Zyuganov, who ran on an anti-oligarch pro-communist

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:19.923
message.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.528
The oligarchs stood to lose everything.

00:08:24.158 --> 00:08:31.028
And so the powerful men controlling the media threw all of their weight behind Yeltsin, and he came

00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:32.598
back to win a second term.

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:39.325
The agreement between Yeltsin and the oligarchs, according to many commentators, was, give me a

00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:44.055
second term and you'll get free rein to do whatever you want.

00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:53.231
Indeed, by the year 2000 a group of seven bankers known in Russia is semibankirskina controlled

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:58.671
anything from 50 to 70% of all Russian financial activity.

00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:06.486
But how did they amass such incredible wealth and how did their wealth continued to grow in the

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:08.176
latter half of the 1990s?

00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:15.372
Well, yes, they had managed to get control of cut-price Russian assets partly through the voucher

00:09:15.372 --> 00:09:18.489
scheme, but there are two more ways that we're going to cover today.

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:24.319
Firstly, something called investment tenders.

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:31.749
Even after the voucher scheme, the government left 20% of every state company still owned by the

00:09:31.749 --> 00:09:32.179
state.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:40.780
By the mid 1990s they were so anxious to continue the sell-off of state assets they would sell the

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.610
remaining 20% to anyone who promised to invest in the company.

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:51.580
As we know, a large proportion of the state owned enterprises were very unproductive.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.700
They were just really bad, inefficient companies, and they needed a large amount of investment to

00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:01.152
allow them to compete in a market economy.

00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:07.625
The Russian state was just desperate for someone to come along and fix these useless companies.

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:12.225
And so in many cases, a promise of investment was enough to get the deal.

00:10:13.526 --> 00:10:19.016
So this meant that a load of these companies were snapped up at rock bottom prices and have since

00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:22.426
been turned around and many a hugely valuable.

00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:29.131
The final way in which they acquired their loot was through something called the loans for shares

00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:29.751
scheme.

00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:36.111
It was definitely the most scandalous of the ways in which the oligarchs became so wealthy.

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:44.116
How this worked was that the banks run by the oligarchs we're charged with auctioning off some of

00:10:44.116 --> 00:10:49.976
Russia's largest state companies from steel manufacturers to oil and gas companies.

00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:56.732
The bankers rigged the auctions, meaning that in many cases they were also participating in the

00:10:56.732 --> 00:11:02.763
auction, so they were the auctioneer and the participant, and they could just pick themselves as the

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:03.083
winner.

00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:10.303
Evidently, if you are choosing yourself to be the winner of an auction, you want to pay as little

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:13.833
money as possible, and this is exactly what happened.

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:22.447
Khodorkovsky for example, received a stake in the oil and gas company Yukos for $310 million.

00:11:23.227 --> 00:11:28.697
Right, that might sound a lot of money to me or you, but that stake was actually worth $5 billion.

00:11:29.587 --> 00:11:30.237
Quite a bargain.

00:11:30.347 --> 00:11:30.607
Right?

00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:38.836
Unsurprisingly, this made the oligarchs incredibly unpopular with the regular non-oligarch Russian

00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:39.546
population.

00:11:40.046 --> 00:11:44.896
You know, the 99.99999% of the population.

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:51.127
The discounts that these oligarchs got on the state assets didn't come from nowhere.

00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:57.357
It was money that should have gone into the Russian state, but instead, all of the profits flowed

00:11:57.357 --> 00:11:59.357
straight into the oligarchs pockets.

00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:06.454
Key to the oligarchs success, in case you hadn't already guessed, was relationships with government.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.650
Although the Russian state was weak, none of these favourable deals would have been possible without

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.470
close relationships with government officials.

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:19.709
So knowing who to speak to and when was absolutely everything.

00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:24.629
Then in the year 2000 along came Vladimir Putin.

00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:31.890
While Putin's reign has been excellent news for many of the oligarchs, several have found themselves

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.760
purged and unable to return to Russia, including Khodorkovsky.

00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:42.360
There are several theories which are uncorroborated of course, that deals were struck between Putin

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.600
and the oligarchs, whereby he promised that he wouldn't go after them in return for their support.

00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:55.831
There are also several theories that Putin asked for a lot more, and by a lot more, I mean a chunk

00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:56.401
of their wealth.

00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:59.601
However, that's a conversation for another day.

00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:04.461
So where does this leave the oligarchs in 2019?

00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:12.239
A large proportion of all the wealth of Russia is still concentrated in the hands of very few, with

00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:18.929
35% of all the wealth in Russia owned by only 110 individuals.

00:13:20.015 --> 00:13:25.998
Some of these individuals are still the same as those that amassed vast wealth in the 1990s in the

00:13:26.331 --> 00:13:28.841
wild west days of Soviet capitalism

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:39.708
Indeed, a research paper in 2018 suggested that there is more than three times as much money held by

00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:44.008
Russians outside of Russia is there is held in Russia.

00:13:45.238 --> 00:13:50.848
Just to underline on that final point, and given that this wealth will largely be held by the

00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:57.439
oligarch population, there is more than three times the amount of money held by Russians outside

00:13:57.439 --> 00:14:03.539
Russia, which isn't going back into the economy or helping regular Russians than there is in the

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:05.179
entire Russian economy.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:14.420
in July of 2019 the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin said, we do not have oligarchs in Russia

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.020
anymore.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.950
I think I'll let you be the judge of that.

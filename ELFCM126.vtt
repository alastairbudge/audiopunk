Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.011
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.571
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:28.951
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about chocolate, the delicious

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:34.311
sweet that is enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people around the world every single day.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:40.541
We’ll talk about where it first came from, how it used to be consumed, how

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:44.411
it developed into the version of chocolate that we know and love today,

00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:49.891
and we’ll also talk about the economics of chocolate, how it actually goes

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:55.131
from a little bean in an equatorial farm through to a bar in your hand.

00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:00.751
The request for this episode came from two members on the same day,

00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:04.611
actually, Pierluca, from Italy, and Jenneke, from the Netherlands.

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.141
So, Pierluca and Jenneke, thanks, I hope you enjoy this one.

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:14.191
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:19.651
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, that transcript and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:24.621
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:29.386
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:34.366
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:39.406
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:44.146
So if that is of interest, and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:48.496
wouldn't be, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:51.843
OK then, chocolate.

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:58.043
You know chocolate, you probably know something about chocolate, but you probably

00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:03.863
don’t know everything about the fascinating story of its journey from spiritual bean

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:09.783
to the bar that is the centrepiece of the 100 billion dollar chocolate industry today.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:16.993
As I guess you do know, chocolate comes from the cacao bean, a bean that is found inside a

00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:23.873
pod that grows on a tree called the Theobroma Cacao, a tree that is native to central America.

00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:31.923
If you go to Central America, find a Theobroma Cacao tree and cut down a load of cacao

00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:37.753
pods, you will be disappointed to find that they don’t seem very chocolatey at all.

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:46.833
If you open up the pod you’ll find a white, sticky pulp, and if you get to the cacao beans and

00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:52.533
put one in your mouth you will probably think you’ve made a mistake and arrived at the wrong tree.

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:58.623
A raw cacao bean is bitter, slightly different to very dark chocolate, but

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:02.643
completely different to the kind of chocolate that you’ll find in shops

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:06.543
all around the world today, and that millions of people enjoy eating.

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:12.523
Indeed, when cacao was first discovered, it wasn’t something that was eaten.

00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:14.473
It was drunk.

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:20.433
Now, there’s a little bit of debate about when cacao was first discovered.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:26.843
In a recent book, called The True History of Chocolate, which, if you are interested

00:03:26.843 --> 00:03:30.333
in finding out the True History of Chocolate sounds like the sort of book that you

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:36.633
should read, the authors suggest that chocolate goes back three or four thousand years.

00:03:37.473 --> 00:03:43.703
It certainly goes back to the indigenous Aztecs, who used to drink a sort of cacao broth.

00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:48.393
This wasn’t just raw cacao beans and water.

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:56.533
The beans would be separated from the cacao pods, then left outside for a week or so to ferment.

00:03:57.343 --> 00:04:01.483
They would then be cleaned and left to dry out in the sun

00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:05.543
for a couple of weeks, then roasted for another 1 to 2 hours.

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:14.553
The beans would then be crushed open, and the raw pieces inside could be ground down into a paste.

00:04:15.453 --> 00:04:20.413
And it was this paste that was then used as the base for the drink.

00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:26.133
Depending on how rich you were, you would drink it in different ways.

00:04:27.293 --> 00:04:33.673
For a cheap, normal day-to-day drink these roasted cacao beans would be mixed

00:04:33.703 --> 00:04:40.723
with maize, with corn, and spices, for a warm, refreshing and revitalising drink.

00:04:41.603 --> 00:04:45.833
But if money was no object, you wouldn’t bother with the added

00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:51.153
corn, instead you would add more pure cacao and extra spices.

00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:57.443
For the Aztecs, these cacao drinks were about more than just being tasty.

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:05.233
They viewed it as having spiritual and medicinal properties, they thought that it could cure

00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:11.513
those who drank it of illnesses such as fever and tiredness, and - somewhat surprisingly

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:16.323
when we think of the effects of chocolate today, they thought it could cure tooth decay.

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:19.313
They thought it could cure problems with your teeth.

00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:25.333
The Aztecs believed the bean was a gift from the gods, specifically

00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:30.513
a gift from a god called Quetzalcoatl, the god of wind and wisdom.

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:37.753
One ruler of the Aztecs, Montezuma II, reportedly believed so strongly

00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:43.003
in its beneficial properties that he would drink it 50 times a day.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:48.583
When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in the Americas they were initially

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:53.933
confused about this strange bean that the local people were so passionate about.

00:05:54.883 --> 00:06:00.263
The King of the Aztecs, Montezuma II, our 50 cups of chocolate a day

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:05.913
ruler, reportedly threw a banquet for Cortes and his men that included

00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:08.493
vast amounts of chocolate, or vast amounts of this cacao drink.

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:15.593
The Spaniards tasted the cacao drink, but weren’t convinced,

00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:20.833
with one even writing that it was a ‘bitter drink for pigs’.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:26.463
But Cortes saw that it was considered pretty special and, after he had

00:06:26.463 --> 00:06:30.983
taken Montezuma II prisoner, he took some cacao beans back to Spain.

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:37.073
So, this is the next step on chocolate’s journey, its arrival in Europe.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:43.603
Exactly when this precious bean first arrived on European shores is

00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:49.053
debated, but it’s likely some time at the start of the 16th century.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.820
But for the majority of the 16th century, it was confined

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.710
to Spain, it didn’t really spread much further afield.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.700
It was consumed in a similar way to the Aztecs, as a drink,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.000
but it was very much a preserve of the wealthiest in society.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.080
These beans were in scarce supply, they had to be

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.350
shipped over from the Americas, and it was a real luxury.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.840
By the start of the 17th century this cacao drink had spread to France.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:31.010
In 1615, when King Louis XIII of France married the daughter of King Phillip

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.500
III of Spain, the daughter, Anne, brought cacao to celebrate the marriage.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.780
Chocolate, or rather cacao, was still in its liquid

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.760
form, a cacao drink, but it was starting to take off.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.680
It had spread to Britain, and European countries with colonial empires

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.750
started to set up their own cacao plantations in equatorial countries.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.070
Cacao requires very specific conditions to grow.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.400
It can only grow in environments with very high humidity, the trees require a lot of

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:14.650
shade, and if the temperature drops below about 18 degrees Celsius the plants will die.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:20.170
So, you simply can’t grow it in Europe in natural conditions, but

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.700
that didn’t stop Europeans from developing quite the taste for it.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.910
In wealthy circles in Europe it was considered a

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.910
fashionable, healthy drink, full of beneficial properties.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.040
It was believed to be good for your health, and was also considered

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.490
to be an aphrodisiac, a substance that increases sexual desire.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:51.380
Indeed, Casanova, perhaps the most famous European womaniser, was reportedly a huge fan of cacao.

00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:56.919
But these Europeans were still drinking cacao, not eating it.

00:08:57.939 --> 00:09:05.359
What you and I know as chocolate wasn’t to come until 1828, and was to be invented by a man

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:10.849
from a country that you might not traditionally associate with chocolate - The Netherlands.

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:16.779
In 1828 a chemist from Amsterdam, called Coenraad Johannes

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:20.339
van Houten, invented a way to make powdered chocolate.

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:25.479
He invented a press that could separate about half the

00:09:25.479 --> 00:09:28.879
natural fat in the bit in the middle of the cacao bean.

00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:35.669
This left a sort of cacao powder, which could either be used for drinking

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:41.979
or could be mixed again with the cacao butter or sugar to create a solid

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:46.979
version, something similar to what we would now know as a chocolate bar.

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:55.039
Van Houten patented his machine, he protected his invention so only he could separate the fat

00:09:55.069 --> 00:10:02.149
from the cacao bean in this way, but the patent only lasted for 7 years, expiring in 1835.

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:08.409
The century following this can be described as the golden age of

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:12.699
chocolate, and many of the chocolates that you and I probably enjoy

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:18.179
today were invented in this period, from the 1830s to the 1930s.

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:25.379
The first chocolate bar was made in 1847 by a company called Fry’s in England.

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:32.999
Then in 1875 a Swiss chocolatier called Daniel Peter had the bright idea

00:10:33.229 --> 00:10:37.789
of adding milk to chocolate to create, you guessed it, milk chocolate.

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:45.023
And four years later, in 1879, another Swiss chocolatier, a man called

00:10:45.023 --> 00:10:50.399
Rodolphe Lindt invented something called conching, which is a process

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:55.669
that changes the chocolate from a powdery state to more of a liquidy one.

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:00.339
And, makes the flavour more evenly distributed and more delicious.

00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:06.559
With the industrialisation of the production of chocolate, and a reduction in

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:11.279
the cost of bringing the cacao beans over from the Americas, what was previously

00:11:11.289 --> 00:11:16.439
something just for the wealthiest became a lot more affordable to people in Europe.

00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:22.129
The arrival of the chocolate bar came at almost the perfect time.

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:26.289
Firstly, the European workforce was changing.

00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:30.659
People were starting to work away from their homes,

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:34.619
people were commuting, and needing to eat ‘on the go’.

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:37.819
Chocolate was an ideal snack.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:42.909
It was tasty, it filled you up, it didn’t need to be cooked or heated,

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:46.709
you didn’t need to get your hands dirty, and it was affordable.

00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:48.059
It was perfect.

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:54.929
And at the start of the 20th century it was also the beginning of the advertising boom.

00:11:55.789 --> 00:12:01.119
Chocolate was a perfect product to be put on billboards, on posters around cities,

00:12:01.229 --> 00:12:06.429
to be advertised in magazines and newspapers, and of course later on, on TV.

00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:13.809
It was a product that anyone could enjoy, man or woman, young or old, and given that it

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:20.329
was now mass produced, it was cheap and therefore enjoyed by millions of people every day.

00:12:21.429 --> 00:12:27.679
Now, the flip side of this affordability is how chocolate was and is produced.

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:33.919
If we go back to the early days of cacao, the beans were frequently

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:38.869
produced by slave labour, by people working in horrendous conditions

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:43.569
while the European rich enjoyed their delicious chocolatey beverages.

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:52.476
And even now, despite the fact that it’s the world’s favourite sweet snack by a country mile, cacao

00:12:52.476 --> 00:12:58.316
farmers , the people who actually produce the chocolate are some of the poorest people in the world.

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:03.896
Farming cacao, farming chocolate, is difficult, tough work.

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:10.246
Each cacao pod produces about 30 to 40 beans, and it

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.219
takes around 80 beans to make 100 grammes of chocolate.

00:13:12.219 --> 00:13:20.436
So, depending on the size and purity of the chocolate bar, it can

00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:25.986
take anywhere from 2 to 5 entire pods to make your chocolate bar.

00:13:27.286 --> 00:13:32.916
And one worker can separate the beans from about 2,000 pods per day.

00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:37.496
So, if you do the maths, a worker can separate enough

00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:41.896
beans to make anywhere from 400 to 1,000 bars of chocolate.

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:45.466
And that’s just the separation stage.

00:13:46.036 --> 00:13:51.366
So if you think of all the other costs involved in the other stages, and remember that you

00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:57.376
can buy a chocolate bar from your local supermarket for really not very much money at all, you

00:13:57.376 --> 00:14:02.936
realise that these people are evidently not getting much of the final price that you are paying.

00:14:03.846 --> 00:14:08.986
Related to this is the question of who else is involved in the process of getting a

00:14:08.986 --> 00:14:15.726
cacao bean from a tree near the Equator through to your hand, ready to be scoffed down.

00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:24.476
Cacao, like most commodities, such as coffee or sugar, is often bought and sold by trading houses,

00:14:24.746 --> 00:14:31.506
companies that will buy up large quantities of cacao in order to sell it on to chocolate companies.

00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:39.096
The price of cacao goes up and down a lot based on its supply, based on how much of it there is.

00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:43.706
If there is a lot of cacao on the market, the price tends to go

00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:47.836
down, and if there isn’t enough cacao available, the price goes up.

00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:55.056
But you and I, as consumers of chocolate, as people who eat chocolate, we don’t really see this.

00:14:55.606 --> 00:15:01.186
We don’t go to a shop one day and find that a chocolate bar is 50 cents and

00:15:01.186 --> 00:15:06.436
then come back the next week to see it’s at 80, then the week after it’s at 30.

00:15:07.298 --> 00:15:12.108
One of the reasons for this is because there is a whole industry of people

00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:17.138
buying and selling things called chocolate ‘futures’, or cacao futures.

00:15:18.248 --> 00:15:23.258
You can think of these as a contract to buy something at a fixed price

00:15:23.288 --> 00:15:28.298
in the future, no matter what the actual market price at that time is.

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:33.426
To give you an example, if the price of cacao now is $3,000 a

00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:40.431
tonne, a cacao farmer can sell a tonne of cacao now for $3,000.

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:45.796
Or, someone could go to the farmer and say “I’ll buy a

00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:50.096
tonne of cacao from you for $3,000 in 6 months time”.

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:58.306
If they agree to do this, the farmer knows that they will have a buyer for their product for $3,000.

00:15:58.906 --> 00:16:05.376
And for the trader, they know that they can get this cacao in 6 months time for a fixed price.

00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:14.526
But if the price in 6 months time is higher, let’s say it's $3,500, the trader can pay the

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:22.086
arranged $3,000 price, and sell the cacao immediately on to someone else and take a $500 profit.

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:27.576
And this is what's happening all over the world, except of course

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:31.136
in much higher quantities than people buying a tonne at a time.

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:37.826
Indeed, a British commodities trader, a man called Anthony Ward once bought

00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:44.439
up contracts for 15% of the world’s cacao, 15% of all the cacao in the world,

00:16:45.159 --> 00:16:50.499
earning himself the nickname Chocfinger, after the Bond villain Goldfinger.

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:57.059
These traders make a profit from knowing what direction the price will go - they

00:16:57.229 --> 00:17:02.839
try to get as much information as possible on future harvests, whether there

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:07.519
will be the right amount of rain and so on, in order to make bets on the price.

00:17:08.469 --> 00:17:14.249
And most don’t ever actually come into contact with a single cacao bean - the contracts

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:19.359
are sold on to chocolate producers, who want to deal with traders who can sell

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:24.069
them hundreds or thousands of tonnes of cacao, rather than a few tonnes at a time.

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:31.739
And the great irony perhaps of chocolate is that, while it is such a common, affordable snack

00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:37.549
for most of us in the West, where we can never actually grow it, in the countries where cacao

00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:43.169
is actually grown, the farmers who grow it aren’t sitting around eating chocolate bars all

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:48.599
day, and they aren’t getting much of the economic benefits of the world’s hunger for chocolate.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:55.169
The top four chocolate producing countries in the world, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Ghana

00:17:55.169 --> 00:18:02.649
and Indonesia are in the bottom 50% when it comes to GDP per capita, when it comes to how

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:07.729
wealthy they are, and cacao farmers are some of the poorest people in these countries.

00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:13.209
And when it comes to the countries that actually eat the most chocolate, they

00:18:13.209 --> 00:18:18.049
are all in Europe, with Switzerland, one of the richest countries in the world,

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:24.239
coming in top at an average of 8.8kg of chocolate consumed per person per year.

00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:32.259
So, it is one of the peculiarities, and some might say an injustice, of the chocolate supply chain

00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:40.089
that the farmer who spends their life harvesting cacao beans in the sweltering midday sun rarely if

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:46.789
ever gets to taste a chocolate bar, and the trader who spends their life speculating on the price

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:53.839
of cacao beans in an office in New York or London rarely, if ever, actually sees a cacao bean.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:00.949
OK then, that is it for today's episode on chocolate.

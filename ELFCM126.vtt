Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.011
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.571
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:28.951
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about chocolate, the delicious

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:34.311
sweet that is enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people around the world every single day.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:40.541
We’ll talk about where it first came from, how it used to be consumed, how

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:44.411
it developed into the version of chocolate that we know and love today,

00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:49.891
and we’ll also talk about the economics of chocolate, how it actually goes

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:55.131
from a little bean in an equatorial farm through to a bar in your hand.

00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:00.751
The request for this episode came from two members on the same day,

00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:04.611
actually, Pierluca, from Italy, and Jenneke, from the Netherlands.

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.141
So, Pierluca and Jenneke, thanks, I hope you enjoy this one.

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:14.351
Before we get right into today’s episode I want to quickly remind you that you can get

so if that is of interest the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:53.501
OK then, chocolate.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:59.701
You know chocolate, you probably know something about chocolate, but you probably

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:05.521
don’t know everything about the fascinating story of its journey from spiritual bean

00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:11.441
to the bar that is the centrepiece of the 100 billion dollar chocolate industry today.

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:18.651
As I guess you do know, chocolate comes from the cacao bean, a bean that is found inside a

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:25.531
pod that grows on a tree called the Theobroma Cacao, a tree that is native to central America.

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:33.581
If you go to Central America, find a Theobroma Cacao tree and cut down a load of cacao

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:39.411
pods, you will be disappointed to find that they don’t seem very chocolatey at all.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:48.491
If you open up the pod you’ll find a white, sticky pulp, and if you get to the cacao beans and

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:54.191
put one in your mouth you will probably think you’ve made a mistake and arrived at the wrong tree.

00:02:55.211 --> 00:03:00.281
A raw cacao bean is bitter, slightly different to very dark chocolate, but

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:04.301
completely different to the kind of chocolate that you’ll find in shops

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:08.201
all around the world today, and that millions of people enjoy eating.

00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:14.181
Indeed, when cacao was first discovered, it wasn’t something that was eaten.

00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:16.131
It was drunk.

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:22.091
Now, there’s a little bit of debate about when cacao was first discovered.

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:28.501
In a recent book, called The True History of Chocolate, which, if you are interested

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:31.991
in finding out the True History of Chocolate sounds like the sort of book that you

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:38.291
should read, the authors suggest that chocolate goes back three or four thousand years.

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:45.361
It certainly goes back to the indigenous Aztecs, who used to drink a sort of cacao broth.

00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:50.051
This wasn’t just raw cacao beans and water.

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:58.191
The beans would be separated from the cacao pods, then left outside for a week or so to ferment.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:03.141
They would then be cleaned and left to dry out in the sun

00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:07.201
for a couple of weeks, then roasted for another 1 to 2 hours.

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:16.211
The beans would then be crushed open, and the raw pieces inside could be ground down into a paste.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:22.071
And it was this paste that was then used as the base for the drink.

00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:27.791
Depending on how rich you were, you would drink it in different ways.

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:35.331
For a cheap, normal day-to-day drink these roasted cacao beans would be mixed

00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:42.381
with maize, with corn, and spices, for a warm, refreshing and revitalising drink.

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:47.491
But if money was no object, you wouldn’t bother with the added

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:52.811
corn, instead you would add more pure cacao and extra spices.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:59.101
For the Aztecs, these cacao drinks were about more than just being tasty.

00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:06.891
They viewed it as having spiritual and medicinal properties, they thought that it could cure

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:13.171
those who drank it of illnesses such as fever and tiredness, and - somewhat surprisingly

00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.981
when we think of the effects of chocolate today, they thought it could cure tooth decay.

00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.971
They thought it could cure problems with your teeth.

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:26.991
The Aztecs believed the bean was a gift from the gods, specifically

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:32.171
a gift from a god called Quetzalcoatl, the god of wind and wisdom.

00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:39.411
One ruler of the Aztecs, Montezuma II, reportedly believed so strongly

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:44.661
in its beneficial properties that he would drink it 50 times a day.

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:50.241
When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in the Americas they were initially

00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:55.591
confused about this strange bean that the local people were so passionate about.

00:05:56.541 --> 00:06:01.921
The King of the Aztecs, Montezuma II, our 50 cups of chocolate a day

00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:07.571
ruler, reportedly threw a banquet for Cortes and his men that included

00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.151
vast amounts of chocolate, or vast amounts of this cacao drink.

00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:17.251
The Spaniards tasted the cacao drink, but weren’t convinced,

00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:22.491
with one even writing that it was a ‘bitter drink for pigs’.

00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:28.121
But Cortes saw that it was considered pretty special and, after he had

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:32.641
taken Montezuma II prisoner, he took some cacao beans back to Spain.

00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:38.731
So, this is the next step on chocolate’s journey, its arrival in Europe.

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:45.261
Exactly when this precious bean first arrived on European shores is

00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:50.711
debated, but it’s likely some time at the start of the 16th century.

00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:55.477
But for the majority of the 16th century, it was confined

00:06:55.527 --> 00:06:59.367
to Spain, it didn’t really spread much further afield.

00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:05.357
It was consumed in a similar way to the Aztecs, as a drink,

00:07:05.787 --> 00:07:09.657
but it was very much a preserve of the wealthiest in society.

00:07:10.577 --> 00:07:14.737
These beans were in scarce supply, they had to be

00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:19.007
shipped over from the Americas, and it was a real luxury.

00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:25.497
By the start of the 17th century this cacao drink had spread to France.

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:32.667
In 1615, when King Louis XIII of France married the daughter of King Phillip

00:07:32.677 --> 00:07:38.157
III of Spain, the daughter, Anne, brought cacao to celebrate the marriage.

00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:43.437
Chocolate, or rather cacao, was still in its liquid

00:07:43.437 --> 00:07:47.417
form, a cacao drink, but it was starting to take off.

00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:53.337
It had spread to Britain, and European countries with colonial empires

00:07:53.517 --> 00:07:58.407
started to set up their own cacao plantations in equatorial countries.

00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:02.727
Cacao requires very specific conditions to grow.

00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:09.057
It can only grow in environments with very high humidity, the trees require a lot of

00:08:09.057 --> 00:08:16.307
shade, and if the temperature drops below about 18 degrees Celsius the plants will die.

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:21.827
So, you simply can’t grow it in Europe in natural conditions, but

00:08:22.097 --> 00:08:26.357
that didn’t stop Europeans from developing quite the taste for it.

00:08:27.527 --> 00:08:30.567
In wealthy circles in Europe it was considered a

00:08:30.717 --> 00:08:34.567
fashionable, healthy drink, full of beneficial properties.

00:08:35.677 --> 00:08:39.697
It was believed to be good for your health, and was also considered

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:44.147
to be an aphrodisiac, a substance that increases sexual desire.

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:53.037
Indeed, Casanova, perhaps the most famous European womaniser, was reportedly a huge fan of cacao.

00:08:54.447 --> 00:08:58.577
But these Europeans were still drinking cacao, not eating it.

00:08:59.597 --> 00:09:07.017
What you and I know as chocolate wasn’t to come until 1828, and was to be invented by a man

00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:12.507
from a country that you might not traditionally associate with chocolate - The Netherlands.

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:18.437
In 1828 a chemist from Amsterdam, called Coenraad Johannes

00:09:18.437 --> 00:09:21.997
van Houten, invented a way to make powdered chocolate.

00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:27.137
He invented a press that could separate about half the

00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:30.537
natural fat in the bit in the middle of the cacao bean.

00:09:31.607 --> 00:09:37.327
This left a sort of cacao powder, which could either be used for drinking

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:43.637
or could be mixed again with the cacao butter or sugar to create a solid

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:48.637
version, something similar to what we would now know as a chocolate bar.

00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:56.697
Van Houten patented his machine, he protected his invention so only he could separate the fat

00:09:56.727 --> 00:10:03.807
from the cacao bean in this way, but the patent only lasted for 7 years, expiring in 1835.

00:10:05.587 --> 00:10:10.067
The century following this can be described as the golden age of

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:14.357
chocolate, and many of the chocolates that you and I probably enjoy

00:10:14.357 --> 00:10:19.837
today were invented in this period, from the 1830s to the 1930s.

00:10:20.747 --> 00:10:27.037
The first chocolate bar was made in 1847 by a company called Fry’s in England.

00:10:28.037 --> 00:10:34.657
Then in 1875 a Swiss chocolatier called Daniel Peter had the bright idea

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:39.447
of adding milk to chocolate to create, you guessed it, milk chocolate.

00:10:40.657 --> 00:10:46.680
And four years later, in 1879, another Swiss chocolatier, a man called

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.057
Rodolphe Lindt invented something called conching, which is a process

00:10:52.197 --> 00:10:57.327
that changes the chocolate from a powdery state to more of a liquidy one.

00:10:57.917 --> 00:11:01.997
And, makes the flavour more evenly distributed and more delicious.

00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:08.217
With the industrialisation of the production of chocolate, and a reduction in

00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:12.937
the cost of bringing the cacao beans over from the Americas, what was previously

00:11:12.947 --> 00:11:18.097
something just for the wealthiest became a lot more affordable to people in Europe.

00:11:19.597 --> 00:11:23.787
The arrival of the chocolate bar came at almost the perfect time.

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.947
Firstly, the European workforce was changing.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:32.317
People were starting to work away from their homes,

00:11:32.577 --> 00:11:36.277
people were commuting, and needing to eat ‘on the go’.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.477
Chocolate was an ideal snack.

00:11:39.817 --> 00:11:44.567
It was tasty, it filled you up, it didn’t need to be cooked or heated,

00:11:45.027 --> 00:11:48.367
you didn’t need to get your hands dirty, and it was affordable.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:49.717
It was perfect.

00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:56.587
And at the start of the 20th century it was also the beginning of the advertising boom.

00:11:57.447 --> 00:12:02.777
Chocolate was a perfect product to be put on billboards, on posters around cities,

00:12:02.887 --> 00:12:08.087
to be advertised in magazines and newspapers, and of course later on, on TV.

00:12:08.757 --> 00:12:15.467
It was a product that anyone could enjoy, man or woman, young or old, and given that it

00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:21.987
was now mass produced, it was cheap and therefore enjoyed by millions of people every day.

00:12:23.087 --> 00:12:29.337
Now, the flip side of this affordability is how chocolate was and is produced.

00:12:30.387 --> 00:12:35.577
If we go back to the early days of cacao, the beans were frequently

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:40.527
produced by slave labour, by people working in horrendous conditions

00:12:40.737 --> 00:12:45.227
while the European rich enjoyed their delicious chocolatey beverages.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:54.133
And even now, despite the fact that it’s the world’s favourite sweet snack by a country mile, cacao

00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:59.973
farmers , the people who actually produce the chocolate are some of the poorest people in the world.

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:05.553
Farming cacao, farming chocolate, is difficult, tough work.

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:11.903
Each cacao pod produces about 30 to 40 beans, and it

00:13:11.903 --> 00:13:13.877
takes around 80 beans to make 100 grammes of chocolate.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:22.093
So, depending on the size and purity of the chocolate bar, it can

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:27.643
take anywhere from 2 to 5 entire pods to make your chocolate bar.

00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:34.573
And one worker can separate the beans from about 2,000 pods per day.

00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:39.153
So, if you do the maths, a worker can separate enough

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:43.553
beans to make anywhere from 400 to 1,000 bars of chocolate.

00:13:44.743 --> 00:13:47.123
And that’s just the separation stage.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:53.023
So if you think of all the other costs involved in the other stages, and remember that you

00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:59.033
can buy a chocolate bar from your local supermarket for really not very much money at all, you

00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:04.593
realise that these people are evidently not getting much of the final price that you are paying.

00:14:05.503 --> 00:14:10.643
Related to this is the question of who else is involved in the process of getting a

00:14:10.643 --> 00:14:17.383
cacao bean from a tree near the Equator through to your hand, ready to be scoffed down.

00:14:19.403 --> 00:14:26.133
Cacao, like most commodities, such as coffee or sugar, is often bought and sold by trading houses,

00:14:26.403 --> 00:14:33.163
companies that will buy up large quantities of cacao in order to sell it on to chocolate companies.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:40.753
The price of cacao goes up and down a lot based on its supply, based on how much of it there is.

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:45.363
If there is a lot of cacao on the market, the price tends to go

00:14:45.363 --> 00:14:49.493
down, and if there isn’t enough cacao available, the price goes up.

00:14:50.393 --> 00:14:56.713
But you and I, as consumers of chocolate, as people who eat chocolate, we don’t really see this.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:02.843
We don’t go to a shop one day and find that a chocolate bar is 50 cents and

00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:08.093
then come back the next week to see it’s at 80, then the week after it’s at 30.

00:15:08.956 --> 00:15:13.766
One of the reasons for this is because there is a whole industry of people

00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:18.796
buying and selling things called chocolate ‘futures’, or cacao futures.

00:15:19.906 --> 00:15:24.916
You can think of these as a contract to buy something at a fixed price

00:15:24.946 --> 00:15:29.956
in the future, no matter what the actual market price at that time is.

00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:35.083
To give you an example, if the price of cacao now is $3,000 a

00:15:35.183 --> 00:15:42.088
tonne, a cacao farmer can sell a tonne of cacao now for $3,000.

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:47.453
Or, someone could go to the farmer and say “I’ll buy a

00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:51.753
tonne of cacao from you for $3,000 in 6 months time”.

00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:59.963
If they agree to do this, the farmer knows that they will have a buyer for their product for $3,000.

00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:07.033
And for the trader, they know that they can get this cacao in 6 months time for a fixed price.

00:16:08.103 --> 00:16:16.183
But if the price in 6 months time is higher, let’s say it's $3,500, the trader can pay the

00:16:16.273 --> 00:16:23.743
arranged $3,000 price, and sell the cacao immediately on to someone else and take a $500 profit.

00:16:24.873 --> 00:16:29.233
And this is what's happening all over the world, except of course

00:16:29.373 --> 00:16:32.793
in much higher quantities than people buying a tonne at a time.

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:39.483
Indeed, a British commodities trader, a man called Anthony Ward once bought

00:16:39.523 --> 00:16:46.097
up contracts for 15% of the world’s cacao, 15% of all the cacao in the world,

00:16:46.817 --> 00:16:52.157
earning himself the nickname Chocfinger, after the Bond villain Goldfinger.

00:16:53.477 --> 00:16:58.717
These traders make a profit from knowing what direction the price will go - they

00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:04.497
try to get as much information as possible on future harvests, whether there

00:17:04.497 --> 00:17:09.177
will be the right amount of rain and so on, in order to make bets on the price.

00:17:10.127 --> 00:17:15.907
And most don’t ever actually come into contact with a single cacao bean - the contracts

00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:21.017
are sold on to chocolate producers, who want to deal with traders who can sell

00:17:21.017 --> 00:17:25.727
them hundreds or thousands of tonnes of cacao, rather than a few tonnes at a time.

00:17:26.897 --> 00:17:33.397
And the great irony perhaps of chocolate is that, while it is such a common, affordable snack

00:17:33.407 --> 00:17:39.207
for most of us in the West, where we can never actually grow it, in the countries where cacao

00:17:39.397 --> 00:17:44.827
is actually grown, the farmers who grow it aren’t sitting around eating chocolate bars all

00:17:44.827 --> 00:17:50.257
day, and they aren’t getting much of the economic benefits of the world’s hunger for chocolate.

00:17:51.477 --> 00:17:56.827
The top four chocolate producing countries in the world, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Ghana

00:17:56.827 --> 00:18:04.307
and Indonesia are in the bottom 50% when it comes to GDP per capita, when it comes to how

00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:09.387
wealthy they are, and cacao farmers are some of the poorest people in these countries.

00:18:10.407 --> 00:18:14.867
And when it comes to the countries that actually eat the most chocolate, they

00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:19.707
are all in Europe, with Switzerland, one of the richest countries in the world,

00:18:19.977 --> 00:18:25.897
coming in top at an average of 8.8kg of chocolate consumed per person per year.

00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:33.917
So, it is one of the peculiarities, and some might say an injustice, of the chocolate supply chain

00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:41.747
that the farmer who spends their life harvesting cacao beans in the sweltering midday sun rarely if

00:18:41.777 --> 00:18:48.447
ever gets to taste a chocolate bar, and the trader who spends their life speculating on the price

00:18:48.477 --> 00:18:55.497
of cacao beans in an office in New York or London rarely, if ever, actually sees a cacao bean.

00:18:58.527 --> 00:19:02.607
OK then, that is it for today's episode on chocolate.

00:19:03.117 --> 00:19:06.497
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:07.607 --> 00:19:12.107
As a final reminder, if you are looking for a more interesting way to improve your

00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:17.847
English in 2021, then I’d recommend checking out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:19:18.187 --> 00:19:22.017
Not only does this mean that you’ll get immediate access to all of our bonus

00:19:22.017 --> 00:19:26.777
episodes, and all of the fantastic learning resources that come with them, but

00:19:26.977 --> 00:19:32.037
I’ve managed to persuade the amazing Amy to give a one hour English strategy

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:36.767
lesson to anyone who becomes an annual Learner member before the end of January.

00:19:37.857 --> 00:19:42.227
As I said at the start, Amy is in super high demand, so

00:19:42.337 --> 00:19:45.137
we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:19:45.471 --> 00:19:50.341
And these are going quite quickly, so if this is of interest, and it certainly

00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:55.051
would be if I were you, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:19:56.101 --> 00:20:00.781
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:16.697
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:21.037
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:27.287
I'm Alastair Budge and today is the start of another three part series.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:31.347
This time we are going to talk about The Space Race.

00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:37.417
In today’s episode, Part One, we are going to be talking about the start of The

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:43.557
Space Race, the two decade-long competition between the USA and the USSR that

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:50.847
involved sending rockets, dogs, monkeys, humans, and even tortoises up into space.

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:55.807
Then, in Part Two, we are going to talk about the second half of The

00:00:55.987 --> 00:01:00.587
Space Race, and focus on one event in particular, The Moon Landing.

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:09.767
And in Part Three, we will look ahead, talk about what has been called The New Space Race, and ask

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:17.127
ourselves why there is a renewed interest in what exists beyond the Earth’s gravitational pull.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:23.347
Before we take off and get into today’s episode though, I want to remind you that

00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:28.427
you can become a member of Leonardo English and follow along with the subtitles, the

00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:33.697
transcript and its key vocabulary over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:02:00.487
Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:05.707
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:10.727
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:14.687
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.397
OK then, The Space Race.

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:25.124
It was the great battle in the sky between the USSR and the USA,

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:30.394
between East and West, between Communism and Capitalism, between

00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:35.414
good and evil, or evil and good, depending on whose side you were on.

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:41.264
Although it might have officially started in 1957, its

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:46.394
roots go back much further, and indeed back to Nazi Germany.

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:53.474
Even before the start of World War Two, Nazi scientists had been working on powerful rockets.

00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:56.904
The objective of those rockets wasn’t to go into

00:02:56.904 --> 00:03:00.824
space, but to deliver weapons over greater distances.

00:03:01.454 --> 00:03:06.724
One Nazi scientist in particular was instrumental in the development of these

00:03:06.724 --> 00:03:12.124
rockets, and will turn out to be one of the most important players in The Space Race.

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:19.454
Wernher von Braun was the genius rocket scientist who developed something called the V2

00:03:19.454 --> 00:03:26.724
missile, a rocket that could travel up to 200km, it could travel at supersonic speeds,

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:33.184
it could travel faster than the speed of sound, and was thus very hard to defend against.

00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:34.294
Not

00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:36.664
only were these rockets fast

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:43.634
and deadly, but they were so powerful that they could travel to the edge of space - in June of

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:52.664
1944 the first V2 crossed something called the Kármán Line, which is the imaginary line 100km

00:03:52.714 --> 00:03:59.594
above the Earth’s surface considered to be the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space.

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:05.854
Germany started to use these V2 rockets in September of 1944,

00:04:06.564 --> 00:04:11.844
firing them over the sea to London, but also to Antwerp, and Liege.

00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:16.314
Although these rockets were deadly, they weren’t to

00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:19.494
prove enough to turn the war around for the Nazis.

00:04:20.324 --> 00:04:25.384
As the Nazi regime collapsed, and there was the ensuing power scramble

00:04:25.384 --> 00:04:30.374
in Europe between the USA and the USSR, both powers tried to get

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:35.334
their hands on this fantastic but deadly German rocket technology.

00:04:36.534 --> 00:04:41.794
Wernher von Braun, the genius creator of the V2 rocket, handed himself

00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:47.514
in to the Americans, and became an incredibly important American asset.

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:55.194
The Americans managed to capture most of the top German scientists and the launch sites,

00:04:55.364 --> 00:05:01.904
while the Soviets managed to get the German plans and drawings for how to build these rockets.

00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:09.214
They also captured a man called Helmut Gröttrup, who was another top rocket scientist,

00:05:09.364 --> 00:05:15.164
and would be brought to the USSR and forced to work on the Soviet’s missile programme.

00:05:16.184 --> 00:05:22.414
In charge of the Soviet Space Programme was a man called Sergei Korolev, a genius rocket

00:05:22.414 --> 00:05:30.104
scientist who had spent 6 years in a Soviet Gulag, a Soviet prison, after being purged by Stalin.

00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:36.294
Much as von Braun, the captured Nazi rocket scientist would prove to be

00:05:36.364 --> 00:05:42.354
instrumental to the Americans, Korolev was of vital importance to the Soviets.

00:05:43.414 --> 00:05:47.954
For the first almost dozen years after the end of the Second

00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:52.554
World War, the Space Race was, at least to the public, slow.

00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:57.604
There was no race, there was no public pledge to go to outer

00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:02.294
space, to put a man on the moon, or to do anything unusual.

00:06:02.894 --> 00:06:07.654
But behind the scenes, the Soviet and American scientists were

00:06:07.654 --> 00:06:12.414
working on recreating the V2 rockets to use for themselves.

00:06:13.714 --> 00:06:19.154
The Cold War had started pretty much as soon as the Second World War had ended,

00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:25.644
and both the USSR and the USA were busy building up their military capabilities.

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:32.184
It’s important to note that, at least initially, these rocket scientists were

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:37.724
part of the military, the rockets were being developed for military purposes.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:45.474
As the Nazis had shown back in 1944, the V2 rocket could be launched into space.

00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:50.934
If a country could develop the technology to fire rockets into space

00:06:50.974 --> 00:06:56.524
and programme them to return to Earth, this would mean that a bomb could

00:06:56.684 --> 00:07:01.914
theoretically be fired down from space to land anywhere in the world.

00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:07.344
The Americans had already developed their own atomic weapons, and

00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:11.254
had shown the world how they worked at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:19.274
The Soviets only developed their own atomic weapons in 1949, but when they did,

00:07:19.654 --> 00:07:26.254
there was the very real possibility that if the USSR could send rockets into space,

00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:31.474
it could fill them with atomic weapons which would rain down on American cities.

00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:36.634
And, for the Americans, that was obviously a frightening thought.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:41.664
So, the post-war period saw both the Soviets and the

00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:45.834
Americans focussing on developing their rocket capabilities.

00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:49.694
But, again, at this point, there was no public race.

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:54.274
Indeed, especially for the Soviets, it was incredibly secret.

00:07:55.424 --> 00:08:01.084
But behind the scenes, there was an increasing push to be the first country to go to space.

00:08:01.984 --> 00:08:10.084
On August 30th, 1955 Korolev, the chief rocket scientist for the Soviets, managed to convince the

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:16.954
Soviet Academy of the Sciences to make beating the Americans into the Earth’s orbit a priority.

00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:21.844
Not only did this have a military benefit, but it could

00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:26.294
have a huge propaganda benefit, both at home and abroad.

00:08:27.154 --> 00:08:29.484
The battle of Communism vs.

00:08:29.514 --> 00:08:34.224
Capitalism was also a battle to win over hearts and minds.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:39.994
If the citizens of the USSR saw that it was the first country to

00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:44.964
put an object into orbit, this would be a huge source of pride.

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:50.994
But, knowledge of this space programme was incredibly restricted.

00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:55.344
Launches weren’t announced until after they had taken place,

00:08:55.624 --> 00:08:59.714
and almost all the details were kept hidden from the public.

00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:06.544
Meanwhile, in the USA von Braun and his team were making solid progress.

00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:10.494
Not only had they managed to recreate the V2 rocket,

00:09:10.814 --> 00:09:14.284
but they had improved the technology significantly.

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:22.514
By 1956 they had developed the technology that could send a satellite into orbit, but President

00:09:22.544 --> 00:09:29.954
Eisenhower was cautious about being seen to send a military rocket into orbit, so he didn’t do it.

00:09:31.194 --> 00:09:36.594
Back in the USSR, Korolev’s team knew that the US were getting close.

00:09:36.824 --> 00:09:42.144
There were rumours that the US was planning to launch a satellite to coincide

00:09:42.284 --> 00:09:49.254
with a large conference on October 6th 1957, so there was no time to lose.

00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:57.484
And on Friday, October 4th of 1957, two days before the Soviets believed the

00:09:57.484 --> 00:10:02.944
Americans were planning to send a satellite into space, the Soviets got the first win.

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:08.354
The first satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched into orbit.

00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:13.504
You may have seen images of it, but it was a small, metallic

00:10:13.514 --> 00:10:20.404
ball, only 58 centimetres in diameter and weighing 83.8 kilos.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:27.034
It took just over an hour and a half to orbit the Earth’s surface, as it

00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:31.894
emitted radio waves that could be picked up by transmitters back on Earth.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:39.894
It might have only been a metallic ball, but what it represented was of huge importance.

00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:45.034
If the USSR could launch a satellite into orbit, and

00:10:45.474 --> 00:10:48.984
it now had atomic weapons, then nowhere was safe.

00:10:49.864 --> 00:10:55.304
This sparked what has come to be known as the Sputnik Crisis, a period

00:10:55.434 --> 00:11:00.644
of self-reflection in the US where it wondered where it had gone wrong.

00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:06.364
For decades the US had been at the forefront of science and technology,

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:11.234
but it had been beaten by a power that its citizens had been told

00:11:11.244 --> 00:11:16.674
was inferior, by a country that was weaker than the United States.

00:11:17.704 --> 00:11:22.284
In the US, directly after the launch, the rocket scientists

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:26.004
couldn’t figure out exactly how the Soviets had done it.

00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:30.514
The USSR hadn’t released any information or images

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:32.884
about the rockets that had launched the satellite.

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:40.644
They had stated that Sputnik 1 weighed 83 kilos, but the Americans couldn’t believe this.

00:11:40.974 --> 00:11:45.054
The Americans had only been planning to launch a satellite weighing

00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:50.064
less than 10kg, and they thought the Soviets must have been lying.

00:11:50.884 --> 00:11:54.434
How could they have launched something that was 8 times heavier?

00:11:55.574 --> 00:12:00.464
When it transpired, when it came to light, that the satellite was indeed

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:04.224
over 8 times heavier than the one the Americans had been planning to

00:12:04.234 --> 00:12:09.684
launch, the true extent of how far ahead the Soviets were came to light.

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:16.944
There were articles in American magazines that tried to explain why the Soviets were so far ahead.

00:12:17.754 --> 00:12:23.074
The theories included that the USSR simply placed a greater emphasis

00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:28.504
on science and technology, and while Americans were busy making cars

00:12:28.504 --> 00:12:32.764
and microwave ovens, the Soviets were sending objects into space.

00:12:33.814 --> 00:12:40.694
The American reaction to Sputnik 1 was to massively increase the budget allocated towards the

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:47.874
American space programme, and to try to create a new generation of engineers and scientists.

00:12:49.384 --> 00:12:54.924
Their immediate priority was to show that they too could launch a satellite into orbit.

00:12:56.244 --> 00:12:57.644
It wasn’t a smooth start.

00:12:58.534 --> 00:13:02.664
On December 6th, just two months after the launch of Sputnik 1,

00:13:03.484 --> 00:13:08.264
The American Vanguard TV-3 was ready to be launched into space.

00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:15.094
It was broadcast on live TV, and millions of Americans tuned in to watch.

00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:19.924
The rocket started to take off, but it only managed

00:13:19.994 --> 00:13:24.884
to go up 1.2 metres before falling back to the ground.

00:13:25.894 --> 00:13:32.524
It was hugely embarrassing to the US, and the launch was mocked by the national press.

00:13:33.954 --> 00:13:41.284
To make matters worse, a Soviet diplomat even joked that the US should receive financial aid

00:13:41.464 --> 00:13:47.244
for its Space Programme “under the Soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations."

00:13:48.544 --> 00:13:56.256
The US did manage to launch a satellite into space the following month, on January 31st of 1958,

00:13:56.412 --> 00:14:02.984
but this was four months after the Soviets, plus their satellite was significantly lighter.

00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:09.844
Just playing catchup with the Soviets was not a position that the Americans wanted to be in.

00:14:10.574 --> 00:14:16.464
In April 1958, Eisenhower pushed for the creation of a national

00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:24.364
space agency, and NASA was created on July 29th, of 1958.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.724
The Soviets were still powering ahead though.

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:32.244
Shortly after the launch of the first satellite, in October of 1957,

00:14:32.604 --> 00:14:37.304
they had launched the first animal into space, a dog named Laika.

00:14:38.114 --> 00:14:43.184
Although this was another big milestone, the story didn’t end well for poor Laika,

00:14:43.184 --> 00:14:48.994
who died onboard, either when the oxygen ran out or from stress and overheating.

00:14:49.934 --> 00:14:54.284
Two more canine space travellers were created in 1960,

00:14:54.524 --> 00:14:58.784
when Belka and Strelka travelled into space with Sputnik 5.

00:14:59.644 --> 00:15:04.524
Although they might not be as famous as Laika, they did manage to come back to Earth

00:15:04.554 --> 00:15:09.774
alive, although one would imagine they were slightly confused about the whole affair.

00:15:10.824 --> 00:15:15.124
But sending animals into space was easy, comparatively speaking.

00:15:15.611 --> 00:15:19.931
If they died, like poor Laika, it wouldn’t be considered a tragedy.

00:15:21.031 --> 00:15:25.051
A person, a human being, was another story altogether.

00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:29.491
Not only was there the complication of keeping them alive when they

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:33.951
were in space, but making sure that they would survive the reentry,

00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:38.461
the arrival back to Earth, was no mean feat, it wasn’t easy at all.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:45.981
The Soviets, as you may probably know, were the first side to manage it, on April 12th

00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:54.111
1961 with the launch of Vostok 1, the spacecraft with the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin inside.

00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:59.591
Just on a linguistic note, the Soviets called their space travellers

00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:03.721
“Cosmonauts”, while the Americans called theirs “Astronauts”.

00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:04.921
They’re the same thing.

00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:11.471
Although Gagarin was a distinguished pilot who had undergone months of intense training,

00:16:11.641 --> 00:16:18.151
he wasn’t actually in control of anything on Vostok 1, he wasn’t piloting the spacecraft.

00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:22.211
Doctors didn’t know what would happen to the human body in

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:26.481
space, and so the entire craft was controlled from down on Earth.

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:33.331
Gagarin did have an envelope with a code that would unlock the manual controls

00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:38.141
of the spacecraft if there was a problem, but luckily he didn’t need to use them.

00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:42.991
He became the first human being to orbit the Earth, which

00:16:43.261 --> 00:16:47.291
he did in 108 minutes, before returning back to ground.

00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:51.871
Now, the return to Earth was by no means simple.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:58.101
The Soviet engineers still hadn’t figured out a way to slow the spacecraft down

00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:02.951
sufficiently so that a human could survive the impact when it hit the ground,

00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:10.321
so Gagarin had to eject from the spacecraft at around 6km up from the ground.

00:17:11.011 --> 00:17:14.311
He would open a parachute, and float back down to Earth.

00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:19.251
He managed it, and he returned to Earth a hero in his native

00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:23.111
land, and he has, of course, gone down in world history.

00:17:24.601 --> 00:17:28.991
Similarly to the Sputnik 1 satellite, the Soviets had kept

00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:33.051
very quiet about how they managed to get Gagarin into space.

00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:36.051
There was huge secrecy around the programme.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.851
What’s more, they tried to confuse the Americans.

00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:44.361
The spaceship was displayed publicly at an airshow in

00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:49.121
1961, but what was on display wasn’t the real spaceship.

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:54.801
The Soviets had hidden the capsule that Gagarin would travel in inside the spaceship,

00:17:55.181 --> 00:18:02.471
and they had also added another fake section at the bottom with 8 fins, 8 small wings.

00:18:03.251 --> 00:18:07.911
They knew that the Americans would be watching, trying to figure out what

00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:12.061
their competitors were up to, and deliberately tried to confuse them.

00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:17.061
It worked, or at least it certainly didn’t help the Americans.

00:18:17.811 --> 00:18:22.121
The USA only managed to get a man into orbit in February

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:26.131
the following year, a full 10 months after the Soviets.

00:18:27.101 --> 00:18:29.791
The race wasn’t going so well for the Americans.

00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:36.461
The Soviets had beaten them in getting the first satellite into space, they had beaten them in

00:18:36.461 --> 00:18:42.041
getting the first animal into space, they had beaten them in getting the first human into space.

00:18:42.881 --> 00:18:47.991
And if there is one thing that the USA doesn’t like, it’s coming second.

00:18:48.511 --> 00:18:54.421
And coming second to your sworn enemy, a nation built on an economic and

00:18:54.441 --> 00:18:59.811
political system that your leaders say is barbaric and wrong, well, that is

00:18:59.831 --> 00:19:05.341
a hard pill to swallow, it was not a comfortable situation for the Americans.

00:19:06.201 --> 00:19:08.991
So, a bold move was required.

00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:16.337
In September of 1962, 18 months after he had become the 35th president

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:22.737
of the USA, John F Kennedy, JFK, proclaimed that the USA would send

00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:27.557
a man to the moon by the end of the decade, by the end of the 1960s.

00:19:28.477 --> 00:19:30.877
Here’s a short clip of him announcing it.

00:19:32.141 --> 00:19:36.871
But why some say the moon, why choose this as our goal?

00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:41.221
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain.

00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:45.421
Why 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic.

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.791
Why does rice play Texas?

00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:50.001
We chose to go to the moon.

00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:52.641
We chose to go to the moon.

00:19:57.374 --> 00:19:59.878
It was an incredibly ambitious plan.

00:20:00.358 --> 00:20:06.068
Getting up into space was one thing, but going to the moon, well, that was something else.

00:20:06.968 --> 00:20:12.105
The Americans needed not just to beat the Soviets, but to beat them with

00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:16.495
something decisive, something that would be remembered for generations.

00:20:17.364 --> 00:20:23.184
Interestingly enough, putting a man on the moon wasn’t the only idea that they had considered.

00:20:23.914 --> 00:20:27.684
In the year 2000 it was revealed that there was another,

00:20:27.964 --> 00:20:31.464
more destructive plan that the US had been considering.

00:20:32.174 --> 00:20:41.054
It was given the codename Project A119, and its objective was to explode a nuclear bomb on the moon.

00:20:42.154 --> 00:20:49.574
As the launching of rockets into space was partly as a display of technological might, of

00:20:49.574 --> 00:20:55.604
technological power, but also of military strength, the US considered essentially bombing the moon.

00:20:56.614 --> 00:21:01.964
They calculated that the explosion would be visible with the naked eye from Earth.

00:21:02.244 --> 00:21:06.584
It would, obviously, be a large display of strength to the Soviets.

00:21:07.314 --> 00:21:14.334
If the US was prepared to bomb the moon, well, that was a strong sign of their military advantage.

00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:17.604
But, the plan was aborted.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:23.004
It was deemed, quite rightly I think, that the dangers outweighed the benefits.

00:21:23.924 --> 00:21:29.704
If the nuclear bomb missed the moon, then it would be floating around in space.

00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:34.304
And if there was a problem with the launch of it, it might explode

00:21:34.564 --> 00:21:38.954
over the USA, or over another country, which would either be highly

00:21:38.974 --> 00:21:43.914
embarrassing or politically disastrous, and deadly in both cases.

00:21:45.044 --> 00:21:51.314
Luckily, it was decided that landing on the moon would be a much better boost for domestic morale.

00:21:51.924 --> 00:21:57.984
The Soviets were also hatching a similar plan, codenamed Project E-4.

00:21:58.414 --> 00:22:03.394
But they too didn’t go through with it, for similar reasons to the Americans.

00:22:04.154 --> 00:22:11.414
So, Projects A119 and E-4 didn’t go ahead, but JFK had publicly

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:15.904
stated that putting a man on the moon was the next big American goal.

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:19.584
Every American knew it, and the Soviets knew it too.

00:22:20.314 --> 00:22:23.064
The race was on, the goal was clear.

00:22:23.414 --> 00:22:28.714
There were 7 years, 3 months and 19 days to send a man to the moon.

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:32.654
Or just 2,667 days.

00:22:33.194 --> 00:22:36.904
Not a huge amount of time to manage what would later be

00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:40.594
called the greatest technological advance in human history.

00:22:41.564 --> 00:22:44.914
And the next stage of the Space Race, the race to the moon,

00:22:45.074 --> 00:22:48.404
is what we’ll learn about in Part Two of this mini-series.

00:22:50.644 --> 00:22:56.104
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the early years of the Space Race.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:58.964
As I mentioned at the start of the episode, this is

00:22:58.964 --> 00:23:01.734
going to be a three part series on The Space Race.

00:23:02.054 --> 00:23:07.504
Part two, which is going to be one of our member-only episodes, will be on the race to the moon,

00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:14.324
and part three, the final part, will be on the next Space Race, the race to Mars and beyond.

00:23:15.034 --> 00:23:19.804
And as a final reminder, if you enjoyed this episode, and you would like to listen

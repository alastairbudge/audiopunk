Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.680
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.710
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.509
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.919
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.019
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.170
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.340
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.610
talking about a group of Soviet spies.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.060
But they weren’t your average

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.119
Soviets spies; they were members

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.029
of Britain’s ruling elite.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.220
Highly educated, upper-class

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.019
men thought to be the best and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.699
brightest of British society.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.719
Men who, to the outside world, were at

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.230
the very top of the British establishment,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.010
but behind closed doors, they fed

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.559
information to an ideological enemy

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.480
for a period spanning three decades.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.580
As this is such an incredible story, with

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.810
so many weird and wonderful facts, twists,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.730
turns, stories and personalities, this

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.099
is going to be a three part mini-series

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.810
on the group dubbed “the Cambridge Five”.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.119
Today, in episode one, we will take a

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.380
look at the backgrounds and recruitment of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.720
these men, of these spies, with a little

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.839
historical context to help us properly

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.570
appreciate the magnitude of what they did.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.990
In part-two, we’ll look at their

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.830
actual spywork, the ingenious ways

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.570
they did it, and, of course, the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.599
top secret information they stole.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.230
And in part-three, we’ll get into their

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.540
downfall, how their story ended, and how,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.970
in some respects, they got away with it.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.170
OK then, let’s get into it and talk

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.750
about the Cambridge Five - the Soviet

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400
spy ring hidden in plain sight.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.880
It was a July afternoon in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.793
London’s Regents Park, in 1934.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.070
It was a clear, hot day, and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.150
the sun was high in the sky.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.250
Birds chirped, and children played.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.740
Park benches lined the paths, and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.930
Londoners lounged lazily in the shade.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.080
A 22-year-old man named Kim Philby,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.890
looking rather nervous, made his way

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.050
through the park wearing a shirt and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.760
tie, despite the sticky summer heat.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.180
He hadn’t planned to come to the park that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.750
day, but set off after his wife had told

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.550
him, rather mysteriously, that she had

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.390
arranged for him to meet, and I’m quoting

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.150
directly, ‘a man of decisive importance’.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.100
She told him nothing more,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370
only the time and location.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.240
Not knowing what to expect, he sat

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.290
down on a bench and tried to blend in.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.060
After a few minutes he saw a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.140
stocky, short man approaching.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.970
He introduced himself as ‘Otto’, and spoke

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.630
with a strong eastern European accent.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.590
Looking around, Otto made small talk

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.650
and complained that he hated London.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.860
He much preferred Paris, he said.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.230
It wasn’t long before Otto cut to the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.010
chase, he stopped with the small talk and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.470
revealed the true purpose of the meeting.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.860
Otto turned and said that someone

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.020
like Philby, someone from his family

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.700
background, could be of great use.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.340
He could make a much greater impact than

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.120
a mere ‘run-of-the-mill party member’.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.740
Philby nodded, saying nothing.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.610
“You must stop communicating with all

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.420
the friends I tell you to if you want

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.170
to go ahead with this”, Otto said.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.170
Eventually the men came to an agreement,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.530
and a few moments later Otto left in

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.480
one direction, Philby the other, and the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.030
two men slipped back into the anonymous

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.490
hustle and bustle of central London.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.280
Officially, Otto was working at a nearby

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.680
university; unofficially, he was Arnold

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.200
Deutsch, a spy recruiter for the Soviets.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.150
Deutsch had just recruited Kim Philby:

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.960
the most famous British double-agent

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.630
of all time, the biggest traitor,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.850
some say, in British history.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.750
That afternoon in Regent’s

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.040
Park was the first step in the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.650
story of the Cambridge Five.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.200
So, who were the Cambridge Five?

00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:33.517
They are Kim Philby, who we heard about a

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:36.757
moment ago, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess,

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:39.697
Anthony Blunt, and John Cairncross.

00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:42.267
Though, of course, the story of the

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.497
Cambridge Five really begins at Cambridge

00:04:44.497 --> 00:04:46.477
University, we should start first

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:48.727
with a bit of background on these men.

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:51.907
This is important because the types of

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.527
people the Cambridge Five were, and by

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.867
that I mean their class backgrounds, their

00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:59.207
social status and the circles they moved

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:02.317
in, these were crucial to their spywork.

00:05:03.307 --> 00:05:04.947
Now, what you need to understand

00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:06.487
about the Cambridge Five is that

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:08.977
they all - besides one - came from

00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:10.897
incredibly privileged backgrounds.

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.127
They were all born into Britain’s

00:05:13.407 --> 00:05:15.307
upper-middle or upper-class,

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:17.717
were educated at the top private

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.777
schools, and came from ‘good’,

00:05:19.947 --> 00:05:22.247
wealthy, families with connections.

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.337
To give you an idea of quite how high

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.567
up these men were in British society,

00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:30.367
Donald Maclean was the son of Sir

00:05:30.447 --> 00:05:32.917
Donald Maclean, a powerful Liberal Party

00:05:32.947 --> 00:05:35.317
politician who was a Privy Councillor,

00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:37.757
like an advisor, to the Royal Family.

00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:41.217
Harold Adrian Russell Philby, known as

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.427
‘Kim’, the man from the London park a

00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:46.187
couple of minutes ago, he was educated at

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:48.417
one of Britain’s most exclusive private

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:51.477
schools, Westminster, and he was the son

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.847
of a famous Arab scholar and diplomat

00:05:54.027 --> 00:05:56.057
who advised the King of Saudi Arabia.

00:05:57.417 --> 00:05:59.607
Guy Burgess, whose full name was

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:02.417
Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess, went

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:04.097
to school at the prestigious Eton

00:06:04.137 --> 00:06:06.357
College, the school that has produced

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:08.227
a third of Britain’s Prime Ministers,

00:06:08.407 --> 00:06:10.737
including Boris Johnson, and is

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.717
where Princes William and Harry went.

00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:15.307
Anthony Blunt was a distant cousin

00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:17.507
of the Queen Mother and fourth cousin

00:06:17.547 --> 00:06:19.967
of Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:21.657
of the British Union of Fascists.

00:06:22.027 --> 00:06:24.337
He also had a suitably prestigious

00:06:24.357 --> 00:06:26.007
education, going to Marlborough

00:06:26.017 --> 00:06:28.357
College, another elite private school.

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:31.297
John Cairncross, on the other hand,

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:33.557
was a little different from the

00:06:33.597 --> 00:06:35.247
other four of the Cambridge Five.

00:06:35.947 --> 00:06:38.587
He was Scottish, first of all, and came

00:06:38.587 --> 00:06:40.707
not from the same privileged background as

00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:43.027
the others but from working-class roots.

00:06:43.697 --> 00:06:47.367
He was born in Glasgow in 1913, the son

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:49.187
of an ironmonger and a primary school

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:51.947
teacher, but when he won a place at

00:06:51.947 --> 00:06:54.270
Cambridge University, he was thrust

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.590
into the very top of British society.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.840
And Cambridge University,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.370
in the early-1930s, is where

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.200
our story really begins.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.540
As you may know, or may remember

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.620
from episode number 276, Cambridge

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.890
University is not just one of the

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.270
most prestigious universities in

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.620
Britain, but it’s consistently ranked

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.800
as one of the best in the world.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.770
Cambridge is a lot more meritocratic

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.680
now, but in the 1930s going to

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.810
study at Cambridge or Oxford was

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.890
a rite of passage for wealthy

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.850
and privileged young British men.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.920
It was the expected step for young men

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.960
like Burgess, Philby, Maclean and Blunt.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.380
Three or four years at Cambridge,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.590
then a respectable job in government

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.770
or the army or the business world.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.620
Kim Philby arrived to study History

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.750
and Economics; Maclean studied

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.040
modern languages; Burgess, history;

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.140
Blunt, who was the oldest of the

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.160
group, studied mathematics; and

00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:58.697
Cairncross, studied French and German.

00:07:59.787 --> 00:08:02.627
All five men were academically gifted,

00:08:02.947 --> 00:08:05.387
that's to say, intelligent, but their

00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:08.517
interests extended outside the library.

00:08:09.787 --> 00:08:11.757
Moving in the same circles - meaning,

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.907
the same social groups - the five

00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:16.227
met and became friends, and were all

00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:18.537
known to be very sociable and active

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.047
in Cambridge’s exclusive social scene.

00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.017
Burgess in particular, it was said,

00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:27.107
bragged, or claimed of “knowing everybody

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.977
who was anybody, everywhere and anywhere.”

00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:34.277
In fact, as we will see, socialising

00:08:34.287 --> 00:08:36.390
and alcohol - and some of the men’s

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.410
struggles to control their alcohol

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.160
intake - this was a common theme

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.270
throughout their careers and it was partly

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.180
to blame for their eventual downfall.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.230
Some of the Five were also active in

00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:51.910
Cambridge’s ultra-elite secret societies.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.760
Burgess and Blunt were both members

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.730
of the Cambridge Apostles and Pitt

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.930
Club, two private members clubs for

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.470
Cambridge’s ‘cream of the crop’ - that's

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.560
to say, the best of the best - that

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.660
have had kings, politicians and

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.960
famous academics as former members.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.670
Outside this bubble of Cambridge, as you

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.960
will know, the 1930s was a time of great

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.620
economic upheaval and class tension.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.280
The First World War had ended in

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.300
1918, at the end of the 1920s the

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.450
Great Depression had caused huge

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.990
hardship and suffering, and with it

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.220
came extreme political turbulence.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.970
And specifically, the threat

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.860
of fascism across Europe.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.980
For these young men and women at

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.040
Cambridge, men and women who felt they

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.070
were destined to go on to rule not only

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.040
the country, but large parts of the

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.780
world, the question remained: what sort

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.260
of world do we want to live in, what

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.190
sort of country do we want to rule?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.290
It seemed like there were two

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.720
competing visions of the world: on

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.940
the one side, there was fascism,

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.944
Mussolini, Hitler, and Oswald Molsley

00:10:03.944 --> 00:10:06.700
in the UK, and on the other, the

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.030
teachings of Karl Marx, communism.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.187
For many who feared the rise of

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.120
fascism, there was only one logical

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.340
choice: support the communists.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.700
And all five of these young men you

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.760
just heard about, Maclean, Burgess,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.240
Philby, Blunt and Cairncross, they

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.490
all held what would be considered very

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.440
left-wing views and moved in circles,

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.870
or interacted with, groups with

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.550
links to the British Communist Party.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.960
Well, as you might imagine, the

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.290
Soviets were hoping to find and win

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.230
over exactly these types of young,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.930
ideological and impressionable men.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.740
And it’s here that we need to

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.080
meet our friend Otto, the man

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.500
with the Eastern European accent

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.080
from the start of the episode.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.330
Or rather, not Otto, but Arnold Deutsch.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.810
In early-1934, Deutsch had been sent

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.720
by Soviet intelligence to London.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.690
Deutsch's cousin was Oscar Deutsch,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.080
the man who created the Odeon cinema

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.940
chain, which still exists today

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.620
by the way, and is actually the

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.650
largest cinema chain in the country.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.820
Crucially, the respectable Oscar Deutsch

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.240
supported his cousin’s move to the UK,

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.050
meaning he was able to exist, to do his

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.180
spywork, under the radar, without the

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.920
knowledge of the British authorities.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.780
Deutsch’s postgraduate work at the

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.010
University of London was a cover, of

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.270
course, and he was secretly working

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.040
as a recruiter with instructions from

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.840
Moscow to, and I’m quoting directly

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.030
‘cultivate young radical high-fliers

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.660
from leading British universities before

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.800
they entered the corridors of power.’

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.040
This mission brought him to that

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.900
bench in London’s Regent’s Park,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.930
and resulted in the recruitment

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.350
of Kim Philby, the first of the

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.110
Cambridge Five, in the summer of 1934.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.420
Philby later said that Deutsch “spoke

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.510
at great length, arguing that a

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.650
person with my family background and

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.210
possibilities could do far more for

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.020
Communism than the run-of-the-mill

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.720
Party member or sympathiser...

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.070
I accepted.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.770
His first instructions were… that

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.140
I should break off as quickly

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.460
as possible all personal contact

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.920
with our Communist friends."

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.110
This was, of course, to make it

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.750
appear as though he was no longer a

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.190
communist sympathiser and strengthen

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.530
his cover - his fake identity.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.380
His first mission was to spy on his

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.640
own father, the diplomat, as the

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.780
Soviets believed he could have had

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.640
important documents in his office.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.750
From there, Philby recommended Burgess

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.720
and Maclean, then Burgess recruited Blunt,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.090
and a little while later Burgess and

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.450
Blunt convinced Cairncross to join them.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.100
The pitch, or the offer, was framed

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.080
in a way to not be explicitly

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.970
working for the Soviets, but rather,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.720
against fascism and for peace.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.850
Indeed, it wasn’t pitched as them

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.690
spying against Britain, but rather they

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.400
were providing information that would

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.090
help stop Britain falling to fascism.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.580
Well, this was the case in the 1930s,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.140
but as we will discover, it soon became

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.350
something altogether very different.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.160
By the time the Five began to graduate

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.870
from Cambridge in the mid to late-1930s,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.755
at least three, Philby, Maclean and

00:13:35.755 --> 00:13:37.900
Burgess, and possibly more, had been

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.050
recruited and trained by the NKVD,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
the Soviet intelligence wing that

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.754
would go on to be the famous KGB.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.130
The exact timing and sequence of

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.500
their recruitment is a little murky,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.810
or unclear, not only because they

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.240
were spies and it was all top secret,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.440
obviously, but also because some of the

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.540
Five, notably Blunt, have cast doubt on

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.250
the fact that they were all recruited

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.840
while they were students at Cambridge.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.270
The exact timings aren’t

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.450
crucial for our story.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.750
Whether it was at university or

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.400
shortly after, they were all recruited,

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.951
they were full-blown Soviet spies,

00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:18.091
with their own cryptonyms, that is,

00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:20.931
their own secret spy names or codes.

00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:25.691
Maclean was known as Homer, Burgess as

00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:29.911
Hicks, Philby was Sonny or Stanley, Blunt

00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:33.471
was Johnson, and Cairncross went by Liszt.

00:14:34.431 --> 00:14:37.151
And these Soviet spies-in-waiting all

00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:39.531
went on to secure the kind of jobs that

00:14:39.531 --> 00:14:42.361
were beyond the Soviet’s wildest dreams.

00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:44.861
So, what did they do?

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.571
That's to say, what were their

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:48.571
official jobs - their ‘covers’?

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:51.981
Maclean and Cairncross joined the Foreign

00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:54.201
Office, becoming diplomats, essentially.

00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:57.121
Guy Burgess initially worked for

00:14:57.121 --> 00:14:59.521
a Conservative MP, a member of

00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:01.331
parliament, before moving on to the

00:15:01.331 --> 00:15:03.921
BBC, where he spent time interacting

00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.801
with and interviewing politicians

00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:07.511
and other influential figures

00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:08.921
from the British establishment.

00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:11.721
Blunt joined the army and then

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:14.231
moved onto MI5, the domestic

00:15:14.352 --> 00:15:16.511
counterintelligence agency, essentially,

00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:19.351
the internal spy department of the UK.

00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:23.381
Kim Philby, however, was given a slightly

00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:26.101
more interesting first mission, one I

00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:27.921
think is worth considering for a moment

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.471
and that might be particularly interesting

00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:32.221
for the Spanish listeners among you.

00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:35.221
According to top secret MI5

00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:37.011
files that were made public in

00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.331
2011, Philby was sent to Spain.

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.201
He arrived in February of 1937,

00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:46.271
shortly after the outbreak

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:47.331
of the Spanish Civil War.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.681
Officially, he was there as a journalist,

00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:53.211
covering the war for The Times newspaper.

00:15:54.101 --> 00:15:56.061
The Times is a more right-wing

00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:58.531
publication and was sympathetic to

00:15:58.531 --> 00:16:01.251
the nationalists, that is, Franco’s

00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:03.461
fascist army, not the Republicans.

00:16:04.901 --> 00:16:06.361
Why is this relevant, you might be

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:09.451
thinking, and surely, if he was a spy for

00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:13.071
the Soviets this seems like an odd choice.

00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:15.981
It was all a cover, of course.

00:16:16.681 --> 00:16:18.861
For the duration of his time in Spain,

00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:21.521
Philby was stationed with, he was based

00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:24.141
with, nationalist forces, supposedly

00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:26.191
reporting for the British newspaper.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.991
But his real mission was to ‘keep an

00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:31.481
eye’ on troops, particularly the Italians

00:16:31.481 --> 00:16:33.951
and Germans, and pass this information

00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:36.291
back to the Soviets, who were, of

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:38.731
course, supporting the Republican cause.

00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:41.891
Some historians believe that his

00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:44.411
real mission, however, was something

00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.051
altogether more exciting, and had

00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:48.721
he pulled it off, would have had a

00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:51.451
tumultuous impact on Spanish history.

00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:54.871
And this was, according to a Soviet

00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:57.201
officer who defected to the West, to

00:16:57.221 --> 00:17:00.571
assassinate Franco, the Spanish dictator.

00:17:01.361 --> 00:17:04.631
Now, this does seem slightly far-fetched,

00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:07.171
slightly unlikely, as Philby had

00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:09.241
no military training or experience.

00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:11.971
And just in case you need a reminder,

00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:14.791
Franco wasn’t assassinated, and he ruled

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:18.561
Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975.

00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:21.544
It is incredible to think that the

00:17:21.544 --> 00:17:23.334
young Philby would have been given

00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:25.574
such a mission so early on in his

00:17:25.574 --> 00:17:28.204
spying career, but as we will see

00:17:28.394 --> 00:17:30.554
throughout this mini-series, the story

00:17:30.594 --> 00:17:32.594
of the Cambridge Five is filled with

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:36.204
strange coincidences and lucky escapes.

00:17:36.964 --> 00:17:39.244
Take for example the time when Franco’s

00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:41.454
guards searched Philby but didn’t

00:17:41.464 --> 00:17:43.454
find the piece of paper he had written

00:17:43.454 --> 00:17:45.624
his secret codes down on - codes for

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:48.204
communicating and sending secret messages.

00:17:49.274 --> 00:17:52.104
Philby then got lucky again in December

00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:55.351
of 1937 when he was the sole survivor

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.824
after a bomb landed in front of his car.

00:17:58.794 --> 00:18:00.824
The other passengers, all foreign

00:18:00.824 --> 00:18:02.494
journalists too, were killed,

00:18:02.794 --> 00:18:04.054
and the nationalist soldiers

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:06.464
used Philby as a propaganda tool.

00:18:07.334 --> 00:18:09.924
Incredibly, he was even given the Red

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.354
Cross of Military Merit by Franco.

00:18:13.944 --> 00:18:15.674
Now by the time the Second World

00:18:15.674 --> 00:18:18.984
War had started in 1939, all of the

00:18:18.984 --> 00:18:21.584
Cambridge Five had done exactly as

00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:23.304
their Soviet handlers had hoped for.

00:18:24.134 --> 00:18:25.394
They had established themselves

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:27.484
and started careers in key

00:18:27.484 --> 00:18:29.444
branches of the British political

00:18:29.594 --> 00:18:31.014
and intelligence establishment.

00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:33.094
Some of them were in the Foreign

00:18:33.094 --> 00:18:35.374
Office, or interacting with influential

00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:37.784
people in the BBC and British Army.

00:18:38.874 --> 00:18:41.244
As war in Europe began, the Cambridge

00:18:41.244 --> 00:18:43.344
spy ring were also approached by

00:18:43.384 --> 00:18:45.124
British intelligence, who thought

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.194
that their education, experiences

00:18:47.304 --> 00:18:49.084
and contacts would make them

00:18:49.154 --> 00:18:51.224
excellent candidates to be spies.

00:18:51.954 --> 00:18:53.164
British spies, that is.

00:18:54.504 --> 00:18:58.044
Philby was recruited into MI6, and some

00:18:58.044 --> 00:19:00.334
of the others were interviewed or worked

00:19:00.364 --> 00:19:02.204
informally for British intelligence.

00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:05.414
Crucially, owing to their privileged

00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.494
backgrounds and respected families,

00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:10.524
very little [if any] security

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.164
checks were done on the men.

00:19:13.004 --> 00:19:16.044
They were, simply put, assumed to be ‘good

00:19:16.084 --> 00:19:18.454
chaps’ because of who they were - they had

00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:20.674
come from good families, gone to the right

00:19:20.674 --> 00:19:23.364
schools, gone to Cambridge, they behaved

00:19:23.514 --> 00:19:25.614
like a British gentleman should behave.

00:19:26.474 --> 00:19:28.334
They were perfectly positioned for

00:19:28.374 --> 00:19:31.182
Act Two, what would turn out to be

00:19:31.182 --> 00:19:33.502
the most prolific and treacherous

00:19:33.532 --> 00:19:35.772
spy ring in British history.

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:40.412
Ok then, that’s it for part one on

00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:41.972
this mini-series on the Cambridge

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.232
Five, part one of this wonderful story.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.442
Next up we’ll get into the real ins and

00:19:47.442 --> 00:19:49.762
outs of what they did, how they did it,

00:19:49.812 --> 00:19:52.522
and how their personal vices got in the

00:19:52.522 --> 00:19:55.172
way, or perhaps even helped them, in

00:19:55.172 --> 00:19:57.052
their quest to betray their country.

00:19:57.712 --> 00:19:59.402
You've been listening to English Learning

00:19:59.402 --> 00:20:01.942
for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:02.412 --> 00:20:04.842
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:20:04.842 --> 00:20:06.872
I'll catch you in the next episode.

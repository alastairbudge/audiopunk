Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:17.317
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:21.817
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:29.797
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to go on a whistle stop tour of the history of London.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.147
London is a city that I imagine you might have visited.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:42.197
Indeed, 30 million people visit London every single year, and are captured by the magic of the city.

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:48.937
But in today’s episode we are going to go a little deeper than red buses, Big

00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:54.497
Ben and Trafalgar Square, and go on a journey through the history of London.

00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:59.487
We’ll go all the way back to the founding of London, we’ll explain

00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:04.567
how there really are two Londons, we’ll meet the Vikings, the plague,

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:11.207
great fires, poverty, opportunity, wars, trains, Nazis, and more.

00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:17.927
I’m really excited to share this story with you, so let’s get started right away.

00:01:19.307 --> 00:01:25.709
The story of London starts, like many great stories do, with the Romans, who founded

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:31.839
the city they called Londinium, after they invaded the British Isles in AD43.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.539
Historians are divided over whether there were any prehistoric

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.299
settlements in the area beforehand, any Bronze age settlements, so we will

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.639
conveniently skip over that part, and start with the arrival of the Romans.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.829
Let’s first remind ourselves of exactly where London is.

00:01:54.449 --> 00:02:00.639
Well, you probably know it’s in the south east of the British Isles, about 80km

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:06.869
from the south coast of the country, and less than 50km from the east coast.

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:13.439
Through the middle of modern London runs the Thames river, which runs from

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.469
west to east, and becomes a large estuary shortly to the east of London.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.949
The Thames is a wide, tidal river, meaning it is easy to

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.459
sail all the way up the river to where modern London is.

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:36.859
You wouldn’t know it now, but thousands of years ago the site where modern London stands

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:44.539
was a boggy meadow, it was the kind of wet ground you sometimes find near a large river.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.776
So, when the Romans arrived in Britain, they would have sailed up this large river

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:56.301
and decided that this area had qualities that would make it a good place to live.

00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:03.101
They built their settlement on the northern bank of the river, on what is now

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:09.501
called The City of London, the area that is now a hub for business and finance.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.351
Construction of Londinium is thought to have started shortly after

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:21.941
AD43, and the Romans turned it into, essentially, another Roman town.

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:29.781
It would have had a forum, even a gladiatorial amphitheatre, large houses with underfloor

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:36.021
heating, and looked similar to many Roman settlements you would find in other parts of Europe.

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:41.921
No doubt the underfloor heating came in more useful than it did in Sicily, for

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:47.301
example, and perhaps it took the Romans a bit of getting used to the climate.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:50.191
Londinium prospered.

00:03:50.691 --> 00:03:55.821
It became a centre for trade, and soon the town, or perhaps

00:03:55.821 --> 00:04:00.431
we can even call it a city, had around 60,000 inhabitants.

00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.151
Much like it is today, it was a cosmopolitan city.

00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:08.631
People from all over the Roman empire lived there.

00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:14.781
Some people came to seek fame and fortune, to make money through trade.

00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:19.661
Others would have come there involuntarily; archaeologists

00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.451
have found the remains of slaves from all over the empire.

00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.471
The Romans even managed to build a bridge over the wide river Thames.

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:36.231
It is even believed to have been able to open to allow large ships to pass through.

00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:44.131
The point is that London, or rather Londinium, was not some poor colonial outpost.

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:48.111
It was a centre for trade, it was a desirable place to

00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:51.301
be, a place where you could make a name for yourself.

00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.041
Only around 10 years after Londinium was founded,

00:04:56.091 --> 00:05:00.231
though, everything had almost been stopped in its tracks.

00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.881
The city was burned to the ground by a native Celtic

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:09.331
tribe led by a fierce warrior queen called Boudica.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.961
Boudica’s father, a king of a local British tribe, had died,

00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:19.071
and the Romans had tried to take his land and property.

00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:26.051
He only had daughters, and Roman law didn’t allow a daughter to inherit anything.

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.444
After Boudica protested, she was flogged, which means beaten

00:05:31.454 --> 00:05:35.597
with a stick or a whip, and her two daughters were raped.

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:43.172
Understandably furious about this treatment, she raised an army and marched on Londinium,

00:05:43.397 --> 00:05:49.087
successfully defeating the Roman soldiers in her way and burning the city to the ground.

00:05:49.847 --> 00:05:55.267
The revolt was eventually put down, but it was a real blow for Roman

00:05:55.267 --> 00:06:00.764
rule in Britain, and reportedly Nero, who was the Roman emperor at the

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:05.794
time, seriously considered withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain.

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:12.354
He didn’t, and Londonium bounced back, becoming this important outpost

00:06:12.374 --> 00:06:17.514
of the Roman empire, and the capital of the Roman province of Brittanium.

00:06:18.584 --> 00:06:25.104
After the Romans left Britain, in the 4th century AD, Londinium fell into ruins.

00:06:25.354 --> 00:06:32.634
It’s believed that Anglo Saxons started to settle nearby, just to the west of the city, around

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:40.874
the 6th century AD, in an area now known as Aldwych, very close to modern day Covent Garden.

00:06:41.824 --> 00:06:46.864
On a linguistic note, the name Aldwych actually comes from the Anglo

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:52.874
Saxon, “Ald”, meaning “old”, and “wych” meaning “village” or “farm”.

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:58.944
The Anglo Saxon settlement was small and unimportant compared to

00:06:59.174 --> 00:07:05.004
Londinium, and is thought to have had only 7,000 people at its peak.

00:07:05.544 --> 00:07:10.294
And of course, there was no grand Roman empire, and very limited

00:07:10.374 --> 00:07:14.774
international trade opportunities compared to several hundred years before.

00:07:15.974 --> 00:07:22.794
In the 9th and 10th centuries the Vikings found that the wide river Thames provided easy

00:07:22.804 --> 00:07:29.544
access to Britain, and there were frequent raiding parties that made life pretty uncomfortable.

00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:37.614
London was hard to defend, given that it was so easy to get there by boat, and there are

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:44.428
stories of fierce battles between the Anglo Saxons and the Vikings, neither of whom were

00:07:44.578 --> 00:07:50.438
actually originally from Britain - in the Anglo Saxons case they had come to Britain

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:56.398
in the 5th century AD, and the Vikings were of course from modern day Scandinavia.

00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:03.638
Now, moving on to our next serious immigrant to rule over the city, William the Conqueror.

00:08:04.858 --> 00:08:12.128
He arrived in Britain in 1066, and after proving victorious over the Anglo Saxon king,

00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:19.528
Harold, he proclaimed himself ruler and was crowned king on Christmas Day of 1066.

00:08:20.308 --> 00:08:26.948
The location for his coronation was to be Westminster Abbey, the magnificent church

00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:32.492
that had been built by the Anglo-Saxon king, Edward The Confessor, six years beforehand.

00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:39.552
And indeed, ever since the coronation of William the Conqueror 955 years

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:44.702
ago, every single English monarch has been crowned in exactly the same place.

00:08:45.472 --> 00:08:50.722
William the Conqueror, who is also known as William I, started construction

00:08:50.882 --> 00:08:55.802
on his own magnificent building, his own castle, on the original site

00:08:55.952 --> 00:09:01.502
of Londinium, around 5km to the east of Westminster, along the river.

00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:07.192
His construction is what we now know as The Tower of London.

00:09:08.092 --> 00:09:13.352
You have probably seen pictures of it, and perhaps you have even been there.

00:09:14.112 --> 00:09:17.772
It is a magnificent fortress, built out of stone.

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:25.582
Against the backdrop of modern day skyscrapers, it might not look so large and

00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:32.012
mighty, but to the local population who would only have been used to one or two

00:09:32.012 --> 00:09:37.412
storey buildings, it must have looked very imposing, which was the idea of course.

00:09:38.772 --> 00:09:40.712
William made London his capital.

00:09:40.942 --> 00:09:46.022
The Anglo-Saxon kings had used Winchester, a city to the south west of

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:51.212
London, but William had decided that the capital of the country he was to

00:09:51.212 --> 00:09:56.502
rule should be here, on the Thames river, on the site the Romans had chosen.

00:09:57.952 --> 00:10:03.212
Moving into the Middle Ages, London continued to grow and prosper.

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:07.442
A bridge was built between the north of the river, where the

00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:12.222
settlement was, and the south an area now known as Southwark.

00:10:12.872 --> 00:10:18.422
Its name was London Bridge, and interestingly enough it was the only bridge across

00:10:18.422 --> 00:10:25.992
the river Thames in London for 500 years - the next bridge wasn’t built until 1739.

00:10:27.132 --> 00:10:33.362
So, when one thinks about the geography of London at this time, and this is really

00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:39.402
the case until pretty much the 17th century, there was “London”, which was the

00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:45.372
city of London, and was where there’s the modern day “City”, the financial hub.

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:52.522
Then there was Westminster, where the abbey was, and where the government business was conducted.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:59.312
And south of the river there really wasn’t very much at all, certainly not compared to today.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:05.432
The south was hard to get to, because the city only contained one

00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:10.822
bridge, and all of the action happened in a comparatively small area,

00:11:10.952 --> 00:11:15.322
the city of London, which was not much larger than a square kilometre.

00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:22.262
There was often great tension between Westminster, the seat of the king or queen,

00:11:22.352 --> 00:11:27.762
and the city of London, which is where the merchants lived and did business.

00:11:28.652 --> 00:11:34.232
The monarch needed the merchants, because they brought wealth to the country, and the

00:11:34.232 --> 00:11:40.142
merchants needed the support of the monarch, because he or she was the Head of State.

00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:47.492
You can see an excellent example of this tension, or perhaps we should say mutually

00:11:47.772 --> 00:11:53.292
beneficial relationship, if you go to the Southwark Docks in London and visit the

00:11:53.302 --> 00:12:00.704
Golden Hind, the ship that Sir Francis Drake used to sail around the world in 1577.

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:07.792
Sir Francis Drake was sponsored by Queen Elizabeth I to go on this mission,

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:13.232
with the understanding that she would benefit from it if he were successful.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:22.192
When Drake returned three years later with a ship full of gold and riches, he donated half of

00:12:22.192 --> 00:12:28.952
it to his queen, which was thought to be enough money to pay off the national debt at the time.

00:12:29.912 --> 00:12:35.102
Indeed, this tension is something that you can still see today in London.

00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:42.462
The city may have swelled, it may have grown so big that Westminster and The City are

00:12:42.552 --> 00:12:49.182
both part of London, but there is a real tension between the businesspeople who believe

00:12:49.332 --> 00:12:55.012
they run the city, to the east, and the politicians who control the laws, to the west.

00:12:55.612 --> 00:12:59.192
They both need each other, and it is a constant game

00:12:59.192 --> 00:13:03.402
of cat and mouse to try to get one up on each other.

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:10.732
Now, while London has enjoyed a relatively peaceful history when one compares it to

00:13:10.732 --> 00:13:17.142
cities such as Paris or Moscow, it has certainly experienced some difficult times.

00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:22.272
When the first Black Death, the first plague, arrived

00:13:22.282 --> 00:13:27.122
in 1348, it wiped out, it killed half the population.

00:13:27.912 --> 00:13:35.262
Different varieties of the plague returned 40 times over the next 300 years, and London’s

00:13:35.342 --> 00:13:42.092
status as a maritime trade centre meant that all sorts of diseases made their way to the city.

00:13:43.452 --> 00:13:48.472
If you have listened to episode 115 you will know all about The Great

00:13:48.572 --> 00:13:54.726
Fire of London, which burned down substantial parts of the city in 1666.

00:13:55.482 --> 00:14:00.722
London was rebuilt from the ground up shortly afterwards, large parts of

00:14:00.722 --> 00:14:05.664
which were designed by one individual, an architect named Christopher Wren.

00:14:06.352 --> 00:14:10.692
He designed the St Paul’s Cathedral that you see today, as well

00:14:10.692 --> 00:14:14.132
as countless other churches and buildings all over the city.

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:20.232
Indeed, above where he is buried in St Paul’s Cathedral the memorial

00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:24.992
reads “'Reader, if you seek his memorial - look around you.”

00:14:25.652 --> 00:14:30.152
Essentially, the entire city is his memorial, so just look

00:14:30.172 --> 00:14:34.042
around the city and you will see his work, his legacy.

00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:40.926
Now, let’s just pause for a moment and take stock of what is happening in various

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:47.096
parts of London after the Great Fire of London, in the latter half of the 17th century.

00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:52.346
The population of the city is around half a million people.

00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:57.716
It has started to spill over westwards, out of the original Roman city.

00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:06.546
Further west, in modern day Soho and the West End, wealthy families had been building grand houses.

00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:11.496
These areas were chosen because they were far away from

00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:16.096
the city, with its polluting industry and nasty smells.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.376
There were great parks, such as Hyde Park, which King Henry VIII had

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:27.226
taken from the Catholic Church and turned into his private hunting park.

00:15:28.076 --> 00:15:33.426
South of these parks was Westminster, the political centre, which contained

00:15:33.436 --> 00:15:37.906
the Palace of Whitehall, the large palace where the monarch would live.

00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:42.256
To the east of the city of London was the docklands,

00:15:42.286 --> 00:15:46.286
the area where boats would be loaded and unloaded.

00:15:47.036 --> 00:15:54.566
The banks of the river Thames would be covered by warehouses, and boats would be dragged up out

00:15:54.606 --> 00:16:01.532
of the river to be unloaded, connecting London with, well, anywhere that was reachable by sea.

00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:07.032
And the city of London, the core of the growing

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:11.982
metropolis, was the centre for trade, business, and life.

00:16:13.052 --> 00:16:19.832
As the global trade network continued to grow, and organisations such as the British East

00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:26.062
India Company brought back great wealth to the country from all corners of the world, this

00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:33.582
translated into great wealth and prosperity for the city, and for a minority of its residents.

00:16:34.612 --> 00:16:41.912
Merchants grew fabulously rich, but life for the average Londoner was still pretty grim.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.912
With the arrival of The Industrial Revolution in the late 18th

00:16:46.932 --> 00:16:51.542
century, the construction of factories in the city and the subsequent

00:16:51.832 --> 00:16:56.992
influx of people to the city, it got even more so, even more grim.

00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:04.062
The population swelled to 2.4 million by 1850, and living

00:17:04.062 --> 00:17:08.412
conditions were terrible for the majority of the urban population.

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:15.612
The plight of the urban poor at this time, in Victorian London, was chronicled by

00:17:15.622 --> 00:17:21.572
journalists such as a man named Charles Mayhew, who wrote an extensive research

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:26.572
piece called “London Labour and the London Poor”, and really helped people

00:17:26.572 --> 00:17:32.002
in power understand quite the extent of the poverty that existed in London.

00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:39.102
The poor also became the subject of novels, most significantly by Charles Dickens.

00:17:39.832 --> 00:17:43.582
Most of his books are set in London, and deal with the

00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:48.062
squalor and terrible conditions that most people lived in.

00:17:49.222 --> 00:17:55.192
Oliver Twist, for example, deals with the life of a gang of pickpockets, villains

00:17:55.342 --> 00:18:01.971
and prostitutes, and has the horrible smell and darkness of London as its backdrop.

00:18:03.141 --> 00:18:08.741
Fifty years after the publication of Oliver Twist, when conditions hadn’t really

00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:13.961
improved at all for the average Londoner, the serial killer Jack The Ripper

00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:20.100
claimed his first victim, and terrorised the city in the late summer of 1888.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.900
For more on that, by the way, you can listen to episode number 30.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.970
At the turn of the 20th century the population of London had

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:37.130
reached 6.5 million, and it was to peak at 8.6 million in 1939.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:46.329
By this time it had started to spread its tentacles north, west, south and slightly to the east.

00:18:47.229 --> 00:18:51.479
I say only “slightly” to the east because the original city of

00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:56.169
London is already to the east of what we consider London today.

00:18:57.129 --> 00:19:00.739
This growth was enabled by the creation of the

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:05.007
underground railway system, which Londoners call The Tube.

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:12.889
It opened in 1863, connecting the train stations on the edge of the city to the centre.

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:19.419
It is no exaggeration to say that the arrival of the tube transformed London.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:24.929
It meant that people could travel more quickly and more easily around

00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:29.679
the city, meaning it became less important to live close to the centre.

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:35.293
The result of this was that London continued to grow outwards,

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:39.829
and started to become the sprawling metropolis that it is today.

00:19:40.939 --> 00:19:45.689
The word for this sprawl is the suburbs, or even suburbia.

00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:51.585
What were previously villages outside London, such as places like

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:57.235
Highgate or Wimbledon, were gobbled up, they were engulfed by the city.

00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:03.785
The creation of these suburbs, and the fact you could easily get there by

00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:09.185
public transport, allowed Londoners to escape the chaos, overcrowding and smells

00:20:09.205 --> 00:20:17.205
of city centre life, and live a semi-rural, or at least pretend rural life.

00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:24.365
Houses in the suburbs were advertised as having fresh air, gardens, and nature.

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:30.235
Instead of a single family living in one room, a house in the suburbs

00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:35.045
meant everyone could have their own room, a garden, and live an English

00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:39.775
countryside life all while being able to easily get to the city centre.

00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:46.405
As a consequence, the population swelled, and during the reign of

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:51.812
Queen Victoria it had quadrupled in size, it had gone up four times.

00:20:52.932 --> 00:20:57.642
London was not just the capital of England, not just the capital of the

00:20:57.642 --> 00:21:02.792
United Kingdom, but it was the capital of the British Empire, an empire

00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:08.692
that at its peak ruled over 450 million people all over the world.

00:21:09.892 --> 00:21:13.272
During the First and Second World Wars, like in most

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:17.212
of Europe, the development of London ground to a halt.

00:21:17.992 --> 00:21:24.682
The bombing of London during World War II, otherwise known as The Blitz, is well documented,

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:30.242
but not many people are aware that the city was also bombed during The First World War.

00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:37.852
The Blitz caused the deaths of around 40,000 Londoners, and the destruction of 2

00:21:37.852 --> 00:21:43.982
million homes, primarily in the poor East End of the city and around the docks.

00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:50.392
So, the period after The Second World War, the post-war years,

00:21:50.472 --> 00:21:55.672
were characterised by rebuilding, and even a resetting of London.

00:21:56.802 --> 00:22:02.232
The destruction of large parts of the city, although tragic, allowed for the

00:22:02.232 --> 00:22:07.762
reconstruction of buildings that were better suited for the future London.

00:22:09.002 --> 00:22:13.459
Old single or two storey houses, especially in the East

00:22:13.469 --> 00:22:18.639
End, were pulled down to make way for larger tower blocks.

00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:22.689
There were large numbers of immigrants coming from the

00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:27.219
disbanding British colonies, in particular from the West Indies.

00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:33.241
London became an ever more multicultural city, with more immigrants arriving from

00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:40.316
South Asia, countries such as Pakistan and India in particular, in the 1960s and 1970s.

00:22:41.378 --> 00:22:46.311
Nowadays, the UK's immigrant population is concentrated in London.

00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:52.702
Around 35% of people living in the UK who were born abroad live in the

00:22:52.702 --> 00:22:58.342
capital city, while London contains only 13% of the UK’s population.

00:22:59.012 --> 00:23:03.642
Similarly, around 37% of people who live in London were

00:23:03.642 --> 00:23:09.042
born outside the UK, compared to 14% for the UK as a whole.

00:23:10.272 --> 00:23:14.012
Although London is now one of the most multicultural cities in

00:23:14.012 --> 00:23:14.794
the world, the transition from majority-white English city of the

00:23:14.794 --> 00:23:25.653
Victorian era to the global city of 2021 has not always been smooth.

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:32.138
From the rise of the British fascists in the 1930s who were protesting against

00:23:32.298 --> 00:23:38.358
immigration and then numerous race riots triggered by police brutality in the

00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:45.668
1980s, 1990s and even in the last decade, it has not always been an easy transition.

00:23:47.038 --> 00:23:52.768
Now, this brings us almost to the London of today, a truly global

00:23:52.768 --> 00:23:58.588
city, a hub of business, music, art, culture, finance, literature.

00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:05.038
If there is one word that we can certainly use about London, it is adaptable.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:11.720
No matter what seems to happen to it, it bounces back, it seems to emerge stronger.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:18.100
From being burned to the ground by Queen Boudica to half its residents being killed

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:23.960
by The Black Death, from suffering from tragic overpopulation and poverty in the

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.450
Victorian era through to being almost razed to the ground by the Nazis, and then

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:36.030
navigating the transition from port, trade city through to the global financial

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:41.739
city it is today, London has certainly shown that it has the capacity to change.

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:46.929
It is a city that has attracted people from all over the world.

00:24:47.309 --> 00:24:54.639
Mozart, Handel, Jimmy Hendrix, Charlie Chaplin, Audrey Hepburn, Engels, Garibaldi, Samuel

00:24:54.639 --> 00:25:01.719
Beckett, Marilyn Monroe, even Karl Marx haven’t been able to resist the pull of this amazing city.

00:25:02.469 --> 00:25:06.259
If you haven’t ever been to London, then I would certainly recommend a

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:11.769
trip, especially as Brexit has meant the pound is a lot cheaper than it

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:17.009
was, so you’ll find that London isn’t nearly as expensive as it used to be.

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:22.755
And if you do go, or even if you have been already and want to go back,

00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:28.442
then go and stand in the old city, where the Romans first built Londinium.

00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:34.995
It is now a bustling metropolis, full of men and women in suits and smart clothes

00:25:35.155 --> 00:25:40.295
rushing around carrying sandwiches and coffees, talking into their mobile phones.

00:25:40.745 --> 00:25:46.055
But pause for a minute, close your eyes, and imagine the amazing

00:25:46.055 --> 00:25:50.435
journey that this city has gone on over the past 2,000 years.

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:57.555
One can only imagine what the next 2,000 years hold for Londinium, but if history

00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:03.572
is anything to go by, it is certainly ready for anything anyone can throw at it.

00:26:05.034 --> 00:26:10.565
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The History of London.

00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:15.655
We have done a really quick tour through the history, and skipped over a lot of

00:26:15.655 --> 00:26:21.015
juicy bits, but I hope this might have whetted your appetite to find out more.

00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:28.925
From the impact that Henry VIII had on the city to Shakespeare to the Gin Craze, there is simply a

00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:34.915
huge amount to say about the history of London, and as a result we haven’t had time for everything.

00:26:35.735 --> 00:26:41.235
One obvious omission, perhaps, one obvious thing that we have not covered, is the

00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:46.945
dialect that people speak in London, Cockney Rhyming Slang, but the good news is

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:52.605
that there is an entire episode, episode 140, where you can learn all about that.

00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:57.365
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:26:57.695 --> 00:27:01.265
If you have been to London, how much of this history did you know?

00:27:01.735 --> 00:27:05.965
If you have been on a tour or have friends from London, what other

00:27:05.995 --> 00:27:09.645
interesting facts or stories do you know about London’s history?

00:27:10.085 --> 00:27:14.175
Let's get this discussion started, the place you can go for that

00:27:14.325 --> 00:27:18.625
is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.414
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:20.414
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:26.854
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Rise of Hollywood.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:33.564
It is the district to the north-west of Los Angeles that has become the global home of filmmaking.

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:36.854
But Hollywood is more than a patch of land.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:41.734
The word Hollywood has come to mean more than the place itself, it means big

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:47.085
movies, American cinema,  it evokes glitz   and glamour, and show business.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:52.435
So in this episode we’re going to look at how Hollywood became, well, Hollywood.

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:57.795
How did this small piece of land on America’s West Coast become the home

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:02.875
of cinema, what phases did it go through, what challenges did it overcome,

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:07.335
and what lies ahead for the future of the American movie industry.

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:09.565
Let’s get right into it.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:18.395
Now, to begin our story, perhaps it’s useful to imagine a world without film, without moving images.

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:24.525
The first photograph was taken in 1826, and it wasn’t until

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:29.685
1878, over 50 years later, that the first film was made.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:36.635
Now, perhaps we can’t really call it a film, but in 1878 the first

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:41.865
moving images were created by the English photographer, Edward Muybridge.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:47.625
He placed 12 cameras along a horse racing track, and

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.255
took photos of the galloping horse in quick succession.

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:58.935
He then created a device to view twelve photo frames of the horse one after the other at high speed.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.765
The result was the moving image of a galloping horse.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:08.265
Now, although this might not seem like much to us now, you can

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:13.201
imagine it must have been pretty amazing to someone back in 1878.

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:17.635
Can you imagine how exciting it must have been to see that first

00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:22.275
image come flickering to life on the screen, as if by magic?

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:27.615
Although he didn’t know it, it would be the tiny seed that would

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:32.495
eventually lead to Hollywood and the multi-billion dollar film industry.

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:39.375
Soon after, in 1885, Americans George Eastman and William H.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:43.075
Walker invented the first film for motion photography.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:47.955
At around the same time, the French brothers Auguste and Louis

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:53.315
Lumiere created a hand-cranked, a hand-operated machine called the

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:59.055
cinematograph to capture and project still frames in quick succession.

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:04.385
At the turn of the twentieth century, film technology made great

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:09.215
advancements, allowing independent filmmakers to experiment creatively.

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:14.945
One of the most famous movies of this time was The Great Train

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:20.492
Robbery, a 12-minute silent Western produced in 1903 by Edwin S.

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:21.012
Porter.

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:28.452
‘Nickelodeons’, or 5-cent movie theatres, started to offer cheap access to the general public

00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:35.002
to sit in the dark and be transported to the world of crackling black and white silent films.

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:41.232
An appetite for film was already growing and by the end of World War I, the

00:03:41.232 --> 00:03:46.112
United States was on the brink of an economic boom and with it, a motion

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:51.062
picture industry was on the rise in one particular neighbourhood of Los Angeles.

00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:55.482
That neighbourhood was, of course, called Hollywood.

00:03:56.442 --> 00:04:00.862
Now why, you might be asking yourself, why would this area

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:05.522
become the mecca for, the global centre of, the film industry?

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:10.052
Los Angeles is now the second largest city in the United

00:04:10.052 --> 00:04:14.372
States, but in 1900 it wasn’t even in the top ten.

00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:22.712
The reasons that the film industry grew in this area of the world are both legal and meteorological.

00:04:24.112 --> 00:04:29.292
Firstly, Thomas Edison, who you may remember from our episodes on The

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:34.712
War of The Currents, Edison held important patents related to filmmaking.

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:39.292
Edison had invented something called the kinetoscope,

00:04:39.302 --> 00:04:42.782
which was a device people could use to watch movies.

00:04:43.372 --> 00:04:47.582
He also teamed up with other companies that made things like the

00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:53.022
film for cameras, and he aggressively sued people who used any of his

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:57.139
filmmaking technology without his patents, without his permission.

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:04.349
This essentially made it impossible for anyone to make a film without paying Edison.

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.339
Importantly, these patents were not applicable in Hollywood, so filmmakers could

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.439
go there and be free from the clutches of this famously litigious inventor.

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:22.849
And secondly, compared to the East Coast, which was where most films had been

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:29.249
made before, Los Angeles is lovely and sunny, and California has wonderful nature.

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.259
The long hours of natural sunlight meant longer days to

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.159
film in daylight, and less reliance on artificial lighting.

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:43.839
And the Californian terrain was great to make movies,

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.819
especially if you were filming something like a Cowboys vs.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.739
Indians movie.

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.309
Soon, the very first film studios in Hollywood started to be built.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.789
It was the beginning of a new era that would take the world by storm and introduce the public

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:07.509
to the world of storytelling through moving pictures, albeit silent pictures to begin with.

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:14.289
In 1912 Universal Pictures - the oldest movie studio in the US - was founded.

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.089
Paramount followed the same year.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:23.047
And just a couple of years later, in 1914, the first “Hollywood” movie was made.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.047
According to industry legend, it was a Western called

00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:31.487
The Squaw Man, and was directed by a man called Cecil B.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:32.347
DeMille.

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:37.437
The quintessentially American Western genre grew out of

00:06:37.437 --> 00:06:40.777
a well-established fictional tradition of “the Western”.

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.277
It centred around a lead male cowboy protagonist who

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:49.637
straddled the boundary between the wild west and civilisation.

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:55.277
These were action stories set in the rugged deserts of the New World.

00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:59.957
Self-reliant characters were seen conquering the landscape under the

00:06:59.957 --> 00:07:05.727
hot sun, with plots often culminating in gunfights and galloping horses.

00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:09.307
It was a genre that would endure for decades.

00:07:09.707 --> 00:07:12.587
But it wasn’t all gunslinging cowboys.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:19.857
Around this time, the iconic Englishman, Charlie Chaplin was fast becoming the most famous actor.

00:07:20.457 --> 00:07:25.367
Chaplin’s distinctive appearance, unique charisma, and humour charmed

00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:30.287
audiences and he soon became the best known actor of the early 20th century

00:07:30.427 --> 00:07:36.337
and an enduring iconic cinematic figure even after his death in 1977.

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:42.337
By the 1920s, even though the movies were still silent, there was no

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:47.607
dialogue, everyday people were becoming enthralled and seduced by Hollywood.

00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:49.787
But there was even more was to come.

00:07:50.397 --> 00:07:56.477
The 1920s gave birth to two key roles behind and in front of the screen

00:07:56.767 --> 00:08:01.317
that were to draw even bigger crowds: the film director and the movie star.

00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:08.837
The creation of heroic and beautiful screen personas made audiences flock to the cinema to see

00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:15.207
their favourite film stars, such as the mysterious Greta Garbo, the beautiful Joan Crawford,

00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:21.667
heroic Buster Keaton and Hollywood’s original handsome Latin lover, Rudolph Valentino.

00:08:22.527 --> 00:08:27.127
The age of screen fame and celebrity culture was just beginning.

00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:32.607
Meanwhile, directors were starting to realise that they could create their

00:08:32.717 --> 00:08:37.697
own style of filmmaking and sell more cinema tickets with iconic actors

00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:43.417
that audiences loved, envied, and wanted to emulate, wanted to be like.

00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:48.937
With hundreds of movies being made each year, Hollywood was starting to dominate

00:08:48.947 --> 00:08:53.627
American culture, and attracting socialites to its glamorous party scene.

00:08:54.637 --> 00:09:01.280
The 1920s was also the decade when it became clear that filmmaking could be big business.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.343
In 1923, four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam,  and Jack

00:09:07.603 --> 00:09:10.553
incorporated their company, Warner Brothers Pictures.

00:09:11.353 --> 00:09:15.853
Later the same year, Disney was founded by brothers Walt and Roy O.

00:09:15.853 --> 00:09:18.563
Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:23.053
And in 1924 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was founded.

00:09:23.883 --> 00:09:30.441
You might not know the name  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but you might recognise its initials: MGM.

00:09:31.373 --> 00:09:35.383
And if you don’t recognise the initials MGM, you’ve

00:09:35.393 --> 00:09:39.433
probably seen a movie with a lion roaring at the start.

00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:41.243
That’s an MGM movie.

00:09:42.703 --> 00:09:46.633
To this day, Warner Brothers, Disney, and MGM, are still

00:09:46.643 --> 00:09:49.993
three of the largest and most powerful Hollywood studios.

00:09:50.943 --> 00:09:55.181
But Hollywood’s Golden Age, as it came to be known, reached

00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:59.140
its peak in the 1930s when  sound came to the cinema.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.210
Silent movies quickly became a thing of the past as there is

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.610
clearly a lot more you can do with a film if there’s dialogue.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.140
Having movies with sound allowed for new genres to emerge.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.840
Action films, action musicals, documentaries, comedies, horror

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.960
movies, and, well, practically every genre we still enjoy today.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.160
It also allowed for a new type of actor to emerge, and stars such as

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.690
Laurence Olivier and Shirley Temple became hugely famous overnight.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:39.150
Audiences couldn’t get enough of Hollywood’s magic and glamour, and going to

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:44.230
the movies was practically a national pastime, an official American hobby.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.701
At this time, during the 1930s that is, approximately sixty-five

00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:54.441
percent of the US population went to the cinema on a weekly basis.

00:10:55.491 --> 00:11:01.911
To give you an idea of how things have changed, now only 8% of Americans go every month.

00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:09.271
Meanwhile, Los Angeles, or more specifically, Hollywood, was becoming a mecca for

00:11:09.281 --> 00:11:15.151
thousands of would-be actors looking for their big break, that one chance to become a star.

00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:20.101
Cinema had evolved from a simple series of photo frames

00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:24.091
to a full-blown industry of grand visual illusions.

00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:29.291
Cinemagoers could not only see moving stories in all kinds of genres,

00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:32.841
they could also watch and hear their favourite actors on the big screen.

00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:38.571
And the 1940s brought more technological advances such as special

00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:43.491
effects, improved sound quality, and widespread use of Technicolour,

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:48.511
first used to the delight of audiences in The Wizard of Oz in 1939.

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:54.321
Gone were the black and white silent movies, in were coloured films with

00:11:54.321 --> 00:11:59.471
special effects, great dialogue, well-known actors and experienced directors.

00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:06.771
Although you might have thought that World War II damaged the fortunes of Hollywood, the attention

00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:12.697
was simply switched to a new type of film production: war movies and American propaganda.

00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:18.027
By 1946, a year after the end of the war, cinema

00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:22.157
attendances and profits were again at an all-time high.

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:27.353
The post-war industrial and economic boom of the 1950s

00:12:27.604 --> 00:12:31.197
created greater affluence and the rise of popular culture.

00:12:32.247 --> 00:12:39.417
But it also created the biggest threat to the cinema since its creation: the television set!

00:12:40.717 --> 00:12:45.837
Sure, the screens might have been tiny and the audiovisual quality

00:12:45.968 --> 00:12:50.208
terrible compared to nowadays, but they were magic to their new owners.

00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:55.708
Why would you want to go out when mini cinemas have just arrived in your own home?

00:12:56.608 --> 00:13:02.758
Soon, millions of American families were focussed on building bigger and better homes with all

00:13:02.828 --> 00:13:08.954
the mod cons, and more than happy to spend time there, glued to their TV sets with their families.

00:13:09.704 --> 00:13:15.974
Plummeting film studio profits led to only one question for Hollywood: What should we do now?

00:13:17.114 --> 00:13:19.654
The industry needed a new marketing strategy.

00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:25.984
Its new target audience was American teenagers, a demographic that wanted

00:13:25.984 --> 00:13:30.524
to escape their parents at home and a demographic with increasing car

00:13:30.524 --> 00:13:35.444
ownership, so what better group of people to target with a new type of movie?

00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:42.914
The new films shifted the traditional, happy-ever-after storylines and idealised characters

00:13:42.924 --> 00:13:50.694
to incorporate darker plot lines, flawed, moody characters, and anti-heroes such as Marlon

00:13:50.694 --> 00:13:58.200
Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951, and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause in 1955.

00:13:59.544 --> 00:14:03.809
At the same time, iconic stars such as Ava Gardner and Marilyn

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:07.979
Monroe were taking the screen and popular culture by storm.

00:14:09.339 --> 00:14:15.019
But it was not enough to save the failing fortunes of Hollywood and the 1950s marked the

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:21.054
industry’s diversification into television filmmaking in an attempt to boost its profits.

00:14:22.124 --> 00:14:25.593
The shift would change how we watch films forever.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:33.345
By the early 1960s, Hollywood film production was at its lowest level since the 1930s.

00:14:34.163 --> 00:14:38.123
Cinema tickets were reduced in price to try to get more people to go,

00:14:38.423 --> 00:14:43.203
while, in an effort to stay afloat, Hollywood started to make films

00:14:43.213 --> 00:14:47.503
and series specifically to be watched at home, not at the cinema.

00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:54.523
This is not to say that the 1960s were totally without their cinematic successes, though.

00:14:54.903 --> 00:14:58.993
The biggest film success of the 1960s was The Sound of

00:14:58.993 --> 00:15:04.113
Music, which was released in 1965 and grossed $163 million.

00:15:04.983 --> 00:15:08.553
The Hollywood hills might have been alive with the sound of

00:15:08.553 --> 00:15:12.293
music and yodelling, but it was not enough to save the industry.

00:15:12.893 --> 00:15:18.953
By 1970, some studios had already started to go bankrupt and the Golden Age of

00:15:18.953 --> 00:15:24.103
Hollywood was starting to look somewhat rusty, and considerably less golden.

00:15:25.473 --> 00:15:30.743
But a new era of filmmaking was quietly beginning, a ‘New Hollywood’.

00:15:31.523 --> 00:15:36.053
In the throes of the Vietnam war and political corruption, an American

00:15:36.053 --> 00:15:41.173
counterculture was emerging, taking a more critical view of the American Dream.

00:15:42.123 --> 00:15:47.153
The fall of the studio system and influence of television ushered in a new

00:15:47.153 --> 00:15:53.133
generation of directors, many inspired by the European filmmaking of the 1960s.

00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:58.718
Frances Ford Coppola epitomised the New Hollywood director and his influence

00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:03.588
and place in filmmaking history was cemented with The Godfather in 1972.

00:16:04.628 --> 00:16:09.498
This film, which I imagine you will have seen, was an exceptional commercial

00:16:09.498 --> 00:16:15.338
and critical success and revolutionised a new genre of crime and gangster films.

00:16:16.228 --> 00:16:23.008
Another New Hollywood film that changed the industry forever was Jaws, which was released in 1975.

00:16:24.028 --> 00:16:28.628
The disaster movie genre had landed and with the help of a massive

00:16:28.678 --> 00:16:33.018
advertising campaign it beat The Godfather at the box office to become

00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:38.298
the top grossing movie in Hollywood history, taking in $260 million.

00:16:39.558 --> 00:16:45.408
But two years later, the intergalactic science fiction movie Star Wars wowed

00:16:45.448 --> 00:16:52.118
audiences with its special effects, beating them all and taking in $775 million.

00:16:53.383 --> 00:16:57.508
Meanwhile, audiences were lured back to their TV sets

00:16:57.688 --> 00:17:01.198
with the advent of VHS video players in the 1970s.

00:17:02.028 --> 00:17:07.415
No longer did you have to wait for a film to be broadcast on your TV - you could now

00:17:07.445 --> 00:17:13.345
watch it whenever you wanted, simply by putting a video into a new special machine.

00:17:14.215 --> 00:17:17.855
Yet again, there was a big drop in people going to the cinema.

00:17:18.485 --> 00:17:20.825
But yet again, Hollywood fought back.

00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:25.841
If the audience would not go to the cinema, the cinema would go to the audience.

00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:32.261
The film industry decided to break into the VHS market and started making films for video.

00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:37.261
Back on the big screen, the 1980s saw the start of a

00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:41.751
slicker, more accessible, and highly marketable filmmaking.

00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:49.271
These films aimed to appeal to the lowest common denominator of interests to maximise audiences.

00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:52.881
Films became focussed on appealing to as many people as

00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:56.871
possible, not on creating beautiful works of cinematography.

00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:03.491
Scripts increasingly needed to conform to tighter and tighter formulaic plot structures and

00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:09.141
technological advancements took precedence over experimental or provocative storytelling.

00:18:10.341 --> 00:18:14.371
Financially, international big business started to buy some of the

00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:19.181
Hollywood studios, helping to secure their futures, and more films

00:18:19.221 --> 00:18:23.501
launched production in overseas locations in a bid to cut costs.

00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:27.831
Meanwhile, the budgets for actually making movies

00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:31.211
were soaring while ticket prices continued to drop.

00:18:32.024 --> 00:18:35.424
Of course, there were plenty of big successes in the 1980s.

00:18:35.904 --> 00:18:42.154
The Return of the Jedi in 1983 and Batman in 1989 were two of them, and the

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:50.268
highest-grossing film of the 1980s was ET in 1982 which brought in $793 million.

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:57.214
But moving into the 1990s, Hollywood had to battle a recession in the United States.

00:18:57.904 --> 00:19:05.604
Box office sales were hit hard as audiences opted to save their money and watch TV or rent videos.

00:19:06.694 --> 00:19:11.893
Despite this, American movie theatre audiences started to grow with the construction of

00:19:11.913 --> 00:19:18.463
bigger, more comfortable multiscreen Cineplex complexes, those massive, massive cinemas.

00:19:19.633 --> 00:19:25.163
Ever increasing advancements in special effects drew large crowds for high budget films,

00:19:25.423 --> 00:19:32.563
involving car chases, gunfights and epic battlefield scenes, such as Braveheart in 1995.

00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:36.903
As the cost of production continued to increase, the

00:19:36.903 --> 00:19:40.423
way people watched films was about to change again.

00:19:41.353 --> 00:19:46.033
In 1997 the first DVD players became available, now

00:19:46.043 --> 00:19:50.293
offering a far superior video quality than videos.

00:19:50.913 --> 00:19:56.251
This provided yet another complication for Hollywood, and combined with the larger and

00:19:56.251 --> 00:20:02.101
more affordable TVs that were now on sale, the film industry needed to fight even harder

00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:07.111
to persuade people to pull out their wallets and opt for the original “big screen”.

00:20:08.211 --> 00:20:13.461
Hollywood became increasingly reliant on big hits, home runs of films

00:20:13.461 --> 00:20:17.721
that you simply couldn’t watch and experience in the same way at home.

00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:21.501
And one in particular stood out.

00:20:22.211 --> 00:20:22.821
Titanic.

00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:28.721
In 1997 the historical, romance disaster movie hit the screens,

00:20:28.971 --> 00:20:33.001
breaking all genres and creating a tidal wave at the box office!

00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:39.174
In 1998, it became the highest grossing film in world history and remained

00:20:39.174 --> 00:20:45.618
so until Avatar in 2009, which still holds the record at $2.8 billion.

00:20:46.254 --> 00:20:54.391
In fact, including revenue, including money from the 2012 and 2017 reissues, Titanic earned

00:20:54.391 --> 00:21:04.344
$660 million in America and $1.5 billion in other countries, totalling $2.2 billion globally.

00:21:06.254 --> 00:21:13.314
But if the 1990s was the decade of the DVD and advances in high definition and surround sound

00:21:13.344 --> 00:21:20.367
IMAX technologies, the 21st century would raise the curtain on a brand-new age of watching films.

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.651
You can probably guess what we’re going to talk about

00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:27.151
now, but if you can’t, let me ask you a question.

00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:30.971
How and where did you watch your last film?

00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:37.991
The chances are that it was on a streaming service, Netflix, Amazon Prime, or something like that.

00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:44.561
The turn of the millennium brought revolutionary digital advances in technology with the roll-out

00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:51.581
of smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.

00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:57.901
Video streaming transformed the way we watch films and streaming services have skyrocketed

00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:04.821
since 2010, with 85% of Americans now subscribed to some form of streaming service.

00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:08.571
Yet again, another complication for Hollywood.

00:22:09.511 --> 00:22:13.691
As part of the streaming “wars”, Hollywood is now increasingly

00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:16.871
offering its movies on its own streaming services.

00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:23.971
If only 8% of Americans go to the movies every month, well, what percentage of Americans could

00:22:23.971 --> 00:22:29.501
Hollywood persuade to pay it a monthly subscription in return for home-access to its movies?

00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:32.611
The studios were certainly keen to find out.

00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:39.041
In 2020, WarnerMedia, the parent company of Warner Brothers, announced

00:22:39.061 --> 00:22:43.661
that it would release all of its 2021 first-run movies to its streaming

00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:48.311
service, HBO Max, at the same time as it released them to cinemas.

00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:52.391
Disney's Plus streaming service announced similar plans.

00:22:53.221 --> 00:22:59.211
Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, going “straight to DVD” was an

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:03.811
example of a film being a failure, but going “straight to streaming”

00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:08.891
in 2022 is, well, Hollywood seems to think it’s just good business.

00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:15.291
And this trend was, of course, accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:23:15.631 --> 00:23:21.591
As cinemas locked down, studios were forced to push films to digital platforms faster than ever.

00:23:22.621 --> 00:23:27.331
All of a sudden, day-one living room access to major films like Dune,

00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:32.431
Black Widow, Halloween Kills and The Matrix Resurrections was a reality.

00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:35.141
So, what was the result?

00:23:35.851 --> 00:23:41.361
Well, the US box office in 2021 was down sixty per cent from 2019.

00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:50.031
A Hollywood Reporter survey from December 2021 showed that cinemagoers aged 45 to 64 were

00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:56.291
still concerned about Covid safety, with 39% less likely to go to a movie as a result.

00:23:57.373 --> 00:24:02.556
Combined with cheaper and better “home cinemas”, some people believe all of this

00:24:02.576 --> 00:24:08.076
adds up to a poor prognosis for cinemas, but not for the film industry as a whole.

00:24:08.986 --> 00:24:13.611
Hollywood’s Golden Age may well be dead or, at least rusty,

00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:17.169
but the New Hollywood streaming model is alive and kicking.

00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:23.279
As long as people continue to love watching films, and Hollywood continues to make movies

00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:29.109
people want to watch, then it will surely find a way to turn that creativity into dollars.

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:34.259
As the just over 100-year history of Hollywood shows us, if there is

00:24:34.259 --> 00:24:38.759
one thing Hollywood is good at, it’s changing and reinventing itself.

00:24:39.399 --> 00:24:44.289
And so long as there is an almost limitless supply of actors waiting to get

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:48.889
their big break, directors and scriptwriters just waiting to get funding

00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:53.861
for their next film, and dozens of film studios eager to snag their next

00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:59.021
blockbuster, you can be sure that Hollywood isn’t going anywhere without a fight.

00:25:01.141 --> 00:25:05.661
Ok then, that is it for today's episode on The Rise of Hollywood.

00:25:06.001 --> 00:25:09.481
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned a bit about Hollywood

00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:14.251
over the years, and how it has battled to overcome the speed bumps in the road.

00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:18.261
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:25:18.641 --> 00:25:21.581
Can you remember what the first film you saw at the cinema was?

00:25:22.091 --> 00:25:24.391
What do you think the future holds for Hollywood?

00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:26.701
Can you see a world without Hollywood?

00:25:27.001 --> 00:25:29.448
Do you think people will always want to go to the cinemas to

00:25:29.471 --> 00:25:32.681
watch films with others, as well as streaming on their devices?

00:25:33.211 --> 00:25:37.261
And which Hollywood era or film is your all-time favourite?

00:25:37.937 --> 00:25:41.177
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

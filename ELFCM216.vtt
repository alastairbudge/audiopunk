Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:16.655
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:21.025
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:30.055
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part series, this time about Fast Food.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:36.315
All around the world billions of people eat fast food every single day, and

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:42.565
1% of the world’s population, 68 million people, will eat at McDonald's today.

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:50.255
In the US alone one single burger, The Whopper, is eaten every 15 seconds,

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:55.055
and globally the consumption of fast food is growing every single year.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:01.935
So, with this large subject on our plate, we are going to split it into three parts.

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:07.415
In part one, in today’s episode we’ll look at the early history of fast food,

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:12.145
where it came from and how it became such a staple dish for so many people.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:18.805
In part two, which is going to be one of our member-only ones, we’ll look at when and how

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:24.775
fast food went global, looking at some of the weird and wonderful stories of techniques

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:30.835
that especially American fast food companies used to appeal to people from different

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:37.125
cultures with different tastes, when these worked and when they failed spectacularly.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:44.815
And in part three we will look at the fast food industry today, how it has had to adapt,

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:51.015
what it is doing to us and our bodies, and what the future of fast food might look like.

00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:55.041
OK then, fast food.

00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:59.171
Now, the idea that someone might want to eat their food

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:03.051
quickly and conveniently is, of course, nothing new.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:08.351
Even going back to the ancient Romans and Greeks there are examples

00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:13.201
of what we might call public kitchens, or perhaps even “street food”.

00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:17.901
These were called Thermopolia, and you can see examples

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:21.591
of them in Southern Italy, in Pompeii and Herculaneum.

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:26.051
A merchant would cook large quantities of a particular

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:30.001
dish, and people could pay a small fee for a plate.

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:36.181
The main customers for this would typically be people who were too poor to have their

00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:41.721
own cooking facilities, so they would eat here out of necessity, not out of choice.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:45.841
And this is only the European example.

00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:51.861
It’s clearly convenient to prepare food in advance so that it is ready to eat quickly.

00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:56.171
Sushi, which many people would put in the category of “fast

00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.681
food”, traces its roots back to the second century BC.

00:03:00.861 --> 00:03:09.171
The kebab is thought to be able to be traced back to 1377, lo mein, the Americanised Chinese

00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:16.321
noodle dish, goes back 2000 years, and even the iconic British fast food, fish and chips,

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:22.351
has a history that goes back to the 16th century, and there are countless other examples.

00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:26.741
But these aren’t the main topics of today’s episode.

00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:32.171
Indeed, they are all small fry, to pardon the pun, compared to

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:37.377
fast food in the 20th century, in particular American fast food.

00:03:37.907 --> 00:03:40.567
And that will be the focus for today.

00:03:41.197 --> 00:03:47.067
We’ll look at how the fast food industry over the past 100 years went from almost

00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:53.357
nothing to a type of food that literally billions of people eat on a frequent basis.

00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:56.577
So, where did it all start?

00:03:57.087 --> 00:04:01.727
Well, it might not surprise you to find out that our story starts

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:07.327
in the United States, in Wichita, Kansas, in 1921, 100 years ago.

00:04:08.587 --> 00:04:15.537
Two men, Walt Anderson and Edgar Ingram had started up a restaurant called White Castle.

00:04:16.407 --> 00:04:22.387
After being frustrated at how long some meatballs were taking to cook, Anderson

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:29.977
reportedly smashed down one on the griddle, creating a small square hamburger.

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:36.167
He saw that this cooked quickly, and unlike larger burgers, it

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:40.767
didn’t need to be flipped, it didn’t need to be cooked on both sides.

00:04:41.757 --> 00:04:45.757
He decided to test serving this out to his customers,

00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:49.857
wrapped in between two pieces of bread, the hamburger bun.

00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:56.127
His customers loved them, and this type of small hamburger, nicknamed

00:04:56.357 --> 00:05:00.607
The Slider, later became the signature dish of White Castle.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:07.387
The hamburgers or meat patties could be prepared in advance, meaning you could come

00:05:07.387 --> 00:05:12.067
in, order a burger and within a short period of time it would be ready for you.

00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:18.627
Anderson didn’t invent the hamburger, of course, but by creating this miniature

00:05:18.627 --> 00:05:24.887
hamburger he had the inspiration to prepare food in his restaurant differently.

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:30.667
The American public at this time were concerned about the conditions

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:36.357
in which meat was prepared, after a 1906 book called The Jungle,

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:40.737
which exposed the dirty secrets of the meat-processing industry.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:48.017
As a result, Anderson and Inghram put a particular emphasis on cleanliness in

00:05:48.017 --> 00:05:53.957
their restaurant, they called it “White” Castle, the interior was porcelain, and

00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:59.457
diners could see their food being prepared in front of them, similarly to how

00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:04.307
you can still see your food being prepared in many fast food restaurants today.

00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:09.727
What’s more, the early 20th century was a time when the public was

00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:15.177
increasingly interested in how things were made, and especially if

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:20.437
this production involved some kind of industrial, efficient process.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:29.937
The Ford Model T car had been released in 1908, and this was the era of public obsession with the

00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:37.377
increasing industrialisation of manufacturing, in particular the novelty of the production line.

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:44.747
So, Anderson and Inghram took inspiration from the Ford production line in their restaurant.

00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:50.717
This not only captivated the public’s attention, but it made it a lot more

00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:56.307
efficient, leading to lower costs of production and lower costs for the customer.

00:06:57.307 --> 00:07:01.757
A slider, which was the name for the first burger, cost

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:07.487
just 5 cents, which is the equivalent of about $0.77 today.

00:07:08.267 --> 00:07:12.297
Now, the burgers were small, and the idea was that you would

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:16.737
buy several of them, but they were still very affordable.

00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:22.147
So, you might be asking - especially if the name “White Castle” is

00:07:22.397 --> 00:07:27.317
unfamiliar to you - why are companies like McDonald’s and Burger King

00:07:27.587 --> 00:07:32.097
more normally associated with the term “fast food” than White Castle?

00:07:32.907 --> 00:07:38.357
Well, we’ll get to the arrival of McDonald’s and the battle of the fast food chains in a

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:45.347
minute, but although White Castle might have had the original innovation of creating the first

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:52.087
“fast food restaurant”, there were a number of reasons that it didn’t immediately take off.

00:07:53.017 --> 00:08:00.367
Firstly, the concept of a nationwide fast food chain as we know it today simply didn’t exist.

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:06.607
Americans weren’t used to this idea, and there also wasn’t the infrastructure

00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:12.077
to support it - there weren’t the industrial-sized meat processing plants or

00:08:12.097 --> 00:08:17.537
bakeries that exist today, so White Castle had to build all of this itself.

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:25.137
Furthermore, there wasn’t an established culture of eating out, a culture of going to restaurants.

00:08:25.437 --> 00:08:28.907
People cooked meals and ate at home for the most part.

00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:33.907
In addition, the Great Depression shook the US in the late

00:08:33.937 --> 00:08:38.747
1920s, which was followed shortly later by The Second World War.

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:45.287
So it was to be in the post-war period, first in the United States but then

00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:50.377
everywhere else in the world, that the fast food boom really got going.

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:56.418
It all started, really, with two brothers, Richard and Maurice.

00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:00.658
You might be able to guess their surname, McDonald.

00:09:01.618 --> 00:09:07.204
They had opened their first restaurant in San Bernardino, California, in 1940.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.748
It was very different to any McDonald’s you might have been to.

00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:18.098
It had a wide array of different items, it was more like a traditional restaurant.

00:09:18.943 --> 00:09:23.588
But what the McDonald’s brothers saw was that the most popular items on

00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:28.618
the menu were, well you might have guessed it, burgers, chips and drinks.

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:33.788
The original McDonald’s restaurant was popular, and the brothers

00:09:33.788 --> 00:09:38.758
were making a very decent living, making around $100,000 a year.

00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:46.688
But, in what was to prove to be a stroke of genius, in 1948 they closed

00:09:46.738 --> 00:09:51.748
down the entire restaurant for three months while they renovated it in

00:09:51.768 --> 00:09:56.808
order to turn it into the first real fast food restaurant as we know it.

00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:02.308
They designed the layout of their new restaurant on a tennis court.

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:06.898
It was all based on the idea of speed, and they even

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:10.218
introduced something called the "Speedee Service System".

00:10:11.038 --> 00:10:15.348
They built on the original system developed at White Castle.

00:10:15.668 --> 00:10:19.418
The production was based on a fast assembly line.

00:10:19.998 --> 00:10:25.588
Instead of a waiter bringing you your meal, you would come to collect it yourself.

00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:30.308
There were no knives and forks, you would eat the food with your hands.

00:10:31.078 --> 00:10:35.188
And the original large menu that the McDonald’s brothers previously

00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:42.168
had was trimmed down to only 9 items: burgers, fries and drinks.

00:10:43.258 --> 00:10:47.538
All of these cost savings meant that they were able to sell

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:54.018
burgers for a mere 15 cents, today’s equivalent of around $1.70.

00:10:55.278 --> 00:11:01.158
You may note that this is over double what the White Castle burgers were selling for, but the

00:11:01.353 --> 00:11:07.775
McDonald’s burgers were normal-sized burgers, they weren’t tiny ones like you’d get at White Castle.

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:14.515
It was a case of an offering that came at the right time, and at the right place.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.855
It was boom time in post-war America.

00:11:18.065 --> 00:11:23.215
Disposable incomes were on the rise, people had more money in their pockets.

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:28.995
Car ownership had continued to rise, and fast food was the perfect type of

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:34.685
food for someone on the move, whether that was a salesman travelling to his

00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:40.705
next meeting or a family stopping off for a quick bite while on a weekend trip.

00:11:41.625 --> 00:11:45.035
From the outset, McDonald’s was a huge hit.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:52.125
People loved it but its success quickly saw copycats, other people looked at how

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:56.565
popular McDonald’s was becoming and thought, “well, I wouldn't mind some of that”.

00:11:57.325 --> 00:12:03.056
Burger King was founded in 1953, 5 years after McDonald’s, when Keith

00:12:03.124 --> 00:12:07.901
Kramer and Matthew Burns saw the success of the McDonald’s brothers.

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:13.311
Taco Bell, another famous American fast food chain was founded in

00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:19.581
1962, when its founder, a decidedly non-Mexican man called Glen

00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:25.251
Bell saw how the fast food formula could also work for Mexican food.

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:32.031
And the McDonald’s brothers in many ways became victims of their own success.

00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:37.651
In the early 1950s a man called Ray Kroc had been working

00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.381
as a salesman for a milkshake mixing machine company.

00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:46.571
He would normally sell one milkshake mixing machine per restaurant,

00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:52.131
but when he saw that the McDonald’s brothers had bought eight machines

00:12:52.191 --> 00:12:56.931
for one restaurant he decided he had to go and see what was going on.

00:12:57.781 --> 00:13:02.471
Eight machines must mean that they were able to sell eight times as much

00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:06.491
milkshake as a normal restaurant, meaning they were probably selling

00:13:06.541 --> 00:13:11.041
eight times as much of everything, and they were probably printing money.

00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:16.031
When Kroc went to see the McDonald’s restaurant, he was amazed.

00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:21.871
It was an incredibly efficient operation, and he sensed the potential.

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:28.172
He persuaded the McDonald’s brothers to start a franchising business, whereby

00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:34.072
they would open new McDonald’s locations which would be managed locally, but

00:13:34.082 --> 00:13:39.502
things like marketing and the sourcing of products would be done centrally.

00:13:40.182 --> 00:13:47.769
Then, 6 years later, in 1961, he negotiated with Richard and Maurice McDonald to buy the

00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:55.739
entire McDonald's operation for $2.7 million, today’s equivalent of around $25 million.

00:13:57.619 --> 00:14:03.139
The McDonald brothers took the offer, and Ray Kroc became the owner of McDonald’s.

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:06.779
The rest is, as they say, history.

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:12.849
Kroc was an aggressive negotiator, and under his leadership McDonalds went

00:14:12.849 --> 00:14:19.029
from 1 restaurant in 1948 to 40,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries in

00:14:19.029 --> 00:14:24.349
the world, with 1% of the world’s population eating there every single day.

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:31.989
The reasons for the success of fast food in America today are similar to what they were when

00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:37.769
the McDonald’s brothers first revealed their “Speedee Service System" and $0.25 burgers.

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:42.589
Firstly, it’s cheap and quick, making it an affordable

00:14:42.729 --> 00:14:46.429
and practical meal for anyone, regardless of their budget.

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:49.959
Secondly, it is the same wherever you go.

00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:53.969
It’s familiar, and we humans are creatures of habit.

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:58.559
Whether someone was eating at a McDonald’s in New York,

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:02.429
Dallas or Chicago, it should taste the same, every time.

00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:09.819
A third reason, which was more of a reason for the success of fast food 70 years ago than now,

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:15.849
but is still a reason in some countries, is that fast food restaurants are clean and tidy.

00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:22.669
Walt Anderson knew this when he first created White Castle, and almost all fast food

00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:27.759
restaurants make sure that everything is cleaned regularly and to a high standard.

00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:33.579
It sounds like a simple thing, but keeping a restaurant clean is no easy matter.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:39.359
We’ll come on to discuss this more in the next episode, on fast food going

00:15:39.359 --> 00:15:45.249
global, but one of the reasons KFC is thought to have been so successful initially

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:50.149
in China is because its restaurants were simply much cleaner than the average

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:55.319
restaurant, so people preferred it despite it being a little bit more expensive.

00:15:56.237 --> 00:16:00.407
Reason number five, and we could go on for hours, but this will be our

00:16:00.407 --> 00:16:05.967
last reason, is to do with the growth of cars, and in particular an

00:16:06.017 --> 00:16:10.707
innovation that came a year before McDonald’s opened, the drive thru.

00:16:11.777 --> 00:16:16.963
It might surprise you, and it certainly surprised me to find out that in the United

00:16:16.963 --> 00:16:23.813
States over half of all McDonald’s sales come from drive-thrus, from people driving

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:28.653
up to the restaurant in their car, placing an order, and driving off with their food.

00:16:29.453 --> 00:16:33.863
As car ownership grew, so did the fast food industry, and

00:16:33.863 --> 00:16:39.093
fast food adapted to be eaten in cars, by people on the move.

00:16:39.983 --> 00:16:44.373
Popcorn chicken, for example, is designed to be eaten with one hand

00:16:44.393 --> 00:16:49.933
while driving, the design of milkshakes has been perfected for cars, and

00:16:50.233 --> 00:16:54.613
McDonald’s makes sure that all of its burgers can be eaten with one hand.

00:16:55.333 --> 00:17:01.243
Fast food is made for a society obsessed with not wasting time, a society

00:17:01.243 --> 00:17:07.023
where time is money, a society that revolves around the automobile, and one

00:17:07.023 --> 00:17:12.943
could even say a society without the same cultural tradition of spending time

00:17:13.153 --> 00:17:18.943
savouring a meal as exists in many European and Asian countries, for example.

00:17:19.503 --> 00:17:26.913
It was, in many ways, a match made in heaven, and has resulted in between 15 and 20% of

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:34.863
Americans eating fast food every single day, and 96% of Americans eating fast food every year.

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:40.233
It didn’t take long for fast food to conquer America, but there are only

00:17:40.233 --> 00:17:45.063
so many burgers, fries and milkshakes a human being can eat every day.

00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:50.793
The next step, of course, was beyond the American borders, where fast food

00:17:50.793 --> 00:17:56.063
companies looked for more people hungry for burgers and fries, ready for a

00:17:56.083 --> 00:18:00.853
taste of American pop culture and eager to see what all of the fuss was about.

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:07.143
And that, my friends, is what we’ll cover in the next episode, when fast food went global.

00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:14.343
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the early history of fast food.

00:18:14.773 --> 00:18:18.703
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and the next

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:24.583
time you see, or perhaps even go into a McDonald’s, Burger King, or any other type of

00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:29.953
fast food restaurant, well, you’ll know a little bit more about where it all comes from.

00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:33.923
Remember, this was part one of a three-part series.

00:18:34.153 --> 00:18:39.133
In part two, which is going to be one of our member-only ones, we’ll look at what happened

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:44.723
when fast food companies took their restaurants to the world, when it went well, when it

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:50.393
went not so well, and some of the cunning techniques that they used to attract customers.

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:55.983
And in part three, the final part, we’ll look at the state of fast food today,

00:18:56.213 --> 00:19:00.813
from what it is doing to our bodies to the future of the fast food industry,

00:19:00.983 --> 00:19:05.723
and we’ll ask ourselves whether we’ll ever be able to kick our addiction.

00:19:06.393 --> 00:19:10.023
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:12.643
Did you know this history of McDonald’s?

00:19:12.843 --> 00:19:17.983
Have you ever been to a White Castle, or had you even heard of it before today’s episode?

00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:19.813
I would love to know.

00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:22.883

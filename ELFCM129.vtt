Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:16.389
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:20.869
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:26.439
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:30.769
The Black Death, the most deadly pandemic in human history.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:39.209
After its arrival on European shores in 1347 it killed anywhere from 30 to

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.399
60% of the population of Europe, and it’s estimated that it was responsible

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.299
for reducing the world’s population by almost half a billion people.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.089
We’ll start by talking about how The Black Death started, what happened to you if you got

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.609
ill, how people tried to cure it, and what happened to society as a result of The Black Death.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.449
We’ll also talk about how it ended, and finish by asking ourselves whether we need to be

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:15.529
worried about The Black Death coming back to wreak a similar amount of destruction today.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:21.009
It is quite the story, so without further ado, let’s get cracking.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:29.999
Our story starts in Messina, a port city on Sicily’s northeastern coast, just opposite the mainland.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:36.229
In October of 1347, 12 ships pulled into the harbour.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:42.579
This wasn’t anything abnormal; it was a port, and ships pulled in all the time.

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:46.799
But these ships weren’t like all the other ships.

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:54.749
They had returned from the Black Sea, and the crew onboard, the sailors onboard, were covered in

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:02.529
horrible black boils, terrible black lumps on their skin, with blood and liquid coming out of them.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:10.549
As the ships neared the harbour, the bystanders, the people watching the arrival of the ships,

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.559
could see that most of the sailors on board were dead, their bodies piled up on the ship.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.089
The sailors that were alive were welcomed ashore, so that they could get medical assistance.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.629
But within a week most had died, and residents of Messina had started

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:36.369
to show exactly the same symptoms as the sailors who were dropping dead.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.509
This deadly disease had started to rage through Messina.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.529
It then spread throughout Italy, France, and within a couple

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.919
of years it had made its way to almost every corner of Europe.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:58.789
The disease is now referred to as The Black Death, or The Plague, and scientists

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:03.889
have a pretty good idea of what it is, how it’s transmitted, and how to stop it.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.989
But when it first emerged, nobody had any idea.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:15.209
Europeans had heard stories about a great plague that existed

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.179
in the east, but had never experienced it in real life.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.759
Sure, there had been smaller plagues, almost since the dawn of written history,

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:33.059
but The Black Death was the first to be not just so widespread, but also so deadly.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:38.349
It all started, so scientists now believe, in central

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.219
Asia, and was likely carried by the Mongol army.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.329
We know, or at least believe, this through an account

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.909
from an Italian notary, a man named Gabriel de’ Mussi.

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:57.999
Between the years of 1345 and 1346 the Mongols had

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.719
surrounded a trading city called Kaffa, in the Crimea.

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.476
The Mongol army had–unintentionally I should add–brought

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:10.336
rats with them, which we now know carried the disease.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:15.226
The disease had started to spread through the Mongol army,

00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:20.626
and bodies had started to pile up outside the city of Kaffa.

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:27.186
The disease didn’t just miraculously appear in the Mongol army outside Kaffa - it’s

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:32.636
believed to have existed in the rats that followed the army for quite some time.

00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:41.126
But given the fact that the Mongol army was almost always on the move, when someone got the disease

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:47.616
and died, their body would just be left, so there was limited opportunity for the disease to spread.

00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:49.506
Not in Kaffa.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:56.576
Outside the city of Kaffa, the Mongol army was static, it was in the same place for some

00:04:56.576 --> 00:05:03.166
time, meaning that the disease was much more easily transmitted from one person to another.

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:08.696
As the bodies piled up, the Mongol soldiers threw them over the

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:13.756
city walls, infecting the local population and poisoning the water.

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:21.196
The disease spread throughout the city of Kaffa, infecting everyone who came into contact with it.

00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:26.306
It was clear that whatever it was, it was deadly,

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:30.016
and it was spreading quickly through the population.

00:05:31.186 --> 00:05:37.176
Merchants who were in Kaffa and in the surrounding area fled for their lives.

00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:39.091
Among these were the Italian merchants that headed back

00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:46.206
on the 12 ships to Messina, but for them, it was too late.

00:05:47.376 --> 00:05:52.696
They returned to Sicily with The Black Death, carrying the plague, and it’s

00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:57.906
from these 12 ships that it’s believed that it spread to the rest of Europe.

00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:06.056
This isn’t to say that if these ships hadn’t landed in Messina, history would be very different.

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:12.896
It’s now accepted that, yes, they might have been the first, but if it wasn’t these 12 ships it

00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:18.556
would have been another 12 ships, or it would have come from somewhere else other than Kaffa.

00:06:19.226 --> 00:06:26.156
So we shouldn’t overstate the importance of these putrid, disgusting dead bodies arriving

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:31.646
over the walls and being probably the first recorded instance of biological warfare.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:38.776
In any case, this was one of the first documented instances of The Black

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:44.056
Death, a plague that was to decimate, in fact, more than decimate if we’re

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:48.796
talking technically, the European population over the following 50 years.

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:56.756
After its arrival in Messina, it spread through Sicily, Genoa, Venice, and Northern Italy.

00:06:57.486 --> 00:07:06.826
It then arrived in France, Spain, Portugal, and by June 1348, just 9 months later, it had arrived

00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:14.056
on the shores of Britain, via a sailor who arrived in Weymouth, a port in south west England.

00:07:15.256 --> 00:07:20.586
Within a few months it was everywhere in Britain, and had also spread to other

00:07:20.646 --> 00:07:25.646
northern European countries, including Germany, Poland, Norway and Sweden.

00:07:26.866 --> 00:07:31.726
At the same time as it was moving north, it was also spreading in the other

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:37.636
direction, and large areas of the middle East and North Africa suffered greatly.

00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:45.346
By the summer of 1348 Cairo, in Egypt, was hit hard, with half of the

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:51.226
city’s 600,000 residents dead, and bodies piled up in the river Nile.

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:58.706
It was brought to the city of Mecca by pilgrims in 1348, and had also spread

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:04.586
throughout large parts of modern Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and of course Turkey.

00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:06.636
It was everywhere.

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:13.796
You might be thinking, ‘well, that doesn't sound that quick, COVID-19 took a fraction of the time.’

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:19.336
Or you might be thinking ‘hang on, there was basically no international

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:23.736
travel 650 years ago, how did it manage to spread so fast?’

00:08:24.906 --> 00:08:30.236
The reality is that there was a lot more international travel 650 years

00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:35.586
ago than most people think there was, but it was through sailors, through

00:08:35.776 --> 00:08:40.816
merchant ships, just like the 12 ships returning to Messina from the Crimea.

00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:46.806
Europe and the middle east were actually very well connected, and these

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:51.906
sea routes were full of merchants going all over the continent, buying

00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:56.986
goods from one place and sailing them to another to sell them for a profit.

00:08:58.006 --> 00:09:02.346
And it was the sailors, and the merchant ships that were mainly

00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:06.096
responsible for taking the disease from one place to another.

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:14.316
When you look at the spread, it goes from port town to port town - on land it spreads

00:09:14.516 --> 00:09:20.956
much more slowly, because people simply didn’t travel as far on land as they did by sea.

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:29.726
In terms of the actual Black Death itself, it’s believed to have consisted of three different

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:36.916
types of plague: The Bubonic Plague, the Pneumonic Plague, and the Septicaemic Plague.

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:43.366
Now, this is the part where you probably don’t want to be eating your lunch, because there are

00:09:43.366 --> 00:09:48.406
going to be some slightly unpleasant descriptions of what these diseases actually did to you.

00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:53.496
All of these three diseases, the three plagues, are

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:57.846
caused by a bacterium called the Yersinia Pestis.

00:09:58.436 --> 00:10:03.386
It is carried by rats, and most believe it to be transferred

00:10:03.396 --> 00:10:08.276
from rat to human, and then human to human, through fleas.

00:10:09.523 --> 00:10:12.083
The rat has the bacteria that causes the plague.

00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:20.723
A flea bites the rat, sucks up the infected blood, then bites a human and passes them the disease.

00:10:21.963 --> 00:10:26.023
The first plague, the Bubonic plague, was the most common one.

00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:33.643
Symptoms of the bubonic plague would normally include a fever, nausea, and vomiting.

00:10:34.793 --> 00:10:39.583
You would also typically start developing horrible boils,

00:10:39.693 --> 00:10:44.993
nasty lumps in your groin, your neck, and your armpits.

00:10:45.953 --> 00:10:50.623
Some were quite small, others could grow to as large as an apple.

00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:57.973
When it first started, it affected everyone equally - men and women, young and old.

00:10:58.873 --> 00:11:04.613
Victims usually died anywhere from 2 to 7 days after the first

00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:10.563
infection, and 80% of people who got the bubonic plague died.

00:11:11.853 --> 00:11:19.143
The pneumonic plague worked in a similar way, but instead of creating these lumps, it caused

00:11:19.173 --> 00:11:26.953
problems breathing, and was even more deadly, killing between 90 and 95% of its victims.

00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:32.973
And even more deadly than both of these was the Septicaemic plague,

00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:38.293
which infected the blood, and killed almost 100% of its victims.

00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:44.443
Luckily it was the rarest of the three, it was the least common of the three plagues.

00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:51.623
Although we now have a pretty good idea about what these different plagues were, when

00:11:51.623 --> 00:11:57.883
they first arrived doctors had absolutely no idea whatsoever - from what was causing

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:03.153
the plague to how they could cure it, they scratched their heads but nothing worked.

00:12:04.503 --> 00:12:08.983
Indeed, given the fact that there didn’t seem to be a cure for it, and

00:12:09.223 --> 00:12:14.633
nobody could understand what was causing it, it was believed by many to be

00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:20.143
an act of God, a punishment for some great wrong that had been committed.

00:12:21.123 --> 00:12:25.423
In Europe, people looked for scapegoats, people to blame.

00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:31.643
God was always right, and everything happened for a reason, so if there was this great

00:12:31.683 --> 00:12:38.203
plague that was sweeping the continent and killing millions, someone must be to blame for it.

00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:45.193
Was it all of society to blame, had things moved in the wrong direction and

00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:50.483
this was God’s way of showing his displeasure, of showing how unhappy he was?

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:55.793
Or was it to punish a particular group, or groups,

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:59.793
in society–groups that were doing wrong against God?

00:13:01.173 --> 00:13:07.723
Several groups bore the brunt of the blame, either because people thought they carried the plague,

00:13:07.813 --> 00:13:14.243
or because people thought God was unhappy with them and that was why he had sent the plague.

00:13:15.343 --> 00:13:20.713
These groups included the poor, Roma, lepers, and Jewish people.

00:13:21.673 --> 00:13:26.943
Frequently people from these groups were killed or thrown out of cities,  as

00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:31.233
it was believed that doing so would reduce the spread of the plague.

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:38.223
This kind of activity was actually perpetuated and encouraged by the nobility

00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:43.753
and the richest in society, it wasn’t some kind of bottom up movement.

00:13:44.953 --> 00:13:51.773
Indeed, the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV, actually pardoned people who had killed Jews.

00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:59.133
Now, evidently this is despicable, inexcusable behaviour, but one thing

00:13:59.323 --> 00:14:05.633
this tells us is that people were resorting to mad violence because they had

00:14:05.643 --> 00:14:10.996
absolutely no idea what was actually going on, and how to stop the spread.

00:14:12.136 --> 00:14:18.576
Another effect of this complete lack of knowledge, and belief that it was some great act of God

00:14:19.076 --> 00:14:25.946
was that there was a huge increase in people doing things to try to ask for forgiveness from God.

00:14:26.876 --> 00:14:32.496
This would range from even more frequent praying right through to flagellation,

00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:37.576
people whipping themselves, whipping their naked backs to punish themselves

00:14:37.866 --> 00:14:41.576
in the hope that God wouldn’t punish them by giving them the plague.

00:14:42.796 --> 00:14:46.496
And what were doctors doing throughout all of this, you might be asking?

00:14:47.096 --> 00:14:54.756
Doctors did try to cure it, but with unsophisticated and ineffective techniques such as cutting

00:14:54.786 --> 00:15:02.486
open veins to allow so-called ‘bad blood’ to come out, or even cutting the boils, the large lumps.

00:15:03.406 --> 00:15:08.156
They’d also try more spiritual cures, such as burning herbs.

00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:09.816
But nothing worked.

00:15:11.146 --> 00:15:16.836
Cities were especially badly hit by the plague, firstly because of the population

00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:23.096
density, but also because they were typically pretty dirty and unsanitary places.

00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:28.316
Animals lived together with humans, rubbish was piled up,

00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:32.796
and it was an ideal environment for the disease to spread.

00:15:33.786 --> 00:15:39.436
People fled the cities to the countryside to try to escape the disease, but many took the

00:15:39.436 --> 00:15:46.226
disease with them, infecting people in the towns and villages, as well as cows, sheep and

00:15:46.226 --> 00:15:53.176
pigs, which could all carry the disease, and then it could be passed back to humans via fleas.

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:59.906
The disease went almost everywhere, wiping out entire families and communities.

00:16:00.736 --> 00:16:07.016
Of course, the effect of 30% of the population being wiped out was considerable.

00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:14.086
Firstly, if people think that they are very likely to die soon, they act in a different way.

00:16:15.256 --> 00:16:21.196
Instances of theft and criminality increased, people started committing more crime.

00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:29.466
There are also records of women in England adopting more revealing types of clothes, clothes

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:35.176
that showed off more parts of their body, which would have been considered immodest years before.

00:16:36.616 --> 00:16:41.966
Presumably in both of these cases people were thinking, well, if I’m going to die

00:16:41.996 --> 00:16:46.856
soon, I may as well take some risks and do things I’m not normally allowed to do…

00:16:48.136 --> 00:16:53.976
From an artistic and cultural point of view, European art became very

00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:59.276
morbid, understandably, as death was so present in everyone’s lives.

00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:05.786
And on an economic level, with fewer workers to do things like work the

00:17:05.786 --> 00:17:11.416
fields and produce food, prices skyrocketed, they increased dramatically.

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:15.656
Cities emptied, and entire families were destroyed.

00:17:16.756 --> 00:17:21.426
With such a huge hit to the population, many economies almost

00:17:21.636 --> 00:17:25.906
ground to a halt, and it took years for them to recover.

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:32.666
But, somewhat miraculously, within around 4 years of The Black Death

00:17:32.736 --> 00:17:38.116
first arriving in Europe, the deaths had started to slow, and people

00:17:38.176 --> 00:17:42.206
were not dying in nearly as high numbers as they had previously.

00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:49.486
The plague was still around, it hadn’t completely disappeared, but there were several developments

00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:56.266
that we now believe helped stop its spread, some of which might be quite familiar to us today.

00:17:57.246 --> 00:18:00.516
Firstly, there were improvements in personal hygiene.

00:18:01.196 --> 00:18:05.476
If you are cleaner, if there are fewer fleas around, and fewer

00:18:05.476 --> 00:18:09.936
places for the plague to exist, then it spreads more slowly.

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:15.486
Secondly, as people realised that the disease was contagious,

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:19.106
people arriving in cities were forced to quarantine.

00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:26.846
Indeed, the word quarantine, as you may know, comes from the Italian quarantina, referring to

00:18:26.846 --> 00:18:33.646
the 40 day period that a sailor would have to ‘quarantine’ before being allowed to come ashore.

00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:39.806
Thirdly, with just far fewer bodies to exist on,

00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:43.026
there was less opportunity for the plague to spread.

00:18:43.816 --> 00:18:49.046
Especially cities were incredibly cramped, small rooms were packed with

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:53.816
people, and if these people died, and there were people spread out in the

00:18:53.816 --> 00:18:58.906
countryside, well that meant fewer bodies, fewer homes for the disease.

00:19:00.016 --> 00:19:06.816
And related to this was the practice of cremating, of burning bodies after a victim died.

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:11.886
Previously, bodies had been piled up and buried, which

00:19:12.106 --> 00:19:16.296
evidently led to huge, infectious piles of bodies.

00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:20.906
When people started to cremate the dead, these dangerous

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:24.076
piles of infectious bodies were no longer an issue.

00:19:25.416 --> 00:19:31.396
So, at different times in different countries across Europe and the middle east, but starting

00:19:31.396 --> 00:19:39.286
in around 1351, the numbers of people dying slowed, and the worst of the plague was over.

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:46.506
There were continued outbreaks of the plague for the next couple of centuries, and indeed

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:53.366
The Black Death, or at least the Bubonic plague has never really completely gone away.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:59.126
Every year there are between one and two thousand cases of what's

00:19:59.126 --> 00:20:04.066
called human plague being reported, in countries such as Zambia,

00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:08.856
Madagascar, India, Algeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:20:09.966 --> 00:20:16.066
In July 2020 you may have seen a slightly sensationalist headline about a case

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:21.076
of a man in a city in the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia who caught The

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:26.816
Bubonic Plague, and later a teenager dying from the plague in the same city.

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:33.876
But, unlike in 1347 we now have an excellent idea about what The

00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:37.906
Black Death is, how to stop it from spreading, and how to cure it.

00:20:39.186 --> 00:20:46.016
So whenever there is an outbreak, and to stress, these outbreaks have always tended to be very

00:20:46.026 --> 00:20:52.606
small, the health authorities do a pretty good job at stopping it before it can get out of hand.

00:20:53.776 --> 00:21:00.774
If one is to look for any positive consequences of The Black Death, historians point to an increased

00:21:00.798 --> 00:21:08.018
sense of European unity, and a sense of shared human experience that brought people closer together.

00:21:08.908 --> 00:21:15.318
We have all gone through this together, it has affected young and old, men and women, rich and poor.

00:21:16.168 --> 00:21:20.658
One can only hope that more recent events, although they are

00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:24.678
thankfully significantly less deadly, might have a similar effect.

00:21:27.558 --> 00:21:31.488
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Black

00:21:31.488 --> 00:21:34.958
Death, the most deadly pandemic in human history.

00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:39.828

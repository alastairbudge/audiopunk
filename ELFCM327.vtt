Hello, hello hello, and welcome
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.066
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:16.236
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:20.676
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.826
I'm Alastair Budge, and today
we are going to be talking

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.336
about a lady called Liz Truss.

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:31.416
If you had been taking a break
from the news between September

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:35.316
and October, you might not have
any idea who this person was.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:39.456
She was, for a brief moment,
the British Prime Minister.

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:45.096
On September the 6th of 2022, she
walked through the door of 10 Downing

00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:46.776
Street, becoming Prime Minister.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:53.856
But on October 20th, just 44 days later,
she announced her resignation, and

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:58.576
with it she became the shortest-serving
Prime Minister in British history.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:03.486
So, in this episode we are going to
look at how it started, what actually

00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:09.076
happened in these tumultuous 44 days, and
ask ourselves where it all went wrong.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.336
Ok then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:16.346
I was born in 1987.

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:21.196
When I was growing up, British
politicians for me were serious,

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:24.056
old men with grey hair and glasses.

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:29.486
If you can picture a man called
John Major, who was Prime Minister

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:35.456
from 1990 until 1997, this is the
vision of a British politician that

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:38.046
people of my generation grew up with.

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:43.306
And British politics was
boring and uninteresting.

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:47.276
Obviously, as a three-year-old,
I wasn’t following it closely,

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.136
but it certainly seemed boring.

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:55.816
Sure, there was infighting, backstabbing,
and crises of different sorts, but it

00:01:55.836 --> 00:02:01.076
all pales in comparison with the British
politics of 30 years later, with the

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:07.536
magazine The Economist publishing a front
cover with the title Welcome to Britaly.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.186
There is no offence intended, of
course, to any Italian listeners

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:17.856
here, but rather to point out that
the consistency and dullness of

00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:22.556
British politics has long gone, and
the events of September and early

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:28.736
October 2022 resembled something more
out of a Netflix drama than real life.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.146
So, where did it all go wrong?

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:37.766
First, we must look at how Liz Truss
became Prime Minister in the first place.

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:42.886
Then, we’ll look at her disastrous time
in office, what went wrong and why, and

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:47.656
now that this chaos is behind us, we
can reflect on what the future holds.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:52.396
Ok then, so, how did Liz
Truss become Prime Minister?

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:57.196
There was no general election,
the British public didn’t vote for

00:02:57.196 --> 00:03:01.586
her, so what was she doing in 10
Downing Street in the first place?

00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:07.406
Well, first I must explain a
quirk, an unusual aspect, of

00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:08.636
the British political system.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.176
In the United Kingdom, people vote
for their local members of parliament.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:19.496
These members of parliament, or MPs,
normally belong to a political party.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:23.639
This political party elects its
leader, and the leader of the

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:27.854
political party with the most votes
typically becomes Prime Minister.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:33.854
Importantly, we don’t directly vote
for a Prime Minister, it’s different

00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:35.824
to the US system, for example.

00:03:36.394 --> 00:03:38.634
Now, why am I telling you this?

00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:44.264
It’s important because if a Prime
Minister resigns when their party

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:48.224
is still in power, there is no legal
need for there to be another election.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:54.604
A new Prime Minister is elected by the
party in power, first the MPs vote,

00:03:54.764 --> 00:04:00.514
and if the MPs can’t reach a conclusive
judgement, it goes to a vote among the

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:02.894
people who are members of that party.

00:04:03.874 --> 00:04:10.044
And this is exactly the situation that
the UK found itself in on July the 7th of

00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:16.364
2022 when Boris Johnson announced that he
was going to resign as UK Prime Minister.

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:22.684
Long story short, Boris Johnson’s
tenure as Prime Minister was mired in

00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:28.644
controversy, from lying and cheating to
his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:34.424
The final nail in the coffin came when it
was revealed that he knew that a senior

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:39.774
politician had been accused of sexual
misconduct and not only did he ignore the

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:45.274
accusations and give him a job, but he
then lied about it when asked directly.

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:51.484
Even for a man dubbed “Teflon
Boris”, because nothing would

00:04:51.484 --> 00:04:53.704
stick to him, this was too much.

00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:58.354
He announced his resignation, and
this was then followed by an almost

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:02.534
two-month campaign to choose the next
prime minister of the party in power,

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:06.774
the Conservative Party, and therefore
the next British Prime Minister.

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:11.744
There were eight different
candidates for the job, and the

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.814
Conservative party was split.

00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:19.114
The early frontrunner was a man
called Rishi Sunak, who had been

00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:23.234
the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
essentially the Minister of Finance.

00:05:24.404 --> 00:05:30.027
But he was seen by many allies of
Boris Johnson to have betrayed Johnson,

00:05:30.394 --> 00:05:35.274
and he was also seen by many members
of the public to be too confident in

00:05:35.274 --> 00:05:37.364
the fact that the job would be his.

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:42.414
Without getting too caught up in
the details of British politics, the

00:05:42.414 --> 00:05:47.484
Conservative party has a wide range
of beliefs, from people like Sunak who

00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:52.644
are closer to the centre, right through
to people on the very far right wing.

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:59.174
One such person was a then
46-year-old lady called Liz Truss.

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:06.996
She was a key ally of Boris Johnson, and
had been his Foreign Secretary since 2021.

00:06:07.684 --> 00:06:12.774
After many weeks of political campaigning,
practically the whole summer, only two

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:16.494
candidates were left in the running to
become the leader of the Conservative

00:06:16.574 --> 00:06:19.414
party: Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss.

00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:24.854
Because neither candidate could
get sufficient support from MPs,

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:29.884
there was a vote by members of the
Conservative party, the 150,000 or

00:06:29.884 --> 00:06:34.454
so people who pay membership fees to
be part of the Conservative party.

00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:41.034
These people were predominantly older,
white people living outside major

00:06:41.074 --> 00:06:44.914
cities, living in the countryside
in the south of the country.

00:06:45.974 --> 00:06:52.594
To be precise, over half were aged
over 60, 97% were white, and they were

00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:55.074
overwhelmingly based in Southern England.

00:06:56.314 --> 00:07:01.754
And it was this group of 150,000 that
voted for the next leader of the party,

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:04.074
and therefore the next Prime Minister.

00:07:05.204 --> 00:07:12.064
So on September 6th, after a tediously
long campaign, Liz Truss was announced

00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:18.784
as the winner, beating Sunak with
57.4% of the vote to his 42.6%.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.939
Why am I going into such detail here?

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.019
Well, the point to reiterate is
that an absolutely tiny percentage

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.349
of the country voted for Liz Truss.

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:34.089
Less than a hundred thousand people
out of a voting population of almost

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:37.349
50 million, it’s less than 0.2%.

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:42.849
And her leadership campaign
had deeply divided the already

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:44.459
divided Conservative party.

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:50.169
So, when she walked through the door of
10 Downing Street, the home of the British

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:55.229
Prime Minister, on September 6th, she
was doing so with minimal public support

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:58.169
and as the leader of a divided party.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.239
It was always going to
be an uphill battle.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.349
So, what actually happened?

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:10.999
Well, this story only lasts 44 days,
but they were certainly eventful.

00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:16.949
Liz Truss went to meet the Queen, as
is customary for a new Prime Minister.

00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:20.779
Within 48 hours the queen was dead.

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:26.169
Clearly, I’m not blaming Liz Truss,
but it wasn’t an ominous start.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:31.989
And while Liz Truss can’t be faulted
for the death of a 96-year-old woman,

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:37.199
the rest of her demise was almost
entirely self-inflicted, it was

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:40.169
unnecessary and it was her fault.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.769
So, where to begin.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.549
Well, it all started to go wrong
on September the 23rd, as she was

00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:49.999
only in her third week in the role.

00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:55.469
Her Chancellor of the Exchequer
and close ally, Kwasi Kwarteng,

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:57.929
announced a “mini budget”.

00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:02.959
Traditionally in British
politics, a Chancellor announces

00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:04.649
a new budget in the spring.

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:10.299
But Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng
decided to announce a new “mini budget”

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:12.709
almost as soon as they were in power.

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:19.139
It was, in theory, in reaction to the
energy and cost-of-living crisis that

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:24.339
was plaguing the UK, and was intended
to provide a blueprint for their

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:26.979
vision of the stagnant British economy.

00:09:28.216 --> 00:09:32.489
Kwasi Kwarteng stood up in
Parliament and made his announcement.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:37.849
He announced a series of tax cuts,
especially for the highest earners,

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:40.889
those earning over £150,000 a year.

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:46.403
These tax cuts would cost
the country £45 billion.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:52.179
The idea behind it, which was a
key part of his and Liz Truss’s

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:56.129
philosophy about how to stimulate the
British economy, was that by reducing

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.229
taxes and government interference.

00:09:58.353 --> 00:10:01.943
the size of the state essentially,
the country would become more

00:10:01.963 --> 00:10:05.973
attractive to business, and in
turn the economy would grow.

00:10:07.463 --> 00:10:12.473
This wasn’t some great secret that
he and Liz Truss had kept, and they

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:14.483
“surprised” the country by announcing it.

00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:21.453
The pair of them had literally written a
book on exactly this back in 2012 called

00:10:21.693 --> 00:10:27.493
“Britannia Unchained”, which set out their
vision for a low-tax British economy.

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:32.333
And Truss had talked extensively
about this during her

00:10:32.343 --> 00:10:33.873
campaign to be party leader.

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:40.513
Now was Truss and Kwarteng’s time
to test out their plan, to finally

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:45.613
unchain the UK from the shackles
of high taxes and low productivity.

00:10:46.573 --> 00:10:49.473
Unfortunately, it did not go as planned.

00:10:50.023 --> 00:10:54.943
The financial markets did not react in
the way that Kwarteng and Truss had hoped.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:59.953
The value of the British pound
dropped immediately after the budget

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:04.473
announcement, reaching an all-time
record low against the US dollar.

00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:10.943
The cost of borrowing skyrocketed,
people in the UK trying to get mortgages

00:11:11.193 --> 00:11:16.193
suddenly found that the interest
rates had doubled or tripled and their

00:11:16.193 --> 00:11:18.513
dream house was now out of reach.

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:24.023
The Bank of England was forced
to intervene and buy £65

00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:26.343
billion in government bonds.

00:11:27.703 --> 00:11:31.933
Now, this isn’t a show about business
or finance, so we aren’t going to

00:11:31.933 --> 00:11:36.853
go into the exact details, but the
point is that this announcement was

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:41.753
very poorly received by the world of
business and it ended up costing the

00:11:41.753 --> 00:11:44.303
country literally billions of pounds.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:50.503
And Liz Truss saw her popularity
ratings go the way of the British

00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:55.453
pound, this already unpopular Prime
Minister became public enemy number one.

00:11:56.343 --> 00:12:00.453
She was pressured to reverse the
announcement, or at least asked to

00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:04.553
set out a plan for how these massive
tax cuts were going to be paid for.

00:12:05.643 --> 00:12:11.863
Yet she did not, instead promising to
continue with her plan, not apologising

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:17.183
or accepting in the slightest that she
bore some responsibility for the chaos.

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:23.686
She did make one concession, which was to
sack her close ally and Chancellor of the

00:12:23.686 --> 00:12:28.563
Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, which she did
on the 14th of October, after it became

00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:30.603
clear that she needed to do something.

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:36.233
He was replaced by a more moderate
politician, a man called Jeremy

00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:40.253
Hunt, who quickly reversed
some of the major tax cuts that

00:12:40.413 --> 00:12:41.983
Kwarteng and Truss had called for.

00:12:43.223 --> 00:12:48.013
By now, there were plenty of people
calling for Liz Truss to go and

00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:52.443
newspaper articles with headlines
like “What is the point of Liz Truss?”

00:12:53.563 --> 00:12:59.803
Her entire political philosophy was one
of low taxes and shrinking the state, and

00:12:59.983 --> 00:13:05.043
if she had completely reversed, gone back
on this policy, what was the point of her

00:13:05.063 --> 00:13:07.113
being Prime Minister in the first place?

00:13:08.423 --> 00:13:13.873
One British tabloid newspaper, called
The Daily Star, even set up a live video

00:13:13.873 --> 00:13:19.507
feed with a picture of Liz Truss next to
a real lettuce, asking its readers the

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:24.107
question of who would last longer, the
lettuce or the British Prime Minister.

00:13:25.077 --> 00:13:27.047
This was on October 14th.

00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:32.667
Unfortunately, the next week would
get even worse for Liz Truss.

00:13:33.087 --> 00:13:38.837
She was doing absolutely terribly in
opinion polls, with a dismal 9% of the

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:43.267
country thinking that she was doing a good
job, and predicting that if there was an

00:13:43.317 --> 00:13:48.627
election tomorrow, the Conservatives would
lose the vast majority of their seats.

00:13:49.407 --> 00:13:51.017
It was crisis time.

00:13:51.877 --> 00:13:56.907
Although she was incredibly unpopular,
the rules of the Conservative Party mean

00:13:57.017 --> 00:14:01.527
that nobody can challenge a leader for
12 months after a leadership contest.

00:14:02.277 --> 00:14:08.307
So what happened was a growing number of
Conservative MPs started to voice their

00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:14.277
lack of confidence in her, both formally
and informally, on and off the record.

00:14:15.207 --> 00:14:19.477
And at the same time the Labour
party started putting pressure on the

00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:24.227
Conservative government to call a general
election, an election that Labour was

00:14:24.237 --> 00:14:28.347
almost guaranteed to win if Truss was
still leader of the Conservatives.

00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:33.837
If things had been bad for Truss
after the crashing of the pound

00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:38.777
and the loss of her closest ally,
things were about to get much worse.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:43.027
And there were two real
nails in the coffin.

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:49.777
Firstly, on October the 19th her Home
Secretary was forced to resign after

00:14:49.787 --> 00:14:54.787
being found to have used a personal
email for government business, and in her

00:14:54.787 --> 00:15:00.347
resignation letter - which was made public
- she was highly critical of Liz Truss.

00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:07.407
Then later that day there was a chaotic
vote on whether to ban fracking, the

00:15:07.597 --> 00:15:12.907
mining technique, with some Conservative
MPs being accused of being bullied

00:15:13.027 --> 00:15:14.667
into voting with the government.

00:15:15.977 --> 00:15:19.577
For many Conservative
MPs, enough was enough.

00:15:20.297 --> 00:15:24.477
Here’s a short clip of an interview
with a senior MP called Charles

00:15:24.477 --> 00:15:26.887
Walker where he explains the mood.

00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:31.427
/
This whole affair is inexcusable.

00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:36.467
It, it is just, it is pitiful
reflection on the conservative

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:38.327
parliamentary party at every level.

00:15:38.567 --> 00:15:40.577
This is absolute disgrace.

00:15:40.577 --> 00:15:45.437
As a tory MP of 17 years who's
never been a minister who's got on

00:15:45.442 --> 00:15:48.167
with it loyally most of the time.

00:15:48.707 --> 00:15:51.317
I think it's a shambles and a disgrace.

00:15:51.377 --> 00:15:53.087
I think it is utterly appalling.

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:57.817
I'm, I'm livid, and I really shouldn't
say this, but I hope all those people

00:15:57.817 --> 00:16:00.187
that put Liz Truss in number 10.

00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:01.087
I hope it was worth it.

00:16:01.447 --> 00:16:03.457
I hope it was worth it for
the ministry or red box.

00:16:03.457 --> 00:16:08.017
I hope it was worth it to sit around the
cabinet table because the damage they

00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:10.717
have done to our party is extraordinary.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.740
Enough was enough.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.880
The following day, just 44 days
after she had taken the job, and

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.670
with record-breaking levels of
unpopularity and absolutely no way

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.580
out, Liz Truss announced that she
would resign as British Prime Minister.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.810
She was, indeed, beaten by the lettuce.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.480
There were calls for a general election
by the Labour Party, with critics pointing

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.280
out that the Conservatives needed to
give the British people the chance

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.900
to choose their next Prime Minister.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.250
The choice didn’t go to the
British people, and the leadership

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.840
contest was thankfully much
shorter than the one in the summer.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.100
It took just four days, and Rishi
Sunak received enough votes from

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.100
MPs to be elected party leader,
and therefore Prime Minister.

00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:10.606
To date, at least, Sunak’s tenure as
Prime Minister has been refreshingly

00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:14.766
boring and uneventful compared
to the chaos of his predecessor.

00:17:15.516 --> 00:17:20.226
He has unwound many of Truss’s pledges,
although he is the leader of a deeply

00:17:20.246 --> 00:17:23.506
divided and still deeply unpopular party.

00:17:24.406 --> 00:17:27.036
And his challenge is two-fold.

00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:32.446
Firstly, and this is of course the
primary challenge, to deal with the

00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:37.406
many crises plaguing the United Kingdom,
from less avoidable crises such as

00:17:37.406 --> 00:17:41.866
the energy and cost-of-living crisis
through to the completely self-inflicted

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:46.816
crisis of reversing the economic damage
of Liz Truss’s 44 days in charge.

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:52.606
But secondly, his job is to
rebuild some of the public trust

00:17:52.626 --> 00:17:57.246
in the Conservative party that was
completely destroyed by Liz Truss.

00:17:58.396 --> 00:18:02.876
The Conservative party’s core message to
the British public has been for a long

00:18:02.876 --> 00:18:08.676
time that it is fiscally responsible,
that it is the party that knows how to

00:18:08.686 --> 00:18:14.376
manage public spending and the economy,
yet Liz Truss’s 44 days in office  have

00:18:14.376 --> 00:18:19.226
done what many commentators have said
to be irreparable damage to this.

00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:25.406
Fortunately for the Conservatives, the
resignation of Liz Truss gave them an

00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:31.376
immediate bump in the polls, with Rishi
Sunak seen as a more moderate and more

00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:33.786
competent candidate than his predecessor.

00:18:35.103 --> 00:18:40.456
Sunak has until January of 2025 to
call a general election, he has two

00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:45.736
years to rebuild trust and patch up
the damage from the most chaotic period

00:18:45.796 --> 00:18:47.556
of recent British political history.

00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:53.606
It’s a monumental task that he has ahead
of him, and all that remains to be said

00:18:53.856 --> 00:18:58.686
is let’s check in again in a couple of
years and see whether he manages it.

00:19:01.246 --> 00:19:07.076
OK then, that is it for today's episode
on Liz Truss, the 44-Day Prime Minister.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:11.236
I imagine that you might have been
aware of some of the chaos that took

00:19:11.236 --> 00:19:14.806
place when she was Prime Minister,
but I hope that this has shed some

00:19:14.806 --> 00:19:19.906
light on it, and provided a bit of
explanation about what exactly went wrong.

00:19:20.836 --> 00:19:24.026
As always, I would love to know
what you thought about this episode.

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.736
How was this news covered in your country?

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:30.236
How has this changed your
perception of British politicians,

00:19:30.276 --> 00:19:31.956
or of the UK as a country?

00:19:32.466 --> 00:19:37.136
Do you think that Rishi Sunak will manage
to undo the damage caused by Liz Truss?

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:41.036
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:16.125
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:20.315
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:25.355
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Venezuela.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:30.535
More specifically, how did this Latin American country go from a

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:34.355
wealthy and prosperous state to one of the poorest in the world?

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.925
This is actually going to be the first of three

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:41.305
episodes all on the very loose theme of Latin America.

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:46.605
Next up we are going to talk about a battle between a Wall Street hedge fund

00:00:46.885 --> 00:00:51.265
and the nation of Argentina, and then after that we’ll be talking about the

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:57.145
self-proclaimed “world’s coolest dictator”, Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador.

00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:02.739
OK then, let’s get started with the collapse of Venezuela.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.739
A few years ago, while on a walk with friends in the

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.839
countryside of Malta, I got talking to a man in his 40s.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.799
He wasn’t from Malta, so I asked him about his life before he got here.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.829
He had been a successful businessman.

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:26.029
He had worked in the property industry, and his business had provided him with a

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:31.999
good life: a nice house, a new car, everything he and his family could possibly want.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:37.379
But he had chosen to leave his home country, and had made

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.749
the trip all across the world to a tiny Mediterranean rock.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:47.699
With limited English, he was now washing cars to make ends meet.

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:55.249
This man was one of almost 8 million people who have left Venezuela since

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.899
2014, in what is one of the largest exoduses of people in modern history.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.879
He left for the same reasons as almost 25% of his fellow Venezuelans: his

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.339
savings were worthless after hyperinflation, the economy was in terminal

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.369
decline, supermarkets had no food, there were electricity and water shortages,

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.639
the hospitals did not have the medicines or equipment that they needed.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.199
As a father, as a parent, there was no hope for his children.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.319
He felt like he had no choice but to leave.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.539
This clearly was a very sad situation, for him and his family, but the thing that I remember most

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:47.579
vividly from that conversation, and from conversations with my Venezuelan friends, is the love that

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.669
they have for their country, and the sense of loss that they felt about what has happened to it.

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.739
Venezuela is clearly a wonderful country in so many

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.569
ways, blessed by great weather, beaches, and landscapes.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.099
It also has the biggest oil reserves in the world, more even than Saudi Arabia.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.759
There are lots of things working in Venezuela’s favour, many reasons that the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.869
country should thrive and its citizens should live happy and prosperous lives.

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.299
But, economically speaking at least, they do not.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:33.509
By 2021, 77% of the population of Venezuela was living in extreme poverty.

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.659
So, where did it all go wrong?

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.429
As we’ll see, there is no one single answer, and a wide variety of points of view about the

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:50.479
root causes of the collapse of the state of Venezuela, but before we get to pointing the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:57.249
finger, we need to do a brief historical recap, as well as have a geographical refresher.

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:02.589
Venezuela is at the top of South America, Colombia to

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.089
the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.169
And below the surface lies oil.

00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:16.459
300 billion barrels worth, the largest proven oil reserves in the

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.239
world, accounting for almost 20% of the entire world’s supply of oil.

00:04:23.609 --> 00:04:30.169
To state the obvious, there is a lot of oil, and since the oil was first drilled, in

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:38.269
1914, the fate of Venezuela has been linked like a siamese twin to the global oil market.

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.169
For much of the 20th century, Venezuela enjoyed a

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.019
prosperity that most Latin American countries did not.

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:54.160
But its prosperity came almost exclusively from oil exports.

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:59.539
And any keen student of history knows that this is risky business.

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.059
The price of oil rises and falls, and countries with large oil reserves often fall

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:12.789
into the so-called “resource trap”, or “Dutch disease”, where the entire economy

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.299
becomes so dependent on one commodity that it fails to develop other sectors.

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:26.029
This is sort of ok when the going is good, and the oil price is high, but when

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:31.529
it decreases dramatically, as the oil price has done multiple times during the

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:37.799
20th century, that country’s income decreases at a similar rate to the oil price.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:45.089
And although Venezuela did make multiple attempts to wean itself off oil

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:50.979
exports, or at least to properly diversify its economy, it never managed.

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:58.499
It suffered from high levels of government corruption, funds were wasted or embezzled, and by the

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:05.809
end of the 20th century there was an increasing gap between the haves and the have nots, people

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:11.789
typically close to government who owned or controlled land or businesses, and everyone else.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.372
One man thought this wasn’t right.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.529
Well, clearly lots of people thought this wasn’t right,

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:22.979
but one man in particular did something about it.

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.949
In 1992, a then 37-year-old colonel called Hugo Chavez

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.899
attempted to mount a coup and overthrow the government.

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.819
It didn’t work, and he was sentenced to two years in jail.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:47.559
Fast forward to 1998, and this man, Hugo Chavez had put himself forward as a presidential candidate.

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:54.349
His message was anti-corruption and anti-poverty, and his proposal was simple:

00:06:55.079 --> 00:07:00.379
vote for me and Venezuela will become a more equal, more prosperous country.

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:07.549
It was a message that resonated with a public fed up with seeing the rich grow richer while

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:13.429
their living standards had stagnated, fed up with seeing the waste and corruption around it.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:20.319
Chavez walked away with 56% of the vote to his closest opponent’s 40%,

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:27.909
and on February 2nd, 1999, he was sworn in as the president of Venezuela.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:33.919
He was the most left-wing president in the history of the country, but he did

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:39.549
not consider himself to fit neatly into any particular political ideology.

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:46.339
In an interview shortly after the election he said “If you are attempting to determine

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:52.539
whether Chavez is of the left, right, or centre, if he is socialist, Communist, or

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:58.889
capitalist, well, I am none of those, but I have a bit of all of those” and he added

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:04.499
that he would go quote “beyond socialism and even savage capitalism.” End quote.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:11.809
This was nice rhetoric, but much of his policy followed the playbook of socialist

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:16.449
populist leaders: high levels of government spending, redistribution of wealth,

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:21.989
nationalisation of private property and businesses, and mass state welfare programmes.

00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:30.079
In principle, a lot of this sounded very good, and indeed it had some commendable results.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:37.089
Inequality reduced dramatically, and by 2011 Venezuela was the

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.759
second most equal country in the Americas, behind only Canada.

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:51.941
The poverty rate fell from 49% in 1999 to 32% in 2013, extreme poverty fell by 71%,

00:08:52.299 --> 00:09:00.134
unemployment fell by 50%, university enrollments doubled, deaths from malnutrition fell by 50%.

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:05.259
If you were an average Venezuelan, it's fair to say that life

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:10.159
overall got better under Hugo Chavez, at least, for a bit.

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:12.599
But there was a problem.

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:16.409
This was all underpinned by oil exports.

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:22.169
The price of a barrel of oil went from $12 when Chavez was sworn

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:29.059
in, in February 1999, right up to a high of $140 in June of 2008.

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:34.749
Throughout this period there were minor crashes, falls in price, which

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:38.529
forced the Venezuelan government to borrow money to continue its large

00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:43.299
social welfare spending, but overall, the price continued to rise.

00:09:44.359 --> 00:09:51.029
And with the oil gushing and cash flowing into the country, there was little incentive

00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:56.819
to invest in anything else, or to keep a careful eye on where the state funds were going.

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:01.809
One area that Chavez did keep particularly tight control

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:06.119
over, however, was the Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:12.289
In 2003, he implemented currency controls, meaning that the

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:16.829
Venezuelan government decided how much the Bolivar should cost.

00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:24.289
The main idea behind this was to control inflation, as if the state set the

00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:29.879
price of a currency, in theory at least the prices of goods shouldn’t fluctuate.

00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:33.089
Emphasis on “in theory”.

00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:39.999
The price it set was 1,600 Bolivars for a dollar, and the only legal way

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:44.599
in which Venezuelan citizens could exchange their hard-earned Bolivars for

00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:49.349
dollars was through the government, at the official government-approved rate.

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:54.659
The problem was that this rate massively overvalued the

00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:59.072
Bolivar, it made the Bolivar seem stronger than it actually was.

00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:05.422
The logic behind this was to make imported goods cheaper, to make it

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:09.642
more affordable for Venezuelan businesses to buy goods from abroad.

00:11:10.642 --> 00:11:15.532
Although this might sound good in practice, it ended up being a disaster.

00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:20.432
It discouraged the production of local goods for export, because

00:11:20.432 --> 00:11:24.222
it was expensive for foreigners to buy them at the official rate.

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:30.072
A vibrant black market emerged, as it was difficult for average Venezuelans to get

00:11:30.072 --> 00:11:34.382
their hands on foreign currency, given that this was controlled by the government.

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:42.192
It also encouraged mass corruption, as officials who controlled the exchange could make huge profits

00:11:42.242 --> 00:11:48.912
buying dollars at the official rate and then selling them at the unofficial black market rate.

00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:56.732
To give you a working example, a Venezuelan official could arrange for a company to buy 1

00:11:56.732 --> 00:12:04.092
million US dollars at the official rate of 1,600 Bolivars to the dollar, but this company could

00:12:04.092 --> 00:12:10.382
turn around and then sell these US dollars on the black market for almost double the price.

00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:17.042
What ended up happening is, to put it simply, mass fraud.

00:12:17.602 --> 00:12:22.362
Companies would manipulate invoices to claim that they needed dollars to

00:12:22.362 --> 00:12:28.292
buy foreign goods, but these goods never existed, it was one huge scam.

00:12:29.702 --> 00:12:38.552
According to one estimate, more than $300 billion was stolen in 10 years, $30 billion every

00:12:38.552 --> 00:12:43.672
single year, which went into the pockets of government officials and their friends in business.

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:45.572
Pretty awful stuff.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.002
And that wasn’t all.

00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:55.412
While these currency controls made imports cheaper, they hurt Venezuela’s main export: oil.

00:12:56.522 --> 00:13:02.712
The government sold oil in US dollars, but because the Bolivar was artificially strong,

00:13:03.272 --> 00:13:08.902
when these dollars were converted back into the local currency, the revenues were

00:13:08.902 --> 00:13:13.102
significantly less than they would have been with a more realistic exchange rate.

00:13:13.782 --> 00:13:17.602
This financial discrepancy led to substantial economic

00:13:17.612 --> 00:13:21.772
losses, further exacerbating the country’s financial distress.

00:13:22.882 --> 00:13:27.212
What’s more, there were controls on the maximum prices that a business could

00:13:27.212 --> 00:13:32.932
charge for certain items, like essentially foodstuffs, medicines and even rent.

00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:37.922
This might have sounded good, because who likes paying more for anything?

00:13:38.342 --> 00:13:44.852
But the reality was that this disincentivised businesses from producing these goods, as they

00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:49.922
wouldn’t be able to make a profit if they were forced to sell it at below the cost of production.

00:13:50.862 --> 00:13:56.702
There is a good reason that almost every economist looks at price and currency controls and says

00:13:57.232 --> 00:14:04.112
“hmm, bad idea”, and Venezuela was a prime example of what happens when these are implemented.

00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:09.562
You will no doubt have seen pictures of empty supermarket shelves in Venezuela’s towns

00:14:09.562 --> 00:14:16.322
and cities, or huge queues outside as Venezuelans waited in line to buy basic foodstuffs.

00:14:17.442 --> 00:14:22.352
And the irony of these price and currency controls is that they

00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:26.212
had the complete opposite effect in terms of controlling inflation.

00:14:27.342 --> 00:14:35.022
During Hugo Chavez’s tenure as president, from 1999 to 2013, inflation went

00:14:35.032 --> 00:14:43.516
from as low as 12% in 2001 to 40% a year by the time he left office in 2013.

00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:51.192
The annual inflation rate was an average of 23% during his presidency, meaning

00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:56.912
that the Bolivar lost almost 95% of its value during Hugo Chavez’s tenure.

00:14:58.242 --> 00:15:01.832
But this was nothing compared to what was to come.

00:15:02.832 --> 00:15:08.522
In 2013, after suffering from a series of health problems, Chavez handed over the

00:15:08.522 --> 00:15:14.702
presidency to Nicolás Maduro, and the economic situation went from bad to worse.

00:15:15.722 --> 00:15:22.092
Inflation went from pretty bad to crippling, reaching 130,000%

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:28.022
in 2018, making the currency worthless and practically unusable.

00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:34.072
The Venezuelan economy shrunk by 86%, poverty rose to

00:15:34.152 --> 00:15:40.582
96% by 2019, and ⅓ of the population was malnourished.

00:15:41.522 --> 00:15:47.112
And almost 8 million people voted with their feet, like the man I mentioned at the start

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:52.202
of the episode, leaving the country with nothing more than the t-shirts on their back.

00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:58.202
After all, if they had any savings in Bolivars, the Venezuelan currency,

00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:02.512
they were worthless, literally not worth the paper they were made out of.

00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:10.052
And when it comes to pointing fingers, assigning blame, there are of course conflicting

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:15.112
views about who and what ultimately caused the collapse of this country that once had a

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:21.552
GDP per capita of 80% of the United States, and was the richest country in Latin America.

00:16:22.902 --> 00:16:28.212
For some, particularly on the political right, Venezuela is a prime

00:16:28.212 --> 00:16:32.192
example of what happens when a country implements socialist policies.

00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:36.962
From currency controls to price controls, from taking land from

00:16:36.972 --> 00:16:41.672
businesses to increased state control, socialism will always fail.

00:16:42.912 --> 00:16:46.632
For others, the blame lies squarely with Chavez.

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:51.922
Some point to particular policies, like currency controls, while others

00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:56.702
point at his authoritarian tendencies, or failure to control corruption.

00:16:57.652 --> 00:17:02.202
For others, it is Maduro who must take the lion’s share of the blame, as

00:17:02.382 --> 00:17:07.732
it was under his tenure that Venezuela went from failing to failed state.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:13.615
For others, the blame lies with the United States, whose sanctions against the

00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:18.042
Latin American country were the nail in the coffin of a left-wing regime that the

00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:24.012
US had been seeking to destroy ever since Chavez was elected president back in 1998.

00:17:25.442 --> 00:17:30.252
For others, we need to go further back, to the colonial past of Venezuela,

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:34.682
and the fact that oil was discovered before the country had developed a

00:17:34.702 --> 00:17:39.682
robust enough democracy to withstand the financial windfall that oil brought.

00:17:41.192 --> 00:17:46.042
From the dozens of articles, papers and interviews I read while researching this

00:17:46.042 --> 00:17:51.272
topic, the thing that struck me most was that the greatest criticism for the

00:17:51.272 --> 00:17:56.852
Venezuelan government came not from foreign commentators, American policymakers, or

00:17:57.182 --> 00:18:02.982
regional rivals, but from young Venezuelans who had been forced to escape abroad.

00:18:04.172 --> 00:18:08.622
There was this profound sense of both anger and sadness.

00:18:09.252 --> 00:18:14.902
Anger for a future that had been stolen from them, sadness about the thought

00:18:14.972 --> 00:18:19.302
that in all probability they would never be able to return to a country

00:18:19.542 --> 00:18:24.642
that had such promise, a country that should have been rich and prosperous.

00:18:26.132 --> 00:18:32.602
Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998 on a message of hope and prosperity.

00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:38.122
The unfortunate reality is that this was the start of one of the

00:18:38.122 --> 00:18:41.942
greatest destructions of hope and prosperity in modern history.

00:18:44.322 --> 00:18:47.882
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Venezuela.

00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:52.602
To state the obvious, there is a huge amount to this subject, many many

00:18:52.612 --> 00:18:56.932
elements that we didn’t have the time to go into today, but I hope this gave

00:18:56.932 --> 00:19:01.522
you some idea about why Venezuela is in the situation that it is in now.

00:19:02.302 --> 00:19:05.152
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:05.462 --> 00:19:08.162
We've got lots of Latin American listeners, and quite

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:11.362
a few Venezuelan listeners, so I would love to know.

00:19:11.982 --> 00:19:15.692
Who holds responsibility for the current situation in Venezuela?

00:19:16.212 --> 00:19:18.192
And are you hopeful for the future?

00:19:18.912 --> 00:19:24.112

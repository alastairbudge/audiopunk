Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.319
English, the show where you can learn fascinating things about the world, and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.890
listen to weird and wonderful stories at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.660
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.860
about Esperanto, the world’s most popular man-made language.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.539
We’ll talk about where it came from, how it works, why

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.290
it works, and we’ll even hear a few people speaking it.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.050
It’s going to be a pretty exciting one, especially if you are interested

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.849
in how languages are created, so without further ado, let’s get started.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.080
Now, in the world today there are around 7,000 languages spoken.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.169
As we found out in the last episode, two thirds of the world’s population speaks just 12 different

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:13.576
languages, and there is a real risk of lots of the other less popular languages dying out.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:19.326
But imagine a world where everyone spoke the same language.

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:25.416
All 8 billion of us could communicate with each other, in the same language.

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:28.586
How would that world be different?

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:36.776
Well, one man certainly saw the benefits of removing language barriers, and saw the

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:42.586
opportunities that would exist if everyone were able to speak the same language.

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:49.116
That man’s name was Ludwik Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:55.356
He was born in a place called Białystok, in the year 1859.

00:01:57.296 --> 00:02:02.246
Białystok was, at that time, part of Russia, but it is now

00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:06.246
part of Poland, quite close to the border with Belarus.

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:14.586
Zamenhof was acutely aware of how language unites and divides.

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:22.116
His parents descended from Lithuanian Jews, and his father was a German and French teacher.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:28.176
Zamenhof himself was fluent in Yiddish and Russian, and

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:32.116
he learned German, French, and Hebrew from his father.

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:38.976
Living in Białystok, he could also speak Polish and Belarusian,

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:42.286
which were both spoken by different local communities.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:47.456
At school, he studied Latin and Greek, as well as Aramaic.

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:54.836
And it is said that he could also speak some English, although not to a particularly high level.

00:02:55.906 --> 00:02:59.906
So, if you are counting, we have hit 11 languages already.

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:06.236
But it wasn’t just because he had learned so many languages, and was

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:10.396
a bit of a language buff that he ended up creating his own language.

00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:16.426
Living in such an ethnically and linguistically diverse place with so many

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:23.436
different internal conflicts and wars, Zamenhof theorised that the fact there

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:28.036
were so many different languages, that people couldn’t easily communicate with

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:32.966
one another, that was one of the main reasons that there was so much conflict.

00:03:34.216 --> 00:03:41.086
If only there were a way for everyone to understand each other, for there to be no room for

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:49.076
miscommunication, then the endless wars and conflict that had plagued Europe would just go away.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:55.556
A world with one common language would mean that we could all understand each other,

00:03:56.086 --> 00:04:03.466
linguistically and therefore culturally, and as a result, everyone would live together in harmony.

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:09.396
It’s not hard to imagine why Zamenhof came to this conclusion.

00:04:10.576 --> 00:04:14.856
Poland had experienced centuries of conflict, and any peace

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:18.836
it had experienced hadn’t ever lasted particularly long.

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:25.756
At the time Zamenhof was growing up, Poland was a multi-ethnic and

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:30.756
multi-linguistic country, a real melting pot of different cultures and

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:35.616
languages, and there were frequent conflicts between these different groups.

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:42.256
Having this common language, Zamenhof thought, would remove

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:46.536
the main reason for the conflict, which was miscommunication.

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:53.396
This was a fiercely held view by Zamenhof from a young age, and even

00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:57.486
while he was at high-school he created his first ‘international language’.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:04.776
He realised though that the grammar of this language, the first language he

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:10.536
created, he realised it was too complex - he had based it on the grammar of

00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:16.546
Russian and Yiddish, and it was only when he started studying English that he

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:22.836
realised that any truly international language had to have a very simple grammar.

00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:28.086
Now, I know what you might be thinking - English grammar isn’t easy.

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:34.286
But it is a lot easier than the grammar of lots of other languages, and Zamenhof

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:39.606
saw that there were elements of English that should be incorporated into

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:44.816
this future, easy to understand common language that he was trying to create.

00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:50.856
His first real project, what is now called ‘Proto Esperanto’,

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:56.306
was finished in 1878, but there was only one problem.

00:05:57.556 --> 00:06:02.976
You may remember that he was born in 1859, which made him only 19 years

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:09.176
old, too young and without the financial resources to actually publish it.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:17.706
It wasn’t until 1887, when he was 28 years old, that he finally published “International language:

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:24.876
Introduction and complete textbook”, under the pseudonym, the pen-name, of Doktor Esperanto.

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:32.066
This book was published in Russian, but it outlined how to speak this new language.

00:06:32.756 --> 00:06:38.276
The language didn’t have an official name though, it was just called “International Language”.

00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:44.936
But early students liked the name of its supposed author, and started

00:06:44.936 --> 00:06:50.546
to call it after him, so it began to be referred to as Esperanto.

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:56.916
I imagine that you may not have ever heard Esperanto before.

00:06:57.806 --> 00:07:02.516
So what we are going to do now is just play a little clip of some

00:07:02.516 --> 00:07:06.836
people speaking it, and you can see if it sounds at all familiar.

00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:43.796
***PEOPLE SPEAKING ESPERANTO****

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:45.764
There we go.

00:07:46.484 --> 00:07:49.795
If it sounds familiar, that’s probably because some

00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:52.935
of the languages you speak are quite similar to it.

00:07:54.175 --> 00:08:02.905
About ¾ of the words in Esperanto have roots in Romance languages - so French, Spanish, Italian,

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:09.105
Portuguese, and so on - and the rest are from Germanic and Slavic languages, and also Greek.

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:16.905
So about half of the world’s population should at least be already familiar with some of

00:08:16.905 --> 00:08:22.445
the vocabulary, which means it’s easier to learn, as you aren’t starting from nothing.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:29.335
What’s more, Zamenhof created the language so that it was intentionally very easy to learn.

00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:37.475
You didn’t need formal schooling, or years of study - the idea was that anyone, regardless of

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:44.125
their educational background, should be able to learn it with 10 minutes or so of study per day.

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:50.125
And if you think about everything that is confusing about different

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:54.745
languages, none of those confusing things exist with Esperanto.

00:08:55.425 --> 00:09:02.035
So, unlike in English, in Esperanto you don’t have phrasal verbs or irregular conjugations.

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:09.765
And unlike in romance languages, you don’t have complicated subjunctives or genders of objects.

00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:16.455
And unlike Asian languages, there are no tones, and instead of having a huge

00:09:16.465 --> 00:09:22.545
list of different words for everything in Esperanto, there are ‘root words’,

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:27.085
and parts that are added to the start of them to change their meaning.

00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:34.725
So, to give you an example if you add ‘mal’, ‘m a l‘, to the start of a word, this

00:09:34.885 --> 00:09:40.515
changes the definition to be the opposite of what the world without ‘mal’ means.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:51.995
So juna ‘j u n a’ is young, but maljuna, with ‘mal’ in front, the opposite of young is….old.

00:09:52.965 --> 00:10:01.485
And blanka is white, malblanka, opposite of ‘white’ is, well you might have guessed it, it’s black.

00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:09.175
It is said that you can actually get by with only around 500 root words in Esperanto,

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:14.045
and you just add parts to the start to create different words and meanings.

00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:19.475
Using the language is also just a lot easier - the letter at the

00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:24.125
end of a word shows you what kind of word it is, so if it ends with

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:29.075
an ‘o’, it’s a noun, and if it ends with an ‘a’, it’s an adjective.

00:10:30.085 --> 00:10:35.365
So it’s very easy to get started, and very easy to actually use.

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:40.525
Almost immediately, it started attracting followers, who

00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:44.345
became passionate about the possibilities of the language.

00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:50.225
It could mean that anyone, from anywhere, could communicate with anyone else.

00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:52.715
What an amazing thing, right?

00:10:54.015 --> 00:10:54.925
Well, yes.

00:10:55.435 --> 00:11:03.255
But as with anything new that inspires strong beliefs, it is often distrusted by the authorities.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:10.005
And the idea that this language would allow normal, common people from different

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:15.505
countries and cultures to communicate with each other was considered very dangerous...

00:11:16.255 --> 00:11:22.025
Shortly after it was first published, Tsarist Russia banned Esperanto.

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:27.335
Then Stalin called it ‘that dangerous language’, and he

00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:31.775
ordered the deportation or execution of Esperanto speakers.

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:40.045
Similarly, Hitler said that it was all part of a plan for Jewish world domination,

00:11:40.595 --> 00:11:46.755
and whenever the Nazis came across Esperanto speakers, they were rounded up and shot.

00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:51.445
But it wasn’t just dictators and Tsarist Russia.

00:11:52.185 --> 00:11:58.165
Iran proposed that the League of Nations, the precursor to the United Nations,

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:06.065
Iran proposed that it adopt Esperanto, but the idea was blocked by the French.

00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:12.735
There was this view that Esperanto was a communist plot - a way to

00:12:12.735 --> 00:12:16.685
unite the working people of the world so that they could rise up.

00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:21.615
In Japan, Esperanto speakers were referred to as

00:12:21.695 --> 00:12:26.505
‘watermelons’, green on the outside, and red on the inside.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:34.225
Green was the adopted colour of Esperanto, it was used for Esperanto flags, and books.

00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:38.665
And red, of course, was, and still is, the colour of communism.

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:44.935
The goal of Esperanto was to allow people from anywhere in the world,

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:50.465
no matter their linguistic background and social class, to communicate.

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:55.885
That might have sounded like a dangerous, communist idea, but it is one

00:12:55.905 --> 00:13:00.055
of the main reasons that people are still attracted to the language.

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:09.055
Since its founding over 100 years ago, Esperanto has attracted hundreds of thousands of learners.

00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:14.555
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how many people speak Esperanto,

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:20.035
but estimates range from around 200,000 to 2 million.

00:13:21.422 --> 00:13:26.562
The reasons for people deciding to learn Esperanto are varied, as well.

00:13:27.603 --> 00:13:31.851
For some, it is just a fantastic intellectual journey.

00:13:32.606 --> 00:13:37.226
For others, it’s a way of meeting and communicating with people from

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:42.086
all over the world, without having to learn tens of different languages.

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:49.216
Interestingly enough, there are big communities of Esperanto speakers in East Asia.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:54.776
Because it’s a lot easier to learn than English, it is a way for speakers

00:13:54.796 --> 00:14:00.216
of languages like Mandarin, Korean or Japanese to easily communicate

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:04.746
with people from all over the world without having to learn English.

00:14:06.476 --> 00:14:13.826
The actual ‘community’ of Esperanto speakers is very strong, and speakers exist all over the world.

00:14:15.226 --> 00:14:22.326
There’s even something called Pasporta Servo, which would be ‘passport service’ in English, which is

00:14:22.326 --> 00:14:28.816
a way for Esperanto speakers to find and connect with other Esperanto speakers all over the world.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:34.656
There are stories of Esperanto speakers bicycling around the world, and

00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:39.646
staying just with other fellow Esperanto speakers, speaking only in Esperanto.

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:42.566
And that’s a pretty cool thing, right?

00:14:42.926 --> 00:14:48.076
The idea that you can speak to anyone, anywhere, all in the same language.

00:14:48.766 --> 00:14:54.306
It’s not surprising that Esperanto speakers, Esperantists, as they are called,

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:59.276
it’s not surprising they are so passionate about the benefits of the language.

00:15:00.096 --> 00:15:05.266
It’s a classic example of network effects - the more people speak it, the

00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:09.196
more useful it becomes, so the more people want to speak it, and so on.

00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:13.716
Still though, only a tiny proportion of the world’s population

00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:19.266
do speak it, and for most people it’s a niche, hobbyist thing.

00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:21.836
But not for everyone though.

00:15:22.286 --> 00:15:26.226
There are stories of children who were raised speaking

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:30.266
Esperanto, so their native language is Esperanto.

00:15:31.636 --> 00:15:37.086
There aren’t many, but it is estimated that there are around 1,000 in the world.

00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:45.076
One exciting big development for Esperanto was that the language learning app Duolingo

00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:52.186
added it as a language that you could learn in the app in 2015, and it estimates

00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:58.276
that over a million users have learned Esperanto using the app since it launched.

00:15:59.186 --> 00:16:04.326
Of course, using Duolingo to learn a traditional language can be

00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:09.176
slightly problematic, but the fact that Esperanto is such a simple

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:14.176
language means it lends itself very nicely to something like Duolingo.

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:20.786
And it is fantastic that this technology has meant that a new generation

00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:26.216
has at least been introduced to Esperanto, but only time will tell

00:16:26.476 --> 00:16:31.076
how many go on to actually be passionate advocates of the language.

00:16:31.996 --> 00:16:37.206
Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof died in 1917, just over 100 years ago now.

00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:42.736
I wonder what he would be thinking if he could see how his creation has developed.

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:50.576
It has certainly attracted a devoted following, enabled countless relationships and friendships

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:57.186
to flourish that wouldn’t have been possible without it, and perhaps, just perhaps, in hundreds of

00:16:57.186 --> 00:17:03.406
years from now the whole world will be speaking Esperanto, and his dream will finally be realised.

00:17:04.346 --> 00:17:10.646
In any case, it is an amazing creation, has a pretty noble mission, And I think he

00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:16.886
would be quite amazed to see the impact that his invented language has had on the world.

00:17:18.446 --> 00:17:22.016
Okay then that is it for Esperanto.

00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:23.246
As always.

00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:25.736
I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:30.176
If you speak some Esperanto, I would especially love to hear from you.

00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:34.016
I'm going to try and learn a bit this weekend and listening to

00:17:34.016 --> 00:17:37.766
it while I was researching this episode really gave me the bug.

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:43.586
And if this episode has inspired you to spend a couple of hours learning some

00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:48.086
Esperanto, then I would also love to hear from you and we can exchange notes.

00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:55.016
Now I'm going to finish this episode by trying to say a little something in Esperanto.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:01.916
Vi aŭskultis anglan Lernadon por Scivolaj Mensoj, de Leonardo English.

00:18:02.546 --> 00:18:09.106
Mi estas Alastair Budge, vi restu sekura, kaj mi kaptos vin en la sekva epizodo.

00:18:11.096 --> 00:18:15.596
In case you didn't get that, I said, or at least I tried to say, you've

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:19.856
been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:18:20.156 --> 00:18:25.106
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:15.987
English, the show where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:16.497
world.

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:24.687
Today we are talking about the Suffragette movement in the UK and how women won the vote.

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:33.117
At the start of the 20th century in the UK, like much of the world, women were considered

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:37.467
second-class citizens, unable to vote in national elections.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:43.272
The Suffragette movement saw women rise up in their masses.

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:50.112
They chained themselves to railings, smashed shop windows, and blew up houses.

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:56.232
One was even killed by throwing herself in front of the King's horse.

00:00:57.582 --> 00:01:04.512
And by 1928 all women over the age of 21 were given the right to vote.

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:09.252
Finally, they had managed to achieve the same status as men.

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:17.052
The movement that did more than anything else for women's rights in the UK was called the

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:18.162
Suffragette movement.

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:24.702
And today we are going to tell the story of these brave women and how they won the vote.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.779
Before we get right into it though, this is just your customary reminder for those of you listening

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:39.129
to the podcast on Spotify, Google Podcasts, iVoox or wherever you may get your podcasts that you can

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:45.079
get your copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which is

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.539
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.579
The transcript is really useful for following every single word and not missing anything.

00:01:53.089 --> 00:02:00.439
You can get it in PDF format, you can read it on the website, or even it now comes in animating

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.549
form, so it scrolls across the page, just like subtitles.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:12.649
And the key vocabulary explains the harder words, so you don't have to stop to look up words and you

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.909
can build your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.459
So go and check that out.

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.519
It's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.079
Okay then let's talk about the Suffragettes.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:35.569
We'll be talking about women's rights in the UK but it's worth just painting the picture of women's

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.109
rights around the world at the start of the 20th century.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:48.639
If we were to summarise it, we'd probably say it was pretty bleak, the prospects didn't look good

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:49.239
for women.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:57.359
There are a few exceptions, but in general, the majority of countries in the world didn't allow

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:05.629
women to vote, and if they did, it was normally restricted to a small selection of women - women who

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.729
owned property or women who paid taxes, or it only allowed women to vote in certain elections.

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:23.749
Universal suffrage, meaning that everyone was able to vote regardless of their status, didn't exist

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.049
anywhere really, and certainly not in Europe.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:36.539
And towards the end of the 19th century, there was an increasing movement in the UK that pushed for

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.429
women's rights to vote.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.139
There were a few laws that were proposed in parliament, but nothing really happened.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:54.284
The politicians - who were at that time, all men, of course, women weren't allowed to, to put

00:03:54.284 --> 00:04:00.794
themselves forward to be a member of parliament - these men didn't seem interested in giving women

00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:08.984
the vote, and every time there was a bill proposed, a law proposed, in parliament, they would vote

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:10.844
it down, they would vote against it.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:20.064
It seemed clear that the peaceful route of petitioning the government, of going to meetings and

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:28.584
trying to persuade politicians to support women's rights to vote, it became clear that this wasn't

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:32.184
having much impact, it wasn't very successful.

00:04:33.654 --> 00:04:44.694
And so in 1903 a new movement was formed called the Women's Social and Political Union, the WSPU for

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:45.054
short.

00:04:46.914 --> 00:04:54.834
It was formed by a woman called Emiline Pankhurst, and it proposed a different approach to what had

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:56.574
been tried previously.

00:04:58.534 --> 00:05:06.184
Their motto, their slogan, the catchphrase, I guess, was "deeds, not words".

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:11.104
So deeds means action, it means getting stuff done.

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:21.489
Pankhurst, who was the leader of the WSPU, she had been campaigning for women's rights since she was

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:30.579
a girl, since the age of 14, so for 31 years, and she was fed up with men saying that they were

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:31.959
going to change things.

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.749
She was fed up with empty words.

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.189
And thus 'deeds, not words' was born.

00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:49.714
The WSPU was all about action, about showing men that women were serious about this and that they

00:05:49.714 --> 00:05:53.884
were going to disrupt society until they got what they wanted.

00:05:56.124 --> 00:05:57.234
And so what did they do?

00:05:57.954 --> 00:06:00.144
Well, they were pretty disruptive.

00:06:00.744 --> 00:06:04.786
They protested, they smashed up windows of shops.

00:06:04.786 --> 00:06:07.416
They chained themselves to railings.

00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:10.381
And they blew up postboxes.

00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:17.331
And they were horribly treated by men, and in particular, by the police.

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:26.381
They were put into prison, of course, what they were doing, despite the fact that the objectives may

00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:33.309
have been good, what they were doing was illegal, and when they were put into prison, the

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:38.814
Suffragettes, the women, they went on hunger strike, they refused to eat.

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:47.113
And so the prison guards would force feed them, they would put a pipe down the women's throats and

00:06:47.113 --> 00:06:49.093
force food down their necks.

00:06:49.963 --> 00:06:51.283
It's pretty horrible stuff.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:07:02.093
And although this frightened some men, the behaviour of the women, others ridiculed the movement,

00:07:02.483 --> 00:07:07.108
and they took this as a opportunity to ridicule women.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:15.448
The name of the movement, the Suffragettes, actually comes from a name that was given to the

00:07:15.448 --> 00:07:20.338
movement by a male journalist from the Daily Mail.

00:07:21.553 --> 00:07:28.993
The name he gave them, the Suffragettes, was intended to ridicule their cause, to make fun of them,

00:07:28.993 --> 00:07:30.193
to belittle them.

00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:40.213
But instead of getting angry about it, they embraced it, saying that the get the 'get' in

00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:44.173
Suffragette means that they were about getting the vote.

00:07:45.517 --> 00:07:53.192
And this wasn't some sort of part-time protest where women took part in it whenever they could.

00:07:54.032 --> 00:08:02.012
Many of the Suffragettes were arrested dozens of times and made active efforts to be put in prison.

00:08:03.257 --> 00:08:12.377
The disruption that they were causing was vital, it was very important to further their cause, to

00:08:13.187 --> 00:08:15.527
help people understand that they were serious.

00:08:16.847 --> 00:08:24.347
What they were doing was not wrong, per se, it was an important step in the journey towards getting

00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:24.877
the vote.

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:27.407
That was at least their theory.

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:37.337
In one of her many trials at court, Emiline Pankhurst, the leader of the Suffragettes told the

00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:44.532
court, "We are here not because we are law-breakers, we are here in our efforts to become

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:45.492
law-makers".

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:55.155
Some of their actions proved more and more militant, more and more extreme, and ended up costing

00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:56.925
some of them their lives.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:07.865
In 1913, at the Epsom Derby, a famous horse race in the UK, a Suffragette called Emily Davison

00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:12.755
rushed onto the track as the horses were running towards her.

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:21.415
She was hit by the King's horse and knocked to the ground and died of her injuries a few days after.

00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:28.195
It's still not clear exactly what her motives were here.

00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:35.660
It didn't seem like she intended to kill herself, and it may have been that she was just trying to

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.270
put a Suffragette banner, a sort of flag on the King's horse.

00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:48.878
But whether it was intentional or an accident gone wrong, didn't really matter at the end.

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:56.498
It was abundantly clear that the Suffragettes were for real and they would stop at nothing until

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:57.248
they got the vote.

00:10:00.128 --> 00:10:08.828
By this time, in 1913 there was much stronger support for the Suffragette movement from men, and it

00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:12.068
looked likely that the vote would come relatively soon.

00:10:13.698 --> 00:10:22.818
However, in 1914 the First World War broke out, and of course, that put an end to the Suffragette

00:10:22.818 --> 00:10:27.249
disruption, as all attentions were focused on the war effort.

00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:36.429
Although on one level, this stalled the progress of the Suffragette movement, it slowed things down,

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:39.299
it actually helped in the background.

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:48.844
One of the reasons given for not allowing women the vote was that they weren't as capable as men,

00:10:48.874 --> 00:10:55.624
they weren't as strong and they weren't as able to have independent thought as men were.

00:10:57.171 --> 00:11:04.491
It obviously seems like nonsense to us now, but at that time it was the prevailing belief, it was

00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:06.291
what a lot of men thought.

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:16.586
Anyway, during the First World War, while men were at the front fighting, things back at home, back

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:19.946
in the UK, were kept going by women.

00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:30.986
Whether it was working in the factories, producing arms, bullets, guns, and so on, or producing food

00:11:31.046 --> 00:11:39.026
to keep the population fed, it was clear, if it hadn't been already, that women were just as capable

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:39.506
as men.

00:11:40.923 --> 00:11:47.133
And this paved the way for women to get the vote, it put women on the path towards getting the vote.

00:11:48.513 --> 00:11:55.378
In February, 1918, while the war was still ongoing, the first women were given the right to vote.

00:11:56.368 --> 00:11:58.768
However, it wasn't universal.

00:11:59.128 --> 00:12:03.928
It was restricted to women over the age of 30 who owned property.

00:12:05.008 --> 00:12:10.648
So it was a start, but certainly not what these Suffragettes had fought for.

00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:20.398
Women had to wait another 10 years, until 1928 for the full rights, which meant that women had

00:12:20.608 --> 00:12:27.268
exactly the same voting rights as men, so everyone over the age of 21 was able to vote.

00:12:29.368 --> 00:12:35.698
Just as a side note, you may know that now the voting age in the UK is 18.

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:41.848
That actually happened in 1970, and of course applied to men and women equally.

00:12:44.393 --> 00:12:50.213
And the Suffragette movement continues to inspire people and be remembered through popular culture.

00:12:51.533 --> 00:12:55.433
If you've seen the film, Mary Poppins, Mrs.

00:12:55.433 --> 00:13:02.543
Banks, the mother of the children returns from a march and sings the song "Sister Suffragette".

00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:13.433
And more recently, in February 2019, female Democrat members of the US Congress dressed

00:13:13.823 --> 00:13:20.363
predominantly in white when they attended President Trump's State of the Union address.

00:13:20.813 --> 00:13:28.103
And the choice of white was because that was in solidarity with the movement.

00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:38.483
Now, it might seem mad to us that this was what had to be done to grant women just equal voting

00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:45.863
rights with men, but it seemed that petitioning and peaceful protest wasn't enough to get the job

00:13:45.863 --> 00:13:46.133
done.

00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:54.738
And of course, it wasn't just in the UK that similar women's movements existed and that women fought

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:55.468
for the vote.

00:13:57.279 --> 00:14:04.516
The interwar period, the period between World War One and World War Two saw many Western countries

00:14:04.546 --> 00:14:05.616
give women the vote.

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:09.256
Although there were a few notable exceptions.

00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:19.931
France, for example, only gave women the vote in 1944, Greece in 1952 and Switzerland, not until

00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:21.011
1971.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:28.662
And of course, unfortunately, there are still a handful of countries where women don't have the same

00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:34.542
voting rights as men, which I'm sure would have Emiline Pankhurst turning in her grave.

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:42.892
Okay then, I hope that this has been an interesting dive into the world of the Suffragettes.

00:14:43.342 --> 00:14:45.772
It's a fascinating story, I think.

00:14:47.082 --> 00:14:54.012
These women were obviously incredibly brave and suffered greatly for their cause, and we all have a

00:14:54.012 --> 00:14:55.152
lot to thank them for.

00:14:56.712 --> 00:15:01.872

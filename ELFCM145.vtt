Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:16.742
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:21.342
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:26.362
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:31.042
football, and specifically, when football became big business.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:35.962
Footballers are some of the best paid people in the entire

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:40.432
world, with many earning astronomical amounts of money.

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:45.602
But it wasn’t so long ago that the situation was very different.

00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:51.602
So, today we are going to take a look at the history of the business of football,

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:57.812
from when it was actually illegal to pay a footballer, through to today, where

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:02.632
the very best footballers can be paid millions of euros every single week.

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:09.322
It’s a really interesting story, so without further ado, let’s get right into it.

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:17.332
Nowadays, it’s a common thing to hear football players talking about their love for the

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:23.262
sport, that the money they make isn’t important, it’s just a number, and that they have

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:28.352
such a deep affection for the game that they would play no matter what they were paid.

00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:35.122
You can decide for yourself whether to believe that, but just over 100 years ago

00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:40.462
it certainly was the case for everyone who played for football clubs in the UK.

00:01:41.012 --> 00:01:44.962
Because they didn’t get paid anything, it was actually

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:48.712
illegal to be paid to play football professionally.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:56.372
Up until then, football players were only allowed to play at an amateur level, they all

00:01:56.382 --> 00:02:02.132
had other jobs, football truly was just something they did out of love for the game.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:09.682
It was only in 1885 that the Football Association, the organisation that

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:15.752
governs the sport in the UK, allowed for footballers to be paid by their clubs.

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:19.182
But, there were certain restrictions.

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:25.272
A club could pay a player, but only if that player had been born

00:02:25.422 --> 00:02:29.832
or had lived for two years within 10 kilometres of the stadium.

00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:33.232
If you think of what that would mean for today’s

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:36.822
game, hardly any professional players would qualify.

00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:41.682
At this time, most footballers were still part-time

00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:45.012
players, they weren’t full-time, professional footballers.

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:49.842
Nevertheless, the clubs started to pay them for their work,

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:53.892
and for the very best players, they were paid quite well.

00:02:54.962 --> 00:03:01.652
The typical salary for an average working man, in a factory, or a normal job,

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:08.292
was around £1 a week at this time, which is around €100 in today’s money.

00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:15.002
But the most skilled footballers were able to command much higher salaries, with

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:22.192
some earning up to £10 a week, so that’s around €1000 a week in today’s money.

00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:27.352
Still, if you are asked to think of a number that footballers

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:32.402
now earn, €1000 a week is probably not the one you think of.

00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:36.402
In any case, it was a lot of money back then.

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:42.652
People thought it was actually too much, and the Football Association

00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:48.382
proposed a cap, a limit, on the amount of money a footballer could be paid.

00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:49.612
That limit?

00:03:50.627 --> 00:03:56.607
It was £4 a week, so around €400 a week in today’s money.

00:03:57.717 --> 00:04:04.267
That limit was introduced from the 1901 season, and there was actually an

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:11.343
official maximum wage that an English club could pay footballers until 1961.

00:04:12.343 --> 00:04:18.047
That limit did increase in line with other salaries, and with inflation,

00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:23.847
but it was still capped at around double the salary of an industrial worker.

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:30.687
After the limit was removed, as one might expect, salaries grew and grew.

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:38.037
Immediately after it was removed, the record was set by the England captain, Johnny

00:04:38.037 --> 00:04:46.187
Haynes, who was paid £100 a week, which is today’s equivalent of about €2,500.

00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:54.047
€2,500 a week is of course a pretty great salary by most people’s standards, but if you

00:04:54.077 --> 00:05:01.437
offered a top football player a salary of €2,500 today they would probably laugh in your face.

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:07.037
Over time, these salary records were broken again and again.

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:12.717
And in line with the salaries, the transfer fees paid by the clubs,

00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:17.467
the money the clubs paid each other to buy players from each other,

00:05:17.937 --> 00:05:22.967
grew and grew, not just inside the UK, but further afield as well.

00:05:23.837 --> 00:05:30.387
In 1961, Luis Suárez Miramontes became the first player to be sold for

00:05:30.387 --> 00:05:38.325
more than £100,000, when he was sold by Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152k.

00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:45.077
In 1979, Nottingham Forest was the first team to pay £1

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:49.657
million to sign a player, a man called Trevor Francis.

00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:56.697
And they also became the first club to pay a player more than £1,200

00:05:56.697 --> 00:06:01.417
a week, and that lucky man was the England goalkeeper Peter Shilton.

00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:08.057
Diego Maradona, who will actually be the subject of the next episode, broke the

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:14.590
record twice, when he was sold from Boca Juniors to Barcelona for £3 million

00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:21.617
in 1982, then from Barcelona to Napoli for £5 million just two years later.

00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:28.227
Then, starting in the mid 1990s, things really started to really shoot up.

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:37.357
I can vividly remember Alan Shearer being sold by Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle in 1996

00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:44.727
for £15 million, and that being considered an eye-wateringly large amount of money.

00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:51.697
It's about €30 million in today’s money, not a huge amount of money for a footballer.

00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:58.415
Then Ronaldo, the original Ronaldo, transferred to Inter Milan for

00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:05.085
£17 million in 1997, Hernan Crespo broke the £30 million mark when he

00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:11.515
swapped Parma for Lazio in 2000 for today’s equivalent of €56 million.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:18.035
And then Zinedine Zidane went from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 for a

00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:25.425
record-breaking 150 billion lire, the equivalent today of around €90 million.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:32.725
Zidane’s transfer record lasted for 8 years, perhaps the bubble had burst, and

00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:38.166
that really was the most that a club could justify paying for a footballer.

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:45.295
But, of course, since then it has been eclipsed several times, most recently with

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:53.935
the €222 million transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain in 2017.

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:58.675
And, naturally, footballer’s salaries have increased

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:02.555
in line with the prices that clubs pay to buy them.

00:08:02.955 --> 00:08:08.815
The best paid footballer in the world at the moment, Lionel Messi, is set to earn

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:14.575
over half a billion euros over the course of his four-year contract at Barcelona.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.595
So, footballers are paid a lot.

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:20.805
And football clubs pay a lot to get footballers.

00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:27.525
But you probably knew this already - what is much more interesting is to ask ourselves….why?

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:36.645
Yes, football is very popular, there is only room for 22 people to play on the field

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:42.475
at any one time, and there are billions of people around the globe who love watching

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:48.735
it, so perhaps it’s only natural that the people on the pitch should be paid so much.

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:56.555
Indeed, there is an article on the Bank of England website which uses football as an

00:08:56.555 --> 00:09:03.645
example to explain supply and demand economics, showing that the best footballers are

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:09.505
in very high demand, and therefore clubs compete to pay the highest salaries for them.

00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:16.685
That is, of course, true, but there are some interesting other elements to the question

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:23.645
of why footballers are paid so much, and when and why football became such a big business.

00:09:24.775 --> 00:09:33.576
Really, the most important period for it, at least in the UK, is the year 1992, when the FA Premier

00:09:33.634 --> 00:09:39.645
League, the Football Association Premiere League, the top league in the country was created.

00:09:40.652 --> 00:09:47.995
The Premier League was created as a way for the best football clubs in the UK to make more money.

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:53.235
Football clubs make money in lots of different ways: from ticket sales,

00:09:53.415 --> 00:09:58.255
sponsorship, and merchandise, but also through the broadcasting rights,

00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:04.335
the rights that TV companies pay to show the matches on the television.

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:14.725
From 1988 to 1992, a TV channel called ITV paid the Football League £11 million

00:10:14.725 --> 00:10:22.135
a year, which is around €25 million in today’s money, to show live matches.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:27.125
It was paid to the English Football League, which would distribute

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:31.585
the money to all of the 92 clubs in the Football League.

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:37.015
For starters this wasn’t much money, and furthermore

00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:41.065
it was shared between almost 100 different clubs.

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:49.085
The best clubs in the country thought "this wasn't very fair", and they decided to break away,

00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:55.945
setting up their own league, the Premier League, and negotiating their own broadcasting deals.

00:10:56.895 --> 00:11:02.985
After a tense negotiating period, the TV broadcasting rights were sold to

00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:10.535
a company called BSkyB, a satellite TV company, for a record-breaking £304

00:11:10.535 --> 00:11:18.315
million, about €500 million in today’s money, over the course of a 5-year period.

00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:23.995
At the time, newspapers questioned how it was possible for it to cost

00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:29.515
so much -  It was almost 10 times what the previous company had paid.

00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:36.665
It was a lot, but it was a lot less than one single footballer, Lionel Messi, is now paid.

00:11:37.555 --> 00:11:42.515
What people hadn’t understood back then was how transformative this

00:11:42.515 --> 00:11:47.295
would be, and how much money there was to be made from football.

00:11:48.205 --> 00:11:51.935
People questioned whether football fans would be willing

00:11:51.935 --> 00:11:55.955
to pay for a satellite TV subscription to watch matches.

00:11:56.755 --> 00:12:02.675
They were, and BSkyB, the company that had shelled out a massive

00:12:02.675 --> 00:12:07.555
sum for the TV rights made a large profit just the following year.

00:12:08.365 --> 00:12:13.447
And, as you may know, the price for the broadcasting rights in the UK,

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:18.655
and also in other countries, has increased dramatically ever since.

00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:26.345
In 2018 the rights to the Premier League matches were bought by a combination of

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:35.265
companies: Sky Sports, BT Sports, and Amazon, for a combined value of €2 billion a season.

00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:40.445
Obviously, it is a lot of money, and this has been one of the major

00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:45.655
reasons that the prices paid for footballers, both the prices paid to get

00:12:45.675 --> 00:12:50.745
them, and their weekly salaries, have reached such stratospheric levels.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:56.105
These clubs receive a lot more money from the broadcasting rights than they

00:12:56.105 --> 00:13:01.195
did 30 years ago, and a large amount of this goes straight on the players.

00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:06.945
As the Bank of England says, it is, on one level, simple supply and demand.

00:13:08.025 --> 00:13:12.625
Obviously, the football clubs want to have the best players, so that they can

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:17.255
have the best chance of winning trophies, so that they can win prize money,

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:22.585
they can keep their fans happy, and get new young fans who will support the

00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:26.845
club for the rest of their life, spending money every year to follow them.

00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:32.895
The clubs have also realised that football players are able to bring in vast amounts of

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:39.995
money off the pitch, that the value of a player is much more than just their playing ability.

00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:47.515
For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid in 2009, they

00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:52.877
paid Manchester United £80 million pounds, almost €100 million euros.

00:13:53.697 --> 00:14:01.037
People at the time said it was a crazy amount of money, but within a year Real Madrid had sold

00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:08.947
1.2 million football shirts with the Ronaldo Number 9 on the back - the amount of money the club

00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:15.587
made just from shirt sales would have practically recouped the amount of money they paid for him.

00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:21.647
And while the footballing world used to be dominated by European

00:14:21.647 --> 00:14:26.387
clubs, big money from outside Europe is starting to have an impact.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:33.777
There have been a series of players who have been lured to China by sky-high wages,

00:14:33.787 --> 00:14:42.057
for example the Brazilian Oscar, who is paid a reported €450,000 every single week.

00:14:43.057 --> 00:14:47.977
While the quality of these Chinese clubs is still nowhere near as high as

00:14:47.977 --> 00:14:52.767
their European counterparts, they are hoping that the arrival of big-name

00:14:52.787 --> 00:14:57.307
players from Europe will at least help them get a new generation of

00:14:57.307 --> 00:15:03.217
fans, sell more stuff and partially offset the huge cost of their wages.

00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:07.507
And back in Europe, there are question marks about

00:15:07.567 --> 00:15:11.117
what this has done to the actual game of football.

00:15:12.107 --> 00:15:19.657
Certainly ticket prices have increased, with standard ticket prices reaching almost €100 for many

00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:26.007
English clubs, and making it unaffordable for many fans to go to the games that they want to.

00:15:27.147 --> 00:15:32.027
And in terms of whether this has actually led to better football,

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:36.737
a higher quality of the game, this is an everlasting question.

00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:44.537
Certainly one would be hard-pressed, it would be very difficult, to argue that footballers are

00:15:44.537 --> 00:15:51.767
now 1,000 times better at the game, even though they are paid in many cases 1,000 times more.

00:15:52.707 --> 00:15:58.687
Yes, perhaps football stadiums might be nicer and safer, and the quality of the

00:15:58.687 --> 00:16:05.097
game has increased overall, but is it so much better that it is justified for a

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:12.747
footballer to earn more in a single day than a nurse or a teacher might do in 10 years?

00:16:13.527 --> 00:16:20.407
Perhaps not, but as the Bank of England rightly points out, this is the law of supply and demand.

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:25.857
Football is an increasingly popular sport, and there is only a very

00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:29.687
small selection of people who can ever be at the top of the game.

00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:36.847
Millions of people pay to watch them live in a stadium, and hundreds of millions more pay to watch

00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:44.257
them on TV, with hundreds of millions more buying shirts, computer games, duvet covers, you name it.

00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:49.967
And as to the question of whether the prices paid by media companies to show

00:16:49.997 --> 00:16:55.027
football matches and the amounts of money paid by clubs to footballers can

00:16:55.027 --> 00:17:00.137
continue to increase, one must surely say that the prices can’t go up forever.

00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:02.387
There must be some sort of ceiling.

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:07.767
While die-hard football fans might still pay €100

00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:13.847
a ticket, would they still pay €200, €500 or €1000?

00:17:14.657 --> 00:17:22.157
It certainly seems unlikely, but at every point that there has been a price paid for TV rights, for

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:29.057
a football player, or for their wages, people have said “that’s mad, it makes absolutely no sense”.

00:17:29.707 --> 00:17:33.577
And then a few weeks, months, or years pass, the record

00:17:33.577 --> 00:17:36.477
is broken, and people say exactly the same thing.

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:43.287
So it would appear that, so long as there are superstar football players, and so long

00:17:43.447 --> 00:17:48.497
as it’s a sport that continues to capture the hearts and minds of billions of people

00:17:48.527 --> 00:17:53.367
from all over the world, there is no limit to how big the business of football can be.

00:17:55.517 --> 00:18:00.697
OK then, that is it for today's episode on When Football Became Big Business.

00:18:01.037 --> 00:18:05.817
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that it’s helped you

00:18:05.827 --> 00:18:11.557
understand some of the factors that mean that footballers are paid such vast amounts of money.

00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:15.757
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the episode.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:19.747
For the football fans among you, what do you think the impact of

00:18:19.747 --> 00:18:23.387
there being so much more money in the business has done to the game?

00:18:24.267 --> 00:18:28.437
And whether you are a football fan or not, what do you think of

00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:32.337
the fact that football players are paid such incredibly high wages?

00:18:32.777 --> 00:18:37.427
Or do you think that they’re not high at all, given the value that they provide?

00:18:38.007 --> 00:18:38.847
I would love to know.

00:18:39.217 --> 00:18:42.027

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:15.875
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.945
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:25.915
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a drug called Ozempic.

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:31.155
To its greatest proponents, it is a miracle drug that will save millions of

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:36.785
lives; to its critics its true dangers will only be understood in years to come.

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:43.025
So in this episode we’ll cover the history of the drug, how it works, why it is

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:48.485
so popular, and what it tells us about the American food and healthcare systems.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:53.725
And, the final point before we start is to say, just in case it wasn’t obvious, that

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:58.905
I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice, so please do not take it as such.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.385
OK then, with that little and I hope superfluous disclaimer

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:06.763
out of the way, let’s get going and talk about Ozempic.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:14.915
It is August at the moment, and millions of Americans will come to Europe for their summer holiday.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.995
For many, it will be an eye-opening experience.

00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:21.975
Paris, Rome, Barcelona.

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:26.995
Museums, art galleries, restaurants, small cobbled streets.

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:32.685
For some, it might even be the first time that they have left the United States.

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:37.245
And judging by posts on social media that tend to increase

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:41.025
at this time of year, many will make a startling discovery.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:46.258
They travel through Europe for a week or so, they drink coffee and eat pain au

00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:51.925
chocolats or filled pastries for breakfast, they eat pizza, pasta, cheese and meat;

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:56.835
they drink beer and wine, they don’t do any exercise for the duration of their trip.

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:04.455
Yet when they get back home they step on the scales and are met by a surprising revelation.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:10.845
Despite having eaten and drunk to their heart’s content, and having

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:15.165
made absolutely no effort to stay in shape, they have lost weight.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:23.105
They then rush to social media to complain that “American food is poison”, and list the reasons that

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:29.335
American food is so unhealthy, and why the US has one of the highest obesity rates in the world.

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:35.455
Now, to state the obvious, obesity is a global problem, Europeans, Asians,

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:40.388
Africans, Australians and South Americans are getting fatter and fatter

00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:45.628
too, and obesity rates tend to increase as a country develops economically.

00:02:46.438 --> 00:02:53.228
But America is unfortunately unique in the size and scale of its obesity epidemic.

00:02:54.638 --> 00:03:05.518
As of the last CDC report, 41.9% of American adults are obese, and a further 31.7% are overweight.

00:03:06.578 --> 00:03:13.968
To put it another way, only 26% of American adults are not either overweight or obese.

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:19.258
And perhaps even more frightening is the situation with children.

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:27.428
20%, or 1 in 5 American children aged between 10-17, are obese.

00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:34.898
Even in very young children, those between 2 and 5 years old, 13% are obese.

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:42.218
As I’m sure you already know, children who are overweight and obese have difficulty losing this

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:48.458
weight as adults, and are much more likely to be plagued by health problems during their lifetime.

00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:54.958
It is a big problem, and it’s no surprise that childhood obesity has been

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.088
called one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century.

00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:05.598
It is a challenge, because decades of doctors and public health officials telling parents

00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:10.508
to make sure that their children eat healthy food and get enough exercise, or telling

00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:16.208
adults that this is what we need to do to lose weight, well it simply hasn’t worked.

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:21.948
It requires a behaviour change, it requires people to change their habits.

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:27.098
And people don’t like doing that unless they absolutely have to.

00:04:28.673 --> 00:04:36.088
But, and it is a big but, what if there were a way to get people to change their behaviour?

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:40.048
What if there were a way to get people to eat less?

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:44.458
What if you could make someone want to eat less?

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:52.132
There is already one way: gastric band surgery, where an operation is performed and a sort

00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:57.392
of knot is tied around the stomach, which restricts the amount of food that someone can eat.

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:03.022
This procedure is generally reserved for people with severe obesity.

00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:10.892
After all, it is an operation that literally cuts someone open and ties a band around their stomach.

00:05:11.822 --> 00:05:15.892
It is an extreme solution for a problem where there is also

00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:20.585
a theoretically simple solution: eat less and exercise more.

00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:27.672
But in December of 2017 a new drug was approved that

00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:32.482
claimed to be a simple solution for this extreme problem.

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:39.552
It was produced by a Danish pharmaceutical company and was given the brand name Ozempic.

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:45.392
It was first approved for use with people with Type 2 Diabetes, which is the

00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:49.682
type of diabetes linked to being overweight or not doing enough exercise.

00:05:50.732 --> 00:05:59.282
And in 2021 it was approved for use with people with obesity under the brand name Wegovy - Wegovy

00:05:59.282 --> 00:06:04.622
and Ozempic are the same drug, just sold in slightly different doses and under different names.

00:06:05.272 --> 00:06:10.372
To avoid confusion, going forward I’ll use the term Ozempic to refer to both of them.

00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:17.162
And, in simple terms, in layman’s terms we could say, the drug works

00:06:17.222 --> 00:06:22.042
by making you feel full for longer, and reducing the urge to eat.

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:30.408
No expensive surgery required, just a simple injection into the thigh or arm or abdomen once a week.

00:06:31.838 --> 00:06:38.738
And, in all of the extensive clinical trials, the drug has shown that it works remarkably well.

00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:45.128
People who take Ozempic want to eat less, so they eat less.

00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:51.888
And unsurprisingly, they lose weight, 15% of their body weight on average.

00:06:53.108 --> 00:06:57.568
And because they lose weight, they reduce the probability of cardiovascular

00:06:57.568 --> 00:07:01.998
disease, heart failure, all of these nasty health conditions that

00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:05.688
you are more likely to suffer if you are overweight or obese.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.134
Hallelujah, some health commentators were saying.

00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:12.584
This was literally a miracle drug.

00:07:13.314 --> 00:07:18.144
As if by magic, it tricked overweight and obese patients into feeling like

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:22.564
they were full so that they didn’t want to eat as much, so they lost weight.

00:07:23.974 --> 00:07:30.404
As word spread, more and more doctors started recommending it to overweight and obese patients.

00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:34.294
After all, it worked, and it was cheap.

00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:37.144
Well, sometimes it was cheap.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:42.154
For Americans with insurance, the cost could be as little as $25

00:07:42.174 --> 00:07:46.794
a month, without insurance it can rise to over $1,000 a month.

00:07:47.764 --> 00:07:54.044
But it was a small price to pay to shed some pounds and return to a more healthy weight.

00:07:55.504 --> 00:08:03.684
And in 2023, just last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended prescribing

00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:10.034
weight-loss medication such as Ozempic to all obese children over the age of 12.

00:08:11.184 --> 00:08:12.724
After all, why not?

00:08:13.404 --> 00:08:19.434
Childhood obesity is a massive problem, there are decades of evidence that a “simple”

00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:24.564
solution of recommending children get more exercise and eat more healthily is ineffective.

00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:31.424
And if there is a drug that can help obese children lose weight and therefore have

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:36.024
fewer health problems later on in life, well that must surely be a good thing.

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:39.874
And it wasn’t just for obese kids.

00:08:40.644 --> 00:08:44.074
Ozempic also became increasingly used by adults who

00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:47.834
were not obese, but who simply wanted to lose weight.

00:08:49.254 --> 00:08:55.094
Celebrities such as Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey posted about how the drug had helped them

00:08:55.094 --> 00:09:02.004
lose weight, and the hashtag Ozempic quickly gained over half a billion views on social media.

00:09:03.454 --> 00:09:07.014
To the producers of Ozempic, the company behind the

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:10.934
miracle drug, this was of course music to their ears.

00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:17.774
The share price increased by almost 60 times, the Danish company that makes it is now

00:09:17.804 --> 00:09:24.224
bigger than the entire Danish economy, and this company, the company that produces

00:09:24.284 --> 00:09:30.091
the drug, was responsible for the entire growth of the Danish economy in 2023.

00:09:31.034 --> 00:09:37.874
It made record profits, and paid a whopping $2.3 billion in income tax

00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:43.914
to the Danish state, equivalent to almost $400 for every Danish citizen.

00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:49.514
And this was driven primarily by the sales of its weight-loss drugs.

00:09:50.814 --> 00:09:56.684
Obviously this was good news for Novo Nordisk, the company behind the drug, it was good

00:09:56.684 --> 00:10:02.544
news for Denmark and its citizens, who were almost literally having dollars transferred

00:10:02.544 --> 00:10:07.489
from American waistlines to their pension pots and already generous healthcare systems.

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:13.859
And it was good news for the American patients, who were shedding pounds in record numbers.

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:15.719
Or was it?

00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:20.099
As you might imagine, there are many prominent voices

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:22.859
that have questioned Americans’ appetite for Ozempic.

00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:29.269
Firstly, there are criticisms of the way the drug works, and what it does to people.

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:34.459
To some, it reportedly alters the way that food tastes,

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:37.565
and results in people losing all pleasure in eating.

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:44.869
Secondly, there is the criticism that the long-term effects of Ozempic are not yet fully understood.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:52.681
It has approval from the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, but it is new, and rushing

00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:58.184
to recommend putting children as young as 12 on the drug, well that is irresponsible.

00:10:59.514 --> 00:11:04.044
But the third category of criticism is perhaps the most important.

00:11:04.954 --> 00:11:08.134
And that’s that Ozempic is not a cure.

00:11:08.564 --> 00:11:10.334
It doesn’t go to the root of the problem.

00:11:11.354 --> 00:11:16.264
To lose weight with Ozempic, you need to take it continuously, it isn’t like a medicine

00:11:16.274 --> 00:11:21.584
where there is a treatment period of 1 or 2 months, or even a year and then its work is done.

00:11:22.284 --> 00:11:26.954
Many patients will need to remain on it forever, and many Ozempic

00:11:26.964 --> 00:11:31.230
users report gaining weight as soon as they stop taking the drug.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.820
If a 12-year-old starts taking Ozempic, it is unlikely

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.510
that they will ever be able to stop taking it.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.700
When you think about the way the drug works, this is kind of obvious; it doesn’t make

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.070
permanent changes to your body, it simply reduces your appetite while you are taking it.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.990
And as soon as you stop taking it, your appetite returns to its normal levels,

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.150
you eat more, and surprise surprise, you will probably end up gaining weight.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:08.310
The root of the problem, to the greatest critics of Ozempic, is both the unhealthy

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.320
nature of American food and the sedentary lifestyle that most Americans lead.

00:12:14.725 --> 00:12:19.855
To go back to the start of the episode, you heard about the classic and perhaps even

00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:25.325
now cliche experience of the American tourist in Europe who finds that they lose weight

00:12:25.575 --> 00:12:30.495
after a couple of weeks in Europe eating pastries, pizza and pasta and drinking wine.

00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:34.565
And when they return to the US, and return to American

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:37.815
food, they find that they put that weight right back on.

00:12:39.227 --> 00:12:44.677
As you may know, American food is somewhat unique in its ultra-processed nature.

00:12:45.607 --> 00:12:51.167
73% of food in the American market is ultra-processed , with the average

00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:56.517
American getting 60% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods.

00:12:57.487 --> 00:13:02.457
And as I’m sure you know, ultra-processed foods are really bad for you.

00:13:02.837 --> 00:13:04.907
They are linked with all sorts of health conditions,

00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:08.257
and have been expressly designed to be addictive.

00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:14.577
That’s exactly why doctors and public health professionals telling people to “eat

00:13:14.607 --> 00:13:21.137
better” or “eat less” has been so ineffective; the majority of American food is

00:13:21.187 --> 00:13:27.347
ultra-processed, and when you eat ultra-processed food, it is hard to eat it in moderation.

00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:33.657
The criticism therefore is that Americans are being “poisoned” and “fattened up”

00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:39.967
by unhealthy food AND they are then being sold the “cure” in the form of Ozempic.

00:13:41.217 --> 00:13:43.317
So, what’s the solution?

00:13:43.897 --> 00:13:48.087
Well, one proposed solution is to make American food healthier

00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:51.997
by increasing regulations on ultra-processed food producers.

00:13:52.797 --> 00:13:55.737
If we could just remove the most unhealthy elements

00:13:55.896 --> 00:13:59.050
from the average American diet, this would be a start.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.640
After all, lots of the most dangerous ingredients in American food

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.140
are simply not allowed in large parts of the rest of the world.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.560
But, clearly, this is easier said than done.

00:14:12.448 --> 00:14:17.267
American food manufacturers wield vast power and spend huge amounts of

00:14:17.297 --> 00:14:22.087
money each year on lobbyists and consultants to influence government policy.

00:14:23.137 --> 00:14:27.817
Big food, as it is called, is simply too big and too powerful.

00:14:28.087 --> 00:14:31.977
There is too much money at stake, too many jobs, too many

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:34.837
palms being greased for anything to be done about it.

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:42.917
And talking of money at stake, pharmaceutical companies, such as the manufacturer of Ozempic, have a

00:14:42.937 --> 00:14:48.727
huge financial interest in making sure that they have an obese population to prescribe medicine to.

00:14:50.107 --> 00:14:53.357
A United States of salad-eating joggers with 32-inch

00:14:53.357 --> 00:14:56.837
waists would be a disaster for the pharmaceutical industry.

00:14:57.917 --> 00:15:02.467
Fortunately for Novo Nordisk, fortunately for American food manufacturers

00:15:02.567 --> 00:15:07.047
and fortunately for Danish pensioners, there are no signs that Americans

00:15:07.047 --> 00:15:11.547
have any intention of putting down the bag of Cheetos or extra large sodas.

00:15:12.557 --> 00:15:17.967
And for as long as that’s the case, Ozempic will continue to reign supreme.

00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:23.147
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Ozempic.

00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:26.547
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:30.327
We are actually going to be following up this episode with another

00:15:30.337 --> 00:15:34.963
episode on another, controversial new invention, e-cigarettes.

00:15:35.273 --> 00:15:38.603
So keep an eye out for that one coming out next week.

00:15:39.132 --> 00:15:43.433
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:15:43.883 --> 00:15:48.793
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

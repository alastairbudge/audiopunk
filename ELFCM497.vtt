Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:16.157
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:20.367
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:27.087
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about overtourism, the phenomenon

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:33.317
of having too many tourists converging on a single destination, and negatively affecting

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:39.527
both their experience of a place and the experience of locals who call that place home.

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:44.237
We’ll see why people are talking about overtourism now when they weren’t

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:48.887
50 years ago, we’ll take a look at a few examples, both well-known and

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:54.937
lesser-known, and ask ourselves how much is too much, when it comes to tourism.

00:00:55.987 --> 00:01:00.507
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:08.687
I’m writing this episode from an Italian city called Trieste, or Trieste as we call it in English.

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:12.867
In case you don’t know it, it is in northeast Italy,

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:16.157
just a few kilometres from the border with Slovenia.

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:21.507
Outside of Italy, the city wasn’t particularly well-known

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:25.097
or visited by tourists until relatively recently.

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:33.407
I first started coming here in 2012, after meeting a girl from the city who is now my wife.

00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:39.467
And then, just over a decade ago, there were hardly any tourists.

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:44.277
You’d see some Austrian number plates, and overhear

00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:48.347
some French or German being spoken, and not much else.

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:55.687
But, over the past few years, Trieste has been experiencing a boom in tourism.

00:01:56.587 --> 00:02:03.167
Huge cruise ships pull up just opposite the main square, casting a large shadow.

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:08.627
You can see tour groups traipsing through the streets, guides speaking

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:13.327
into microphones and holding up flags to make sure people don’t get lost.

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.797
Many restaurants now have menus with English translations,

00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:21.427
which was certainly not a common sight when I first came here.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:28.507
Now, Trieste is not Venice or Florence or Rome, it is still very much a

00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:34.167
second or even third-tier city for tourists, but it was recently named

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:39.926
as a city that is at “high risk” of something called “overtourism”.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.683
I imagine you might have heard of this word before, or at least the concept.

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:52.733
It’s a relatively new word, first appearing in the English dictionary in 2018.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:58.773
If you look it up in the dictionary, you will be met with a definition like

00:02:59.153 --> 00:03:03.893
“the phenomenon whereby certain places of interest are visited by excessive

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:08.543
numbers of tourists, causing undesirable effects for the places visited.”

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.973
The key word there is “excessive”.

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:18.956
In English, as you will probably know, we use the prefix “over”

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:23.413
in front of a word to indicate that something is done too much.

00:03:24.063 --> 00:03:26.763
Overeating is eating too much.

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:29.923
Overpriced means too expensive.

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:33.893
Overcooking means cooking something for far too long.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:38.613
And overtourism means “too much tourism”.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:45.583
Of course, this raises the important question of how much is too much?

00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:50.823
Who decides how many tourists is “the right” amount of tourists,

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:55.123
and what are cities and countries doing to try to achieve this?

00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:02.953
Now, the example of the city of Trieste is one I wanted to start with because it probably isn’t a

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:10.333
city you would first think of when it comes to “overtourism”, but it is one at risk of overtourism

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:16.583
partly because of a city you probably would think of when you think of the word “overtourism”.

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:23.893
The cruise ships that now tower over the main square of Trieste didn’t always use

00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:30.023
to come here; they used to go to a different city just along the coast, Venice.

00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:36.203
Venice, as I imagine you will know and many of you will have experienced

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:40.883
firsthand, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:49.493
20 million people visit Venice every year, which might not sound like that much - it’s less than

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:56.813
half the number of Paris - but Venice is a tiny city built on a series of canals and waterways.

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:04.313
The non-tourist population of the island of Venice is only 50,000, and the sheer

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:10.143
number of tourists at any point of the year makes the residents of the city severely

00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:16.303
outnumbered by its visitors, turning it into an almost Disneyland-type experience.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:20.243
Now, Venice is an extreme example.

00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:26.303
It has been an incredibly popular tourist destination for hundreds of years, going back even

00:05:26.303 --> 00:05:32.853
to the Grand Tour, where young English aristocrats used to tour Europe when they came of age.

00:05:33.693 --> 00:05:37.293
By the way, as a quick side note, we have an episode on

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:41.093
The Grand Tour, it’s number 156 if you’re interested.

00:05:42.353 --> 00:05:44.546
Now, moving back to overtourism.

00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:51.553
What is more interesting to talk about than the very clear problem of overtourism in Venice is the

00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:58.780
problem, or at least phenomenon, of overtourism in other areas, to look into what the key drivers

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.870
of this are, how it is changing these areas and how locals and governments are reacting to this.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.800
So, why are we talking about overtourism?

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.280
Well, on one level it’s simple.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.850
The cost of travel has decreased significantly over the past 30

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.430
years or so, and people around the world have more disposable income.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.190
The result is that there are far more tourists than ever, and the tourism industry is booming.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:41.440
Worldwide there were 25 million tourist arrivals in 1950, but in 2019, the year

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.500
before COVID hit and the tourism industry was decimated, there were 1.5 billion.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.120
And approximately half of these tourism arrivals were in Europe, with cities such as

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.820
Venice, Paris, Rome, and Barcelona being particularly popular tourist destinations.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.890
So, why is this a problem?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.030
Well, first and foremost it is a question of space.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.580
Tourists come to see things or experience new places.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.030
Whether this is a museum or a beach or a village or a national park or a city in general, there

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.120
is a point at which there simply isn’t enough space to accommodate everyone who wants to visit it.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.480
To take a famous but extreme example, The Mona Lisa is less than half a

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.903
metre squared, and 10 million people visit the Louvre every year to see it.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.200
The result is huge queues and most people only being able to see it from a

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.190
distance past other tourists’ smartphones and being shoved along by security

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.750
guards who need to get a certain number of people through every hour.

00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:59.631
There are so many people that everyone has a worse experience.

00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:05.631
And the problem of overtourism is not restricted to museums or monuments.

00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:11.231
Increasingly people are seeking beautiful Instagrammable locations to snap

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:15.751
a photo from, whether that’s the Norwegian fjords or the Amalfi coast.

00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:21.911
People have seen photos of idyllic beaches or landscapes on social media, they

00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:26.921
book a ticket to the same place to get a similar photo only to find that there

00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:30.861
are hundreds of other people lined up to try to take the same photo as them.

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:36.281
This clearly leads to an inferior tourist experience, but

00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.091
it often also is a serious negative for local residents.

00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:47.371
The area becomes more crowded, the price of housing is pushed up, tourists can

00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:52.131
be loud and disrespectful of their surroundings, they wear down the natural

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.821
environment, they leave waste behind, they put pressure on public services.

00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:04.511
And as residents grow outnumbered by tourists, the very nature of a town or city changes.

00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:12.061
Local grocery shops are replaced by souvenir shops, local libraries by spaces for tourists.

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:17.061
The place changes to cater primarily for tourists, and

00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.431
locals play second fiddle, their needs come second.

00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:28.621
After all, to take a very transactional view, tourism is an economic

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.927
arrangement between a country or city and people who do not live there.

00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:38.761
The city encourages people to come and visit it on the implicit condition

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:43.261
that they spend money, that they inject money into the local economy.

00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:49.771
They eat at restaurants, they buy souvenirs, they stay at hotels, all of which provide

00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:55.801
jobs and generate tax receipts, which go into providing services for the local residents.

00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:04.370
And sometimes people underestimate just how much of a contribution tourism makes to a local economy.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:14.790
In France it’s 9.5%, in Italy, it’s around 13%, and in Spain it is even higher at 14.3%.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.960
Even in the UK, which people might not necessarily think of as a

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.570
tourist destination, tourism makes up just over 10% of the economy.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.950
And in a country like Malta, which is heavily reliant

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.120
on tourism, it makes up almost 30% of the economy.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:43.280
But, despite the large part that tourism plays in many countries’ economies, some

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.660
destinations are saying that the number of tourist arrivals has reached such high

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.690
levels that this trade-off, this economic arrangement, needs to be rethought.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:02.290
In other words, yes tourists bring in money but they don’t bring in enough money to

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.420
make up for the disruption and inconvenience they cause to the lives of residents.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.960
The most common tool that cities have been using to combat

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.360
this is implementing or increasing taxes on tourists.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.237
In some cases, it’s a per-night fee, which is 12.5%

00:11:23.507 --> 00:11:26.490
of the cost of accommodation in the case of Amsterdam.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.480
In some cases, it’s a fee simply to enter the city.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.570
Venice trialled a €5 entrance fee this year, and Amsterdam

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.990
already charges €14 to cruise passengers to disembark in the city.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:51.770
The logic behind this is two-fold: firstly, to raise money to invest in services that benefit

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:58.410
local residents and secondly to discourage low-spending tourists from coming in the first place.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.190
And this brings us nicely on to talking about the problem of

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.440
budget travel, at least from the perspective of local residents.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.950
Now, budget travel is great for tourists in many ways.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.070
Low-cost flights have meant that people can travel to destinations

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.270
that might have previously been prohibitively expensive, and they can

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.867
experience new cities and cultures with ease and without breaking the bank.

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:31.547
But what it has led to is a situation in which tourists

00:12:31.797 --> 00:12:35.147
visit a town or city and don’t spend very much money.

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:41.957
They use all of the services of that place, they walk on the roads, they use the buses or

00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:47.837
metro, they lie on the beaches, but their contribution to the local economy is minimal.

00:12:49.317 --> 00:12:54.667
Malta, the tiny Mediterranean island I used to call home, is constantly

00:12:54.697 --> 00:12:58.427
talking about this phenomenon, and what can be done to address it.

00:13:00.137 --> 00:13:07.307
The average tourist in Malta spends just under €110 a day, including accommodation.

00:13:08.347 --> 00:13:14.357
It might sound like quite a lot, but it is actually pretty low by global standards.

00:13:15.607 --> 00:13:23.247
As a point of comparison, the average Chinese tourist in Switzerland spends €400 a day, and

00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:29.247
although costs are higher in Switzerland than in Malta, they aren’t anywhere near four times higher.

00:13:30.517 --> 00:13:36.137
The point is that not all tourists are created equal, there are huge discrepancies

00:13:36.327 --> 00:13:40.787
between how much tourists spend and therefore contribute to a local economy.

00:13:42.027 --> 00:13:49.587
So destinations like Malta are doing everything they can to attract higher-spending tourists, more

00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:56.427
older tourists who will eat at expensive restaurants and stay at hotels and fewer budget-conscious

00:13:56.437 --> 00:14:01.707
tourists who want to stay in Airbnbs and buy beers and sandwiches from supermarkets.

00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:07.777
And on the supply side, many cities are restricting the availability

00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:12.247
of holiday rentals, imposing limits on the number of Airbnbs or

00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:15.737
the number of nights that a property can be rented out every year.

00:14:17.197 --> 00:14:21.287
And in some cities, residents furious about how tourists have

00:14:21.307 --> 00:14:25.107
taken over their city have taken matters into their own hands.

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:31.689
You might have read about how a group of protestors sprayed tourists with water pistols

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:37.079
in Barcelona in July of this year, or how there have been demonstrations in cities like

00:14:37.162 --> 00:14:43.359
Malaga in Spain and Oaxaca in Mexico about how tourism has been adversely affecting

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:49.119
everything from the availability and affordability of housing to access to local services.

00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:56.199
Now, I want to end this episode with a personal example of the real-life effects of tourism.

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:01.579
My wife has a close friend who runs a restaurant in Trieste,

00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:05.909
which, remember, is a relatively small city in northeast Italy.

00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:12.699
It is a nice restaurant, not super fancy, but it serves high-quality Italian fare.

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:19.979
Over the years it has developed a good reputation and has lots of glowing reviews on Google.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:26.809
Although it was never previously a tourist restaurant, it has become very popular with tourists.

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:32.649
I always enjoy talking to her about her business, and the other evening

00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:36.199
we got to speaking about the different types of tourists that she has

00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:40.189
started to see at her restaurant and their different characteristics.

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:47.519
She told me that they hardly have any customers from the cruise ships, because cruise passengers

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:52.679
go back to the ship for dinner, because it will typically be included in their ticket.

00:15:54.009 --> 00:16:00.209
Austrian tourists are her favourite because they have several courses, they order wine,

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:07.049
they leave generous tips, and tend to always be very appreciative of the food and service.

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:12.309
They spend lots of money, they leave good reviews, and they tell their friends.

00:16:13.469 --> 00:16:17.599
She always says that if she could fill up the restaurant with Austrian

00:16:17.599 --> 00:16:22.579
tourists every evening, well that would be a dream situation, financially

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:27.209
at least, but it would mean becoming purely a tourist destination.

00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:32.209
And if you were wondering about what the opposite of an Austrian

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:36.379
would be, it's actually domestic tourists, tourists from Italy.

00:16:37.849 --> 00:16:45.089
In her experience at least, Italian tourists tend to order less, they either order the house

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:51.349
wine or no wine at all, and many are more critical of the food because they are familiar

00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:56.519
with the dishes and feel more comfortable criticising the use of particular ingredients.

00:16:57.489 --> 00:17:02.329
By the way, she says this as an Italian born and bred, from Trieste.

00:17:03.249 --> 00:17:08.989
And when we talked more about it, she told me that before the tourists started to

00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:14.359
come in their masses, her restaurant, like many restaurants, was always struggling.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:18.115
Some nights would be great, others awful.

00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:25.235
And this micro-example is an imperfect example of the at times

00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:28.775
problematic relationship that many cities have with tourism.

00:17:29.925 --> 00:17:33.965
You heard that she doesn’t like the cruise ships, because cruise passengers

00:17:34.265 --> 00:17:38.265
clog up the streets and don’t spend any money at the restaurants.

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:44.005
This is a sentiment that appears to be felt in practically every city that hosts cruise

00:17:44.005 --> 00:17:50.425
ships and why Amsterdam, for example, has started charging them a hefty per-passenger fee.

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:56.085
My wife’s friend also doesn’t want to only cater to tourists, because

00:17:56.375 --> 00:18:00.395
then her restaurant would lose much of its charm and authenticity.

00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:04.835
But at the same time, her restaurant is a business.

00:18:05.075 --> 00:18:09.885
She has cooks and waiters to pay, and she has razor-thin margins.

00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:15.865
Like a town or city, there is limited space in her restaurant, and she doesn’t

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:19.995
want to fill up that limited space with guests who will not spend much money.

00:18:20.855 --> 00:18:25.135
She doesn’t want to increase the prices to such an extent that it becomes unaffordable

00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:29.535
to local people, or turn it into a restaurant that only caters to tourists.

00:18:30.116 --> 00:18:36.045
But at the same time, her landlord comes knocking every month with ever-increasing rent

00:18:36.055 --> 00:18:41.605
bills, the cost of everything has gone up, and her restaurant is full almost every evening.

00:18:42.765 --> 00:18:47.135
To state the obvious, this is a nice problem to have, to have too many

00:18:47.135 --> 00:18:50.765
people who want to come to your restaurant or your town or your city.

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:55.330
But the benefits are not evenly distributed.

00:18:56.072 --> 00:19:01.065
This lady runs a restaurant that’s popular with tourists, so of course she

00:19:01.065 --> 00:19:04.985
will be happier to tolerate a higher number of tourists than someone who

00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:09.475
works for a local school, let’s say, and is facing increasing housing costs.

00:19:11.165 --> 00:19:17.535
So, to wrap things up, for all of the measures that cities are putting in place to discourage

00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:24.145
mass tourism, there seems to be no end in sight to the unstoppable growth of the tourism industry.

00:19:25.133 --> 00:19:32.583
2024 is set to be the biggest year on record for the tourism and travel industry, with tourists

00:19:32.643 --> 00:19:40.533
spending a whopping 11 trillion dollars, which is 1 out of every 10 dollars spent worldwide.

00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:48.303
For people who work in the tourism industry, either directly or indirectly, the global

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:53.683
boom, and news that this is set to continue, has most probably been excellent news.

00:19:54.743 --> 00:20:01.183
But for everyone else, from the young people who cannot afford rent to Dutch pensioners who

00:20:01.183 --> 00:20:07.413
have to sleep with the sounds of people partying outside, the benefits are not so easy to see.

00:20:09.473 --> 00:20:15.187
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the contentious issue of overtourism.

00:20:15.753 --> 00:20:18.793
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:19.473 --> 00:20:23.273
If nothing else, perhaps you’ve learned something about Trieste, which is a

00:20:23.303 --> 00:20:27.633
wonderful city that I would certainly recommend visiting if you ever have the chance.

00:20:28.423 --> 00:20:31.293
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:31.713 --> 00:20:35.033
Do you live in a town or city where overtourism is a problem?

00:20:35.433 --> 00:20:40.003
What do you think about the issue, and what is your town or city doing about it?

00:20:40.483 --> 00:20:43.843
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:44.363 --> 00:20:47.093

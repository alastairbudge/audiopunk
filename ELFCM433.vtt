Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.579
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.479
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.871
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Monopoly.

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:29.281
It’s one of the most popular board games in the world, and has brought joy and

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:34.201
infighting to players and families all over the world, including my own I should add.

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:38.161
And where it came from, well it is an interesting story in

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.471
itself, so let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:48.841
I imagine that most people listening to this will know about the game of Monopoly.

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:55.041
It is one of the best-known, best-selling and best-loved board games of all time.

00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.851
On the off chance that you don’t know what Monopoly is, it’s a board game

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:06.551
where players roll a dice and move around a board, trying to acquire property.

00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:12.901
If you own a property and another player lands on your property, they need to pay you money,

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:17.741
depending on the kind of property that you have and the number of properties that you own.

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:24.511
There are a bunch of other different elements to the game, but it usually ends with

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:29.931
one player acquiring more and more properties and everyone else going bankrupt.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.371
It is a lot of fun, especially if you win.

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:40.161
Now, you might have already heard something about the legend of the origin of monopoly.

00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:42.711
The story goes something like this.

00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:49.831
One evening in Philadelphia, a man called Charles Todd invited his childhood

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:54.491
friend Esther Jones and her husband, Charles Darrow, over for dinner.

00:01:55.711 --> 00:02:02.061
The year was 1932, at the height of The Great Depression, and the Darrows

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:06.551
were no doubt happy for some company and an evening of pleasant conversation.

00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:14.011
After all, Charles Darrow was one of the tens of millions of Americans who had found themself out

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:20.675
of work, he had lost his job, was struggling to make ends meet, and there was little hope in sight.

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:26.265
It was evenings like this, friends and a warm meal, that kept

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:30.205
people’s hopes up, no matter how dire the future might look.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:34.815
When dinner was over, the Todds brought out a board

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:38.635
game and suggested that the four of them have some fun.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:45.335
It wasn’t an official board game, it was something it seemed like the Todds had made themselves.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:52.625
The game involved throwing dice and moving counters around a board, being able to buy

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:57.905
property, real estate, and then collect pretend money if someone landed on your property.

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:03.965
The Darrows took to the game quickly, Charles Darrow in particular.

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:09.015
He loved it, started inventing his own advanced rules, and would

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:13.645
frequently return to his friends’ house to play it again and again.

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:21.755
The game didn’t have an official name, it was just referred to by the group as “the Monopoly game”.

00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:29.355
As Darrow asked more about it, it turned out that quite a few couples they knew

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:35.115
had made copies of this game, all slightly different but with a similar premise.

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:40.775
There were no written rules to the game, and it was passed from one person

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:44.735
to another in a similar fashion to how it was passed from the Todds to

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:49.355
the Darrows: introduced over dinner or at a social gathering of some sort.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:54.025
Charles Darrow thought this was slightly odd.

00:03:54.685 --> 00:04:00.475
After all, it was such a good game, it seemed a shame for it to be so unofficial.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:05.535
So, he decided to start producing copies of the game himself.

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:10.925
He made the boards, colouring them in by hand, with his wife and son helping out too.

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:16.495
They moulded the pieces, typed out the cards the information about the property would be

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:22.805
written on, and packaged it all up in boxes that had previously been used for storing ties.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:29.095
In other words, he took this fledgling of an idea, this unofficial

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:34.335
game, created the official rules and started to produce it en masse.

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:38.445
Well, perhaps not quite “en masse”, but at least in

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.328
relatively large quantities, far greater than ever before.

00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:49.585
It was originally something of a side project, something that he hoped would earn him

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:54.235
some money while he waited for the economy to recover and he could find a full-time job.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:59.105
But before long, it became something much bigger.

00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:04.155
He managed to persuade a Philadelphia department store to stock it.

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:11.285
The store agreed, boxes flew off the shelves, they were very popular, and just a

00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:18.395
year later, in 1935, a toy company called Parker Brothers bought the rights to it.

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:24.565
Now with a large toy distributor behind it, the game exploded.

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:29.075
It became hugely popular all over the country, providing a

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:32.985
welcome respite to economically-challenged American families.

00:05:33.635 --> 00:05:39.054
You bought the game  for a few dollars  and it could guarantee you hundreds of hours

00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:44.494
of fun, and perhaps a few hundred hours more arguing with your family and friends.

00:05:45.584 --> 00:05:50.664
What’s more, it gave you the opportunity to imagine, just for a minute, that you

00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:55.914
were a real estate mogul with a collection of houses and hotels all over the country,

00:05:56.474 --> 00:06:01.514
sitting around collecting rent from other people, instead of your real life situation

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:06.954
which for most of the country meant not having a job and paying rent to someone else.

00:06:08.394 --> 00:06:14.984
And as for Charles Darrow, he had filed a copyright for the game, and he would go on

00:06:14.984 --> 00:06:20.174
to collect royalty payments from Parker Brothers toy company for the rest of his life.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:25.524
By creating this game about people who roll the dice and

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:29.394
can become fabulously wealthy, he did exactly that himself.

00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:34.744
He became the world’s first millionaire game designer in the process.

00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:40.414
But as with many great success stories, there is a twist.

00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:45.634
While Monopoly was bringing families together around dining room tables

00:06:45.814 --> 00:06:49.614
across America, providing a delightful escape from the economic woes

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:56.344
outside, its true origins were much less known, and somewhat controversial.

00:06:57.304 --> 00:07:00.394
See, Charles Darrow was a fraud.

00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:05.604
Or at least, the man himself wasn’t a fraud, but there is more to

00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:09.244
his claim to be the inventor of monopoly than first meets the eye.

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:18.154
The real story of Monopoly started not with Charles Darrow, but with a remarkable woman named

00:07:18.194 --> 00:07:25.224
Elizabeth Magie, a name that until recently was largely unknown in the history of this iconic game.

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:31.394
Elizabeth Magie was a bold and progressive thinker, born in the aftermath

00:07:31.614 --> 00:07:35.334
of the Civil War, a time of great change and upheaval in America.

00:07:36.244 --> 00:07:41.804
Her father, James Magie, was a staunch abolitionist and a friend of Abraham Lincoln.

00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:49.004
He instilled in his daughter a deep sense of justice and a keen awareness of social issues.

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:55.174
And it was from this background that Elizabeth Magie was inspired to create her

00:07:55.254 --> 00:08:01.807
own board game, "The Landlord's Game," which she successfully patented in 1904.

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:07.884
I’ll read you a description of how it was played, and you can decide

00:08:07.884 --> 00:08:11.514
for yourself if you can see any similarities with another game:

00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:15.774
Players used fake money to buy and sell deeds and

00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:18.834
properties, borrowed from the bank, and paid taxes.

00:08:19.514 --> 00:08:25.574
They circled a clearly drawn path, one corner anchored by the Poor House and Public Park.

00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:27.924
across the board was the Jail.

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:35.054
another corned showed a globe with a homage to Magie’s idol, Henry George: “Labour Upon

00:08:35.054 --> 00:08:41.374
Mother Earth Produces Wages.” And included on her original board were the words: “GO TO JAIL”.

00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:46.872
Players circled the board, performing labour and earning wages.

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:50.782
Each time they passed the Mother Earth space they were supposed to

00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:55.272
have performed so much work they received $100 in play money wages.

00:08:56.012 --> 00:08:59.272
Players who ran out of money were sent to the Poor House.

00:08:59.862 --> 00:09:03.752
Trespassing on someone’s land earned you a trip to jail, where

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:07.852
you sat until you either threw a double or paid a $50 fine.

00:09:08.962 --> 00:09:10.662
OK, end of the description.

00:09:11.002 --> 00:09:15.482
It sounds a bit like the game you or I might know as Monopoly, right?

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:23.842
Now, interestingly enough, Elizabeth Magie created two sets of rules for this game: one that

00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:31.232
rewarded all players when wealth was created [the so-called anti-monopolist rule] and another

00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:37.482
where the goal was to crush your opponents and establish monopolies [the monopolist rule].

00:09:38.782 --> 00:09:44.812
It was a teaching tool, a way to demonstrate the injustices of the capitalist system,

00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:51.018
a system that had led to men like JD Rockefeller acquiring monopolies and accumulating

00:09:51.038 --> 00:09:56.038
huge fortunes while most Americans still struggled to put food on the table.

00:09:57.068 --> 00:10:03.498
It was a fun game, it seems, but it was played mainly in left-wing academic circles

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:09.438
and among Quaker communities, including one in Atlantic City, close to Philadelphia.

00:10:10.935 --> 00:10:17.995
Like the version that Darrow was first shown, it was unofficial, evolving as it passed from one

00:10:17.995 --> 00:10:23.445
family to another, with different local neighbourhoods being added to and removed from the board.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:32.038
It might have been intended as a bit of fun and a social statement, but Magie was awarded a patent

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:40.288
for her game in January of 1904, almost 30 years before Darrow made the first version of his game.

00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:44.968
So, it wasn’t his game at all, it was Magie’s.

00:10:46.498 --> 00:10:52.918
And as you might have realised, the version that he was introduced to wasn’t the “anti-monopoly”

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:59.098
one, the one where all players were rewarded for wealth creation, but the “monopolist” one,

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:04.686
the one where you try to amass as much money as possible at the expense of your fellow players.

00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:07.406
Now, back to Magie.

00:11:07.886 --> 00:11:13.016
She was clearly a remarkable lady, and had many other talents and occupations.

00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:20.086
Alongside designing the Landlord’s Game, she wrote short stories and poetry, acted in plays, and

00:11:20.216 --> 00:11:26.386
was a keen advocate for women’s rights and economic reform, there were many strings to her bow.

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:32.386
And then, out of the blue, in 1935, she was contacted by Parker

00:11:32.386 --> 00:11:35.966
Brothers, who wanted to buy her patent for The Landlord’s Game.

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:42.456
She didn’t realise this at the time, but another game that bore a striking

00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:46.066
resemblance to her original “Landlord’s Game” had been taking off.

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:52.406
Parker Brothers were doing everything they could to buy up patents and copyrights

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:57.816
to any similar games, to protect Darrow’s “Monopoly”, their golden goose.

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:03.096
On their search, they came across the patent for “The Landlord’s

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:06.846
Game”, which had been filed more than 30 years beforehand.

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:12.576
They offered Magie a flat fee of $500 for her patent.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:22.826
$500 is about $11,000 in today’s money, not bad going whatsoever, especially for something that

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:27.936
for Magie had been considering as something of a hobby, a bit of fun and social commentary.

00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:37.086
But, when you consider that more than 275 million copies of the game have been sold since

00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:43.916
1935, it was one of the worst deals in history, or best deals if you are Parker Brothers.

00:12:45.826 --> 00:12:49.636
When Magie realised what had happened, it was too late.

00:12:50.946 --> 00:12:56.046
She had sold the rights to her game, and she wouldn’t see a penny more from it.

00:12:57.616 --> 00:13:02.266
And not that she seemed particularly interested in money, but she can’t have been

00:13:02.276 --> 00:13:06.956
best pleased to find out that someone else was getting rich off her creation either.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:13.606
And she was even more angry that the game that she had intended to be a criticism

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:18.656
of monopolistic practices was being played up and down the country to celebrate

00:13:18.766 --> 00:13:23.766
wealth creation and monopolies, exactly the opposite of what she had intended.

00:13:25.466 --> 00:13:32.876
Magie died in 1948, with her role in creating monopoly not even featuring in her obituary.

00:13:34.256 --> 00:13:39.316
And for decades, her contribution to the game remained unknown.

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:46.246
It was only rediscovered in 1974, after a German-American left wing economics

00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:51.776
professor called Ralph Anspach tried to patent a game called “anti-Monopoly”.

00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:58.206
As part of the patent search process for this game, he discovered Magie’s

00:13:58.266 --> 00:14:04.256
original patent from 1904, and this opened up a whole new can of worms.

00:14:04.806 --> 00:14:10.136
It resulted in a lengthy legal battle, with Anspach using it to highlight

00:14:10.186 --> 00:14:14.726
Parker Brother’s monopolistic practices and drawing attention to the

00:14:14.796 --> 00:14:18.956
irony of a company trying to have a monopoly on a game called Monopoly.

00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:27.563
Now, Parker Brothers was bought by the toy giant Hasbro in 1991, and

00:14:27.704 --> 00:14:32.553
Hasbro only really mentions Darrow in its communications, there is zero

00:14:32.553 --> 00:14:36.513
mention of Elizabeth Magie’s involvement in the creation of Monopoly.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:41.783
This does, of course, raise interesting questions about the

00:14:41.783 --> 00:14:45.793
whole idea of patents, copyright and the creative process.

00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:53.163
Lizzie Magie’s the Landlord's game was perhaps the original game centred around moving

00:14:53.163 --> 00:14:57.773
pieces around the board, doing work and collecting money depending on where they landed.

00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:03.423
Darrow’s creation was very similar, but his “creation”,

00:15:03.743 --> 00:15:07.153
if we can call it a creation, came almost 30 years later.

00:15:08.313 --> 00:15:12.103
If it hadn’t been for Magie, there would have been no Landlord’s Game.

00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:16.993
And if it hadn’t been for the Landlord’s Game, there would probably have been no Monopoly.

00:15:18.113 --> 00:15:24.743
But if it hadn’t been for Charles Darrow’s changes to the game and focus on getting it into a toy

00:15:24.743 --> 00:15:31.103
store, it would almost certainly not have reached the success and popularity that it has today.

00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:35.883
And bringing it back to the present day, Monopoly

00:15:35.883 --> 00:15:39.113
is probably the world’s most successful board game.

00:15:39.853 --> 00:15:44.743
From Monopoly Junior, which is aimed at younger players, to even a Braille

00:15:44.763 --> 00:15:49.873
version for the visually impaired, from a French to a Star Wars version,

00:15:50.193 --> 00:15:54.913
the game's adaptability and universality has been key to its success.

00:15:55.823 --> 00:15:58.983
And no matter what kind of country or society you live

00:15:58.983 --> 00:16:03.253
in, it is easy to understand, play, and get behind.

00:16:04.043 --> 00:16:08.493
Acquire stuff through a combination of luck and skill, hope other people

00:16:08.623 --> 00:16:13.893
are not as lucky or skillful as you are, and get rich off others misfortune.

00:16:15.413 --> 00:16:21.893
That might be a cynical and simplistic way of looking at it, but it is precisely Monopoly’s

00:16:21.903 --> 00:16:28.143
simplicity and universality that has made it such a resounding success and global phenomenon.

00:16:29.173 --> 00:16:33.663
But, to bring it back to the original topic, the origin of all of this.

00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:39.283
Who should get the credit, who should be rewarded for the success of Monopoly?

00:16:40.843 --> 00:16:44.233
Darrow certainly grew wealthy from his role in the

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:48.763
creation, and as we heard, Magie got practically nothing.

00:16:49.713 --> 00:16:55.923
It was, in fact, Parker Brothers and then Hasbro who have profited most greatly from the

00:16:55.923 --> 00:17:02.873
invention, and you could say that they are merely the distributor, the final part of the process.

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:06.643
So what does this tell us?

00:17:07.173 --> 00:17:11.183
It’s probably a lesson that Elizabeth Magie would not like to hear.

00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:18.293
It’s that when it comes to something like game development, it isn’t the genius creative who thinks

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:24.803
up the game at her kitchen table, or the out-of-work thirtysomething American salesman who discovers

00:17:24.803 --> 00:17:31.903
it and sells it into a shop, but it’s the huge game distributor that bought up all of the patents.

00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:38.423
Elizabeth Magie certainly wouldn’t be best pleased to hear this, but the story of the

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:44.723
game that she created is perhaps the best example in history of the power of Monopoly.

00:17:47.213 --> 00:17:50.783
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Monopoly.

00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:54.463

Is it the sort of thing that you play with your family over the holidays?

00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:06.683
And did you know about this unusual origin story?

00:18:07.283 --> 00:18:10.443
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

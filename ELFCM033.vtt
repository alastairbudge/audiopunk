Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:10.099
English.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:15.859
The show where you can learn fascinating things about the world at the same time as improving your

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.549
English.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:24.569
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are talking about Universal Basic Income, sometimes known as

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:29.279
citizens income, guaranteed minimum income or just basic income.

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:35.729
It's the idea that the government guarantees you enough money to live on.

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:44.513
It's an idea that has gained a lot of traction, a lot of new supporters and followers over the past

00:00:44.513 --> 00:00:44.993
few years.

00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:49.988
And today we are going to ask ourselves why exactly that is.

00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:56.438
Before we get right into it though, let me just remind those of you listening to this podcast on

00:00:56.738 --> 00:01:03.128
Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iVoox or wherever you get your podcasts, that you can get a copy of the

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:08.188
transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:15.113
The transcript now comes in fancy, new animating format, which I think is a bit like subtitles, but

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:15.803
even better.

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:19.033
So go and check that out, that's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:21.643
Okay then.

00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:30.023
Universal Basic Income has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, but it's not actually a new

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.133
idea at all.

00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:40.143
In fact, Thomas More, who was an advisor to Henry the Eighth, the subject of one of our last

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:49.703
episodes, he proposed the idea of a basic income guaranteed to all citizens in a book called Utopia,

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:55.703
and this was back in the year 1516, over 500 years ago.

00:01:57.373 --> 00:02:04.963
There have been various different variations on this idea throughout the past 500 years, but the

00:02:04.963 --> 00:02:07.123
principle has remained fairly similar.

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:16.668
The intention of Universal Basic Income is that it's a payment to provide enough to cover the basic

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:25.368
cost of living and provide financial security for all citizens, so that the citizens of a country

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:29.058
have enough money to survive, to meet their basic needs.

00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:38.097
It's become more and more popular recently as there is this fear that technology and automation will

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:42.897
lead to more and more job losses, that robots will take everyone's jobs.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:52.107
The idea is that the profits of this automation will go to a much smaller group of people, to the

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:59.607
entrepreneurs, the investors, the programmers, the shareholders, the people who control the robots.

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:10.787
So as a way to counteract this, taxes should be raised and the money would go towards paying for a

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:16.907
Universal Basic Income to guarantee all citizens a basic standard of living.

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:24.634
There are different opinions on who should actually qualify for this income, who actually gets the

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:25.054
money.

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:32.374
Some suggest that every citizen should receive this income - from someone without a job and any

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:35.134
income, right through to a billionaire.

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:43.534
Because it's universal, everyone should get it, and giving it to everyone reduces a large amount of

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:50.019
the bureaucracy and administration that would be involved around deciding who gets it.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:58.424
While others suggest that only people who are below a certain income level or below the poverty line

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:05.624
would receive this, or also that only people who have lost their jobs to automation, to robots,

00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:06.194
would get it.

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:11.764
And there are also different views on who should pay for it.

00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:19.904
Some people say that taxes should be increased on the wealthy, while others say that corporations

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:20.684
should be taxed.

00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:29.349
This is of course, a difference, but the fact that a lot of the most wealthy people get the majority

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:35.349
of their income through a business or businesses, or shareholdings in a business means that

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.409
ultimately the money is coming from a similar place.

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:46.491
Interestingly enough, Universal Income is an idea that has supporters from right across the

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:54.539
political spectrum, from right-wing libertarians, right through to left-wing socialists, and people

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.599
support it for very different reasons of course.

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:03.179
We'll go into exactly why people support it and why people hate it in a minute.

00:05:04.476 --> 00:05:10.417
First though, let's just talk about some of the people who are pushing for some form of Universal

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:11.107
Basic Income.

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:20.547
Firstly, Andrew Yang, the former candidate for the Democratic nomination for president of the United

00:05:20.547 --> 00:05:25.842
States is a big proponent of it, and it formed a big part of his campaign.

00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:36.542
His signature policy was what he called a Freedom Dividend, where every person over the age of 18

00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:43.952
would receive $1,000 per month, regardless of whether they were working or not, so everyone would

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:44.312
get it.

00:05:46.252 --> 00:05:48.142
But it's not just Yang.

00:05:48.762 --> 00:05:56.952
The famous economist, Milton Friedman, who was probably the father of neoliberal economics, he had

00:05:56.952 --> 00:06:05.952
proposed a similar thing, but it was just called a negative tax, whereby people who earned below a

00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:11.562
certain level would be given a top-up, given cash, by the government.

00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:21.180
And the cofounder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, has written extensively about why he thinks a Universal

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.710
Basic Income is a good idea, saying that "cash is the best thing you can do to improve health

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.420
outcomes, education outcomes, and lift people out of poverty."

00:06:35.077 --> 00:06:41.827
It's a very popular idea with the tech industry, and I guess you could say that people working

00:06:41.827 --> 00:06:47.947
within technology have the best idea of the impact that automation will have.

00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:57.507
Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have spoken in favor of Universal Basic Income as have Sir Richard

00:06:57.507 --> 00:06:59.067
Branson and Elon Musk.

00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:08.087
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has been very outspoken about the fact that robots are

00:07:08.087 --> 00:07:14.807
coming to take everyone's jobs and has said that Universal Basic Income is the only solution.

00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:21.937
So there are evidently a lot of very knowledgeable people who are in favour of Universal Basic

00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:22.237
Income.

00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:30.562
Other than the fact that they say that lots of jobs will be lost due to automation, there are a load

00:07:30.562 --> 00:07:36.892
of other benefits that people think will come from widespread adoption of Universal Basic Income.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:45.369
For example, it would lead to people being able to gain and develop new skills and become more

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:49.629
productive instead of being forced to work in a low skilled job.

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:58.549
It would mean that people wouldn't be trapped in terrible jobs with nasty bosses and could have the

00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:06.739
freedom to quit and find a job they wanted instead of being trapped in a job that they hated just to

00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:07.309
pay the rent.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:15.413
It would also get rid of one of the problems of the poverty trap, where in some countries, the more

00:08:15.413 --> 00:08:23.593
you earn the less benefits, the less money from the government you get, and so in some situations

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:29.233
people find themselves with actually less money if they work than if they didn't.

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:34.393
So that's what's called the poverty trap, it's very hard to get out of this cycle.

00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:43.251
A Universal Basic Income would remove this, as you'd get the money whether you worked or not.

00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:47.181
Working would just mean that you got more money, not less.

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:56.931
Also, and this is something that we touched on in our podcast on bullshit jobs, a Universal Basic

00:08:56.961 --> 00:09:00.141
Income would be far easier to administer.

00:09:01.035 --> 00:09:09.041
What this would mean is it would remove a lot of the bureaucracy and administration that is involved

00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:13.058
with the dishing out of social security.

00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:23.138
If a set amount, a set sum of money, is just given out to everyone, then you remove a huge amount of

00:09:23.138 --> 00:09:31.253
administration that is currently involved with assessing, examining, administering funds, checking

00:09:31.253 --> 00:09:32.783
up on people and so on.

00:09:33.743 --> 00:09:41.843
If instead of paying people to administer the distribution of money, you just gave everyone the

00:09:41.843 --> 00:09:47.423
money, everyone would be happier and better off, so the theory goes.

00:09:48.638 --> 00:09:54.589
This is one of the main reasons that it's popular with libertarians, that it means that you can

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:58.069
reduce a huge amount of government administration.

00:10:00.123 --> 00:10:06.634
And finally, for countries that are worried about citizens not having children because they are

00:10:06.694 --> 00:10:13.714
unsure about their economic future, a Universal Basic Income would give young people the confidence

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:19.929
that they could start a family without having to constantly worry about putting food on the table.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:29.309
So in theory, there are a lot of positives and a lot of things in favour of some form of Universal

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:29.999
Basic Income.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:38.006
But of course, there are those that are vehemently opposed to it, they hate the idea.

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:43.556
There are probably three main categories of why people are opposed to it.

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:48.146
Firstly, there's the "how are we going to pay for it?"

00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:48.776
category.

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:57.386
Obviously handing out cash, handing out money, to a large proportion of society is more expensive

00:10:57.386 --> 00:11:03.956
than not handing out cash to a large proportion of society, and so just from a financial point of

00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:10.661
view, opponents of Universal Basic Income are against it because you'd have to raise taxes.

00:11:11.658 --> 00:11:18.172
If we take the example of implementing it, of doing it, in the United States of America, there are

00:11:18.172 --> 00:11:26.807
around 180 million working age adults, and it would cost about two point two trillion dollars to pay

00:11:26.837 --> 00:11:31.190
each of them $1,000 a month, so that's $12,000 a year.

00:11:32.315 --> 00:11:34.175
That's evidently a lot of money.

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:42.650
And even when you factor in that it would replace the existing welfare programs, which cost about $1

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:48.245
trillion a year, that's still an extra one point two trillion dollars that needs to come from

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:48.605
somewhere.

00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:55.293
And then there's the argument of "it'll make people lazy and why should I pay for other people to

00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:56.303
sit on their backsides?"

00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:04.493
That if everyone is suddenly given a handout by the government, it will mean that the incentive to

00:12:04.493 --> 00:12:11.603
work is removed and people stop working, people don't apply for jobs, and people will fall into a

00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:18.863
vicious cycle whereby there isn't the incentive to get a job, so they don't develop new skills, and

00:12:19.163 --> 00:12:21.623
so they become even more unemployable.

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:31.213
Lots of people are against Universal Basic Income because they just don't like the idea of working

00:12:31.213 --> 00:12:37.123
hard just to pay for someone else to get money handed out by the state, to get their money.

00:12:38.053 --> 00:12:39.643
And that's a fair argument, right?

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:44.533
Why should I work just to make money that is then given to someone else who isn't working?

00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:50.035
And then there are the "it's an economic bad idea" arguments.

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:57.175
Firstly, that if everyone just received more money, people would spend that money and it would

00:12:57.295 --> 00:13:03.835
increase inflation because there was more demand for goods, the higher prices would then make it

00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:11.065
harder for those with less money to get by, to manage to keep a decent standard of living.

00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:12.895
And it would just be a vicious circle.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:21.940
There's also the argument that actually comes mainly from the left that Universal Basic Income will

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:30.366
give employers, will give companies, an excuse to pay less than they should in salaries because they

00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:37.131
know that workers are already getting their needs met, that they are getting enough money to live on

00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:38.871
from Universal Basic Income.

00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:47.646
There's also the argument that comes mainly from the left, actually, that universal basic income

00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:54.546
will give employers an excuse to pay less than they should because they know that workers are

00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:57.156
already getting their subsistence needs met.

00:13:57.456 --> 00:14:01.506
They're getting enough money to live on from universal basic income.

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:11.649
So critics say that this means employment wages, the money that people get from work, is likely to

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:12.129
go down.

00:14:14.045 --> 00:14:21.862
The counter argument here is that pay for jobs that people really would rather not do is likely to

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:27.862
increase, but pay for jobs that people would probably quite like to do will decrease.

00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:33.567
So if we take a practical example here, let's take the example of two jobs.

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:40.557
Firstly, a toilet cleaner, which I guess is a job that most people would not choose to do.

00:14:41.187 --> 00:14:45.567
Because fewer people wouldn't want to do it, the pay for that should increase.

00:14:46.767 --> 00:14:54.657
And let's say a job like museum curator or film critic, which is a job that many people would love

00:14:54.657 --> 00:14:58.017
to do, I'm sure, the pay for that would be forced down.

00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:07.497
So there are a lot of pretty persuasive theories, good arguments, both for and against Universal

00:15:07.497 --> 00:15:08.157
Basic Income.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:16.154
And the really interesting thing is that quite a few countries are actually testing it out, not on a

00:15:16.394 --> 00:15:21.644
countrywide level, but are testing it out with small sections of society.

00:15:23.068 --> 00:15:31.460
The most famous Universal Basic Income experiment was in Finland where it gave 2000 unemployed

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:37.910
people 560 euros a month for two years, even if they found work.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.680
So it cost about 27 million euros to do.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:50.390
The programme has now finished, but the people on the programme said that they were very supportive

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:59.090
of it and that it gave them more confidence, it reduced their stress levels and gave them more of an

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:05.420
incentive to find a good job, not just any job, or also to start their own business.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:13.554
The Finnish government was meant to test out the scheme with employed people too, to see whether it

00:16:13.554 --> 00:16:20.814
gave them an incentive to find better jobs, but this scheme never actually took off, never actually

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.244
happened.

00:16:22.644 --> 00:16:30.474
Overall, it's deemed that the Finnish experiment was a moderate success, but not enough of a success

00:16:30.474 --> 00:16:32.154
to roll out to the entire country.

00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:40.305
One other interesting test of Universal Basic Income was actually in the West African country of

00:16:40.335 --> 00:16:40.935
Liberia.

00:16:42.695 --> 00:16:49.535
Researchers wanted to test out whether giving money to alcoholics, drug addicts and criminals would

00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:56.345
mean that they just spent the money on drink, drugs and bad things, or whether they put it to better

00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:56.705
use.

00:16:58.374 --> 00:17:05.694
Actually what happened was the complete opposite of what critics of Universal Basic Income say.

00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:13.434
What happened is that the people who were given the money, they spent the money on things like food

00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:19.254
and activities that helped to try to pull themselves out of their bad situation.

00:17:20.467 --> 00:17:25.859
And Universal Basic Income is also being tested in various states in the United States.

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:31.685
However, it's a bit too early to come to any great conclusions about how effective they are.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:39.747
Whatever you think about Universal Basic Income, I think we can agree that it's a pretty interesting

00:17:39.747 --> 00:17:47.667
idea and there are evidently pretty compelling, pretty strong arguments for and against.

00:17:49.197 --> 00:17:55.197
And while I'm sure we'd all agree that we want to live in a society where everyone is free to not

00:17:55.197 --> 00:18:01.317
have to worry about having a roof over their head or putting enough food on the table, there are

00:18:01.317 --> 00:18:09.237
obviously many different theories about what the best way to do that is and Universal Basic Income

00:18:09.267 --> 00:18:10.317
is just one of them.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:17.227
I always say that I'd love to know what you think of the podcast, and in this case it's especially

00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:17.557
true.

00:18:18.037 --> 00:18:25.237
We have listeners now from I think 140 different countries, and obviously what you think may well

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.737
depend on the country you're from.

00:18:27.342 --> 00:18:33.732
Perhaps in your country, there are already some places where Universal Basic Income is being tested.

00:18:34.812 --> 00:18:40.872
So I'd love to know what you thought of the podcast, both from a general point of view and also what

00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:42.852
you think of Universal Basic Income.

00:18:43.692 --> 00:18:50.862

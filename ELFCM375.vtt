Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.860
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.270
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about someone called Zeno.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.940
Or rather, we aren’t going to talk about the man, so

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.149
much, but his paradoxes, his contradictory statements.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.290
These are statements and riddles that have puzzled

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.110
philosophers and thinkers for going on three thousand years.

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:46.654
They puzzle me, they will probably puzzle you, and no doubt they

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:49.914
will continue to puzzle people for thousands of years to come.

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:55.854
So, let’s not waste a minute, and talk about the paradoxes of Zeno.

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:00.674
Let me start with a simple statement.

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:06.334
If you meet a person on the street and their only words to you

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:11.734
are “I am lying, I am not telling the truth”, what do you think?

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:20.014
Well, you probably think it’s a slightly odd thing for a stranger to say, but when you dig a

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:26.844
little deeper and you really think about it, you realise that it is a problematic statement.

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:33.254
If someone says “I am not telling the truth”, then their statement is

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:37.764
both true and false, they are both telling the truth and they are lying.

00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:42.004
If their statement is true, that they are not telling

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.264
the truth, then they are also telling the truth.

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:51.954
Similarly, if their statement is false, and they are lying about not telling

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:56.234
the truth, then they are telling the truth, which contradicts their statement.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.484
Confusing, right?

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:05.594
This is perhaps the best-known paradox, and it’s called the “Liar’s Paradox”.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:10.824
It is infuriating and frustrating on many levels, because

00:02:10.924 --> 00:02:14.694
it seems ridiculous, illogical, it doesn’t make sense.

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:19.514
But on another level it makes perfect sense, it simply

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:23.764
outlines how logic can be used to defy common sense.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:29.354
And this is the crux, the most important part, of a paradox.

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:36.244
You can use logic and theory to prove that something is the case, even if we know that it is not.

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:42.114
The grandfather of the paradox, even though he wasn't behind

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:46.374
The Liar's Paradox, was a man called Zeno, Zeno of Elea.

00:02:47.404 --> 00:02:53.184
Now, we don’t know a huge amount about the life of Zeno, and what is known, or

00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:57.964
believed to be known about the man is far less interesting than his paradoxes.

00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:05.131
He was a Greek philosopher, and lived in the 5th century BC, in the ancient city of Elea.

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:11.154
Confusingly, perhaps, Elea was in what we call Ancient Greece, but

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:15.324
it's now in Italy, in the province of Campania, just south of Naples.

00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:17.934
This isn’t a paradox.

00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:21.574
It’s easy to understand, as back in the 5th century BC,

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:25.334
this area was populated and controlled by the Greeks.

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:30.544
Anyway, this was where Zeno was born, grew up, and

00:03:30.734 --> 00:03:33.784
created the paradoxes he would go down in history for.

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:37.304
So, to the paradoxes themselves.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:41.384
Historians believe that there may have been up to 40

00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:44.974
different paradoxes, but only 9 survive to this day.

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:50.174
They are fascinating and infuriating in equal measure.

00:03:51.184 --> 00:03:55.354
We don't have time to talk about them all today, but we'll talk about

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:59.694
three of his most famous ones, and if you find this topic interesting,

00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:03.654
well there is a lot of material all over the Internet on the subject.

00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:10.554
So, the first of Zeno's paradoxes that I'd like to talk about today is one I remember

00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:16.554
being told about by a Maths teacher when I was about 14, and being completely struck by it.

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:22.004
This paradox is called Achilles and The Tortoise.

00:04:23.204 --> 00:04:26.844
Achilles, if you remember your Greek history, is a Greek

00:04:26.864 --> 00:04:30.914
warrior who can, amongst other things, run very fast.

00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:38.204
And a tortoise is the animal with a shell on its back that is known for walking very slowly.

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:41.424
So, picture this situation.

00:04:41.984 --> 00:04:48.204
There is a race between Achilles and a tortoise, something very fast and something very slow.

00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:55.254
Because the tortoise is very slow, it is given a head start, an advantage.

00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:59.464
Achilles allows it to start 100 metres ahead of him.

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:05.751
The race is to a tree that is 100 metres in front of the tortoise.

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:13.401
So, you have Achilles at point A, the tortoise at point B, which is 100 metres ahead of Achilles,

00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:20.861
and you have the finish line 100 metres ahead of the tortoise and 200 metres ahead of Achilles.

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:27.171
The tortoise only needs to travel 100 metres to the finish line whereas

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:32.541
Achilles needs to travel 200 metres - 100 metres to catch up to where

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:36.441
the tortoise started, then the remaining 100 metres to the finish line.

00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:45.751
There is a countdown, 3, 2, 1, bang goes the firing pistol and both Achilles and the

00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:52.281
tortoise set off at the same time, running as fast as they can to reach the finish line.

00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:55.021
Who would win the race?

00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:57.661
Well, Achilles would, of course.

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:03.261
You don't need to be a great sports commentator or to know the top speed of a tortoise to know that.

00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:10.401
But, at least according to Zeno, you can logically prove that Achilles will never be

00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:16.291
able to overtake the tortoise, therefore it will be impossible for him to win the race.

00:06:17.671 --> 00:06:19.221
How, you might be thinking?

00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:24.871
Well, remember that the tortoise started 100 metres before Achilles.

00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:30.691
Assuming that the tortoise travels at a constant speed, and does not stop,

00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:35.431
by the time Achilles has reached the point where the tortoise started,

00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:39.911
the tortoise will have moved on, and will be at a different place.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:45.691
Let’s say, for sake of ease, it takes Achilles 10 seconds

00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:49.691
to run 100 metres, he travels at 10 metres per second.

00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:52.661
And the tortoise is much slower.

00:06:53.131 --> 00:06:56.991
Let’s say it takes him 10 seconds to go 1 metres.

00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:02.691
After 10 seconds, where is Achilles and where is the Tortoise?

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.821
Achilles after 10 seconds is at the position the tortoise

00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:11.211
started, and the tortoise is 1 metre ahead of him.

00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:17.361
You could say, well this is ridiculous, in another 10 seconds Achilles will have

00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.151
reached the tree and the tortoise will only have moved 2 metres from where it started.

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:25.611
But here comes the paradox.

00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:30.851
You can use the same logic as we used for Achilles to catch up to

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:35.611
where the tortoise started to logically prove that Achilles will never

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:39.891
be able to overtake the tortoise, he’ll never be able to go past it.

00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:47.181
Achilles will continue to gain ground on the tortoise, he will continue to close

00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:52.381
the distance between him and the tortoise, but in the time it takes for Achilles

00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:56.711
to reach the point where the tortoise was, the tortoise will have moved on.

00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:01.611
If this is a strange thing to get your head around, to

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.601
understand, just imagine that the distances are much larger.

00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:11.951
Let’s say there is a 10km race, and Achilles gives the tortoise a 9km head

00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:18.111
start, so Achilles needs to travel 10km and the tortoise needs to travel 1km.

00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:23.641
It might take 60 minutes for Achilles to run 9km, by which

00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:26.861
time the tortoise might have moved 100 metres, let’s say.

00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:32.171
Then it might take Achilles 30 seconds to run 100 metres,

00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:36.021
and in that 30 seconds the tortoise might have moved 1 metre.

00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:42.301
Then it might take Achilles 0.1 seconds to run 1 metre, and in that

00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:47.301
0.1 seconds the tortoise will have moved forward 0.1 centimetres.

00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:53.481
Then in that 0.1 seconds the tortoise will have moved forward 0.1 millimetres.

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:58.871
So the distances keep on getting smaller and smaller, but logically

00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:03.771
Achilles can never overtake the tortoise, because in the period of time

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:07.831
that he has run to catch up with the tortoise, the tortoise has continued.

00:09:08.984 --> 00:09:14.384
Obviously, this seems ridiculous, because we know that in the real world Achilles

00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:19.304
would be able to overtake the tortoise, our real world experience proves that.

00:09:20.414 --> 00:09:25.624
And of course Zeno knew this too, he simply wanted to show how logic and

00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:30.884
mathematics sometimes give results that contradict what we know to be true.

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:36.444
Let me tell you another one, which is very similar to the first, in that they

00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:41.854
both rely on distances getting smaller and smaller to an infinitesimal size.

00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:45.954
This one is called the Dichotomy Paradox.

00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:52.664
To introduce it, let me start with what again might seem like a ridiculous question.

00:09:54.204 --> 00:09:58.584
Let's say you are standing 100 metres away from your friend and

00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:02.634
you walk towards them in a straight line, you'd get there, right?

00:10:03.814 --> 00:10:04.484
Of course you would.

00:10:05.724 --> 00:10:11.234
Zeno, however, has a paradox that logically and mathematically proves

00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:17.304
that this is impossible, and that all motion and movement is an illusion.

00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:19.324
Let me explain.

00:10:20.464 --> 00:10:24.564
You are standing on the ground and your friend is 100 metres away.

00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:29.224
To reach your friend you first need to get halfway there.

00:10:30.294 --> 00:10:35.634
Then, you need to travel half of the remaining distance, so the remaining ¼ of the way.

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:39.915
Then you need to travel half of this remaining ¼, so ⅛.

00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:44.803
You are currently ⅞ of the way there, so you’re almost there.

00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:50.463
But first you need to travel half of the remaining 1/8, so 1/16.

00:10:51.373 --> 00:10:54.953
And you keep on going, to the smallest imaginable distance.

00:10:56.553 --> 00:10:59.293
And what was that smallest possible distance?

00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:07.193
For Zeno there was no answer to this, because numbers and distances could be divided infinitely.

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:14.343
There is no “final” distance, because every distance every number can be divided again.

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:20.213
So, to go back to the problem of you walking 100 metres, or any

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:23.643
distance for that matter, in a straight line to meet your friend.

00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:29.393
First you need to travel half the distance, then you need to travel half the remaining

00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:35.153
distance, so a quarter, then you need to travel half of the remaining distance, so an eighth.

00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:38.513
And then you need to travel half of that, so one sixteenth.

00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:42.963
And because there is no end to how small these numbers can be

00:11:42.963 --> 00:11:46.853
divided, there is an infinite amount of distances to be travelled.

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:50.863
And it is impossible to travel an infinite distance,

00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:55.013
therefore all movement and motion is impossible.

00:11:56.253 --> 00:12:01.753
There is even another, flipped, version of this paradox, which has the same idea of someone

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:07.223
needing to travel a fixed distance, but before they get to the halfway point between them and

00:12:07.223 --> 00:12:13.433
their destination, they need to travel half of that distance, so a quarter, and before they

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:18.973
get to a quarter they need to get to the halfway point of a quarter, so an eighth, and so on.

00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:26.483
Because there are an infinite number of distances to travel to even start the journey, the logical

00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:33.593
conclusion is that it is impossible to even start, and that all movement must be an illusion.

00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:41.143
Now, our eyes and our reality tell us that this cannot be true; movement is not an illusion.

00:12:42.343 --> 00:12:48.983
And in fact, this paradox has baffled and confused mathematicians and philosophers for millennia.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:56.383
There are now some solutions to it, namely that it is possible to add up an infinite number of

00:12:56.383 --> 00:13:02.583
things and get a finite answer, thereby proving that logic does match our real world expectations.

00:13:03.903 --> 00:13:08.573
One way of solving this, and by proving that it’s possible to add up an

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:13.783
infinite number of things and get a finite answer, is by imagining an object.

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:18.933
In some examples a square is used, in others it's a cake.

00:13:20.403 --> 00:13:22.753
First, let’s take the example of a square.

00:13:24.183 --> 00:13:31.253
Let’s say this square is 1 metre by 1 metre, so it has an area of 1 metre squared.

00:13:32.633 --> 00:13:36.673
If you divide it in two, then two again, then two again, then two again,

00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:41.803
and keep on dividing it in two to infinity, Zeno’s dichotomy paradox would

00:13:41.803 --> 00:13:47.483
suggest that the number is infinity, the square has an area of infinity.

00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:53.703
But we know that the total area of all of the divided squares, all the

00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:59.903
space in the square, equals 1 metre squared, which proves that you can add

00:13:59.903 --> 00:14:04.423
up an infinite number of measurements and still receive a finite answer.

00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:10.573
And if you prefer to think about the example of a cake, well imagine cutting

00:14:10.593 --> 00:14:15.333
half a cake, then the remaining quarter, then an eight, a sixteenth, and so on.

00:14:15.983 --> 00:14:20.473
You know that there is a finite amount of cake, no matter how much you keep on cutting.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:27.913
Now, perhaps even more mind-bending and unusual is The Arrow Paradox.

00:14:29.193 --> 00:14:34.473
For this, Zeno asks us to imagine an arrow flying through the air.

00:14:35.653 --> 00:14:39.053
If you don’t like the idea of an arrow, you can imagine anything - a

00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:43.113
stone, an aeroplane, a cat being catapulted through the sky.

00:14:44.123 --> 00:14:48.513
I’ll continue to use the example of the arrow, because that’s what Zeno used.

00:14:49.643 --> 00:14:51.853
Now, think of the idea of time.

00:14:52.843 --> 00:14:58.703
Time is only a series of moments, fixed periods in time, of “nows”.

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:05.443
In these moments, the arrow is fixed in its position, it doesn’t move.

00:15:06.663 --> 00:15:12.583
And as time consists only of an infinite number of moments, of nows,

00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:17.033
in which an arrow doesn’t move, logically an arrow cannot move.

00:15:17.243 --> 00:15:19.043
Movement is impossible.

00:15:20.663 --> 00:15:23.433
If this is a bit difficult to get your head around,

00:15:23.743 --> 00:15:26.723
let me give you an example that I think is helpful.

00:15:27.523 --> 00:15:31.073
Zeno lived 2,500 years ago, so he didn’t have this

00:15:31.073 --> 00:15:35.213
example, but imagine a photograph of an arrow in the air.

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:40.903
At that exact moment in time, if that moment in time

00:15:40.903 --> 00:15:45.273
is zero seconds, the arrow is still, it isn’t moving.

00:15:45.993 --> 00:15:52.093
The photograph captures it at exactly where it was at that point in time, not moving.

00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:59.513
So, to continue the logical argument, if time consists only of these moments in

00:15:59.513 --> 00:16:05.503
time where the arrow isn’t moving, logically the arrow cannot move through the air.

00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:13.023
Again, this defies common sense, it goes against what we know to be true in the real world.

00:16:14.403 --> 00:16:18.953
For philosophers and mathematicians, this was clearly frustrating.

00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:25.683
If logic and maths are to be a way of explaining what we know to be true, how is it

00:16:25.773 --> 00:16:31.423
that they can also be used to prove that something we know to be true is in fact false?

00:16:32.973 --> 00:16:36.793
As such, mathematicians and philosophers have spent literally

00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:41.243
thousands of years attempting to disprove the paradoxes of Zeno.

00:16:42.093 --> 00:16:46.763
Aristotle interrogated the paradoxes several hundred years after Zeno created them.

00:16:47.283 --> 00:16:51.103
The Italian scholar Thomas Acquinas tried in the 13th century.

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:55.623
The French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and the English philosopher and

00:16:55.623 --> 00:17:00.163
mathematician Bertrand Russel gave it their best attempt in the 20th century.

00:17:00.883 --> 00:17:02.843
And people are still trying.

00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:07.843
And this is the legacy of Zeno and his paradoxes.

00:17:08.473 --> 00:17:12.613
He was the first Western philosopher to really grapple with the concept of

00:17:12.613 --> 00:17:17.973
mathematical infinity, a concept that is incredibly important in modern mathematics.

00:17:19.353 --> 00:17:26.043
When he created these paradoxes, he most likely thought of them as a fun thought exercise, a fun

00:17:26.043 --> 00:17:31.733
and interesting way of testing logic and reason against what we know to be true in the real world.

00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:37.473
In all probability he had little idea that these paradoxes would continue

00:17:37.493 --> 00:17:41.483
to baffle and confuse mathematicians and philosophers, to this very day.

00:17:42.993 --> 00:17:48.653
And if the past two and a half thousand years are anything to go by, people will continue to be

00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:58.293
baffled by them for many thousands of years to come Ok then, that is it for this little exploration

00:17:58.593 --> 00:18:03.833
of the Paradoxes of Zeno, one of the first Western philosophers to have grappled with the concept

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:09.383
of infinity, and get people asking all sorts of questions about what is real and what is not.

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:14.073
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:14.483 --> 00:18:16.253
Did you know about Zeno before?

00:18:16.833 --> 00:18:19.111
Have you ever studied any of these paradoxes?

00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:22.061
What other kinds of paradoxes do you know about?

00:18:22.781 --> 00:18:26.261
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:26.631 --> 00:18:29.321

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:16.641
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.751
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:27.926
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a woman called Geli Raubal.

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:34.871
It is a fascinating story that involves suicide, allegations of violence, infatuation,

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:40.611
and the 20th century’s most famous dictator, and I’m excited to share it with you today.

00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:48.488
Ok then, let’s get right into it and tell the story of Geli Raubal.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:58.003
On September 19th, 1931, the police pushed open the door of an apartment in Munich, in Germany.

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:01.883
There was an eerie silence in the air.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.523
Something seemed wrong.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.343
It didn’t take long for the police to notice.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:13.753
Lying on the floor, in a pool of blood, was a lifeless young girl.

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:20.043
There was a bullet wound to her chest, and a pistol lay by her side.

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:27.853
Her name was Geli Raubal, and she had turned 23 a few months beforehand.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.840
The name Geli Raubal might not mean much to you, and it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080
might not have meant much to many people at the time.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.550
But Geli Raubal was the niece of Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi party, the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.250
political party that had risen from relative obscurity to become the second largest

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.840
party in Germany a year beforehand, and a man who would later be responsible for

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.920
dragging Europe into a war that would claim more lives than any other in human history.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.090
And there was his niece, lying there, dead.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.340
Not only dead, but lying in Adolf Hitler’s apartment,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.780
the bullet that killed her came from his very own gun.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.900
So, what happened, who was Geli Raubal, why do some people think he was responsible

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.150
for her death, perhaps that it was even Hitler himself who pulled the trigger?

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:35.127
First, a bit of family history for you.

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:39.307
Adolf Hitler was the fourth of six children.

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:44.267
His father had been married before, and had two children.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:49.097
The second of which was called Angela, which, if you’re following,

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:54.017
made her Adolf Hitler’s half-sister, his sister from another marriage.

00:02:55.427 --> 00:02:59.387
Although Angela and Adolf didn’t really know each other as children,

00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:04.797
in 1925 she moved in next to him, becoming his housekeeper.

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:12.437
She brought with her her her 17 year old  daughter, who was also called Angela, or Geli for short.

00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:20.277
Technically Geli was Hitler’s half-niece, because her mother was his half-sister, but for

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:25.747
the sake of ease in this episode I’ll refer to her as his “niece” and him as her “uncle”.

00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:30.967
After all, their blood relationship might have been slightly

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:36.137
removed, but Hitler and his half-niece would become very close.

00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:38.837
Now, back to Geli.

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:43.407
She was, reportedly, the sort of person that you would remember.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.717
One woman who knew her described her walking down the

00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:52.127
street one day, saying ‘I saw her and I just stopped dead.

00:03:52.507 --> 00:03:55.707
She was so tall and beautiful that I said nothing.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:59.627
And she saw me standing there and said, ‘Are you frightened

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:03.607
of me?’ And I said, ‘No, I was just admiring you…'

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:10.477
Another, Hitler’s driver, a man called Emil Maurice, who will crop up again shortly,

00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:17.147
said Geli was “a princess, people on the street would turn around” just to stare at her.

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:23.727
And another described her as a “naturally vivacious and flirtatious”

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:28.047
young woman who wanted to go out, dance, and wear makeup.

00:04:29.157 --> 00:04:34.717
Clearly, she was a beautiful young lady with an independent character, someone who you

00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:40.737
would remember, and someone who most likely would have had no shortage of male admirers.

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:47.860
One of those male admirers, it would seem, was her own uncle, Adolf.

00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:55.603
As a quick reminder of the age gap here, Geli was 17 when she went to live with her uncle.

00:04:57.073 --> 00:05:01.387
Adolf Hitler, 19 years her senior, would have been going on 40.

00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:08.443
He was over twice her age, he was literally old enough to be her father, but it was

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:14.233
not such a large age gap that romance would have been completely out of the question.

00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:21.243
Whether or not the feelings were romantic, he was clearly very fond of his young niece.

00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:26.123
He paid for her singing lessons, he would walk around with this young

00:05:26.123 --> 00:05:31.463
girl on his arm, and he wanted her to go with him everywhere he went.

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:38.893
As she grew into a young woman, Hitler also became insanely jealous.

00:05:39.743 --> 00:05:45.163
He didn’t like the way other people looked at Geli; he wanted to keep her for himself.

00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:52.603
You can imagine, therefore, how furious he was when he discovered that Geli had been having

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:59.233
an affair with Hitler’s private driver, a man with Jewish heritage called Emil Maurice.

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:06.593
When he discovered the pair in a compromising position, Hitler reportedly threatened to whip his

00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:13.543
chauffeur, and promptly fired him, reportedly declaring that he should be “shot like a mad dog”.

00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:18.623
Things were never the same between Geli and her uncle after this.

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:23.993
She couldn’t be trusted, and was put under near constant surveillance.

00:06:25.203 --> 00:06:29.833
As you might imagine, this put serious pressure on the young lady.

00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:35.793
She was, essentially, a prisoner in Hitler’s household, and told her

00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:41.013
friends “My uncle is a monster, nobody understands what he demands of me”.

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:44.723
So, what did he demand of her?

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:50.753
She knew, he knew, perhaps her mother knew, but it is now a

00:06:50.753 --> 00:06:54.443
secret that has been forever consigned to the history books.

00:06:55.923 --> 00:07:02.453
Some speculate that the relationship between the two was romantic, or sexual, or both.

00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:08.743
Hitler was clearly infatuated with his young niece, and he was furious

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:12.063
at the thought of her being in a relationship with any other man.

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:17.073
And as for whether the feelings might have been mutual,

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:20.863
he was an up-and-coming politician, a powerful man.

00:07:21.913 --> 00:07:27.573
Sure, his political opinions might have been vile, but is it completely beyond

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:31.243
the realms of possibility that she might have found her uncle attractive

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:36.183
and there have been some kind of romantic relationship between the pair?

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:43.683
Another variant on this theory is that there was some kind of sexual relationship between

00:07:43.683 --> 00:07:51.053
the two, but romance and attraction didn’t play a part in it; in other words, it was abusive.

00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:58.933
Although Hitler didn’t show any signs of being a sexual abuser, clearly he had monstrous

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:05.063
tendencies - is it such a step to think he might have abused a young woman he was obsessed with?

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:11.153
And another theory is that there was no sexual element to the relationship at

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:16.593
all, it was all about Hitler wanting to control his niece and not allow her to

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:22.183
have any kind of relationship with anyone else, well, certainly not any other man.

00:08:23.613 --> 00:08:29.383
Whatever the truth, all of the evidence suggests that Adolf Hitler was completely obsessed with

00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:36.213
his niece, and that he did love her deeply, even if this love might have been warped and twisted.

00:08:37.523 --> 00:08:39.023
So, what happened?

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:44.833
Well, Geli and her mother had moved in with Hitler in 1925.

00:08:46.007 --> 00:08:52.643
In 1927 her affair with Hitler’s chauffeur had been discovered, and she had been kept under what

00:08:52.643 --> 00:08:58.413
we could describe as house arrest, only allowed out with some sort of chaperone, a guard with her.

00:08:59.783 --> 00:09:05.983
In 1929 she had started studying at university in Munich, and had moved into a

00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:11.013
large apartment owned by Hitler, although the two did keep separate bedrooms.

00:09:12.263 --> 00:09:18.951
And a year and a half later, on the morning of September 18th, 1931 the pair

00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:25.103
would be heard having a huge argument, shouting and shrieking at each other.

00:09:26.283 --> 00:09:33.993
The following day, on September 19th, Geli Raubal would be found dead, in a pool of her own blood.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.380
The truth about what actually happened will most

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.960
likely never be revealed, but here are the theories.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.900
The first category of theories, if we can call them

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.310
that, revolve around the idea that she killed herself.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.490
Naturally, if someone is found in a pool of their blood

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.090
with a gun by their side, this is the obvious answer.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.080
But, you are probably thinking, if she killed herself, why did she do it?

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.980
One theory is that the argument with her uncle was over a potential husband, a young Jewish man.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.760
She wanted to go to Vienna, so the theory goes, to get engaged to this man.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.280
Hitler forbade it, he said it was absolutely not allowed, and,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.550
unable to bear the sorrow, the heartbreak, she killed herself.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.590
Another was that she had stage fright; she was about

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.550
to have her musical debut and she got frightened.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.610
This would be the official verdict given by the police and the Nazi party.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.620
Another was that the pressure from Hitler was too great, that she

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.210
couldn’t continue her life as a prisoner, and this was the only way out.

00:10:54.517 --> 00:10:58.714
Another is that she was jealous of Hitler, who was forming an

00:10:58.714 --> 00:11:02.464
increasingly close relationship with another woman, Eva Braun.

00:11:03.634 --> 00:11:06.884
Geli couldn’t bear the possibility of losing her uncle

00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:10.554
to another woman, so this was her only route out.

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:17.884
Another might sound even more extreme, and it’s that she was pregnant with Hitler’s child.

00:11:19.084 --> 00:11:22.404
This would have been problematic for many reasons, but

00:11:22.684 --> 00:11:25.904
particularly the fact that the two were so closely related.

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:31.204
Killing herself was the only route out, so the theory goes.

00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:37.204
And there’s another related theory that she was pregnant, not with Hitler’s

00:11:37.204 --> 00:11:43.054
child, but with the child of another man, the mysterious Jewish man from Vienna.

00:11:44.334 --> 00:11:48.564
If Hitler had been furious to find out that Geli was merely having an affair with

00:11:48.564 --> 00:11:53.864
his partially Jewish driver, imagine the fury that he would have unleashed when

00:11:53.864 --> 00:11:59.094
he found out that his adored niece was pregnant with the child of a Jewish man.

00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:06.094
Now, there are other theories that Geli did indeed kill herself, she pulled

00:12:06.094 --> 00:12:11.404
the trigger, she shot herself, but she didn’t actually mean to kill herself.

00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:16.454
The reason for doing this could have been any of the ones I just mentioned,

00:12:16.854 --> 00:12:20.014
from showing her uncle she was serious about getting married to the Jewish

00:12:20.044 --> 00:12:24.534
man in Vienna through to that he needed to stop being so possessive of her.

00:12:26.034 --> 00:12:32.414
This might sound like an extreme length to go to to get someone’s attention, but perhaps

00:12:32.474 --> 00:12:37.174
shooting herself was the only way she thought she could get her uncle’s attention.

00:12:38.844 --> 00:12:43.014
Although we don’t know anything about the kind of discussions and arguments

00:12:43.174 --> 00:12:48.224
that Hitler had with his niece, his later actions don’t give us much confidence

00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:52.694
that he would have been a rational person, open to sensible arguments.

00:12:53.664 --> 00:12:58.844
Perhaps Geli thought the only way she could show her uncle that she was serious about

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:04.314
whatever she was proposing was by going to such an extreme length as attempting suicide.

00:13:05.564 --> 00:13:09.794
In fact, another of Hitler’s lovers did this, Eva Braun.

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:14.704
She tried to kill herself on two separate occasions to get Hitler’s

00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:19.604
attention, once by shooting herself and once by taking sedatives.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:24.954
Clearly, in her case, it did work, or at least she

00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:27.754
didn’t die and Hitler started paying more attention.

00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:34.584
Now, as to our third category of theory, this revolves around the

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:38.934
idea that it was Adolf Hitler himself who pulled the trigger, it was

00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:43.274
the future Fuhrer who killed his 23-year-old niece in cold blood.

00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:49.057
Although this would make for a gripping story, a plot twist

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:53.407
even, the timeline for this makes it seem a little unlikely.

00:13:54.357 --> 00:13:59.047
Hitler and his niece had lunch on the Friday, he left Munich for Hamburg

00:13:59.177 --> 00:14:03.267
shortly after lunch, and Geli was found dead the following morning.

00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:07.027
He had an alibi, that he simply wasn’t there.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:14.657
But there are some clues that suggest this might not be as plausible as it seems.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:23.517
Geli was found with a fractured nose, a broken nose, as if someone had hit her very hard.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:28.503
On her desk was a letter she was writing to a friend in

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:32.083
Vienna, which described how she was excited about her trip.

00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:39.454
But the letter ended abruptly, almost as if someone had interrupted her in the middle of writing it.

00:14:40.723 --> 00:14:44.973
Sure, it’s possible that she was writing an excited letter to her friend

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:50.653
and then stopped in the middle of it to shoot herself but it seems…unlikely.

00:14:52.093 --> 00:14:57.873
What’s more, when she was found dead on the Saturday morning, it’s believed that she could

00:14:58.013 --> 00:15:03.633
have been dead for anywhere up to 24 hours, so she could have been shot the day before.

00:15:05.033 --> 00:15:10.073
So, why would Hitler have killed his niece, or have arranged for someone else to

00:15:10.073 --> 00:15:15.323
do it, or that a senior member of the Nazi party took matters into their own hands?

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:23.280
The theories mainly revolve around the idea that Geli posed a threat to the rise of the Nazi

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.310
party; she knew things that could prove dangerous to Hitler if they became public knowledge.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.090
There are rumours of explicit letters that Hitler wrote to Geli, and

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.980
even some of pornographic sketches that Hitler made of his niece.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.680
Even if there was no physical evidence, Geli knew things, or at least

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.880
people thought she knew intimate, embarrassing, details about Hitler.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.985
She was talking to her friends or a mysterious Jewish lover about

00:15:56.095 --> 00:16:01.455
Hitler’s infatuation for her, of the things that she said he made her do.

00:16:02.865 --> 00:16:07.355
Clearly, this was politically very dangerous for both Hitler and

00:16:07.355 --> 00:16:12.905
the Nazi party, so either he or someone else silenced her forever.

00:16:14.485 --> 00:16:20.345
Now, this is purely a theory, but the ruthlessness that the Nazi party would show

00:16:20.495 --> 00:16:24.465
in terms of killing anyone who got in its way suggests that they wouldn’t have

00:16:24.465 --> 00:16:28.805
thought twice about getting rid of Hitler’s niece if she was a perceived threat.

00:16:30.325 --> 00:16:36.635
Whatever really happened to Geli Raubal in that apartment, it had a profound effect on Hitler.

00:16:37.995 --> 00:16:43.685
Of course, it’s hard to have any sympathy for the man, not only because of his later atrocities,

00:16:43.975 --> 00:16:49.045
but also because he was directly or indirectly responsible for this young woman’s death.

00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:54.445
It did, however, undeniably cause him great sorrow.

00:16:55.715 --> 00:17:00.275
He missed her funeral, preferring to be on his own at a lake house.

00:17:01.215 --> 00:17:04.795
He declared that all of her clothes and belongings should be

00:17:04.795 --> 00:17:09.335
gathered in one room, which would be kept as a shine to her memory.

00:17:10.825 --> 00:17:16.175
Some within the Nazi party even feared that he would kill himself out of sadness.

00:17:17.755 --> 00:17:22.275
And the Nazi party acted fast to try to minimise the political

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:25.975
damage caused, and to hide this from the German public.

00:17:27.335 --> 00:17:31.108
Remember, this was in September of 1931.

00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:37.215
He was the country’s hottest up-and-coming politician, and would become Chancellor

00:17:37.445 --> 00:17:43.015
on the 30th of January 1933, less than a year and a half after Geli’s death.

00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:47.685
The party had to act, and act fast.

00:17:48.155 --> 00:17:49.995
The fewer questions, the better.

00:17:51.115 --> 00:17:55.415
There was no proper post-mortem or investigation into her death.

00:17:56.605 --> 00:18:00.205
Her body was discovered on Saturday morning and immediately

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:03.485
sent away before the newspapers came out on the Monday.

00:18:04.845 --> 00:18:07.355
Still, question marks were asked.

00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:15.185
One anti-Nazi paper started with the headline A MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR: HITLER’S NIECE

00:18:15.265 --> 00:18:19.815
COMMITS SUICIDE, asking the questions that you heard about a few minutes ago.

00:18:21.145 --> 00:18:26.525
Other newspapers followed, Hitler was forced to issue a written statement denying any

00:18:26.535 --> 00:18:32.835
involvement in it, and for a brief period it looked like this might turn into a real

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:38.815
national scandal, one that could even topple the upcoming politician’s rise to power.

00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:41.175
It wasn’t to be.

00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:47.865
The cover-up, or at least attempts to make sure no questions could be asked, worked.

00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:54.765
Geli’s body was hidden away from view, any evidence was destroyed or taken

00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:59.745
away by the Nazi party, so there was simply no way to get to the truth.

00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:06.505
And as you’ll know this did nothing to stop Hitler’s rise to power.

00:19:07.225 --> 00:19:10.015
Hitler became the Fuhrer, marching into Poland

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:12.925
shortly before the eighth anniversary of Geli’s death.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:20.267
This was almost 100 years ago now, so as to the question of who pulled

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:25.977
the trigger, and why, unless some radical new evidence emerges, this

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:30.447
is going to be one of those mysteries forever consigned to history.

00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:37.857
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Geli Raubal, Hitler’s murdered

00:19:37.857 --> 00:19:42.777
lover, or at least dead half-niece, depending on which theory you like the most.

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:46.907
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:47.377 --> 00:19:52.097
What do you think is the most plausible of the explanations for Geli Raubal’s death?

00:19:52.717 --> 00:19:57.637
How do you think the world might have been different had this scandal toppled Adolf Hitler?

00:19:58.287 --> 00:20:01.677
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

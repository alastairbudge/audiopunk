Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.690
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.739
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.709
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of a new

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.380
three-part mini-series on thinkers and philosophers.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.910
In part one, in this episode we’ll talk about Marcus Aurelius, the so-called “philosopher emperor”.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.869
In part two,  we’ll talk about a gloomy German, the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.310
so-called “philosopher of pessimism”, Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.990
And in part three we will talk about Ayn Rand, the self-proclaimed “Radical for Capitalism”.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.209
They are all very different people with very different outlooks on life, so I hope this

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.910
mini-series will provide you with some interesting variety on how these individuals saw the world.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.540
OK then, Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher emperor.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.430
It might sound like the world’s greatest understatement

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.902
to say that a lot has changed since the year AD 170.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.020
Clearly, a lot has changed, it has been almost 2,000 years.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.749
But millions of people around the world, perhaps more accurately tens of millions or even hundreds

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.370
of millions of people, find themselves turning to the words of a man from the 2nd century.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:38.700
To be precise, they find themselves turning to the philosophy of

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.040
Marcus Aurelius, the last of the so-called Five Good Roman Emperors.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.690
Sales of his philosophical musings, Meditations, have boomed in recent years, going from a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.170
mere 16,000 in 2012 to more than 100,000 by 2019, the last year that figures were released.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.169
And judging by how many posts and videos there are all over Twitter,

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:13.585
Instagram and TikTok, that number is presumably a lot higher in 2024.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.949
The interesting thing is that Meditations, this now best-selling book, wasn’t even written as a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.980
book, it wasn’t intended for public consumption, it was Marcus Aurelius’s own notes to himself.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.150
It wasn’t even called Meditations, and wasn’t published and made available

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.039
to the public until the 16th century, 1,400 years after its author’s death.

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.220
Now, let me tell you a bit about the man, Marcus Aurelius, before we go onto his philosophy.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.730
He was born in AD 121, in a time of relative peace, at least if you were a Roman.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.299
He became emperor shortly before his fortieth birthday.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.830
And this transition to emperor did not come as a surprise; he had been groomed for it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.579
from a young man, and had had plenty of time to contemplate what such power would entail.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.290
And if you know anything about Roman emperors, it’s that very few

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.260
managed to resist the temptations that this power afforded them.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.210
Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero, these are all names of men who were completely

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.050
corrupted by the power of Rome, and who did truly atrocious things.

00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.200
But Marcus Aurelius was different.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.190
There were no orgies, incest, executions of family members or declarations that he was a god.

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:56.870
The path he chose was of simplicity, of striving above everything else to live a “virtuous” life.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.090
We know from historical records that Marcus Aurelius was considered to be a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.290
good man and a benevolent emperor, but to really understand why he behaved

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.510
in this way, especially when so many other Roman emperors didn’t, we need

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.000
to look at Meditations, his writings on his philosophical outlook on life.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.679
It’s here that we can understand the “why”.

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:30.351
Now, the first thing to underline about Meditations is that the major difference

00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:36.091
between it and other philosophical works is that it was never intended to be published.

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:40.551
Marcus Aurelius might be known as a modern philosopher,

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:44.569
but in life he was an Emperor, not a philosopher.

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:50.681
Meditations was Marcus Aurelius’s personal notes to himself,

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:55.131
kind of like a diary but without the “today I did this”.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:05:00.461
It was more his own account of how to be human, of what the purpose

00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:06.651
of life truly is, so this gives it an authenticity that is unusual.

00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:12.351
Aurelius wasn’t trying to impress anyone, he wasn’t trying to debate

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:17.371
or argue or make complicated philosophical arguments; he was writing

00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:22.331
down these thoughts for one person and one person only: himself.

00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:29.411
I should add that if you haven’t read Meditations, it is pretty short and accessible,

00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:36.151
something like 150 pages, spread over 12 different short books, which you don’t have to read

00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:41.211
in order, so pick up a copy if this sounds like an idea that you would like to explore further.

00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:48.466
Right, let’s go through 5 key ideas and themes that you can find in Meditations.

00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:55.061
The first, and perhaps overriding idea in Meditations is about what you can

00:05:55.061 --> 00:06:00.711
control in life and what you can’t, and how that should impact your behaviour.

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:06.301
Aurelius writes about how external events are beyond our

00:06:06.301 --> 00:06:10.021
control; and therefore it is pointless worrying about them.

00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:14.891
If there is a tsunami on the other side of the world, or a stranger insults

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:20.221
you or you are stung by a bee, there is no point in getting angry or upset.

00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:25.501
You have no control over these events, they are outside your sphere of

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:30.191
influence, and worrying about them can bring you unnecessary distress.

00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:34.971
What you should focus on instead is on what you can control:

00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:40.341
your actions and behaviour, and your reaction to external events.

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:44.171
And if you cannot do anything about something that has

00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:47.941
already happened, there is no value in worrying about it.

00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:55.281
The second idea in Meditations is about the importance of living according to nature.

00:06:56.071 --> 00:07:00.281
Now, this doesn’t mean going out into nature and putting up a house of sticks.

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:03.531
It is to do with the natural laws of the universe.

00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:12.051
Marcus Aurelius believed that every individual has a role to play in the cosmos, bees gather

00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:18.341
nectar, sheep eat grass, fish swim around in the rivers and seas and do whatever fish do.

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:26.761
For humans, living according to nature means behaving in a way that is rational and

00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:32.931
virtuous, aligning one's actions with the inherent rational structure of the universe.

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:37.564
There is a “right” way to behave, according to Marcus Aurelius,

00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:42.111
and this way is by helping and cooperating with other people.

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:46.791
Our purpose, our role in the world, is to use reason

00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:50.821
to understand nature and live by its principles.

00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:59.101
The third theme explored in Meditations is the practice of reflection and self-examination.

00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:04.261
Aurelius advocates for a life of continuous self-assessment

00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.221
and vigilance over your own thoughts and actions.

00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:13.051
He writes about the importance of questioning your impulses and desires, to ensure

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:18.381
they are rooted in reason and not in fleeting emotions or external pressures.

00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:24.011
This introspection helps to cultivate a disciplined mind,

00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:28.471
and leads to greater personal integrity and inner peace.

00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:34.821
In other words, when you feel like you want to do something, ask yourself why?

00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:40.491
Is there a good reason for it, or are you acting on instinct or because you are being

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:44.821
pressured into doing something that you would not do if you were thinking rationally.

00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:54.191
The fourth major idea is the acceptance of fate, or to be precise, to embrace and welcome fate.

00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:59.351
Amor fati, for the Latinists among you, a love of one's fate.

00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.751
Marcus Aurelius writes that we should embrace whatever happens to us,

00:09:05.021 --> 00:09:09.701
even suffering and adversity, as necessary parts of the universe's plan.

00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:16.511
This does not mean we are all passive, flopping over and accepting whatever life

00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:21.921
throws at us; instead, it's an encouragement to face challenges with courage

00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:27.161
and to find meaning in them, rather than getting upset or trying to avoid them.

00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:35.891
Finally, the fifth key idea in Meditations is the concept of impermanence and mortality.

00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.381
Aurelius repeatedly reminds himself of the transient nature of life,

00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:46.541
urging himself to focus on living virtuously in the present moment

00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:50.691
without attachment to material things or external recognition.

00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:58.831
This awareness of mortality is meant to heighten the appreciation of life and the urgency

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:04.871
to live well, as everything and everyone is subject to the inevitable decay of time.

00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:13.681
Now, that is clearly a very abridged version of some of the key ideas in Meditations, and as

00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.261
I said, I’d certainly encourage you to pick up a copy if you’d like to explore these further.

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:24.791
If you hadn’t heard these before, perhaps you might be thinking “well, it’s easy enough for him to

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:29.951
say that we shouldn’t worry about events beyond our control and that we should accept whatever life

00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:34.991
throws at us - he was Roman emperor after all, I guess he didn’t have to worry about all that much!”

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:40.391
Yes, on one level, you’re right, he was Roman Emperor.

00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.171
And he didn’t have to worry about putting enough food on the table, but

00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:49.961
his life was full of managing conflicts, dealing with rivalries, and

00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:55.111
managing–pretty successfully I should add–one of the largest empires of all time.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.381
But it’s worth remembering a few things.

00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:06.191
Firstly, as we’ve said multiple times, Marcus Aurelius was not writing this for anyone

00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:11.551
other than himself, he was not trying to preach to anyone and tell them what they should do.

00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:15.621
When he wrote “you should do this”, the reader he was

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:19.471
referring to was not me, was not you, it was himself.

00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:25.061
And in Meditations he does not claim to be a paradigm of

00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:29.121
virtue and to always live by his own rules and guidelines.

00:11:29.751 --> 00:11:30.911
That’s exactly the point.

00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:36.001
He is, at times, weak and he struggles to live by his own rules.

00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:39.511
He writes about how he finds it difficult to get out of bed in the

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:43.251
morning, he writes about his own moments of frustration with others,

00:11:43.571 --> 00:11:48.651
his impatience with servants, and about the temptations that he faces.

00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:53.781
When he realises that he has displayed arrogance or anger,

00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:58.191
he recognises it and warns himself not to do it again.

00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:03.231
That’s precisely why he needs these guidelines, so that he can constantly

00:12:03.231 --> 00:12:08.811
refer back to them and remind himself what the virtuous course of action is.

00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:15.411
And when you read about his advice to embrace suffering rather than to get upset,

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:21.601
you might think, well he probably never really suffered or experienced any real pain.

00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:27.561
No, he also experienced great pain and suffering in his personal life.

00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:35.711
He had 13 children, but he lost 9 of them in childhood, only 4 of his children survived.

00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:40.011
It’s completely unbearable for any parent to contemplate losing

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:44.721
any child, but to think that this man went through it 9 times.

00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:52.491
Yes, infant mortality was significantly higher back then, but it shows remarkable character

00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:58.701
that he did not allow these nine heartbreaking experiences to change his philosophy and outlook

00:12:58.701 --> 00:13:05.381
on life, instead, reminding himself that he should embrace fate and not allow it to break him.

00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:12.511
Now, you heard that Marcus Aurelius is enjoying a large resurgence in the 21st century,

00:13:13.011 --> 00:13:18.821
as is Stoicism, the Ancient Greek philosophy from which a lot of these ideas come from.

00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:26.411
As to the question of why, well, perhaps you’ve been listening to this and you’ve been

00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:33.291
nodding along, thinking, yes, that makes sense, in that case you can probably understand why.

00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:37.511
His philosophy and writings are very accessible.

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:43.441
Unlike more traditional philosophers, Aurelius didn't deal in dense

00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:48.051
theoretical concepts, but practical advice rooted in principles

00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:53.461
like resilience, acceptance of fate, and consciousness of mortality.

00:13:54.451 --> 00:14:00.411
It is pragmatic, easy to understand, and easy to follow, or at least, if

00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:03.961
you are prepared to go the lengths to follow it, it is easy to follow.

00:14:05.571 --> 00:14:11.481
Secondly, this accessibility and bite-sized nature is almost perfectly

00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:15.381
applicable to the way in which many people consume information nowadays.

00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:20.751
Instead of lengthy philosophical papers, people want soundbites,

00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:25.601
short sentences that can be put on a social media post or short video.

00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:32.051
Clearly, Marcus Aurelius was not writing for an audience with a short attention span,

00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:39.481
but his world outlook was, strangely enough, perfectly crafted for the TikTok generation.

00:14:40.951 --> 00:14:44.261
Thirdly, it is authentic and raw.

00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:50.211
As you heard, he never claims to be perfect, and Meditations is

00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:54.581
full of his personal struggles to live a good and virtuous life.

00:14:55.351 --> 00:15:00.201
Anyone reading this can empathise, we all struggle to do “the right thing”.

00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:08.608
To wrap things up, Meditations serves as a timeless reminder that no station in life is immune to

00:15:08.608 --> 00:15:15.318
suffering, and that everyone, no matter how different, no matter how rich and powerful, struggles

00:15:15.328 --> 00:15:21.598
with the same things: temptations, making bad decisions, even getting out of bed in the morning.

00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:27.438
The only thing we can do, as Marcus Aurelius wrote, is understand what we

00:15:27.438 --> 00:15:32.408
can control and what we cannot, and do our best to live a virtuous life.

00:15:33.168 --> 00:15:35.438
We won’t always manage, but we must try.

00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:39.718
That is the key to inner peace if you ask Marcus Aurelius.

00:15:40.768 --> 00:15:48.318
So, to leave you with a quote from Meditations: “You have power over your mind — not outside events.

00:15:49.054 --> 00:15:52.158
Realise this and you will find strength.”

00:15:54.498 --> 00:15:58.458
OK, that is it for today's episode on Marcus Aurelius.

00:15:58.778 --> 00:16:01.208
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that it might

00:16:01.232 --> 00:16:04.388
have inspired you to go and pick up a copy of Meditations.

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:09.478
Read it in your language, or even read it in English, the language is remarkably

00:16:09.508 --> 00:16:13.788
accessible, so you can learn some philosophy and some English at the same time.

00:16:14.898 --> 00:16:19.658
As a quick reminder, this is going to be followed up by another couple of philosophical episodes.

00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:24.640

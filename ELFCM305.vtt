Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:16.723
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:21.123
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:26.663
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about beer.

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:31.143
Now, you might love beer, you might hate beer, but no matter

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:34.973
your feelings about it, the story of beer is fascinating.

00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:40.143
It’s a story of how simple ingredients have been put together to create

00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:44.973
the world’s third most popular drink, after water and tea that is.

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:48.533
And in telling this story, we’ll come across

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:53.287
breweries,  German dukes, the pyramids, soldiers and spas.

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:59.975
And to cap it all off, at the end you’ll learn five interesting and surprising facts about beer.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:05.435
So, let’s get right into it and talk about the history of this wonderful drink.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:08.595
Let’s start with a simple question.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:10.755
What actually is beer?

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:15.475
If you look in a dictionary, you might find something like “an

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:20.075
alcoholic drink made from yeast-fermented malt flavoured with hops.”

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:24.906
But, as any continental European who has gone to a British pub,

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:29.106
asked for a “beer”, and been slightly confused about what they are

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:33.786
given will know, “beer” means different things to different people.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:41.143
For most of the world, a “beer”, “une bière”, “una birra”, “ ein Bier”, this

00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:46.943
typically means a fizzy, yellow-coloured liquid that’s that is kept cool, in a fridge.

00:01:47.723 --> 00:01:51.703
It often comes in a bottle, and when poured into a glass

00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:56.453
a sort of foamy head, bubbles, will form at the top.

00:01:57.523 --> 00:02:01.633
But “beer”, especially if you are in a more traditional

00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:04.523
British pub, means something slightly different.

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:10.713
If you ask for a “beer” you might find someone pulling down hard on a lever,

00:02:11.103 --> 00:02:16.733
pulling it back and forth, and then handing you a dark, non-fizzy brown liquid.

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:23.823
And, shock horror to many Europeans, it’s often quite warm, it’s not cold.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:29.293
Now, both drinks are technically “beer”, but you might hear British

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:35.203
people referring to the former as a “lager” and the latter as an “ale”.

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:39.573
Although the end result is pretty different, the

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:43.033
ingredients and process for making them are pretty similar.

00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:52.573
Both typically have four ingredients: barley, water, yeast and a magical plant called hops.

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:57.293
Barley is a very common grain, it’s the fourth most

00:02:57.303 --> 00:03:00.463
produced grain in the world, after corn, rice and wheat.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.473
Water is, well, it’s water.

00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:07.333
But the kind of water does matter, as we’ll come to in a bit.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.913
Yeast is the bit that turns the sugar into alcohol.

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:17.623
And hops, this magical plant, is an ingredient used both to add

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:22.323
flavour, and to preserve the beer, to stop it going off, going bad.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.203
These four ingredients are the key to beer.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:33.173
“Yeast”, as you may know, was only really understood as a separate living organism

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:38.708
in the 19th century, so, although it has been used for millennia, and was used

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:43.158
in beer production, it wasn’t as well understood as the other three ingredients.

00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:49.018
In fact, there was even a German 16th century law declaring

00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:52.448
that there were the only three ingredients allowed in beer.

00:03:53.068 --> 00:04:01.138
Yes, in 1516 Wilhelm IV, the Duke of Bavaria, declared the so-called Reinheitsgebot.

00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:07.688
If you translate this into English, it means the “purity law”, and it states

00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:13.918
that there should only be three ingredients for beer: barley, water, and hops.

00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:19.728
The yeast was, of course, there, it just wasn’t identified as a separate ingredient.

00:04:20.898 --> 00:04:26.528
Interestingly enough, this law was not so much to promote the beer industry, but

00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:32.728
more to ensure that other cereals, in particular rye and wheat, were available

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:37.748
to bakers, so that ordinary people had an adequate supply of affordable bread.

00:04:38.938 --> 00:04:46.007
And another interesting fact was that this was part of German law until 1987,

00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:51.133
making it, until recently, the oldest food quality regulation in the world.

00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:57.183
Now, there are, of course, all sorts of other ingredients that can be added to beer,

00:04:57.553 --> 00:05:03.373
instead of barley you can use “rice” or even “corn”, but if we focus on the historically

00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:08.413
British and European versions of beer, these are the traditional ingredients.

00:05:09.223 --> 00:05:14.833
So, we have our four ingredients, but making delicious beer is clearly more

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:20.093
nuanced, there's more to it than adding them all together and hoping for the best.

00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:26.353
It’s a complicated process that involves soaking the barley in water so that it releases

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:32.473
sugars, filtering it, adding the magical hops, boiling it, cooling it down again,

00:05:32.673 --> 00:05:38.073
adding yeast and leaving it to ferment, to release alcohol, and then packaging it.

00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:43.705
And no doubt if you are the sort of person who brews your own beer, you will see

00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:49.315
this description as a gross oversimplification, but the point to underline is

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:54.545
that, although the ingredients that go into the beer might be few in number and

00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:59.985
relatively inexpensive, the actual process of brewing the beer is highly skilled.

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:06.555
This process, beer brewing, has been around in some form or another for

00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:11.775
thousands of years, with a recipe for beer brewing found in an ancient script

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:18.775
from Mesopotamia, from 6000 BC, 8 thousand years ago, literally The Bronze Age.

00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:24.845
But rather than talking about the chronological history of beer brewing, we are going to look

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:31.605
at three different stories about beer, to illustrate how different types of beers have evolved.

00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:36.365
One is from Germany, another from Ireland, and another from India.

00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:43.645
For our first, from Germany, we need to go back to the year 1553 when

00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:49.265
Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria decided to ban the brewing of beer in summer.

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:56.395
The liquid was often brewed in open containers, and the warm weather would mean

00:06:56.395 --> 00:07:02.335
the liquid could easily be contaminated, go bad, in the heat, making drinkers sick.

00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:08.015
So, in a bid to make beer brewing safer, it was only allowed between

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:13.395
September 29th and April 23rd, in the cooler months of the year.

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:19.315
So, why is this important in the history of beer, why is it important to our story?

00:07:20.035 --> 00:07:24.845
Well, different types of yeast act differently at different temperatures.

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:30.725
In warmer temperatures, the yeast acted faster, resulting in darker,

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:35.855
fruitier and stronger tasting beer, similar to a British dark beer.

00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:40.645
In cooler temperatures, the result was clearer, the

00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:44.555
yellowish type of liquid you may think of today as a “lager”.

00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:50.195
And this was the sort of beer that resulted after summer brewing was banned.

00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:55.055
The beer-drinking public liked it, it could be stored for longer

00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:59.545
periods of time, and it became the dominant form of beer in the region.

00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:05.925
The dominance of this lager-style beer gained a further boost in the 19th

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:10.715
century when the ideal soft water supply and a particularly good type of

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:15.845
hops were found together on the west side of Bohemia, near what is now the

00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:20.425
German/Czech border but was at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:08:21.415 --> 00:08:24.955
The beer became known in German as Pilsen, and it’s

00:08:24.955 --> 00:08:27.685
from this that we get the “Pilsner” type of beer.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:33.925
This beer quickly spread across Europe, as its discovery coincided with the

00:08:33.935 --> 00:08:38.995
industrialisation of brewing methods and increasing interconnectedness of Europe.

00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:45.785
The new rail network meant that the beer could be easily and cheaply transported around

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:51.305
the Austro-Hungarian empire, so allowing people from Trieste in modern day Italy to

00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:57.815
Vienna in modern day Austria to quench or satisfy their thirst with this golden liquid.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:04.645
I should add that this area of the world still contains not just some of the iconic beer

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:10.845
brands, such as Pilsner Urquell, but also some of the world’s most avid beer drinkers.

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:18.225
Specifically, people from the Czech Republic, on a per capita basis, drink the most beer in

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:26.015
the world, drinking by some calculations an average of 190 litres of beer per person per year.

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:31.945
The UK, in comparison, has a long way to go, with the average

00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:35.875
Brit drinking only 70 litres of beer per person per year.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:42.555
Now, we do need to move back to north-western Europe for our second beer-related story.

00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:48.545
It’s not to Britain we’ll go to, though, it’s to Dublin, the capital of Ireland.

00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:52.585
And specifically, it’s time to talk about Guinness.

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:59.475
This type of beer is technically known as a stout – it’s a bit confusing

00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:05.355
as this word also means wide but there is a logic to it when you take your

00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:10.795
first mouthful of Guinness, as it can seem as much like food as drink.

00:10:11.895 --> 00:10:18.225
Guinness, named after its pioneering founder, Arthur Guinness, was started at St James’ Gate

00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:24.165
outside Dublin because it was here that he found the right kind of water supply for his beer.

00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:30.325
Remember that Pilsner was created partially because of having the right kind of soft water?

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:35.795
Well, Guinness is made possible because of a particular kind of water too.

00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:44.565
The water to the west of Dublin has a distinctive pH value - it is alkaline, gathering this

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:50.075
chemical quality through the soil and rocks it has seeped through on the way to the brewery.

00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:52.795
Now, why is this important?

00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:59.045
Well, if you remember your chemistry lessons from school, alkalis can neutralise acids.

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:05.155
The brewing process for Guinness involves using lots of roasted barley, which

00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:10.965
not only gives the drink its distinctive dark colour, but also an acidic taste.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:17.865
And the alkaline water neutralises this, leaving a delicious, well-balanced drink.

00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:24.325
So well balanced, in fact, that it used to be prescribed by doctors to pregnant women.

00:11:25.215 --> 00:11:29.355
I should add, perhaps, that this is no longer recommended, and that

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.885
nothing you ever hear on this show should be taken as medical advice.

00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:39.190
Our third story is a broader one – a type of beer called IPA.

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:43.695
Its origin unsurprisingly lies in those iconic

00:11:43.705 --> 00:11:48.535
capital letters, IPA, which stand for Indian Pale Ale.

00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:55.345
Yes, this is another element of British history which has its roots in the country's colonial past.

00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:59.505
In the early stages of what became the British Empire

00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:02.559
in India, the soldiers needed something to drink.

00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:08.619
Water was off the menu, because it could be contaminated and dangerous to drink.

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:10.929
So, beer was the answer.

00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:15.209
Not only would it keep the soldiers hydrated, but it

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:18.409
would help keep morale up because, well it was beer.

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:24.269
The beer was initially shipped out from Britain; so, it needed to be in a

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:29.919
style which meant that it was preserved, hence the strong hoppy element to IPA.

00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:34.659
At the same time, the soldiers needed to be able to drink plenty

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:38.739
of it and it needed to have strong thirst-quenching properties.

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:43.299
In summary, the strong hop levels allowed the beer

00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:46.919
to be kept or preserved in casks for up to a year.

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:53.589
And because IPAs were traditionally quite weak, not very alcoholic, the soldiers

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:58.399
could drink a lot of it and quench their thirst without getting too drunk.

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:03.759
It was, essentially, a chemical solution to the problem of how to send

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:07.839
beer thousands of kilometres if you don’t have any way of keeping it cold.

00:13:08.859 --> 00:13:15.139
And although its origins might have been very practical, it is, in my opinion at least, delicious.

00:13:15.619 --> 00:13:22.239
And this type of beer, IPA, is at the centre of a movement known as the "craft beer revolution”,

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:28.769
a movement where people are choosing independent beers brewed at smaller, artisan breweries,

00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:35.219
rather than buying mass-produced beer from multinational giants such as Heineken or InBev.

00:13:36.677 --> 00:13:43.157
Now, to conclude, here are five weird and wonderful beer facts or curiosities.

00:13:44.037 --> 00:13:48.297
Firstly, you may like drinking beer, but it might surprise you to

00:13:48.297 --> 00:13:52.917
find out that there are places where you can also bathe in beer.

00:13:53.617 --> 00:13:58.587
There are beer spas in Germany and Austria where you can literally swim in beer.

00:13:59.157 --> 00:14:01.487
It is, apparently, good for the skin.

00:14:02.347 --> 00:14:05.597
It might be cheaper to make your own beer bath, though.

00:14:06.107 --> 00:14:10.567
For four people for two hours it costs about 250 euros.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:15.387
You aren’t even allowed to drink the beer, although perhaps if you’ve been

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:19.607
sitting in it with three friends for two hours, you might not really want to.

00:14:21.097 --> 00:14:26.477
Secondly, going even further back right to almost the very start of beer, the

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:31.597
pyramids at Giza were built on beer - the workers were literally paid in beer.

00:14:32.347 --> 00:14:37.787
It was clearly thirsty work as they would receive four to five litres a day.

00:14:38.807 --> 00:14:43.637
One imagines that they wouldn’t drink it all themselves though, as I can’t imagine it would be

00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:49.437
much fun working away in the hot Egyptian sun if you drank 5 litres of beer the night before.

00:14:50.867 --> 00:14:54.357
Thirdly, this is to do with British university drinking

00:14:54.357 --> 00:14:57.717
culture, and it is a silly but interesting one.

00:14:58.477 --> 00:15:04.497
At some universities, the tradition goes that if someone throws a coin into your full

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:09.917
pint of beer, you would need to drink the entire pint before the coin falls to the bottom.

00:15:10.757 --> 00:15:14.927
The name for this is “pennying”, and the reason you needed to

00:15:14.927 --> 00:15:19.867
drink so fast was, in theory, to “stop the queen drowning”.

00:15:20.747 --> 00:15:26.737
Remember that British money had, until she died at least, a picture of The Queen on,

00:15:26.987 --> 00:15:32.027
so you had to finish all of the liquid in the glass to “stop the queen drowning”.

00:15:32.907 --> 00:15:37.487
Silly, I know, but if you happen to be in a British pub and someone

00:15:37.497 --> 00:15:42.087
drops a coin in your pint, well you can impress them by doing this.

00:15:42.937 --> 00:15:48.887
Now, on that subject, I know that British people have a bad reputation for drinking lots of beer,

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:55.457
but statistically speaking we are far from the worst, or the best, depending on your point of view.

00:15:56.427 --> 00:16:00.747
As you heard, the Czechs are the world’s greatest beer consumers by

00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:05.617
a significant margin, guzzling 191 litres of the stuff every year.

00:16:06.587 --> 00:16:11.467
The Czechs have, in fact, held the top spot for 30 years,

00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:15.277
and they show no signs of losing their crown any time soon.

00:16:16.097 --> 00:16:20.807
Next it’s Austria, with the average Austrian getting through 107

00:16:20.807 --> 00:16:25.107
litres a year, with Romania, Germany and Poland following close behind.

00:16:26.057 --> 00:16:29.617
Brits, contrary to popular belief, aren’t even in the top

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:34.197
20 of beer drinkers, we are behind Mexico in 23rd place.

00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:38.417
And our final curiosity is about Guiness.

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:43.027
When it comes to Guinness, the famous dark beer first brewed in

00:16:43.037 --> 00:16:47.317
Dublin, the two biggest Guinness drinking countries might surprise you.

00:16:48.187 --> 00:16:53.857
In fact, Ireland is only the third largest consumer of Guinness, first

00:16:53.877 --> 00:16:58.964
it’s the UK, and second it’s somewhere a little further away, Nigeria.

00:16:59.814 --> 00:17:04.534
Yes, Guinness has been sold in Nigeria since 1827 and there

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:08.027
has been a Guinness brewery in the country since 1962.

00:17:08.704 --> 00:17:13.154
It’s not sold in pint glasses, but in glass bottles, and it

00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:16.924
seems that the people of Nigeria can’t get enough of the stuff.

00:17:17.984 --> 00:17:22.014
Right, so there you go, a quick whirlwind tour through

00:17:22.014 --> 00:17:25.094
the history of the world’s third most popular drink.

00:17:25.714 --> 00:17:31.314
Enjoyed by the ancient Mesopotamians, the builders of the Egyptian pyramids, soldiers,

00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:36.204
students, in particular by the Czechs, and by billions of people around the world,

00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:42.474
perhaps even you, it’s a safe bet to say that beer isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

00:17:44.284 --> 00:17:48.444
OK then, that is it for today's episode on beer.

00:17:48.814 --> 00:17:53.118
I hope it's been an interesting one, and whether you are a committed beer drinker

00:17:53.324 --> 00:17:57.534
or you can’t stand the smell of the stuff, well I hope you’ve learned something new.

00:17:58.534 --> 00:18:01.674
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:02.004 --> 00:18:06.674
If you’re a beer drinker, a beer lover even, what’s your favourite type of beer?

00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:09.484
Have you ever tried a British “ale”?

00:18:09.924 --> 00:18:10.744
What did you think of it?

00:18:11.334 --> 00:18:14.494
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

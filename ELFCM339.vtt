Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.300
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.410
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.219
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.879
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.160
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.350
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.230
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.260
two of our mini-series on queens.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.370
In part one we looked at the tragic life

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.220
of Anne Boleyn, the wife of Henry VIII.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.900
And in part three it’s going to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.980
be Catherine the Great of Russia.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.390
I should say that if you haven’t

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.250
listened to the one on Anne Boleyn

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160
yet, I would advise you to listen

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.010
to that one before this one.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480
Anne Boleyn was Elizabeth the First's

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.870
mother, so an understanding of her

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.210
story will help you better understand

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.330
the story of Elizabeth, and give you

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.400
an indication of why, perhaps, she took

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.140
some of the decisions she did, decisions

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.360
that would mean she was able to truly

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.179
manage to control her own destiny and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.529
legacy, in a way her mother wasn't.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.680
So, let’s get right into it and learn

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.809
about Elizabeth I, The Virgin Queen.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.649
There's an expression in modern

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.130
English called "broken home".

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.619
It tends to mean an unstable and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.170
unhappy childhood, often with

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.030
separated or fighting parents.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.799
There is little evidence that this

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.160
expression existed in the 16th

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.589
century, but let me introduce you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.919
to a situation that would certainly

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.539
meet our modern description.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.149
Imagine your mother was the queen of

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.710
England, but when you were only two

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.750
years old she was publicly executed

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.409
on the orders of your father.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.000
You were then disowned by your

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.330
father, along with your half-sister

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.020
from his first marriage.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.930
And when your father had another

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.510
child with his new wife, a boy no

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.400
less, you became even less important.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.740
This was the situation that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.560
young Elizabeth found herself in.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.510
A broken home is perhaps even a euphemism

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.983
for the early years of Elizabeth I.

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.880
Despite being disowned and having

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.820
little chance of ever sitting

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.979
on the throne, she was still the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.850
king’s daughter and had an extremely

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.300
privileged childhood and education.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.520
She learnt mathematics, poetry,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.139
rhetoric, and music, and was

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.890
fluent in five languages.

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.660
From an early age, it was clear that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.416
this young girl was a cut above the

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:49.240
rest, she was something special.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.210
She was tall, she had bright red

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.890
hair, and was exceptionally clever.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.030
And this intelligence and wit would

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.860
come in very handy, as she had to be

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.590
constantly on guard, looking out for

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.330
men plotting and conspiring against her.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.690
This all started from a young age.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.200
When she was only 14 years

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.590
old, her father, Henry VIII

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.966
died, passing the throne to her

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.440
9-year-old half-brother, Edward.

00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:25.256
Clearly, a 9-year-old can’t exactly rule

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:28.456
for himself, so his government was left in

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:31.396
the hands of elder noblemen and officials.

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:35.356
And, as you might imagine, before

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:38.096
Henry had even taken his last breath,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.116
there were plenty of plots and schemes

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:43.716
about how to manipulate and control

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:46.426
not only his son and heir, but his

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.986
other children, Mary and Elizabeth.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.776
At this point, the young Elizabeth

00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:54.786
was sent to live with Henry’s 6th

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:57.086
and final wife, Catherine Parr,

00:03:57.296 --> 00:03:59.346
who had married a man called Thomas

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:01.296
Seymour after Henry had died.

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:05.076
If the surname “Seymour” rings a

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:08.506
bell, Thomas Seymour’s sister was Jane

00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:11.316
Seymour, who was Henry VIII’s third wife.

00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:14.486
Now, I know there are a lot of names

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.526
and relationships here, so don’t

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.286
worry if it’s a bit tricky to follow.

00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:21.116
The important point is that Thomas

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.626
Seymour was not good news for Elizabeth.

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:26.356
Believing it would get him closer to

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:29.166
the crown, Seymour begun to make sexual

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:31.356
advances towards the teenage girl.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.666
He was 25 years older than her,

00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:37.376
and were he to be alive today, he

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.426
would certainly be called a sexual

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:41.596
predator and thrown into prison.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.936
Elizabeth’s servant reported that

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:46.506
Seymour would come to Elizabeth’s

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:48.686
bedroom every morning before the

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:50.606
young princess was even dressed.

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:52.906
He would verbally abuse her,

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.016
and it’s thought he probably

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.596
sexually abused her as well.

00:04:57.736 --> 00:04:59.676
It’s believed that Catherine was well

00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.046
aware of her husband’s behaviour but

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:04.196
initially did nothing to stop it.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:07.726
In fact, in one horrible episode

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:10.066
she actually joined in this

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:11.986
behaviour with him, with the couple

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:13.866
reportedly tearing the young girl’s

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:16.066
dress to pieces to humiliate her.

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:19.206
It was not until Catherine found

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:21.696
Elizabeth in Seymour’s arms that she

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.916
reacted and sent the young girl away

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:26.066
from her palace never to see her again.

00:05:27.182 --> 00:05:29.519
Around a year after Elizabeth had been

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:32.929
sent away, Catherine died, leaving all

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:36.149
her riches to Seymour and making him one

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:38.039
of the wealthiest men in the country.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.329
So, to recap, Henry VIII dies, his

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:45.239
surviving wife, Catherine, marries this

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.819
horrible abusive man, Thomas Seymour,

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.279
who is planning to marry Elizabeth.

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.569
Then Catherine dies, leaving her

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.699
fortune to evil Thomas Seymour.

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.429
Seymour now has the chance to carry out

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.769
his plan to marry Elizabeth and gain

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.429
influence over his nephew, Elizabeth’s

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:07.159
half-brother, the young king Edward VI.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.439
Some say he actually planned

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.719
to kill or marry off his nephew

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.209
and put Elizabeth on the throne.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.849
In any case, he didn’t

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:18.849
have the chance to do it.

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.579
He was arrested for treason, by his own

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.529
brother no less, and eventually executed.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:29.429
Anyone involved with Seymour also

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.619
came under suspicion, and this,

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:33.689
naturally included Elizabeth.

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.519
She was central to Seymour’s plan,

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.849
even though there is no evidence that

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.419
she wanted anything to do with him.

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:44.369
She was accused of helping him and of

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.179
having a sexual relationship with him.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.629
She was interrogated for weeks, with

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:52.199
attempts to bully a confession out of her.

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:57.399
However, at just 15 years old, Elizabeth

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.579
outsmarted the council and denied all

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.899
the charges, proving herself to be

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.379
wise, confident, careful, and able

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.699
to look out for herself in this world

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.609
of manipulative and conspiring men.

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.789
But this would only be the start

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.969
of her lifelong battle against

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.819
men plotting to get rid of her.

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:22.919
In 1553, her half-brother, King

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:26.049
Edward VI, died, aged only 15.

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:30.409
In his will just days before he died, he

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.339
had named his Protestant cousin, Lady Jane

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:36.159
Grey, as his heir, most likely because

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.129
he didn’t want his Catholic half-sister,

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.209
Mary, to take control of the country.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:43.839
Well, the throne did pass to Lady

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:46.549
Jane Grey, but for a measly 9

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:49.279
days, before the tide turned and

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.779
Catholic Mary seized the throne.

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:55.619
Mary was determined to undo her

00:07:55.619 --> 00:07:57.369
father’s religious reforms and

00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:59.679
return the country to Catholicism.

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:02.869
Her father, Henry VIII, remember,

00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:05.719
had broken with Rome and declared

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.462
himself to be head of the Church

00:08:07.462 --> 00:08:09.572
of England, the Protestant Church

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.702
of England, so that he could marry

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.702
Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth’s mother.

00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:16.762
Mary was a devout Catholic.

00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:19.772
Protestants who refused to convert to

00:08:19.772 --> 00:08:22.112
Catholicism were burned at the stake,

00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:25.042
earning Mary the nickname of Bloody Mary.

00:08:25.892 --> 00:08:28.052
Yes, if you’re wondering, the drink with

00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:30.792
tomato juice and vodka is named after

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:33.002
this religious zealot of an English queen.

00:08:34.152 --> 00:08:36.712
Elizabeth, who was born a Protestant,

00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:39.062
would find herself caught up in this

00:08:39.062 --> 00:08:41.772
religious turmoil, with Mary even

00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:43.612
locking up her own sister in the

00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:45.942
Tower of London, supposedly believing

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:47.592
that she was plotting against her.

00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:51.022
It was two months before Elizabeth would

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:53.642
be released from the Tower, and after this

00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:56.302
she was sent off to be kept under what was

00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:58.852
essentially house arrest for another year.

00:09:00.042 --> 00:09:02.362
Now, to skip forward a little bit,

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:06.392
Bloody Queen Mary died childless in 1558.

00:09:07.202 --> 00:09:09.682
She had failed to produce an heir, so the

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:12.772
crown passed to the 25-year-old Elizabeth,

00:09:13.132 --> 00:09:15.652
turning her into Queen Elizabeth I.

00:09:16.552 --> 00:09:18.882
Now, I know it has taken us a while

00:09:18.882 --> 00:09:20.922
to get to the bit where Elizabeth

00:09:21.092 --> 00:09:22.642
actually becomes Queen Elizabeth,

00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:25.312
but the back story is important.

00:09:25.992 --> 00:09:27.362
Think about what she has gone

00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:29.522
through so far, and it might help

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.502
you understand the actions she'll

00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:33.092
take when she's on the throne.

00:09:34.472 --> 00:09:37.082
She was crowned in a coronation ceremony

00:09:37.252 --> 00:09:39.502
that was nothing short of a spectacle.

00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:42.402
She paraded through the streets in

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:45.052
a small golden carriage as thousands

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:47.242
of excited Londoners tried to

00:09:47.242 --> 00:09:48.982
catch a glimpse of the new Queen.

00:09:50.332 --> 00:09:52.362
But not everyone was so

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:54.022
excited over the coronation.

00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:57.052
Remember, there are still vast

00:09:57.202 --> 00:09:59.762
religious divisions, and Catholics

00:09:59.762 --> 00:10:01.672
were angry at the idea of a

00:10:01.722 --> 00:10:03.842
protestant being back on the throne.

00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:06.532
It was not only her religion

00:10:06.662 --> 00:10:08.482
that made Elizabeth problematic.

00:10:09.112 --> 00:10:12.002
She was an unmarried, childless,

00:10:12.022 --> 00:10:14.562
female monarch, a very unusual

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:15.682
combination at the time.

00:10:16.772 --> 00:10:18.882
So, there was an exceeding amount of

00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:21.102
pressure on her to do something about it.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.562
And what that meant, in practical

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.152
terms, was first to find a husband.

00:10:28.272 --> 00:10:30.482
Not just so that he would do the

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.572
important job of producing a male heir

00:10:32.572 --> 00:10:35.072
with her, but also so that he could

00:10:35.082 --> 00:10:37.272
help her make the tricky decisions

00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:39.162
that a monarch needed to take.

00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:42.882
Women at this time were not considered

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:45.382
to be intellectually capable of making

00:10:45.392 --> 00:10:47.852
these kinds of tough decisions, so a

00:10:47.852 --> 00:10:50.372
queen needed to find a man to help her.

00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:54.152
As you might imagine, for an incredibly

00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:57.412
intelligent and independent woman, one who

00:10:57.412 --> 00:10:59.812
had already proved that she was perfectly

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:01.472
capable of looking after herself,

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:04.452
this must have been a tricky pill to

00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:07.712
swallow, a difficult reality to accept.

00:11:08.622 --> 00:11:11.662
And indeed, Elizabeth didn't accept it.

00:11:12.202 --> 00:11:14.612
In fact, she had resolved never to

00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:17.102
marry, even taking a pledge as an

00:11:17.162 --> 00:11:19.322
8-year-old to never take a husband.

00:11:20.252 --> 00:11:21.702
She would keep this pledge

00:11:21.842 --> 00:11:23.672
for her entire adult life.

00:11:24.252 --> 00:11:26.102
But how could she sell this

00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:27.852
to the public, a public that

00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:29.692
expected her to take a husband?

00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:33.042
Well, as queen, she transformed her

00:11:33.082 --> 00:11:36.162
image and public persona from ordinary

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:39.608
woman into a god-like figure, a deity.

00:11:40.412 --> 00:11:42.262
She announced that she would live

00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:44.852
and die a virgin, earning her

00:11:44.862 --> 00:11:46.652
the nickname “The Virgin Queen”.

00:11:47.482 --> 00:11:49.612
It was actually a very clever move,

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:51.422
as it placed her in a completely

00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:54.062
different category to a normal

00:11:54.062 --> 00:11:55.772
queen, who would constantly be

00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:57.652
bombarded with marriage requests.

00:11:58.552 --> 00:12:01.062
If people thought of her more like a

00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:03.802
god than a queen, well this gave her the

00:12:03.802 --> 00:12:06.382
perfect excuse to not take a husband.

00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:09.682
So, why was this, why was she

00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:11.882
so opposed to getting married?

00:12:12.462 --> 00:12:15.172
Well, perhaps it was just her character.

00:12:15.862 --> 00:12:18.002
Perhaps she had seen the devastating

00:12:18.012 --> 00:12:20.472
effect of marriage on her own mother, Anne

00:12:20.472 --> 00:12:23.102
Boleyn, as well as the fate of the other

00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:25.202
five women who had married her father.

00:12:25.872 --> 00:12:27.342
Perhaps it was the horrific

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.352
abuse she likely suffered at

00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:30.802
the hands of Thomas Seymour.

00:12:31.392 --> 00:12:34.372
Perhaps she was simply disgusted by all

00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:36.532
of the scheming and plotting men at court.

00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:38.562
Perhaps she thought that being

00:12:38.562 --> 00:12:40.942
independent was, counterintuitively,

00:12:41.242 --> 00:12:43.232
her best chance at surviving.

00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:46.102
Whichever it was, one thing is

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:49.242
undeniable: this was a man’s world

00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:51.642
where women were second-class citizens.

00:12:52.412 --> 00:12:54.652
It was not long, though, before Elizabeth

00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:56.982
had much bigger problems than fending

00:12:57.012 --> 00:12:59.012
off the advances of male suitors,

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:03.032
because in 1562 she fell very ill.

00:13:04.182 --> 00:13:07.112
Initially, she and her court believed it

00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:09.882
was just a cold but she grew weaker and

00:13:09.882 --> 00:13:12.592
weaker and soon she could not even talk.

00:13:13.442 --> 00:13:15.992
It became obvious that the queen had

00:13:16.202 --> 00:13:19.232
Smallpox, the deadly disease that killed

00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:22.862
between 20-30% of everyone it infected.

00:13:23.832 --> 00:13:24.792
Everyone believed

00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:27.002
Elizabeth was about to die.

00:13:27.852 --> 00:13:30.422
Thankfully, though, she did not and she

00:13:30.422 --> 00:13:33.042
amazed everyone by making a full recovery.

00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:36.032
The disease would, however, leave

00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:37.572
her with terrible scarring on her

00:13:37.572 --> 00:13:39.982
face, which she would cover up with a

00:13:40.022 --> 00:13:42.792
permanent thick layer of white makeup.

00:13:43.762 --> 00:13:45.652
She tried to take full advantage

00:13:45.652 --> 00:13:47.612
of her escape from death,

00:13:47.842 --> 00:13:49.512
describing it as evidence that

00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:51.689
God supported and protected her.

00:13:52.602 --> 00:13:54.622
But it wasn’t taken this way by all,

00:13:54.682 --> 00:13:57.022
with her critics suggesting that this

00:13:57.082 --> 00:13:59.702
only proved her to be a weak and sickly

00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:01.792
woman who desperately needed a husband.

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:04.582
And the pressure continued to

00:14:04.582 --> 00:14:07.192
grow, with her advisors continually

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:09.302
putting forward potential matches.

00:14:09.422 --> 00:14:12.172
But Elizabeth rejected them all.

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:15.247
Now, it is, of course, possible

00:14:15.257 --> 00:14:17.557
that there was another reason that

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:19.707
Elizabeth was not interested in any

00:14:19.707 --> 00:14:21.647
of her advisor’s suggested husbands.

00:14:22.038 --> 00:14:24.297
Perhaps it was because she had

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.007
a love interest of her own.

00:14:27.107 --> 00:14:29.637
One man above all others was

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:30.867
believed to be her lover.

00:14:31.427 --> 00:14:33.477
His name was Robert Dudley,

00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:34.877
the Earl of Leicester.

00:14:35.487 --> 00:14:37.417
The pair had known each other since

00:14:37.417 --> 00:14:39.907
childhood and were almost inseparable.

00:14:40.507 --> 00:14:43.107
The Queen called him her ‘Sweet Robin’

00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:45.717
and gave him many gifts, riches and

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.047
powerful positions within her government.

00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:50.807
Over the years, many rumours came

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.447
out about the pair having had

00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:54.517
multiple illegitimate children, who

00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:56.757
were subsequently sent abroad to

00:14:56.757 --> 00:14:58.827
protect the Queen’s virginal image.

00:14:59.677 --> 00:15:01.177
Whether the rumours were true or

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:03.437
not, they clearly show that not

00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:05.267
everyone was convinced by the

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:07.117
Queen’s claims she was a virgin.

00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:10.618
And Dudley certainly seemed to start to

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:13.406
think that he was the one for Elizabeth,

00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:15.436
he was the man she was waiting for.

00:15:15.926 --> 00:15:17.956
He planned a lavish proposal to

00:15:17.956 --> 00:15:20.926
her in an extravagant 19-day-event,

00:15:21.026 --> 00:15:23.506
featuring water fountains, musical

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.576
performances, plays and fireworks.

00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:28.556
The highlight of the entire event was

00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:31.266
planned to be a play, during which Dudley

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:33.876
would dramatically propose to the queen.

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:37.556
But Elizabeth had other plans.

00:15:38.056 --> 00:15:39.676
When she got wind of what was about

00:15:39.676 --> 00:15:41.856
to happen, she refused to let the

00:15:41.856 --> 00:15:43.866
performance start, and Dudley’s

00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:46.456
plan was thwarted, it was stopped.

00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:49.406
The Virgin Queen was not planning

00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:50.886
on breaking the promise she had

00:15:50.886 --> 00:15:52.736
made to herself as an 8-year-old.

00:15:53.396 --> 00:15:56.296
She would remain single, she did not

00:15:56.296 --> 00:15:58.316
need a man to tell her what to do.

00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:02.246
And all around, the threats were growing.

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:04.896
After all, the queen’s ticking

00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:07.416
biological clock and refusal to take

00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:09.326
a husband was problematic for the

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:11.046
succession of the British crown.

00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:14.056
With no children, who would the

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:15.916
throne pass to after her death?

00:16:17.066 --> 00:16:19.246
For some, they sensed opportunity.

00:16:19.736 --> 00:16:23.006
In 1571 an Italian banker, Roberto

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:25.676
Ridolfi conspired with Elizabeth’s

00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:28.396
Catholic cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:31.596
The pair plotted to gather an army from

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:34.536
Spain and then kill Elizabeth so Mary

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.866
could take the English throne, and the

00:16:36.866 --> 00:16:39.416
country could be returned to Catholicism.

00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:42.306
But while there were plenty of

00:16:42.366 --> 00:16:44.576
plotting men around, Elizabeth

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:47.764
also had a network of spies, she

00:16:47.934 --> 00:16:49.974
knew that knowledge was power.

00:16:51.014 --> 00:16:54.144
Her chief spymaster was a man named Sir

00:16:54.154 --> 00:16:57.094
Francis Walsingham, and he managed to

00:16:57.094 --> 00:16:59.714
discover this plot, a plot which would

00:16:59.714 --> 00:17:02.414
go down in history as The Ridolfi Plot.

00:17:03.484 --> 00:17:05.374
Elizabeth ordered the executions of

00:17:05.474 --> 00:17:08.174
everyone involved, but she decided

00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:10.454
to spare her Scottish cousin, Mary.

00:17:11.424 --> 00:17:14.814
Her mercy, however, would not go rewarded.

00:17:15.424 --> 00:17:19.144
In 1586, 15 years later, Mary,

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:21.294
Queen of Scots began to plot again.

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:23.674
She had been sending coded

00:17:23.674 --> 00:17:25.824
letters in beer barrels to an

00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:27.954
Englishman named Anthony Babington.

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:31.124
The plan was much the same as the

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.574
Ridolfi Plot, with Spain to invade,

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:35.664
kill Elizabeth, place Mary on the

00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:37.694
throne and restore Catholicism.

00:17:38.804 --> 00:17:41.774
But the conspirators, including Mary, did

00:17:41.774 --> 00:17:44.204
not realise that their letters were yet

00:17:44.244 --> 00:17:46.824
again being intercepted by Elizabeth’s

00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:49.454
trusted spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham.

00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:53.374
This time, Elizabeth wouldn’t be so

00:17:53.454 --> 00:17:55.564
forgiving towards her rebellious cousin.

00:17:56.424 --> 00:17:59.094
Mary was caught, held in the Tower of

00:17:59.094 --> 00:18:01.314
London, and beheaded the following year.

00:18:02.528 --> 00:18:04.724
But even with her rival to the

00:18:04.724 --> 00:18:06.454
north now dealt with, there was

00:18:06.454 --> 00:18:08.414
little peace for this English queen.

00:18:09.184 --> 00:18:11.204
There was increasing rivalry with

00:18:11.204 --> 00:18:14.014
Spain, with Philip II expressing

00:18:14.014 --> 00:18:16.104
his desire to attack England and

00:18:16.104 --> 00:18:17.874
restore Catholicism to the country,

00:18:18.214 --> 00:18:20.324
which would clearly require removing

00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:22.094
the Protestant monarch, Elizabeth,

00:18:22.284 --> 00:18:24.244
and replacing her with a Catholic.

00:18:25.724 --> 00:18:28.964
This all came to a head in 1588,

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:31.244
just a year after Elizabeth had

00:18:31.244 --> 00:18:32.914
got rid of the “Mary” threat.

00:18:34.144 --> 00:18:35.874
On the south coast of England, the

00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:38.574
troops were preparing for the arrival of

00:18:38.574 --> 00:18:41.114
the Spanish armada, the Spanish fleet.

00:18:42.004 --> 00:18:44.504
On the 19th of August 1588,

00:18:44.844 --> 00:18:46.864
Elizabeth went to visit them, making

00:18:46.874 --> 00:18:49.584
a rousing speech to her soldiers.

00:18:51.114 --> 00:18:53.684
She declared, ‘I know I have the

00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:56.114
body of a weak and feeble woman;

00:18:56.614 --> 00:18:59.154
but I have the heart and stomach of

00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:01.384
a king, and a king of England too’.

00:19:02.664 --> 00:19:04.334
The English were looking down the

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:07.114
barrel of a potentially huge defeat.

00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:09.564
The Spanish forces were far greater

00:19:09.654 --> 00:19:12.014
in number, but there were terrible

00:19:12.024 --> 00:19:13.504
storms on their route north.

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.404
There was a battle, the battle of

00:19:16.404 --> 00:19:18.654
Gravelines, and the Spanish were

00:19:18.654 --> 00:19:21.144
pushed away from the coast, forced to

00:19:21.144 --> 00:19:23.644
retreat back to Spain via the North

00:19:23.654 --> 00:19:26.314
Sea, and the threat was averted.

00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:30.214
This victory, although it was certainly

00:19:30.224 --> 00:19:32.864
helped by bad weather and storms, brought

00:19:32.914 --> 00:19:35.744
Elizabeth’s popularity to new heights, and

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:37.984
cemented her in the minds of the public

00:19:38.194 --> 00:19:41.104
as the Queen who had seen off the Spanish.

00:19:42.534 --> 00:19:45.184
And despite all of these domestic and

00:19:45.294 --> 00:19:47.604
international threats, with cousins and

00:19:47.794 --> 00:19:50.004
Spanish kings trying to kill her, the

00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:52.744
Elizabethan era, as it has come to be

00:19:52.744 --> 00:19:55.484
known, was a period of relative peace,

00:19:55.644 --> 00:19:57.944
both domestically and internationally.

00:19:58.704 --> 00:20:00.454
Yes, there were all of those people at

00:20:00.514 --> 00:20:02.854
home and abroad who wanted her dead, but

00:20:03.084 --> 00:20:05.404
compared to the years that came before

00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:07.954
and after, it was remarkably peaceful.

00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:12.114
And with this peace came an era of

00:20:12.114 --> 00:20:14.304
unparalleled cultural development,

00:20:14.774 --> 00:20:16.924
and the flourishing of the arts.

00:20:17.524 --> 00:20:20.104
The Elizabethan era saw the plays of

00:20:20.274 --> 00:20:22.774
William Shakespeare, the explorations

00:20:22.784 --> 00:20:24.664
of Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter

00:20:24.674 --> 00:20:26.714
Raleigh, and huge development

00:20:26.714 --> 00:20:29.114
in poetry, theatre and music.

00:20:30.084 --> 00:20:32.204
It’s pretty amazing to think that in

00:20:32.204 --> 00:20:34.264
the years before she was made queen,

00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:36.974
the country was in the midst of bloody

00:20:36.984 --> 00:20:39.184
religious wars, and then less than

00:20:39.184 --> 00:20:41.784
forty years after her death the UK

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.744
experienced its most bloody civil

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:46.224
war and then the execution of a King.

00:20:47.244 --> 00:20:49.874
And here, in the middle, came this

00:20:50.224 --> 00:20:52.764
“Golden Age” of peace and tranquillity,

00:20:53.164 --> 00:20:54.764
which the lady on the throne can

00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:56.344
take a large amount of credit for.

00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.065
So, she was an admirable woman, and

00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:02.125
a strong and intelligent leader.

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:05.245
But she was, after all, human.

00:21:06.235 --> 00:21:09.955
By 1597 she was 64 years old, an

00:21:09.955 --> 00:21:11.805
impressive age at the time when the

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.545
average life expectancy was just 42.

00:21:15.455 --> 00:21:17.545
That year, the French ambassador

00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:19.875
wrote that the Queen looked aged,

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:22.285
with wrinkles and many missing teeth.

00:21:22.985 --> 00:21:25.435
She also bore the scars of smallpox,

00:21:25.475 --> 00:21:27.445
which she covered up with her thick

00:21:27.505 --> 00:21:29.615
white makeup and her orange wig.

00:21:30.675 --> 00:21:33.285
And many took her ageing face to be

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.655
a reminder of the fact she was now

00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:38.735
too old to have a child but had still

00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:40.675
not named an heir to the throne.

00:21:41.915 --> 00:21:43.195
And she could not escape

00:21:43.445 --> 00:21:45.055
time’s winged chariot.

00:21:45.685 --> 00:21:49.085
On 24th March 1603, at the age of

00:21:49.085 --> 00:21:52.095
69, without ever producing an heir or

00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:55.265
naming her successor, she died, ending

00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:57.975
the near 120 year-reign of the Tudors.

00:21:59.155 --> 00:22:00.935
She was truly remarkable,

00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:03.815
overcoming imprisonment, disease,

00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:05.805
assassination attempts, war and

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:08.735
rebellion, to rule for 45 years.

00:22:09.565 --> 00:22:11.375
This would have been impressive enough

00:22:11.595 --> 00:22:14.595
as is, but to do that as an unmarried

00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:17.605
woman in a world dominated by scheming

00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:20.625
and unscrupulous men was even more so.

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.415
She has gone down in British history

00:22:23.545 --> 00:22:25.475
as one of the most influential monarchs

00:22:25.505 --> 00:22:27.985
of all time, seeing the country through

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:30.135
religious rivalries, domestic and

00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:32.645
international conflict, and turning the

00:22:32.645 --> 00:22:36.205
country from an infighting minor European

00:22:36.205 --> 00:22:38.845
power into a fledgling imperial one.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.885
She was also, compared to her mother,

00:22:42.155 --> 00:22:44.355
Anne Boleyn, and even the subject of

00:22:44.355 --> 00:22:45.925
the next episode, Catherine the Great,

00:22:46.525 --> 00:22:49.165
the only one who really managed to

00:22:49.165 --> 00:22:51.875
control her own image and write her own

00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:54.795
story, defying her critics and leaving

00:22:54.885 --> 00:22:56.875
an enormous legacy on the country.

00:22:58.375 --> 00:22:59.855
When she was born, she was

00:22:59.855 --> 00:23:01.145
a disappointment to her

00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:02.705
father because of her gender.

00:23:03.795 --> 00:23:05.995
The great irony was, despite this

00:23:06.315 --> 00:23:07.975
“disappointing” gender, she was

00:23:07.985 --> 00:23:10.055
far more intelligent, cunning,

00:23:10.115 --> 00:23:11.565
and brave than her father.

00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:15.835
This father, Henry VIII is remembered

00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:18.495
as a selfish and nasty king.

00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:21.795
His daughter, on the other hand, managed

00:23:21.795 --> 00:23:24.805
to write her own story, define her own

00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:27.905
path and ultimately be remembered as a

00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:30.765
far more successful ruler than any man.

00:23:33.151 --> 00:23:36.151
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode

00:23:36.321 --> 00:23:39.781
on Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, part

00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:41.721
two of this three-part miniseries.

00:23:42.321 --> 00:23:43.541
Next up we’ll be talking

00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:44.811
about Catherine The Great.

00:23:45.161 --> 00:23:47.221
And if you missed it, part one was

00:23:47.221 --> 00:23:49.431
on Elizabeth’s mother, Anne Boleyn.

00:23:50.218 --> 00:23:51.935
As always I would love to know

00:23:51.935 --> 00:23:53.405
what you thought of this episode.

00:23:53.645 --> 00:23:55.115
How much did you know about

00:23:55.115 --> 00:23:56.915
the life of Elizabeth I?

00:23:57.265 --> 00:23:59.095
Why do you think she never married?

00:23:59.485 --> 00:24:01.105
Can you think of any parallels

00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:04.265
between Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II?

00:24:04.915 --> 00:24:06.915
I would love to know, so let’s

00:24:06.915 --> 00:24:08.265
get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.479
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:20.589
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.549
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part mini-series on The Atomic Bomb.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.069
In part one we heard about the discovery of nuclear fission,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969
the scientists behind it, and how the bomb was developed.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:41.059
Today’s episode is all about what came next, the decision to drop the

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.819
bomb, and what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August of 1945.

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.559
And in part three we will discuss the aftermath of the bombs.

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:56.715
We’ll look at some of the ethical questions about whether the bombs should have been dropped at all

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.789
and how the use of atomic weapons has impacted global politics, both in the Cold War and beyond.

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.599
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:13.699
The last thing we heard about in part one was the Trinity Test, the successful

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:20.159
test of a real atomic bomb in the Nevada desert on July 16th of 1945.

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:24.519
The scientists had done what had been asked of them.

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:29.509
In 27 months they had developed the most powerful bomb in the

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.679
world, a bomb with the explosive energy of 25 kilotonnes of TNT.

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:39.892
The only question was, how was it to be used?

00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:45.552
To back up one minute, let’s remind ourselves of what exactly was

00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:49.092
going on in the world when this first atomic test was completed.

00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:53.732
The date was July 16th, 1945.

00:01:54.892 --> 00:02:01.412
Two months before, on May 8th of 1945, Germany had surrendered to the Allied forces,

00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:07.572
and after five and a half years, Hitler was dead and the war in Europe was over.

00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:12.572
On the other side of the world, there was no such sign of peace.

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:17.782
The Pacific War was in full flow, and the Japanese continued

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:21.712
to fight fiercely against the mainly American Allied forces.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:29.232
The start of 1945 had seen the battles of Iwo Jima and later Okinawa, where the

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:34.932
Americans learned that, for their Japanese adversaries, this was a fight to the death.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:41.072
This might sound like an exaggeration, but in the case of Iwo Jima, of

00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:47.232
the 21,000 Japanese soldiers defending the island, 99% fought to the

00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:52.502
death rather than surrender, and in the case of Okinawa it was 94%.

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:59.242
We’ll go on to discuss whether a Japanese surrender was actually possible without an atomic

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:06.672
bomb in the next episode, but the point is that in 1945 the American soldiers and the American

00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:13.382
public back home had understood quite how hard it would be to take Japan and finally win the war.

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:19.122
Preparations were made for a full-scale invasion of Japan.

00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:24.412
But it was evidently going to result in huge loss of life on both sides.

00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:29.882
On the American side, up to 20,000 soldiers had been

00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:33.422
killed taking the relatively small island of Okinawa.

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:37.782
How many more would be killed when invading the main islands?

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:42.032
Military strategists tried to calculate it.

00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:51.642
One estimate, delivered on July 15 of 1945, a day before the first atomic test, suggested that

00:03:51.662 --> 00:04:00.722
just the first phase of the invasion would result in between 130,000 and 220,000 US casualties.

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:08.582
And a later estimate suggested that the Allied forces would suffer between 1.7 and 4

00:04:08.622 --> 00:04:15.932
million casualties, with anywhere from 400,000 to 800,000 deaths in the entire invasion.

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:20.262
And let’s not forget about the Japanese side here too.

00:04:20.712 --> 00:04:28.552
The Japanese Vice Admiral, Takijirō Ōnishi, who was known as the father of the kamikaze, estimated

00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:35.152
that up to 20 million Japanese would lose their lives if and when the Allied forces invaded.

00:04:36.062 --> 00:04:40.672
20 million would have been about a quarter of the entire Japanese population.

00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:46.342
Now, of course, there is reason to exaggerate the number here, to deter

00:04:46.392 --> 00:04:51.532
an American invasion, but the Japanese casualties at Iwo Jima and Okinawa

00:04:51.822 --> 00:04:55.972
certainly suggested that the Japanese wouldn’t go down without a fight.

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:02.132
In the Oval Office, the President of the United States was Harry Truman, who

00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:07.552
had taken over from Franklin Roosevelt after his death on April 12th of 1945.

00:05:08.562 --> 00:05:13.662
Truman had been Vice President, so he was aware of the Manhattan Project, the

00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:18.412
project to build an atomic weapon, although he wasn’t the person who had ordered it.

00:05:19.832 --> 00:05:22.162
Truman had a decision to make.

00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:30.482
After the successful Trinity Test on July 16th of 1945, he knew he had an incredibly deadly

00:05:30.482 --> 00:05:35.782
weapon that could be used to kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Japanese.

00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:41.622
And he was pretty sure that Japan had no such weapon itself, so there

00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:45.522
would be no way to fight back, with a comparable impact at least.

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:52.042
On July 25th, 10 days after the test, Truman wrote in his diary:

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:57.082
“We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world.

00:05:57.432 --> 00:06:00.872
It may be the fire destruction prophesied in the

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:04.482
Euphrates Valley Era, after Noah and his fabulous Ark.”

00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:10.242
A day later, on July 26th, the Potsdam Declaration, or the

00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:14.152
Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender, was published.

00:06:15.522 --> 00:06:21.063
This document was co-signed by Truman, the President of the United States, Winston Churchill,

00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:26.722
the Prime Minister of the UK, and Chiang Kai-Shek, the president of the Republic of China.

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:33.562
It called for Japan to surrender unconditionally, saying that if Japan didn’t

00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:39.912
it would face–and I’m quoting directly here–”prompt and utter destruction”.

00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:45.872
The official response came from the Japanese Premier, Kantarō Suzuki.

00:06:46.812 --> 00:06:51.982
Interestingly enough, on a linguistic note it’s still debated whether

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:56.632
the Americans actually understood the translation of what Suzuki said.

00:06:57.942 --> 00:07:03.062
He used the Japanese word “mokusatsu”, which can be translated

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:07.802
as “ignore”, “pay no attention to”, or simply “no comment”.

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:13.082
The Americans understood that this meant he was saying Japan

00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:16.802
would ignore it, or take no notice of this declaration.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:23.382
Of course, it was quite an important point to understand correctly, as if it meant he

00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:28.912
would completely ignore it “forever” then this was a sign that Japan wouldn’t surrender.

00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:35.612
And if it meant temporarily and there was no comment for right now, well, it

00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:40.182
might mean there might have been a way to find a peaceful solution, or that there

00:07:40.182 --> 00:07:44.902
was a way to negotiate a surrender that would be acceptable to the Japanese.

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:50.972
In any case, the Americans interpreted it as Japan saying that it would

00:07:50.982 --> 00:07:55.262
ignore this demand for surrender, and it would fight to the death.

00:07:56.762 --> 00:08:01.212
Meanwhile, the Americans had been transporting the atomic cores, the

00:08:01.432 --> 00:08:06.242
cores of the bombs, across the Pacific, and by the start of August they

00:08:06.242 --> 00:08:11.132
were ready at a US naval base on the island of Tinian, in the Pacific.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.740
Earlier that year, an American committee had prepared several target

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.900
cities in Japan, cities that would be potential targets for an atomic bomb.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.710
There were three boxes that these cities needed to tick to be considered as a potential target.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.160
These cities needed to be larger than 3 miles, so that’s

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.530
just under 5km, in diameter, so they needed to be big enough.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.110
Secondly, it needed to be sure that an atomic bomb would create effective damage.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:52.060
Put crudely, there needed to be a combination of buildings and people that could be blown to pieces.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:00.370
And finally, the target city needed to be unlikely to have been attacked by August of 1945.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.200
A slightly strange reason, you might think, but the Americans

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.810
wanted to showcase and measure the true impact of the bomb.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.170
If the atomic bomb was dropped over a city that was already

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.570
partially destoyed, then it would be harder to measure.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.600
If it was dropped on a relatively unscathed, a relatively

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.630
untouched city, then it would show quite how powerful it was.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:35.380
Remember, the intended audience for the atomic bomb wasn’t just Japan, it was the

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.810
American public, the wider world, and debatably it was also the USSR, Soviet Russia.

00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:48.020
The initial targets chosen that met these three criteria were Kokura,

00:09:48.484 --> 00:09:55.104
a city now called Kitakyushu, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Niigata, and Kyoto.

00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:59.736
You’ll note that Nagasaki wasn’t actually on the first list.

00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:01.966
We’ll come to why that was in a minute.

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:08.046
The order to drop the bomb was given on July 25th by President

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:11.826
Truman, but this didn’t mean that it would be dropped immediately.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:18.396
The bomb would be dropped on one of the targets as soon as possible after August 3rd.

00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:24.426
The reason that there wasn’t a definite date was because the plane carrying

00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:28.786
the bomb needed to be able to phsyically see its target on the ground.

00:10:29.246 --> 00:10:33.576
There couldn’t be clouds, otherwise the bomb might be dropped in the wrong place.

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:37.726
The day chosen was August the 6th.

00:10:38.556 --> 00:10:45.036
It was a Monday, and as the residents of Hiroshima slept soundly, a squadron of 7 American

00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:51.946
bombers took off from Tinian, in the Mariana Islands, and flew 6 hours north towards Japan.

00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:57.796
One of them was a bomber called the Enola Gay, which was carrying

00:10:57.926 --> 00:11:02.476
an atomic bomb with the innocent sounding nickname of “Little Boy”.

00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:12.456
At 8:15am, and flying 9,470 metres above the city, the plane released the bomb.

00:11:13.796 --> 00:11:19.916
As soon as the bomb was dropped, because it was so heavy and the plane was now 5,000

00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:26.186
kilos lighter, the plane instantly jumped three metres, and the pilot made a 155

00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:31.766
degree turn away, racing to get out of the area before the deadly bomb exploded.

00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:39.486
For 44.4 seconds, “Little Boy” fell, zooming down towards its target.

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:45.636
When it was 580 metres above ground level, the firing mechanism

00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:51.526
went off, firing an enriched uranium bullet at six uranium rings.

00:11:52.826 --> 00:11:59.176
As the free neutrons struck the nuclei of the uranium atoms, neutrons within the nucleus

00:11:59.246 --> 00:12:03.946
were released, giving off tremendous amounts of energy and causing yet more neutrons

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:09.646
to split, which hit more nuclei, splitting them and starting a nuclear chain reaction.

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:14.756
The entire process took fractions of a millisecond.

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:20.526
The bomb exploded, instantly killing between 70 and 80,000

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:24.966
people, about a third of the population of Hiroshima at the time.

00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:31.666
Never before, in the entirety of human history had so many lives

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:35.426
been purposefully extinguished in such a tiny amount of time.

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:41.293
The bomb was two thousand times more powerful than any other bomb that had

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:46.536
ever been used in history, and as you will know, the impact was terrible.

00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:53.686
Sixteen hours later, President Truman issued a grim warning to the Japanese people.

00:12:54.905 --> 00:13:01.685
His statement read–and again I’m quoting directly here–"If they do not now accept our terms,

00:13:02.055 --> 00:13:08.985
they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.

00:13:09.975 --> 00:13:16.935
Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they

00:13:16.935 --> 00:13:22.095
have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.”

00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:27.235
Note, he didn’t actually reveal that it was an atomic bomb.

00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:34.295
Very few people knew that such a bomb even existed, all they knew was that Hiroshima had

00:13:34.295 --> 00:13:40.415
been struck by the world’s biggest explosion and it had caused untold death and destruction.

00:13:41.755 --> 00:13:46.985
Japanese atomic scientists only realised that the bomb had likely been atomic

00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:52.255
the following day after going to Hiroshima and seeing the extent of the damage.

00:13:53.515 --> 00:13:57.545
Despite realising what the Americans had, the Japanese leadership

00:13:57.845 --> 00:14:02.765
believed that no more than two more atomic weapons would be ready, so

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:07.455
Japan would only need to suffer a maximum of two more atomic bombs.

00:14:08.755 --> 00:14:13.665
Remember, there were Japanese predictions of up to 20 million Japanese losing

00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:18.295
their lives if the Americans invaded, and more than a hundred thousand Japanese

00:14:18.495 --> 00:14:22.965
had been killed in the Battle of Iwo Jima alone, so losing a few hundred

00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:28.775
thousand people in atomic bomb attacks was, although evidently tragic, tolerable.

00:14:30.005 --> 00:14:35.315
And on the subject of tragedy, after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima about as many

00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:40.385
people were injured as were killed, with people who were lucky enough not to be killed

00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:46.035
outright by the bombs suffering everything from terrible burns, to being crushed

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:51.085
by falling buildings, right through to long term damage from the radiation and the

00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:56.775
evident but less visible mental trauma of having lived through such a scarring event.

00:14:58.155 --> 00:15:00.745
But there was no time to mourn the dead.

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:05.745
The Americans decided to proceed with another attack, with two possible

00:15:05.755 --> 00:15:11.415
targets: Kokura, a city in southwestern Japan that was the location of

00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:14.595
one of the country’s largest weapons factories, was the main target.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.020
Kokura is now part of a city called Kitakyushu, by the way.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:25.880
The second, backup, target, was the city of Nagasaki, a port city in the southwest.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.850
Interestingly, Nagasaki wasn’t on the first shortlist of potential targets, but was only

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.582
added to it after Kyoto was taken off because of its cultural and historical importance.

00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:45.670
At 3:47 in the morning on August 9th, just three days after Hiroshima,

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.100
another bomber squadron lifted off from Tinian, in the Pacific.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:56.780
Among the bombers was Enola Gay, the aeroplane that had dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.640
But this time the Enola Gay was acting as reconnaissance,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.400
going ahead to check the weather above Kokura.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:12.450
The deadly weapon, a bomb called “Fat Man”, was carried in another plane called Bockscar.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:19.410
When the bombers arrived at Kokura, they found that there was a lot of black smoke above the city,

00:16:19.837 --> 00:16:27.087
caused partially by another bombing raid on a nearby city and partially by a factory intentionally

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:33.957
burning black tar to create smoke above city to create a sort of protective black shield above it.

00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:38.517
The bombers circled Kokura for almost an hour, trying

00:16:38.517 --> 00:16:41.597
to find a break in the clouds, but there was none.

00:16:42.677 --> 00:16:46.827
They were flying high enough that they were safe from Japanese anti-aircraft

00:16:46.857 --> 00:16:51.477
guns, but they were burning fuel fast, and they couldn’t circle forever.

00:16:52.437 --> 00:16:57.947
They decided to go to the secondary target, Nagasaki, 150 kilometres to the south.

00:16:59.197 --> 00:17:04.007
If there was a clear view above the city, that would be the target for the bomb.

00:17:04.747 --> 00:17:08.687
If not, they would have to try to fly to the newly occupied island of

00:17:08.687 --> 00:17:13.227
Okinawa, and would probably have to drop the bomb in the sea on the way.

00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:21.318
As the bombers arrived, they found that Nagasaki too was covered by thick clouds, but at

00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:28.278
exactly 11:01 there was a small break in the clouds, allowing the bombers to see the city.

00:17:29.588 --> 00:17:36.398
The order was given for the bomb to be dropped, and 47 seconds later the again innocently named

00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:44.038
“Fat Boy” exploded 500 metres above the city, destryoing everything within a 1.5km radius.

00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:50.438
Nagasaki was a smaller city than Hiroshima, and was mainly chosen for its

00:17:50.448 --> 00:17:55.648
military facilities, so it’s estimated that fewer people died there than in

00:17:55.658 --> 00:18:01.688
Hiroshima, but it’s thought that between 40 and 80,000 people perished either

00:18:01.898 --> 00:18:06.898
in the blast or as a result of it in the days, weeks and months afterwards.

00:18:07.969 --> 00:18:13.389
One of the difficulties in actually knowing how many people died was because

00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:18.229
there was no official death toll, and figures are normally chosen by taking

00:18:18.229 --> 00:18:23.119
the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before the bombs and then afterwards.

00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:32.129
Overall, the death toll is estimated at between 130,000 and 230,000 people, with

00:18:32.139 --> 00:18:37.189
the majority of those civilians not people directly involved in the military.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:44.949
The dropping of the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the biggest single cause of civilian

00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:51.919
death ever, and it is no exaggeration to say that never before in human history, and one

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:57.879
can only hope never again, have so many people been killed in such a tiny period of time.

00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:05.625
To make matters worse for Japan, in the early hours of August 9th, the same day as the

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:12.085
bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, news reached Japan that Soviet Russia had declared war on

00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:18.485
Japan and invaded Manchuoko, Manchuria, the puppet state in modern day north east China.

00:19:19.306 --> 00:19:21.998
There was also another statement from President

00:19:22.008 --> 00:19:24.835
Truman, I’ve actually got a clip of this for you now:

00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:27.956
"Having found the bomb we have used it.

00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:35.186
We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan's power to make war.

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:38.786
Only a Japanese surrender will stop us."

00:19:40.453 --> 00:19:46.055
In case the audio quality was a bit bad there, he said “ “Having found the bomb we have

00:19:46.065 --> 00:19:52.345
used it…We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan's power to make war.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.645
Only a Japanese surrender will stop us.”

00:19:57.055 --> 00:20:01.495
Frantic discussions ensued between senior Japanese military officials.

00:20:02.175 --> 00:20:06.345
Some wanted to continue to fight, while others supported a surrender.

00:20:07.525 --> 00:20:10.955
The power of the atomic bombs was now clear to see,

00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:14.955
and Japan had no idea how many more the Americans had.

00:20:15.765 --> 00:20:17.875
Would the next attack come that day?

00:20:18.205 --> 00:20:18.735
Tomorrow?

00:20:19.035 --> 00:20:19.645
Next week?

00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:24.835
And if they had already destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, what would be next?

00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:25.665
Kyoto?

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:26.685
Tokyo?

00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:33.795
Finally, in the early hours of August 10th, less than 24 hours after the bomb

00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:39.235
exploded above Nagasaki, the Japanese emperor privately told the Allies that the

00:20:39.245 --> 00:20:45.035
country would surrender, and on August 15th he publicly announced this to the nation.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.165
Although it wouldn’t be officially signed until

00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:53.455
September 2nd, the Second World War was effectively over.

00:20:54.275 --> 00:21:00.475
The atomic bomb, for all of its death and destruction, looked like it had completed its mission.

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:06.564
A war that had cost up to 50 million people their lives was now over.

00:21:07.505 --> 00:21:11.895
The question that many would come to ask would be, had it really

00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:16.415
been necessary, and was the world really now a safer place?

00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:24.815
OK then, that is it for today's episode, part two of this mini-series on the atomic bomb.

00:21:25.335 --> 00:21:30.365
I know it might be an uncomfortable topic, but it is an important one, and even

00:21:30.365 --> 00:21:34.755
though I’m sure you knew quite a bit about the events of the summer of 1945

00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:38.995
already, I hope you found this interesting and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:44.205
As a reminder, this was part two of this three-part mini-series.

00:21:44.475 --> 00:21:47.665
If you missed part one, that was on The Manhattan Project, the

00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:51.405
science behind the bomb, and the work that went into creating it.

00:21:51.975 --> 00:21:56.835
Next up, in part three, we’ll look at the world after the bomb, how things

00:21:56.835 --> 00:22:01.375
have developed since then, both in the decades after and in more recent years,

00:22:01.515 --> 00:22:06.075
and look at some of the ethical arguments behind the dropping of the bomb.

00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:09.485
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.365
this episode, and of this mini-series in particular.

00:22:12.925 --> 00:22:15.965
Did the Americans need to drop these two atomic bombs?

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:17.515
Was there another way out of it?

00:22:18.035 --> 00:22:20.635
What would have happened if Japan had not surrendered?

00:22:21.565 --> 00:22:26.175
If you are a Japanese listener, how is this period of history looked back on in

00:22:26.175 --> 00:22:31.875
your country, and what do you think Premier Kantarō Suzuki meant by “mokusatsu”?

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:36.005
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

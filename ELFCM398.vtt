Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:15.922
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.082
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:24.352
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about an

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:29.522
explorer called Ernest Shackleton and his quest to cross Antarctica.

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:33.642
It is one of history’s greatest stories of exploration,

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:38.122
resilience, courage, and leadership, and I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:42.535
It's also a member request, so Daniel from Spain, thank

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:45.095
you for this excellent suggestion; this one's for you.

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:50.529
OK then, Ernest Shackleton, Antarctic Explorer.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:58.385
On April the 23rd 1916, a 42-year-old man picked up a

00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:03.125
pencil, his hands shaking in the sub zero temperatures.

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:09.195
He managed to write the following words to his right-hand man, Frank Wild.

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:11.095
Dear Sir,

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:15.235
In the event of my not surviving the boat journey to South

00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:18.855
Georgia you will do your best for the rescue of the party.

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:23.115
You are in full command from the time the boat leaves this island.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:28.775
You can convey my love to my people and say I tried my best.

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:35.735
This man had spent the past five months floating on the freezing ice,

00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:40.575
literally going with the flow, trapped in one of the most hostile

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:45.905
climates on Earth and with no way of communicating with the outside world.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:55.265
The following morning he and five companions would clamber into a small open boat and attempt

00:01:55.455 --> 00:02:01.825
a 1,300 kilometre journey across one of the most treacherous bodies of water in the world.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:09.041
The man with the pencil was Ernest Shackleton, and although he failed in his

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:15.161
original mission, and would never claim the title of Antarctic record holder, he

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:21.051
will forever be remembered as one of the greatest, if not the greatest explorers.

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:27.121
Before we get into his story specifically, let me give you some

00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:31.411
background about the period in which Shackleton lived and explored.

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:38.271
This would be dubbed “The Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration”, and

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:41.771
the title does a pretty good job of describing what it was all about.

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:49.351
This period took place from 1897 to 1922, and involved 16

00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:53.121
major expeditions with parties from 8 different countries.

00:02:54.681 --> 00:03:00.321
By the end of the 19th century, much of the world had been charted, mapped,

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:06.111
explorers had been there, put down flags and claimed territory for their country.

00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:14.921
But there were two sizable areas of the world that hadn’t been explored: the North and South Poles.

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.491
Astronomers and mathematicians had known about their existence, they had

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:25.791
known of the magnetic north and south poles, but nobody had ever been there.

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:32.641
A famous Norwegian explorer called Roald Amundsen dreamed of being the first person to

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:38.815
travel to the North Pole, and started making preparations for an epic voyage in 1909.

00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:45.861
His plans were thwarted, however, when he discovered that a pair of American

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:51.381
explorers, Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had claimed to have reached the North Pole.

00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:57.871
There was no glory in being the second explorer to get there, so he changed his plans.

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:04.191
His crew had been told that they were going to the North Pole, but when they

00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:08.301
were about to leave the port of Madeira, off Portugal, thinking that they

00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:12.541
were heading north, he informed them that they were going somewhere else.

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.071
He turned the ship southwards, and headed for

00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:19.911
Antarctica, looking to claim the South Pole for himself.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:26.405
At the same time as this, a rival British party led by a man called

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:31.815
Captain Robert Falcon Scott was also heading to Antarctica, and this

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:35.835
would be a competition the newspapers dubbed “The Race to The Pole”.

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:41.765
Now, this is a story for another day, but to keep it brief, Amundsen

00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:49.068
won the race, and at around 3 pm on the 14th of December 1911, Amundsen

00:04:49.068 --> 00:04:53.435
and his team reached the South Pole and raised the Norwegian flag.

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:59.325
Scott and the British would reach the pole 23 days afterwards, and

00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:03.415
would be distraught to find that they had been beaten by the Norwegians.

00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:09.215
And tragically, all five members of the British expedition

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:12.135
died as they attempted to trace their path back.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:16.915
This wasn’t, of course, the first attempt to reach The South Pole.

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:25.085
In fact, the subject of this episode, Ernest Shackleton had attempted to do this in 1909.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:30.925
He managed to get within 150 kilometres of the South Pole, but

00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:35.345
ultimately had to turn around as his party ran out of supplies.

00:05:36.475 --> 00:05:41.445
Had they continued to the South Pole, Shackleton knew that his men would all have

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:47.475
perished of starvation on their return, so he made the decision to abandon the expedition.

00:05:48.885 --> 00:05:52.955
He did make some very useful geographical discoveries though, and

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:56.715
these would be used by Amundsen and Scott a couple of years later.

00:05:57.895 --> 00:06:04.015
And, amazingly enough, there is even a real recording of Shackleton talking about this expedition.

00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:10.855
He made it on the Edison phonograph recorder, and it’s from 1910, so that explains

00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:16.775
the quality, but here is a clip from a real-life recording of Ernest Shackleton:

00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:24.241
We reached a point within 97 geographical miles of the South Pole.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:32.671
The only thing that stopped us from reaching the actual point was the lack of 50 pounds of food.

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:38.656
Another party reached for the first time the south magnetic pole.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:44.346
Another party reached the summit of a great act of volcano, Mount Erebus.

00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:50.956
I Ernest Shackleton have today March the 30th dictated this record.

00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:54.895
Wonderful, right?

00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:59.911
Now, we must move on a few years to 1913.

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:07.935
Both the North and South Poles have been claimed, and Shackleton is itchy for his own adventure.

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:13.395
One thing that nobody has yet done is cross the Antarctic.

00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:17.895
Amundsen reached the South Pole, but he turned back and

00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:21.194
pretty much traced his footsteps, taking the same route back.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.865
Shackleton decides that he wants to get his own record, and starts

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:31.115
preparing for what he would call “the last great Polar journey”.

00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:35.975
He estimates that he will need to raise £50,000 for the

00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:39.915
trip, which is around five million Euros in today’s money.

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:45.385
Amongst other things, he needs men, so he puts out a job

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:50.515
advert, which reportedly read "Men wanted for hazardous journey.

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:55.845
Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:58.075
Safe return doubtful.

00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:01.615
Honour and recognition in event of success."

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:07.055
I should say that no evidence of this original advert exists today,

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:12.065
but whatever the text did say, it clearly had the intended effect.

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:16.015
Shackleton received 5,000 applicants.

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:17.815
56 men were chosen.

00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:22.215
“The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition” was born.

00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:25.365
His plan went as follows.

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:31.865
The party would be split into two groups, and approach Antarctica from different sides.

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:37.305
One group, led by Shackleton, would sail through the Weddell

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:41.745
Sea, which is the freezing sea close to the tip of South America.

00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:48.435
They would land on Antarctica, and Shackleton and a group of 6 men would

00:08:48.435 --> 00:08:53.515
make the almost 3,000 kilometre journey on foot first to the South Pole

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:58.045
and then continue to the other side of the continent, opposite New Zealand.

00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:05.555
Meanwhile the other half of the expedition would have set sail from New Zealand, landed on

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:10.635
the other side of Antarctica and left supplies for the group that had made the crossing.

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:18.635
Remember, the reason that Shackleton had to turn back in 1909, after he got so close,

00:09:19.045 --> 00:09:23.325
was because he knew he would have run out of supplies and his men would have starved.

00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:26.005
He didn’t want to make the same mistake again.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:34.915
Shackleton set off from England in a ship appropriately called Endurance on August 1st, 1914.

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:40.095
It would take them almost two months to get to their first “pit

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:44.675
stop”, the island of south Georgia, the relatively large island about

00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:48.325
one and a half thousand kilometres away from the tip of Antarctica.

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:54.095
Shackleton and his crew stopped at the island for several days to make their

00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:58.557
last preparations before continuing their journey to the bottom of the world.

00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:04.916
They were advised to wait a little longer; the whalers on the island told him

00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:09.726
that it was particularly bad weather, and thick ice flows were blocking the sea.

00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:14.706
This advice was not heeded; it was ignored.

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:22.666
And on December 5th 1914, the ship set off, with Antarctica in its sights.

00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:29.896
Now, Antarctica is “only” one and a half thousand kilometres away from the island of South Georgia.

00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:35.346
But the part of Antarctica that Shackleton was aiming for was significantly

00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:38.856
further than this; it was more like two and a half thousand kilometres away.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:45.286
Shackleton’s idea was to sail for as far as he could, so that he and his

00:10:45.286 --> 00:10:49.106
men would minimise the part of the journey they needed to make on foot.

00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:56.916
It was a good idea in theory, but this theory soon came up against reality.

00:10:58.086 --> 00:10:59.686
The whalers were right.

00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:07.196
Just two days after setting sail, the crew of the Endurance looked ahead of them and

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:13.636
saw that the sea was covered in pack ice, pieces of thick ice that blocked its path.

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:20.036
The ship continued southwards, but progress was painfully slow.

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:26.906
The ice blocked them at every path, and what’s more, it was closing in around them.

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:33.476
By mid February the ship was essentially stuck in the ice, unable to move.

00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:39.236
Shackleton had ordered his men off the ship with their pickaxes and

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:44.406
shovels in an attempt to break through, but their efforts proved futile.

00:11:45.086 --> 00:11:49.256
The Endurance was stuck, now at the mercy of the flows

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:52.746
of the seas, only able to move with the pack ice.

00:11:53.656 --> 00:11:56.176
And winter was rapidly approaching.

00:11:57.726 --> 00:12:04.158
As a reminder, May to September are the coldest months in Antarctica, and Shackleton and The

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:11.588
Endurance were facing down the possibility of an Antarctic winter trapped, alone, on the icy sea.

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:18.708
Now, it’s worth spending a minute to talk about what the Endurance was, and what it had on it,

00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:23.788
because this really gives you some sense of what Shackleton and his crew had to live through.

00:12:25.308 --> 00:12:29.308
The Endurance itself was a sailing boat made out of wood.

00:12:30.088 --> 00:12:34.668
Yes, it was magnificent, and designed for these kinds of expeditions.

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:40.818
And yes it did have an engine, but this was a basic coal-powered engine

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:45.148
that was intended as a backup, rather than its main power source.

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:47.688
It was a wooden sailing boat, essentially.

00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:53.828
The team did have a wireless system, a radio, but by the time they were

00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:58.188
stuck in the ice, they were too far out of range for it to be used.

00:12:59.388 --> 00:13:04.858
And alongside the crew, there were 69 dogs, two sledges, and

00:13:05.038 --> 00:13:08.648
enough food, drink and fuel to keep them going for a year or so.

00:13:09.568 --> 00:13:15.358
They were well-supplied, but they were trapped, helpless, unable to do anything.

00:13:16.948 --> 00:13:21.898
What’s more, as the temperature continued to drop and the ice continued to tighten

00:13:21.898 --> 00:13:26.618
around them, it seemed like they might have bigger problems to contend with.

00:13:28.118 --> 00:13:33.498
On July 14th, in the depths of winter, the crew heard

00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:36.808
an almighty crack coming from the bottom of the ship.

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:41.508
Shackleton, already keenly aware that his crew’s

00:13:41.508 --> 00:13:45.298
morale was lagging, tried to pass it off as a whale.

00:13:46.438 --> 00:13:52.638
But on closer inspection, it was clear that the thick pack ice was crushing the

00:13:52.638 --> 00:13:59.148
ship, and freezing water started to seep into her hull, into the body of the ship.

00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:06.248
It took a while, but by October, after having managed to keep his crew alive through

00:14:06.248 --> 00:14:12.588
the entire Antarctic winter, Shackleton realised that the ship needed to be abandoned.

00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:19.278
It had been crushed so badly that it was a matter of time before it sank to the bottom.

00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:26.616
On October 27th 1915, the crew bid farewell to the Endurance; they

00:14:26.786 --> 00:14:31.456
abandoned the ship, and took their chances with the floating pack ice.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:36.535
They would later recall that they gathered together to eat their last

00:14:36.535 --> 00:14:41.245
meal in complete silence, as they contemplated what they were about to do.

00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:46.925
They now realised that they would need to call the ice home until it melted and

00:14:47.145 --> 00:14:51.465
there was a passage out, which was only likely to happen in several months' time.

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:57.118
Still, they were better off on the ice than on the Endurance, which they

00:14:57.118 --> 00:15:02.612
watched slowly sink on November 21st, less than a month after abandoning it.

00:15:04.072 --> 00:15:08.362
The men would spend the rest of the year on the ice, and it wasn’t

00:15:08.362 --> 00:15:13.772
until April the following year, April 1916, that the ice started to

00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:17.522
melt sufficiently for there to be enough space for a boat to pass.

00:15:19.072 --> 00:15:25.022
The men set out in a small lifeboat on April 9th, aiming for the nearest land.

00:15:26.122 --> 00:15:30.912
It took a week, but they did arrive on “Elephant Island”, a

00:15:30.912 --> 00:15:34.382
remote ice-covered island just off the coast of Antarctica.

00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:40.862
It would be the first time that they had been on land for 497 days.

00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:48.001
They found a completely uninhabited island, well, uninhabited apart from the penguins.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:52.021
It was better than being stuck on the ice in the middle of the

00:15:52.021 --> 00:15:56.051
sea, but they were far from any form of human civilization.

00:15:57.121 --> 00:16:02.401
What’s more, Elephant Island wasn’t the kind of place that a ship would pass.

00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:06.621
Shackleton realised that if he wanted to get his men

00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:10.221
home alive, drastic measures would need to be taken.

00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:16.821
And so it was, on April 24th of 1916, that he decided

00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:19.691
to take five crew members and try to find help.

00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:25.061
The chosen destination was South Georgia, the island

00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:27.441
they had stopped off at on their outbound journey.

00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:34.791
But it was 1,300 kilometres away across an icy and incredibly dangerous sea.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:41.611
The vessel for this hazardous trip would be a lifeboat only 7 metres long.

00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:49.731
Shackleton ordered his men to pack supplies for only four weeks, reasoning that if they

00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:54.741
hadn’t found South Georgia in four weeks, well that would mean that they had died on the way.

00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:58.461
And besides, there were the men they left behind on

00:16:58.471 --> 00:17:01.701
Elephant Island to consider; they needed to eat too.

00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:05.905
As you heard at the start of the episode in the letter he

00:17:05.905 --> 00:17:09.405
wrote, he clearly thought it was unlikely he would succeed.

00:17:10.785 --> 00:17:13.025
Certainly, the odds were against him.

00:17:13.315 --> 00:17:16.475
It was very unlikely that anyone would survive that journey.

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.095
The journey took 14 days.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:24.255
and was as difficult and hellish as you might have imagined.

00:17:24.998 --> 00:17:31.372
Huge waves, ferocious winds, minimal food, and the constant fear of being

00:17:31.452 --> 00:17:36.082
thrown into the icy water, which would result in almost-certain death.

00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:38.442
But they made it.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:45.632
They landed in South Georgia, however they landed on the uninhabited south side of the island.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.432
The whaling stations, where they could find other human

00:17:49.432 --> 00:17:52.562
beings who could help them, were all on the north side.

00:17:54.092 --> 00:17:59.396
By this time, three of the men were in terrible condition, incredibly ill.

00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:07.836
Shackleton told these three to stay put, to stay on the south side, while he and two of the crew

00:18:08.036 --> 00:18:14.676
would attempt the 40 kilometre trip on foot, over mountains, glaciers and frozen waterfalls.

00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:23.139
At 7am in the morning, after walking for 36 hours straight, they realised that they had made it.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:27.145
They made contact with a group of whalers, who didn’t initially

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:31.875
recognise this trio of frostbitten, bearded and barely alive men.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:39.851
Yet there was no time to celebrate or relax; Shackleton's attention turned to saving the rest

00:18:39.851 --> 00:18:45.111
of his crew, which was split between the three sick men on the other side of South Georgia,

00:18:45.621 --> 00:18:51.201
and the majority of the crew which was still stuck 1,300 kilometres away on Elephant Island.

00:18:52.691 --> 00:18:58.891
On Elephant Island, with no sign of Shackleton, morale had reached an all-time low.

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:02.961
The men had been eating penguins, but the penguins

00:19:03.111 --> 00:19:06.361
had gotten wise to this, and stopped coming ashore.

00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:11.861
What’s more, the pack ice was starting to close in around the island,

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:16.621
and it looked like no ship would be able to reach them even if it tried.

00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:24.851
And then, as if by magic, on August 30th of 1916, a large ship appeared.

00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:28.151
It was Shackleton returning to save his crew.

00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:32.911
Miraculously, all of his men survived.

00:19:34.327 --> 00:19:38.027
The group on the other side of Antarctica, however, the group that

00:19:38.027 --> 00:19:41.557
had been tasked with leaving supplies for the explorers after they had

00:19:41.557 --> 00:19:45.387
reached the South Pole, they weren’t so lucky, losing three of their men.

00:19:46.547 --> 00:19:51.457
And this was all for nothing, essentially, as Shackleton’s crew never

00:19:51.507 --> 00:19:55.567
actually set foot on the Antarctic, in this expedition at least.

00:19:56.991 --> 00:20:00.541
Now, Shackleton ultimately failed to achieve his goal of

00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:03.811
crossing the Antarctic, and he would never reattempt it.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:08.801
But this expedition has gone down in history as one

00:20:08.811 --> 00:20:12.201
of the greatest, with Shackleton as a great explorer.

00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:19.421
He was calm under pressure, able to lead and inspire his crew under the most hellish of conditions.

00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:23.781
He was also incredibly loyal to his men.

00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:27.971
Not only did he always put himself in the greatest of

00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:32.511
danger, but he always prioritised the wellbeing of his crew.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:38.161
While some might have wanted to rest after spending 500 days trapped on the

00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:43.431
ice, Shackleton’s first priority was heading back out to sea to save his crew.

00:20:44.901 --> 00:20:49.941
He might not have claimed any Antarctic records for himself, but he will

00:20:49.941 --> 00:20:55.151
forever go down in history as one of the Antarctic’s greatest explorers.

00:20:57.601 --> 00:21:03.771
OK then, that is it for today's episode on this fantastic explorer, Ernest Shackleton.

00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:08.471
I should add that if you would like to learn more about this amazing journey, there are

00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:12.941
so many wonderful anecdotes and stories that we didn’t have the time to listen to today.

00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:18.661
He kept fantastic diary entries, so go and read up about it, it’s absolutely fascinating.

00:21:19.471 --> 00:21:22.551

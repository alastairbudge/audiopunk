Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:16.607
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:20.857
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:25.177
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:30.127
about Oxbridge, why two universities dominate life in the UK.

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:35.677
Oxbridge, if you hadn’t guessed, is the name for Oxford and Cambridge

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:40.277
University, the two most famous and prestigious universities that

00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:44.417
dominate everything from British politics to journalism to business.

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:50.517
And in this episode we are going to look at why that is, and what is being done about it.

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:56.197
We’ll start with a brief look at the universities themself, the history of

00:00:56.197 --> 00:01:00.402
Oxford and Cambridge and how they are different from other universities in the

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:06.337
UK, then we’ll look at why graduates from these universities dominate so much of

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:11.317
British public life, and ask ourselves whether this will change any time soon.

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:13.997
OK then, Oxbridge.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:20.617
Before we get right into this episode I should start with a little personal disclaimer.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.447
I didn’t study at either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:29.597
I did apply for Oxford, and was given an interview but, like the

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:34.247
almost 85% of other people who applied, I was not offered a place,

00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:38.187
and I went to another university called University College London.

00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:43.147
Now, with that out of the way, let me start by saying that I

00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:46.477
imagine you will have heard of Oxford and Cambridge University.

00:01:46.997 --> 00:01:51.377
They are two of the most famous universities in the world, and often

00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:55.717
come first in the global rankings of the best universities in the world.

00:01:56.777 --> 00:02:03.827
Together with places like Harvard, Stanford and MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:09.807
you will find Oxford and Cambridge on pretty much every list of top five universities worldwide.

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:16.387
No doubt you knew that already, but what you might not have known is quite how much

00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:21.937
Oxford and Cambridge, or simply, Oxbridge, dominates the ruling class in Britain.

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:29.597
Graduates from Oxbridge make up less than 1% of the UK population, but make up

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:39.437
75% of senior judges, 51% of diplomats, 47% of columnists for major newspapers,

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:45.897
a quarter of MPs, of members of parliament, and one in five civil servants.

00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:53.297
And neither university is particularly large, in terms of how many students it takes.

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:59.644
Oxford only takes 12 and a half thousand undergraduates, and Cambridge takes a similar number.

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:07.004
Both universities have about the same number of postgraduate students, Masters and PhD

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:13.882
students, which takes the total number of students studying at each university to around 25,000.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.244
At Oxbridge in total, undergraduates and postgraduates in the two

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:24.724
universities put together, there are fewer than 50,000 students, but these

00:03:24.774 --> 00:03:29.854
students have an outsized impact on Britain, and indeed, the wider world.

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:37.434
As a point of comparison, Harvard has about 23,000, so it’s about the same, while

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:44.954
universities like UC Berkeley have about 45,000 and the Sorbonne in Paris has over 55,000.

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:52.284
Both Oxford and Cambridge, on a structural level, are very different

00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:56.574
from most universities in the UK, and most universities in the world.

00:03:57.844 --> 00:04:01.294
The universities are divided into self-governing

00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:06.870
colleges: Oxford has 39 colleges while Cambridge has 31.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.774
On a linguistic level it might sound confusing, because what British people

00:04:13.804 --> 00:04:19.804
call “university”, Americans call both “college” and “school”, and in Oxford and

00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:24.444
Cambridge you have the “university”, but within it you have separate “colleges”.

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:31.314
The university is a sort of umbrella around the colleges, and the degree certificate

00:04:31.384 --> 00:04:37.484
is from the university, but most of student life is dominated by the college.

00:04:38.104 --> 00:04:41.294
Students live in the college, and university professors,

00:04:41.644 --> 00:04:46.074
otherwise known as “dons” are attached to a particular college.

00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:52.604
The reason for this is historical, Oxford and Cambridge originally

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:58.194
began as monastic-like institutions with the teaching staff – the dons,

00:04:58.294 --> 00:05:02.174
who were priests originally – enclosed within the college's walls.

00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:09.504
As you may know if you’ve been there, and you may know anyway if you’ve seen pictures, many of these

00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:15.954
colleges are incredibly beautiful buildings, with the most beautiful for many being the chapel.

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:21.174
They did, after all, begin life as religious places, hence why

00:05:21.314 --> 00:05:25.284
no expense would be spared for the centre of religious worship.

00:05:26.844 --> 00:05:32.374
The emphasis placed on the self-contained college community also means that

00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:38.307
they have elegant, enclosed " quads” or squares and wonderful dining halls,

00:05:38.477 --> 00:05:42.217
such as the one you might be familiar with from the Harry Potter films.

00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:48.518
Unlike in many other universities, where there are large lectures attended by

00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:54.068
hundreds of students, and then there might be exams or assignments set at the end

00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:59.538
of each term, undergraduate students at Oxbridge are typically taught in small

00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:05.818
tutorial groups, often just two or three undergraduates to a single professor.

00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:12.854
This tutorial style makes the teaching particularly intimate and, as you can imagine,

00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:18.304
means that students are often pushed and challenged more than at typical universities.

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:24.344
Another particularly unique aspect of Oxbridge is the sheer amount of

00:06:24.344 --> 00:06:28.694
work that most undergraduates are required to do on a weekly basis.

00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:35.454
At many universities, throughout the UK but throughout much of the world, the workload,

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:40.754
the amount of work that you actually have to do, is not particularly strenuous.

00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:45.604
In an average term, you might have to do a few assignments per

00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:49.304
class, and you will normally be given several weeks to do them.

00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:56.824
At Oxbridge, students are required to be almost constantly doing assignments, every week there

00:06:56.824 --> 00:07:03.214
is a new assignment that needs to be completed within 7 days, and there is no option to extend.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:10.354
The pace, the speed, is furious, and–as we’ll come to discuss shortly–one of

00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:14.764
the main skills that Oxford graduates often say that the university has given

00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:19.904
is the ability to produce a large amount of work in a very short period of time.

00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:26.424
If we contrast this to the university system in, let’s say Italy–and

00:07:26.574 --> 00:07:31.634
apologies if you are Italian, but I say this both having studied at an Italian

00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:36.544
university and my wife being Italian–there is little time pressure for most

00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:41.264
subjects, and it isn’t uncommon for people to take several years to graduate.

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:45.694
At Oxbridge this simply isn’t an option.

00:07:46.314 --> 00:07:49.864
Every week there is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be

00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:54.174
completed, there is no hiding from it because you will have these

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:59.144
small tuition groups, and it simply isn’t possible to not do the work.

00:08:00.484 --> 00:08:06.294
The result of this is that you have this curious situation where students within each

00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:12.634
college will often know each other very well, as they live and study together intensely,

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:17.934
but may not even have met other students doing the same course at another college.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.050
Even within the university, some colleges are more prestigious than others.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.290
At Oxford, one of the most prestigious colleges is called Christ

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.804
Church, which was in fact founded by King Henry VIII in 1546.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.830
It only teaches 730 undergraduate students per year,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.540
but has a formidable list of alumni, or former students.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:53.550
Of the 28 British prime ministers educated at Oxford, 13 have come from this one college.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.190
But it’s not just prime ministers.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.030
Among its famous alumni you will find the philosopher John

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.390
Locke, and Robert Hooke, the 18th century scientist and inventor.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.840
Writers include the 1930s poet WH Auden and Lewis

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.300
Carroll, the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.000
Meanwhile at Cambridge, let us take a look at the other college

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.611
founded by Henry VIII, the prestigious Trinity College, which has

00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:28.224
even fewer undergraduates than Christ Church Oxford at only 600.

00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:35.208
Here, the record is not so much in prime ministers, although it can name six British

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:41.693
ones and five other ones, including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:09:41.978 --> 00:09:45.918
Trinity College is most famous for its Nobel prize winners.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.578
Now, you might find this difficult to believe, but Trinity College Cambridge

00:09:51.698 --> 00:09:57.516
has produced 34 Nobel laureates since Nobels started being awarded in 1901.

00:09:58.258 --> 00:10:02.518
This is out of 118 that have been generated by Cambridge

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:07.278
University, and the 975 that have been awarded worldwide.

00:10:08.238 --> 00:10:12.718
Indeed, were Cambridge University a country, it would be the country

00:10:12.848 --> 00:10:17.028
with the third highest number of Nobel prizes awarded in the world.

00:10:18.428 --> 00:10:23.468
And although Christ Church in Oxford and Trinity in Cambridge might be two of

00:10:23.468 --> 00:10:28.118
the most prestigious colleges of the university, and typically perform best

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:33.438
academically, every college is prestigious, and pretty much every single college

00:10:33.448 --> 00:10:38.888
will have famous and notable alumni that have gone on to have a global influence.

00:10:39.758 --> 00:10:45.188
Alumni of Oxbridge are too many to name, but let me just give you a few examples.

00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:49.118
The current UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, the previous

00:10:49.118 --> 00:10:52.468
one, Theresa May, the one before that, David Cameron.

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:58.688
Indeed, more British Prime Ministers have gone to Oxbridge than every other university put together.

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:03.068
And of course it’s not just prime ministers and politicians.

00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:04.338
J.R.R.

00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:09.558
Tolkein, Emma Watson, Benazir Bhutto, Bill Clinton, Stephen Hawking, Rupert

00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:15.218
Murdorch, Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, who you might know better as Mr Bean, and

00:11:15.368 --> 00:11:20.358
Aung San Suu Kyi, they all spent time studying at either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:27.318
Now, to get back to the question of how and why Oxbridge has such an oversized

00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:33.008
influence on British life, this is one that is often a subject of debate in the UK.

00:11:33.948 --> 00:11:40.098
Is it because the brightest and most ambitious students are attracted to Oxbridge, and therefore

00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:45.418
it’s only natural that these young men and women will go on to have successful professional careers?

00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:50.098
Is it because the tuition system at Oxbridge is so intense and

00:11:50.098 --> 00:11:54.528
personal, that of course it will produce more knowledgeable, productive

00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:58.568
and capable graduates than students of another university system?

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:04.218
Is it because the brand names of Oxford and Cambridge University are now so

00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:10.188
recognised that if someone has this name on their CV, on their resume, that they

00:12:10.198 --> 00:12:14.728
will be given opportunities and job interviews where another candidate might not?

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:20.188
Is it because of the alumni network that exists, of students living and

00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:25.088
working in such close proximity, as each graduate forges their own career

00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:29.658
path they will work with and help their former university colleagues?

00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:33.678
Is it the confidence and charisma that going to Oxbridge

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.733
instils in a young person, which often stays with them for life?

00:12:38.203 --> 00:12:40.683
Or is it a combination of everything?

00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:46.883
As you’d imagine, there are countless articles in newspapers and journals

00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:52.433
about why exactly this is, but the result is, as we’ve seen, the sheer

00:12:52.463 --> 00:12:56.923
domination of British public life by graduates from these universities.

00:12:58.233 --> 00:13:03.893
You might argue that this is an unhealthy situation, one where such a tiny

00:13:03.893 --> 00:13:08.693
proportion of the population has such a large impact on life in the country.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:14.803
You might argue that it’s a good thing, if the brightest and most capable 18 year olds are

00:13:14.803 --> 00:13:20.113
given the opportunity to live and study with other similarly bright and capable 18 year

00:13:20.113 --> 00:13:25.363
olds, so they can all learn from each other, be pushed forward by each other’s ambition,

00:13:25.463 --> 00:13:30.313
and generally do better than if they studied with a random collection of students.

00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:35.793
Either opinion may be valid, but it does hinge upon whether you

00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:40.813
believe that access to these universities is fair and unbiased.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:47.833
And unfortunately, on this count, both universities have come under increasing pressure

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:52.723
and scrutiny, with critics saying that Oxford and Cambridge have historically preferred

00:13:52.723 --> 00:13:57.983
candidates from private schools, fee-paying schools, rather than state schools.

00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:04.303
Six and a half percent of children in Britain go to private schools, but up until

00:14:04.303 --> 00:14:09.463
recently around 50% of Oxford and Cambridge graduates went to private schools.

00:14:10.463 --> 00:14:16.063
In the past 20 years or so, both Oxford and Cambridge have pledged to increase the number of

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:22.873
places offered to candidates from state schools, and have a goal of 75% of places going to

00:14:22.873 --> 00:14:30.713
state school pupils, but there is still a way to go, with Oxford at 68% and Cambridge at 71%.

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:37.153
This being said, there are still critics who say that these statistics hide

00:14:37.173 --> 00:14:42.763
another ugly truth, and that is that not all state schools are created equal.

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:47.973
Some are very high quality academically, while others are not.

00:14:48.973 --> 00:14:54.423
And for exceptionally talented students who have not been lucky enough to go to a good school

00:14:54.733 --> 00:15:00.433
and who perhaps have not grown up in an environment where going to university is the norm,

00:15:00.853 --> 00:15:07.583
access to Oxbridge is incredibly hard, and Oxford and Cambridge have been accused of not making

00:15:07.593 --> 00:15:14.093
much of an effort to encourage gifted students from disadvantaged households to apply there.

00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:17.773
Thankfully, this has started to change.

00:15:18.373 --> 00:15:23.701
They are now spending considerable amounts of money on outreach programmes, trying to ensure

00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:30.071
that potential applicants in schools which have rarely sent any one of their pupils to Oxbridge,

00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:35.141
the brightest amongst these groups are persuaded that Oxford or Cambridge could be for them.

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:43.421
In this respect, the intervention of the British rapper, Stormzy, in 2018 has been significant.

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:51.261
He joined forces with other, less glamorous, sponsors to support black and mixed race students

00:15:51.271 --> 00:15:58.091
through Cambridge, awarding up to 10 scholarships of £20,000 per year to the successful students.

00:15:58.871 --> 00:16:03.031
This so-called "Stormzy effect" means that Cambridge has now

00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:06.551
significantly increased the number of black and mixed race students.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:12.861
Estimates at both Oxford and Cambridge show that the numbers of what’s called BAME

00:16:12.991 --> 00:16:19.551
undergraduates - BAME stands for Black, Asian and Mixed Race - the number of BAME

00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:25.701
students is almost one third, while this segment is only 13% of the total UK population.

00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:30.731
So things are certainly getting better, and although access

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:34.571
might not be equal, it is more equal than ever before.

00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:40.381
Now, it is worth noting that, compared to many universities in the United States, for

00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:46.291
example, access to Oxford and Cambridge is incredibly meritocratic, the universities are

00:16:46.321 --> 00:16:52.341
much better at offering places based on intelligence and potential rather than anything else.

00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:59.861
You may remember the “Varsity Blues” scandal from 2019, where parents of wealthy

00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:05.351
students were found to have paid bribes to secure access to elite American universities.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:11.401
You may know that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, was accepted to Harvard

00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:17.291
University despite having very average grades, and there being question marks about

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:23.011
whether his father’s $2.5 million donation to the university had anything to do with it.

00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:27.851
You may also know that for many American universities, students

00:17:27.851 --> 00:17:31.341
with a family connection are more likely to be given a place.

00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:36.791
At Harvard, for example, 33% of applicants with a family

00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:40.921
connection are offered a place while the overall rate is just 6%.

00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:45.871
Fortunately this is not the case for Oxbridge - it doesn’t matter

00:17:46.061 --> 00:17:49.941
whether your parents both went there and donated millions of pounds to

00:17:49.941 --> 00:17:53.411
the university, it shouldn’t affect your chances of getting a place.

00:17:54.751 --> 00:18:00.501
Now, let us finish this exploration of Oxbridge with some curiosities, some little

00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:05.171
interesting facts that you may not know about these two prestigious universities,

00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:09.631
because they are steeped in history and have some amazing stories to tell.

00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:15.671
Firstly, and this is also a practical point, did you know that you can

00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:20.721
actually visit these colleges, you can wander around them and imagine

00:18:20.721 --> 00:18:25.231
yourself strolling through the courtyard like Sir Isaac Newton or Oscar Wilde?

00:18:25.781 --> 00:18:30.201
You can, and if you visit the UK I would definitely recommend you do this.

00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:35.691
Secondly, if you haven’t ever visited Oxford or Cambridge or been

00:18:35.691 --> 00:18:39.421
inside a college, you will probably have seen it in film or TV.

00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:45.551
The colleges are beautiful, and are often used as sets for films and TV series.

00:18:46.361 --> 00:18:50.241
Harry Potter is the most famous one, which used the majestic dining

00:18:50.241 --> 00:18:54.891
hall at Christ Church College Oxford for the great hall at Hogwarts.

00:18:55.721 --> 00:18:59.541
Thirdly, Oxford University is home to one of the oldest

00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:02.981
libraries in Europe, and the second largest library in the UK.

00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:10.321
It’s called “The Bodleian”, or simply “The Bod”, and has over 13 million individual books.

00:19:11.621 --> 00:19:17.791
Fourth, our penultimate fact is that the head of Oliver Cromwell, the man who ruled England for

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:23.617
a brief period in the 17th century, is still rumoured to be hidden in a college in Cambridge.

00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:31.037
And our final fact relates to an unusual tradition at Oxford University, and that is that several

00:19:31.077 --> 00:19:38.467
colleges keep pet tortoises, and every year there is a tortoise fair where these animals race,

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:45.037
chasing, I guess I probably shouldn’t use the word “chasing”, but at least following a lettuce leaf.

00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:51.327
So, there you go, a brief look at the unusual and unique institutions

00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:55.656
of Oxford and Cambridge University, otherwise known as Oxbridge.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.517
The final thing to underline is that if you visit the UK I

00:20:00.517 --> 00:20:03.927
would highly recommend a trip to either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:08.287
They are both a very easy train or bus ride away from London,

00:20:08.587 --> 00:20:11.917
and you will find yourself with no shortage of things to do.

00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:18.473
Whether it’s going for a ride on the gondola-like boats called punts and imagining that you are

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:24.493
Lewis Carrol writing Alice and Wonderland or strolling through a courtyard at a famous college

00:20:24.503 --> 00:20:30.993
and imagining that you’re Lord Byron, there are few places in the country, few places in the world

00:20:31.053 --> 00:20:36.623
perhaps, that have produced so many people that have had such an impact on the world we live in.

00:20:38.835 --> 00:20:43.159
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Oxbridge.

00:20:43.473 --> 00:20:46.923
I hope it's been an interesting one, that it’s given you some perspective

00:20:47.053 --> 00:20:51.363
on how these universities work and why they are so important, and that

00:20:51.363 --> 00:20:55.673
perhaps it has inspired you to pay them a visit if you come to the UK.

00:20:56.703 --> 00:20:59.873
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:00.223 --> 00:21:01.823
Have you been to Oxford or Cambridge?

00:21:02.113 --> 00:21:03.043
What did you think of them?

00:21:03.693 --> 00:21:09.493
Are there similar institutions in your country that have a similar impact on public life?

00:21:10.053 --> 00:21:11.223
I would love to know.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:16.607
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:20.857
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:25.177
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:30.127
about Oxbridge, why two universities dominate life in the UK.

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:35.677
Oxbridge, if you hadn’t guessed, is the name for Oxford and Cambridge

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:40.277
University, the two most famous and prestigious universities that

00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:44.417
dominate everything from British politics to journalism to business.

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:50.517
And in this episode we are going to look at why that is, and what is being done about it.

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:56.197
We’ll start with a brief look at the universities themself, the history of

00:00:56.197 --> 00:01:00.402
Oxford and Cambridge and how they are different from other universities in the

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:06.337
UK, then we’ll look at why graduates from these universities dominate so much of

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:11.317
British public life, and ask ourselves whether this will change any time soon.

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:17.087
But before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.587
OK then, Oxbridge.

00:02:01.207 --> 00:02:06.207
Before we get right into this episode I should start with a little personal disclaimer.

00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:10.037
I didn’t study at either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:15.187
I did apply for Oxford, and was given an interview but, like the

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:19.837
almost 85% of other people who applied, I was not offered a place,

00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:23.777
and I went to another university called University College London.

00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:28.737
Now, with that out of the way, let me start by saying that I

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:32.067
imagine you will have heard of Oxford and Cambridge University.

00:02:32.587 --> 00:02:36.967
They are two of the most famous universities in the world, and often

00:02:37.137 --> 00:02:41.307
come first in the global rankings of the best universities in the world.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:49.417
Together with places like Harvard, Stanford and MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:55.397
you will find Oxford and Cambridge on pretty much every list of top five universities worldwide.

00:02:56.807 --> 00:03:01.977
No doubt you knew that already, but what you might not have known is quite how much

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:07.527
Oxford and Cambridge, or simply, Oxbridge, dominates the ruling class in Britain.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:15.187
Graduates from Oxbridge make up less than 1% of the UK population, but make up

00:03:15.197 --> 00:03:25.027
75% of senior judges, 51% of diplomats, 47% of columnists for major newspapers,

00:03:25.357 --> 00:03:31.487
a quarter of MPs, of members of parliament, and one in five civil servants.

00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:38.887
And neither university is particularly large, in terms of how many students it takes.

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:45.234
Oxford only takes 12 and a half thousand undergraduates, and Cambridge takes a similar number.

00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:52.594
Both universities have about the same number of postgraduate students, Masters and PhD

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:59.472
students, which takes the total number of students studying at each university to around 25,000.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.834
At Oxbridge in total, undergraduates and postgraduates in the two

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:10.314
universities put together, there are fewer than 50,000 students, but these

00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:15.444
students have an outsized impact on Britain, and indeed, the wider world.

00:04:16.654 --> 00:04:23.024
As a point of comparison, Harvard has about 23,000, so it’s about the same, while

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:30.544
universities like UC Berkeley have about 45,000 and the Sorbonne in Paris has over 55,000.

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:37.874
Both Oxford and Cambridge, on a structural level, are very different

00:04:37.914 --> 00:04:42.164
from most universities in the UK, and most universities in the world.

00:04:43.434 --> 00:04:46.884
The universities are divided into self-governing

00:04:47.124 --> 00:04:52.460
colleges: Oxford has 39 colleges while Cambridge has 31.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.364
On a linguistic level it might sound confusing, because what British people

00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:05.394
call “university”, Americans call both “college” and “school”, and in Oxford and

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:10.034
Cambridge you have the “university”, but within it you have separate “colleges”.

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:16.904
The university is a sort of umbrella around the colleges, and the degree certificate

00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:23.074
is from the university, but most of student life is dominated by the college.

00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:26.884
Students live in the college, and university professors,

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:31.664
otherwise known as “dons” are attached to a particular college.

00:05:33.224 --> 00:05:38.194
The reason for this is historical, Oxford and Cambridge originally

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:43.784
began as monastic-like institutions with the teaching staff – the dons,

00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:47.764
who were priests originally – enclosed within the college's walls.

00:05:49.104 --> 00:05:55.094
As you may know if you’ve been there, and you may know anyway if you’ve seen pictures, many of these

00:05:55.094 --> 00:06:01.544
colleges are incredibly beautiful buildings, with the most beautiful for many being the chapel.

00:06:02.414 --> 00:06:06.764
They did, after all, begin life as religious places, hence why

00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:10.874
no expense would be spared for the centre of religious worship.

00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:17.964
The emphasis placed on the self-contained college community also means that

00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:23.897
they have elegant, enclosed " quads” or squares and wonderful dining halls,

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:27.807
such as the one you might be familiar with from the Harry Potter films.

00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:34.108
Unlike in many other universities, where there are large lectures attended by

00:06:34.148 --> 00:06:39.658
hundreds of students, and then there might be exams or assignments set at the end

00:06:39.658 --> 00:06:45.128
of each term, undergraduate students at Oxbridge are typically taught in small

00:06:45.308 --> 00:06:51.408
tutorial groups, often just two or three undergraduates to a single professor.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:58.444
This tutorial style makes the teaching particularly intimate and, as you can imagine,

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:03.894
means that students are often pushed and challenged more than at typical universities.

00:07:04.954 --> 00:07:09.934
Another particularly unique aspect of Oxbridge is the sheer amount of

00:07:09.934 --> 00:07:14.284
work that most undergraduates are required to do on a weekly basis.

00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:21.044
At many universities, throughout the UK but throughout much of the world, the workload,

00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:26.344
the amount of work that you actually have to do, is not particularly strenuous.

00:07:26.984 --> 00:07:31.194
In an average term, you might have to do a few assignments per

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:34.894
class, and you will normally be given several weeks to do them.

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:42.414
At Oxbridge, students are required to be almost constantly doing assignments, every week there

00:07:42.414 --> 00:07:48.804
is a new assignment that needs to be completed within 7 days, and there is no option to extend.

00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:55.944
The pace, the speed, is furious, and–as we’ll come to discuss shortly–one of

00:07:55.944 --> 00:08:00.354
the main skills that Oxford graduates often say that the university has given

00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:05.494
is the ability to produce a large amount of work in a very short period of time.

00:08:06.844 --> 00:08:12.014
If we contrast this to the university system in, let’s say Italy–and

00:08:12.164 --> 00:08:17.224
apologies if you are Italian, but I say this both having studied at an Italian

00:08:17.224 --> 00:08:22.134
university and my wife being Italian–there is little time pressure for most

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:26.854
subjects, and it isn’t uncommon for people to take several years to graduate.

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:31.284
At Oxbridge this simply isn’t an option.

00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:35.454
Every week there is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be

00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:39.764
completed, there is no hiding from it because you will have these

00:08:39.764 --> 00:08:44.734
small tuition groups, and it simply isn’t possible to not do the work.

00:08:46.074 --> 00:08:51.884
The result of this is that you have this curious situation where students within each

00:08:51.884 --> 00:08:58.224
college will often know each other very well, as they live and study together intensely,

00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:03.524
but may not even have met other students doing the same course at another college.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.640
Even within the university, some colleges are more prestigious than others.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.880
At Oxford, one of the most prestigious colleges is called Christ

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.394
Church, which was in fact founded by King Henry VIII in 1546.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.420
It only teaches 730 undergraduate students per year,

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.130
but has a formidable list of alumni, or former students.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:39.140
Of the 28 British prime ministers educated at Oxford, 13 have come from this one college.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.780
But it’s not just prime ministers.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.620
Among its famous alumni you will find the philosopher John

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.980
Locke, and Robert Hooke, the 18th century scientist and inventor.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.430
Writers include the 1930s poet WH Auden and Lewis

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.890
Carroll, the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.590
Meanwhile at Cambridge, let us take a look at the other college

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.201
founded by Henry VIII, the prestigious Trinity College, which has

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:13.814
even fewer undergraduates than Christ Church Oxford at only 600.

00:10:14.718 --> 00:10:20.798
Here, the record is not so much in prime ministers, although it can name six British

00:10:20.798 --> 00:10:27.283
ones and five other ones, including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:10:27.568 --> 00:10:31.508
Trinity College is most famous for its Nobel prize winners.

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:37.168
Now, you might find this difficult to believe, but Trinity College Cambridge

00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:43.106
has produced 34 Nobel laureates since Nobels started being awarded in 1901.

00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:48.108
This is out of 118 that have been generated by Cambridge

00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:52.868
University, and the 975 that have been awarded worldwide.

00:10:53.828 --> 00:10:58.308
Indeed, were Cambridge University a country, it would be the country

00:10:58.438 --> 00:11:02.618
with the third highest number of Nobel prizes awarded in the world.

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:09.058
And although Christ Church in Oxford and Trinity in Cambridge might be two of

00:11:09.058 --> 00:11:13.708
the most prestigious colleges of the university, and typically perform best

00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:19.028
academically, every college is prestigious, and pretty much every single college

00:11:19.038 --> 00:11:24.478
will have famous and notable alumni that have gone on to have a global influence.

00:11:25.348 --> 00:11:30.778
Alumni of Oxbridge are too many to name, but let me just give you a few examples.

00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:34.708
The current UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, the previous

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:38.058
one, Theresa May, the one before that, David Cameron.

00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:44.278
Indeed, more British Prime Ministers have gone to Oxbridge than every other university put together.

00:11:45.268 --> 00:11:48.658
And of course it’s not just prime ministers and politicians.

00:11:49.268 --> 00:11:49.928
J.R.R.

00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:55.148
Tolkein, Emma Watson, Benazir Bhutto, Bill Clinton, Stephen Hawking, Rupert

00:11:55.148 --> 00:12:00.808
Murdorch, Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, who you might know better as Mr Bean, and

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:05.948
Aung San Suu Kyi, they all spent time studying at either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:12.908
Now, to get back to the question of how and why Oxbridge has such an oversized

00:12:12.928 --> 00:12:18.598
influence on British life, this is one that is often a subject of debate in the UK.

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:25.688
Is it because the brightest and most ambitious students are attracted to Oxbridge, and therefore

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:31.008
it’s only natural that these young men and women will go on to have successful professional careers?

00:12:31.498 --> 00:12:35.688
Is it because the tuition system at Oxbridge is so intense and

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:40.118
personal, that of course it will produce more knowledgeable, productive

00:12:40.338 --> 00:12:44.158
and capable graduates than students of another university system?

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:49.808
Is it because the brand names of Oxford and Cambridge University are now so

00:12:49.828 --> 00:12:55.778
recognised that if someone has this name on their CV, on their resume, that they

00:12:55.788 --> 00:13:00.318
will be given opportunities and job interviews where another candidate might not?

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:05.778
Is it because of the alumni network that exists, of students living and

00:13:05.778 --> 00:13:10.678
working in such close proximity, as each graduate forges their own career

00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:15.248
path they will work with and help their former university colleagues?

00:13:15.708 --> 00:13:19.268
Is it the confidence and charisma that going to Oxbridge

00:13:19.593 --> 00:13:23.323
instils in a young person, which often stays with them for life?

00:13:23.793 --> 00:13:26.273
Or is it a combination of everything?

00:13:27.503 --> 00:13:32.473
As you’d imagine, there are countless articles in newspapers and journals

00:13:32.643 --> 00:13:38.023
about why exactly this is, but the result is, as we’ve seen, the sheer

00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:42.513
domination of British public life by graduates from these universities.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:49.483
You might argue that this is an unhealthy situation, one where such a tiny

00:13:49.483 --> 00:13:54.283
proportion of the population has such a large impact on life in the country.

00:13:54.923 --> 00:14:00.393
You might argue that it’s a good thing, if the brightest and most capable 18 year olds are

00:14:00.393 --> 00:14:05.703
given the opportunity to live and study with other similarly bright and capable 18 year

00:14:05.703 --> 00:14:10.953
olds, so they can all learn from each other, be pushed forward by each other’s ambition,

00:14:11.053 --> 00:14:15.903
and generally do better than if they studied with a random collection of students.

00:14:16.993 --> 00:14:21.383
Either opinion may be valid, but it does hinge upon whether you

00:14:21.383 --> 00:14:26.403
believe that access to these universities is fair and unbiased.

00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:33.423
And unfortunately, on this count, both universities have come under increasing pressure

00:14:33.583 --> 00:14:38.313
and scrutiny, with critics saying that Oxford and Cambridge have historically preferred

00:14:38.313 --> 00:14:43.573
candidates from private schools, fee-paying schools, rather than state schools.

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:49.893
Six and a half percent of children in Britain go to private schools, but up until

00:14:49.893 --> 00:14:55.053
recently around 50% of Oxford and Cambridge graduates went to private schools.

00:14:56.053 --> 00:15:01.653
In the past 20 years or so, both Oxford and Cambridge have pledged to increase the number of

00:15:01.653 --> 00:15:08.463
places offered to candidates from state schools, and have a goal of 75% of places going to

00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:16.303
state school pupils, but there is still a way to go, with Oxford at 68% and Cambridge at 71%.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:22.743
This being said, there are still critics who say that these statistics hide

00:15:22.763 --> 00:15:28.353
another ugly truth, and that is that not all state schools are created equal.

00:15:29.073 --> 00:15:33.563
Some are very high quality academically, while others are not.

00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:40.013
And for exceptionally talented students who have not been lucky enough to go to a good school

00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:46.023
and who perhaps have not grown up in an environment where going to university is the norm,

00:15:46.443 --> 00:15:53.173
access to Oxbridge is incredibly hard, and Oxford and Cambridge have been accused of not making

00:15:53.183 --> 00:15:59.683
much of an effort to encourage gifted students from disadvantaged households to apply there.

00:16:01.003 --> 00:16:03.363
Thankfully, this has started to change.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:09.291
They are now spending considerable amounts of money on outreach programmes, trying to ensure

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:15.661
that potential applicants in schools which have rarely sent any one of their pupils to Oxbridge,

00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:20.731
the brightest amongst these groups are persuaded that Oxford or Cambridge could be for them.

00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:29.011
In this respect, the intervention of the British rapper, Stormzy, in 2018 has been significant.

00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:36.851
He joined forces with other, less glamorous, sponsors to support black and mixed race students

00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:43.681
through Cambridge, awarding up to 10 scholarships of £20,000 per year to the successful students.

00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:48.621
This so-called "Stormzy effect" means that Cambridge has now

00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:52.141
significantly increased the number of black and mixed race students.

00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:58.451
Estimates at both Oxford and Cambridge show that the numbers of what’s called BAME

00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:05.141
undergraduates - BAME stands for Black, Asian and Mixed Race - the number of BAME

00:17:05.351 --> 00:17:11.291
students is almost one third, while this segment is only 13% of the total UK population.

00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:16.321
So things are certainly getting better, and although access

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:20.161
might not be equal, it is more equal than ever before.

00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:25.971
Now, it is worth noting that, compared to many universities in the United States, for

00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:31.881
example, access to Oxford and Cambridge is incredibly meritocratic, the universities are

00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:37.931
much better at offering places based on intelligence and potential rather than anything else.

00:17:39.271 --> 00:17:45.451
You may remember the “Varsity Blues” scandal from 2019, where parents of wealthy

00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:50.941
students were found to have paid bribes to secure access to elite American universities.

00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:56.991
You may know that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, was accepted to Harvard

00:17:56.991 --> 00:18:02.881
University despite having very average grades, and there being question marks about

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:08.601
whether his father’s $2.5 million donation to the university had anything to do with it.

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:13.441
You may also know that for many American universities, students

00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:16.931
with a family connection are more likely to be given a place.

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:22.381
At Harvard, for example, 33% of applicants with a family

00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.511
connection are offered a place while the overall rate is just 6%.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:31.461
Fortunately this is not the case for Oxbridge - it doesn’t matter

00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:35.531
whether your parents both went there and donated millions of pounds to

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:39.001
the university, it shouldn’t affect your chances of getting a place.

00:18:40.341 --> 00:18:46.091
Now, let us finish this exploration of Oxbridge with some curiosities, some little

00:18:46.131 --> 00:18:50.761
interesting facts that you may not know about these two prestigious universities,

00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:55.221
because they are steeped in history and have some amazing stories to tell.

00:18:56.361 --> 00:19:01.261
Firstly, and this is also a practical point, did you know that you can

00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:06.311
actually visit these colleges, you can wander around them and imagine

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:10.821
yourself strolling through the courtyard like Sir Isaac Newton or Oscar Wilde?

00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:15.791
You can, and if you visit the UK I would definitely recommend you do this.

00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:21.281
Secondly, if you haven’t ever visited Oxford or Cambridge or been

00:19:21.281 --> 00:19:25.011
inside a college, you will probably have seen it in film or TV.

00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:31.141
The colleges are beautiful, and are often used as sets for films and TV series.

00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:35.831
Harry Potter is the most famous one, which used the majestic dining

00:19:35.831 --> 00:19:40.481
hall at Christ Church College Oxford for the great hall at Hogwarts.

00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:45.131
Thirdly, Oxford University is home to one of the oldest

00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:48.571
libraries in Europe, and the second largest library in the UK.

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:55.911
It’s called “The Bodleian”, or simply “The Bod”, and has over 13 million individual books.

00:19:57.211 --> 00:20:03.381
Fourth, our penultimate fact is that the head of Oliver Cromwell, the man who ruled England for

00:20:03.381 --> 00:20:09.131
a brief period in the 16th century, is still rumoured to be hidden in a college in Cambridge.

00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:16.551
And our final fact relates to an unusual tradition at Oxford University, and that is that several

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:23.981
colleges keep pet tortoises, and every year there is a tortoise fair where these animals race,

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:30.551
chasing, I guess I probably shouldn’t use the word “chasing”, but at least following a lettuce leaf.

00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:36.841
So, there you go, a brief look at the unusual and unique institutions

00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:41.169
of Oxford and Cambridge University, otherwise known as Oxbridge.

00:20:42.103 --> 00:20:46.031
The final thing to underline is that if you visit the UK I

00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:49.441
would highly recommend a trip to either Oxford or Cambridge.

00:20:49.761 --> 00:20:53.801
They are both a very easy train or bus ride away from London,

00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:57.431
and you will find yourself with no shortage of things to do.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:03.986
Whether it’s going for a ride on the gondola-like boats called punts and imagining that you are

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:10.006
Lewis Carrol writing Alice and Wonderland or strolling through a courtyard at a famous college

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:16.506
and imagining that you’re Lord Byron, there are few places in the country, few places in the world

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:22.136
perhaps, that have produced so many people that have had such an impact on the world we live in.

00:21:24.348 --> 00:21:28.672
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Oxbridge.

00:21:28.986 --> 00:21:32.436
I hope it's been an interesting one, that it’s given you some perspective

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:36.876
on how these universities work and why they are so important, and that

00:21:36.876 --> 00:21:41.186
perhaps it has inspired you to pay them a visit if you come to the UK.

00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:45.386

What did you think of them?

00:21:49.206 --> 00:21:55.006
Are there similar institutions in your country that have a similar impact on public life?

00:21:55.566 --> 00:21:56.736

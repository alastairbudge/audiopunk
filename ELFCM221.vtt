Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:17.248
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:21.788
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.428 --> 00:00:30.138
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our four-part mini-series on gangsters and robbers.

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:35.378
In Part One, we talked about The Real Peaky Blinders and the criminals

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:39.828
of late 19th century and early 20th century Birmingham, England.

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:45.868
In Part Two, today’s episode, we will be talking about Al Capone, the

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:51.078
Italian-American prohibition era gangster with the nickname of Scarface.

00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:56.218
In Part Three, we'll talk about the notorious gangster and bank robber

00:00:56.558 --> 00:01:01.638
John Dillinger, the man called by the FBI “Public Enemy Number One”.

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:08.958
Then in Part Four we will zoom over to London, perhaps not a city that you automatically

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:14.268
associate with gangsters and criminals, and talk about The Kray Twins, a pair

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:20.578
of identical twins who terrorised the East End of London in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:27.339
OK then, let’s learn about the real story of Al Capone.

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:34.899
If you were to ask 100 Americans who the first person they’d think of when they heard the word

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.289
gangster, there’s little doubt that the name “Al Capone” would be right at the top of the list.

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:47.919
His name is synonymous with organised crime, violence, and corruption,

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.609
and the legacy he left behind is a mix of fear and admiration.

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:00.759
To understand how Al Capone managed to achieve what he did, we must first remind

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.329
ourselves of what life was like in the US at the turn of the 20th century.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.189
The American Civil War had ended in 1865.

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:15.389
Immigrants were arriving in their droves from Europe,

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.539
with New York as the first stop for almost all of them.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:26.599
These immigrants came from all over Europe, but there were particularly large numbers from Ireland

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:33.269
and southern Italy, areas of the continent where economic opportunities were not plentiful.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.629
Gabriele and Teresa Capone were two such people.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.619
They were Italians who had left their home outside Naples, got on

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:47.099
a boat and sailed across the Atlantic, in hope of a better life.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.629
On arrival in America in 1893, the pronunciation of their

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.819
surnames would have been Americanised, from Capone to Capone.

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:05.719
Gabriele and Teresa settled into American life, living in Brooklyn, New York City.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.809
Although they were respectable law-abiding citizens, life certainly wasn’t easy for new

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.639
Italian immigrants, and they, like the Irish, were treated as second-class citizens.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.859
They had a large family, with Teresa giving birth to nine

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.299
children, one of them being the protagonist of today’s story.

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:33.799
Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in 1899.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:40.579
The Brooklyn he would have been born into was an unruly one, one of street

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.579
gangs, dock workers, prostitution, crime, gambling, and all sorts of vices.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.149
It didn’t take Al long to be influenced by his surroundings.

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:59.359
He joined small street gangs of young boys that were involved in petty crime, and he was

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.549
expelled, he was kicked out of school at 14 years old after hitting a female teacher.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:14.839
The world that Capone lived in was an unfair one, and the young Al realised this from early on.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:20.999
As the child of Italian immigrants, he was treated as a second-class citizen, it was

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.759
harder for him to get ahead in life than it would be if he wasn’t of Italian heritage.

00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:33.229
He looked to the Americans making fortunes in business, people like JD Rockefeller

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:38.439
who lived in grand houses in New York City, and he wanted the same thing.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.369
The only problem was that the cards were stacked against him.

00:04:43.843 --> 00:04:47.459
It would be very difficult to make his way in the world

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:51.660
honestly, given the prejudice against Italian immigrants.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.500
So, what did Capone do?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.680
Well, we both know what route he took.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.790
Shortly after being kicked out of school he met a man called Johnny Torrio, another

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.990
Italian immigrant who had become a local mob boss, a local organised crime boss.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.690
Torrio became a bit of a mentor to Capone, and he showed him

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.470
the ropes, he taught him how to run an organised crime business.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.530
Torrio had shown that a life of crime could look like a semi-respectable business.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.480
Torrio seemed like a respectable businessman.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.150
He owned legitimate businesses–nightclubs, bars, and restaurants–but

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.110
he would operate illegitimate businesses from inside them.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.010
From prostitution to gambling, illegal loans, drug dealing, you name

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.350
it, Torrio was involved with it, and therefore would make money from it.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.990
But from the outside it looked semi-respectable.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.570
Torrio recognised Capone’s drive and abilities, and introduced Capone to his

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.000
other business associates, who were inevitably italian-American gangsters.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.560
One such man was Frankie Yale, and Capone’s first semi-legitimate job was

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.630
working as a bouncer, a person on the door at a nightclub that Yale worked at.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.600
Capone was a big man, especially for a southern Italian immigrant in the early 20th century.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.560
He was 180cm tall and weighed almost 100kg so he wasn’t

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.230
the sort of person you’d like to pick a fight with.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.480
When he was working on the door of this nightclub he allegedly shouted out something

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.180
not particularly nice about the bottom of one of the young ladies visiting the club.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.380
What he didn’t know is that this lady was the sister of another gangster, who, when

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.510
he heard about Capone insulting his sister’s honour, came to find him with a knife and

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:08.410
made two very large cuts across Capone’s cheek, earning him the nickname “Scarface”.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.940
Capone, by the way, reportedly hated this nickname, and hated the scars.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.650
You almost never see these scars in photos of Capone, because his face is always

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.490
turned the other way, and when he was asked about the scars he claimed he got

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.360
them fighting in World War I, which wasn’t true as he never served in the war.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.700
And the nickname that he actually liked?

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:42.430
“Snorky”, which was Italian-American slang at the time for someone with nice clothes.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.360
By the time he had got involved in this criminal underworld, the young Al had also fallen in

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.190
love, and had a child with his girlfriend, an Irish-Catholic girl two years older than him.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.630
After she had their child, they married, and it was reportedly a

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.560
happy marriage despite the life that Capone would go on to lead.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.670
Shortly after getting married, his mentor Johnny Torrio offered Capone a job

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.460
in Chicago, as a bouncer at a business he was involved in, a business that was

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.190
actually a brothel, a place where men would go to have sex with prostitutes.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.130
Capone jumped at the opportunity, and in 1919, aged only twenty, moved his

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.970
wife and young child to Chicago, a city he would forever be associated with.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.020
Capone worked on the door of the brothel, allowing people in and

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.150
out, but it seems that he was also a frequent customer himself.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:52.900
It’s thought to be in this brothel where he contracted syphilis, the sexually transmitted infection.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.590
Syphilis is now something that is relatively easy to cure, and even when Capone

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.730
would have first got it it’s thought that he could have been cured of it.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.370
But, he never actually got treatment for it, and it was

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.450
an infection that plagued him for the rest of his life.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.280
The relevance of this will become clear later on in our story.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:24.120
Now, in Chicago opportunities started to open up both for Torrio and Capone.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.280
Torrio’s boss, a Mafia don called Big Jim Colosimo,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:34.370
was murdered in May of 1920, and Torrio took his place.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.480
It’s thought that Torrio and Capone could have been involved in his murder, and that Capone

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.170
might have even arranged for his ex colleague from New York, Frankie Yale, to shoot Colosimo.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:55.650
Whether Capone was involved or not, Colosimo being out of the way was very convenient for him.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:02.480
Torrio took his place, inheriting Colosimo’s large portfolio of criminal businesses,

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:08.990
and Capone, as Torrio’s right hand man, was now in an incredibly powerful position.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.820
There was something else that had happened at the start of 1920 though that was to

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:21.270
prove to be even more important for the story of Al Capone, and this was actually

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:27.560
nothing to do with murders or gangsters, but actually to do with a change in the law.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:34.960
On January 17th 1920 the US government passed the Volstead Act, which

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.880
banned the production, importation, transportation and sale of alcohol.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:48.450
This period, known as the Prohibition Era, went on from 1920 to 1933.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:55.480
The idea behind it was to reduce crime and corruption, solve the problems that

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.250
had plagued American society and to improve the health of the American population.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:08.439
Certainly in terms of reducing crime and corruption, it was not successful, and suddenly there

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:15.409
was a huge opportunity for organised criminals to control the production and sale of alcohol.

00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:21.249
Given that Torrio and Capone controlled large parts of the Chicago underworld

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:26.649
through their businesses, bars, clubs, and brothels, they were in a unique

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:32.479
position to sell and distribute alcohol, making vast profits in the process.

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:36.849
Business was good, and Torrio and Capone started to grow

00:11:36.849 --> 00:11:41.149
rich, but they were not the only crime gang in town.

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:48.649
There were feuds with other Chicago crime gangs, both Italian and Irish, and after several

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:55.539
attempts on his life, Torrio decided that he wanted out of the world of crime, he wanted to retire.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:12:01.999
He didn’t quite manage to retire completely from the criminal world, and he later spent

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:09.019
some time in prison, but he left Chicago in late 1925, moving back to Italy to be with his

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:15.189
wife and mother, and removing himself from the dangers of the Chicago criminal underworld.

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:22.229
He knew that Capone would be able to handle it, and reportedly said to him “It’s all yours, Al.

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:23.009
Me?

00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:24.059
I’m quitting.

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:25.499
It’s Europe for me”.

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:32.449
The 26-year-old Capone was handed the reins to a criminal empire, a

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:38.949
huge business that made around $70 million dollars a year in 1926, which

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:43.229
is the equivalent of over a billion dollars a year in today’s money.

00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:47.489
This business empire was wide and vast.

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:52.569
It involved prostitution, illegal alcohol production, smuggling and

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:58.069
sales, gambling, extortion, protection, racketeering, and drugs.

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:04.949
To allow all of this to happen without interference from the authorities, Capone and his associates

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:11.639
would threaten and bribe local officials, politicians, judges and police officers, they would

00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:18.389
influence elections, they controlled vast amounts of how the city was actually administered.

00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:23.179
Capone didn’t do much to try to hide what he was up to.

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:28.649
While other criminals shunned the spotlight, they tried to hide

00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:32.999
from attention, Capone actively sought it, he looked for it.

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:36.929
He had his own press agent, he arranged interviews,

00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:40.499
he wanted to be photographed, he wanted to be known.

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:44.989
He wasn’t embarrassed in the slightest of how he made

00:13:44.989 --> 00:13:49.039
money, saying “I’m like any man - I supply a demand”.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:53.259
He wanted to be thought of as a businessman and

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:56.729
philanthropist, someone who gave back to the community.

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:01.279
He financed soup kitchens for the unemployed during the Great

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:05.339
Depression, and wanted to be known as someone who supported the poor.

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:12.939
Capone certainly did arrange for soup kitchens for the Chicago poor, but there are now question

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:19.379
marks about whether he actually paid for this himself - it’s believed by some historians that he

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:26.409
would have extorted local restaurants into providing the ingredients, so despite making literally

00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:31.809
hundreds of millions of dollars a year, he might not even have paid a cent towards these himself.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:35.049
He was also a ruthless killer.

00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:40.009
Although he was never convicted of any murders or violent crimes himself,

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:45.049
it’s believed that he wasn’t afraid to roll up his sleeves and kill people

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:49.889
himself, and he certainly arranged for the murders of hundreds more.

00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:57.139
And it was one particular murder, or mass-murder really, that changed things for Al Capone.

00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:03.189
Capone was in control of the South Side of Chicago, but the lucrative

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:08.999
North Side was controlled by another gang, ran by a man called Bugs Moran.

00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:14.669
There had been an ongoing feud between Capone and Moran for several years.

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:18.449
They were both involved in the selling of bootlegged

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:21.999
alcohol, illegal alcohol, and they hated each other.

00:15:23.079 --> 00:15:29.519
In February of 1929, Capone had a plan to get rid of his rival for good.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:37.599
He had arranged for a contact to offer Moran a truckload of illegal whisky at a very low price.

00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:45.829
Moran accepted, and ordered for it to be delivered to a warehouse on February 14th, Valentine’s Day.

00:15:46.969 --> 00:15:52.459
When the whisky arrived, men dressed as police officers burst onto the scene,

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:57.339
lining up Moran’s men against the wall, telling them that they were being arrested.

00:15:58.152 --> 00:16:02.169
But they weren’t police officers, they were Capone’s guys.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:07.829
They pointed their machine guns at Moran’s men and fired, killing six

00:16:07.849 --> 00:16:12.299
of Moran’s men immediately, and one would later die of his wounds.

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:15.649
Crucially though, Moran wasn’t there.

00:16:15.979 --> 00:16:18.059
He had decided to sleep in that morning.

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:23.059
Moran was furious, blaming the killing on Capone.

00:16:23.489 --> 00:16:28.419
He even broke the unwritten criminal code of never speaking

00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:31.899
to the police, and told them it was Capone who did it.

00:16:32.979 --> 00:16:37.539
Capone, of course, denied it, but now public opinion was turning against

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:42.179
him - there was little doubt that Capone had ordered the hit, which

00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:47.009
by this time had been given the name “The Valentine’s Day Massacre”.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:50.189
This was one step too far.

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:54.939
It was one thing making some money through prostitution and gambling,

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:59.489
but lining 7 people up against the wall and murdering them in cold

00:16:59.489 --> 00:17:03.169
blood, with their pictures plastered all over the Chicago newspapers?

00:17:04.009 --> 00:17:08.769
Capone was called to court to testify, but he said he was in

00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:12.539
Florida suffering from pneumonia and couldn’t get out of bed.

00:17:13.219 --> 00:17:17.189
He was in Florida, that was true, and indeed nobody

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:20.259
thought that Capone would have pulled the trigger himself.

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:28.709
But he certainly didn’t seem ill - he had been spotted at a race track and even out in the Bahamas.

00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:34.909
Eventually the authorities did manage to get him to return to Chicago, which he

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:40.959
did on March 20th of 1929, just over a month after The Valentine’s Day Massacre.

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:46.089
The police weren’t able to charge him with involvement in the massacre, as

00:17:46.159 --> 00:17:50.259
he denied it and they couldn’t find anyone who would testify that he had

00:17:50.259 --> 00:17:55.589
anything to do with it, but they did manage to convict him of “contempt of

00:17:55.589 --> 00:18:00.079
court”, the crime of not appearing in front of a courtroom when asked to.

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:06.079
The maximum punishment for this was a year and a $1,000 fine, but

00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:10.279
Capone didn’t serve a day in prison, not for this crime at least.

00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:17.849
Instead, he was arrested a couple of months later, in May of 1929, for carrying a pistol.

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:23.039
Capone was given a one year sentence, but only served nine months of it.

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:26.894
While in prison he lived a luxurious life.

00:18:27.484 --> 00:18:33.254
He was still in control of the gang from prison, and his associates made

00:18:33.254 --> 00:18:37.744
sure that the prison guards were sufficiently compensated, that they were

00:18:38.004 --> 00:18:42.864
paid enough money, for Capone to have anything he wanted in his prison cell.

00:18:43.834 --> 00:18:48.444
When he got out of prison, in March of 1930, he found that

00:18:48.444 --> 00:18:52.994
the tide had turned, that public opinion was not on his side.

00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:58.194
What’s more, the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.004
knew exactly who he was and what he was doing.

00:19:01.464 --> 00:19:05.624
They knew that he was going to return to exactly what he had been doing all

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:10.114
of his life, they just needed to find a crime that they could charge him with.

00:19:10.696 --> 00:19:14.746
He was listed as “Public Enemy Number One”, literally

00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:18.286
the biggest enemy of the people in the entire country.

00:19:19.156 --> 00:19:24.426
The country was also in the middle of the greatest economic crisis in its short history.

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:31.076
People were suffering, and for all Capone’s reportedly philanthropic activities, after the

00:19:31.076 --> 00:19:37.266
Valentine’s Day Massacre a light had truly been shone on the kind of person he really was.

00:19:37.956 --> 00:19:41.666
If the authorities couldn’t get him on any of the violent criminal

00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:45.906
charges that they knew he was certainly guilty of, there was another

00:19:45.906 --> 00:19:50.396
way they thought they could take him off the streets: financial crime.

00:19:51.186 --> 00:19:54.346
Al Capone didn’t try to hide his wealth at all.

00:19:54.825 --> 00:19:58.776
Quite the opposite - he flaunted it, he showed it to the world.

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:06.196
He wore a $50,000 diamond ring on his little finger, on his pinkie, he wore suits

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:10.386
that would cost today’s equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars, he would

00:20:10.586 --> 00:20:17.116
travel everywhere in a custom-built armoured Cadillac, he would spare no expense.

00:20:17.736 --> 00:20:23.396
But where did this money come from, at least what did he tell the tax authorities?

00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:28.196
Well, he said he was a businessman engaged in a variety of

00:20:28.196 --> 00:20:32.206
small businesses, including being a used furniture dealer.

00:20:32.996 --> 00:20:39.186
The problem was that Capone’s reported income, the money that he told the government

00:20:39.276 --> 00:20:45.346
he had made on his tax returns, was tiny compared to how much he was clearly spending.

00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:55.066
And he was arrested in June 1931 on charges of tax evasion, of failing to pay the required taxes.

00:20:56.016 --> 00:21:03.016
After a lengthy trial, in October of 1931 Capone was convicted of tax evasion

00:21:03.146 --> 00:21:09.256
and sentenced to 11 years in prison, the longest sentence ever for tax evasion.

00:21:10.056 --> 00:21:15.516
He was initially sent to a state prison in Atlanta, but his men had managed

00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:20.576
to bribe guards so that Capone lived a pretty privileged life in prison.

00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:26.316
Three years later, in a bid to properly punish Capone and show the

00:21:26.336 --> 00:21:32.046
country that crime didn’t pay, he was transferred to a new, high-security

00:21:32.046 --> 00:21:36.916
prison on a rocky island in the bay of San Francisco: Alcatraz.

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:42.636
The prison at Alcatraz had previously been a military prison, but was

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:48.506
converted to a federal prison, a prison for civilians, in the early 1930s.

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:53.586
When it opened in August 1934, it welcomed some of the

00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:57.226
country’s most dangerous and highest-profile criminals.

00:21:57.366 --> 00:22:00.316
Bank robbers, gangsters, murderers.

00:22:00.446 --> 00:22:03.796
And Al Capone was one of its first inmates.

00:22:04.316 --> 00:22:11.076
Now, the life of Al Capone after he arrived at Alcatraz was sad and certainly not glorious.

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:17.996
His syphilis, which remember he had contracted while working at a brothel after first moving

00:22:17.996 --> 00:22:24.526
to Chicago with his wife and young child, his syphilis was getting worse, and had progressed

00:22:24.556 --> 00:22:30.036
to something called neurosyphilis, where the infection affects your mental capacities.

00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:36.776
Syphilis, if left untreated, permanently rots and damages your brain.

00:22:37.676 --> 00:22:41.936
His last years at Alcatraz were spent in the prison hospital, and

00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:47.236
by the time he was released, which was in November of 1939, doctors

00:22:47.236 --> 00:22:52.076
reported that he had the mental capabilities of a 12-year-old child.

00:22:52.856 --> 00:22:56.736
After being released, he spent the rest of his life at his mansion

00:22:56.806 --> 00:23:01.806
in Florida, before dying of complications from a stroke in 1947.

00:23:02.676 --> 00:23:06.386
Now, after Capone had been put in prison, the Chicago

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:10.016
gang he had been the boss of was thrown into disarray.

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:16.186
There was no immediate big boss to take his place, unlike when Johnny Torrio had taken

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:21.839
the place of Big Jim Colosimo or when Al Capone had taken the place of Johnny Torrio.

00:23:22.767 --> 00:23:29.726
Organised crime certainly didn’t go away, but without Capone at the top it became less violent.

00:23:30.466 --> 00:23:35.516
What’s more, the Prohibition era ended in 1933, and

00:23:35.626 --> 00:23:39.396
that put a large dent in the business model of the gang.

00:23:39.976 --> 00:23:43.876
Now, when it comes to the legacy of Al Capone, he is

00:23:43.886 --> 00:23:46.896
probably the most famous gangster in American history.

00:23:47.396 --> 00:23:52.746
He was a larger than life character, a man who knew what he wanted and how to get it,

00:23:53.086 --> 00:23:58.956
and a man who seemed to like the idea of being seen as having achieved The American

00:23:58.956 --> 00:24:04.516
Dream, of having gone from nothing to being one of the richest men in the country.

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:10.346
But he was, of course, like everyone else in this mini-series, a violent murderer.

00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:15.146
There are terrible stories of him brutally murdering rivals with baseball

00:24:15.146 --> 00:24:20.696
bats, or arranging for hideous assassinations, and he was no doubt responsible

00:24:20.716 --> 00:24:26.146
directly and indirectly for the deaths of dozens if not hundreds of people.

00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:31.856
And for all of the stories that he put out about him being a generous

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:37.366
philanthropist, it appears that these were also complete lies, and he had threatened

00:24:37.396 --> 00:24:41.696
hardworking shopkeepers and restaurant owners to go into their own pockets.

00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:46.836
He might have claimed to have just been a businessman, giving the people what they wanted.

00:24:47.096 --> 00:24:51.766
But it’s hard to contest that there have been few people more deserving

00:24:52.096 --> 00:24:57.326
than Alphonse Gabriel Capone of the title of “Public Enemy Number One”.

00:24:59.189 --> 00:25:03.455
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Al Capone.

00:25:03.855 --> 00:25:09.035
As a reminder, this is part two of our four-part mini-series on famous gangsters.

00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:12.775
Part one was on the Real Peaky Blinders, the street-gang

00:25:12.785 --> 00:25:15.775
that terrorised Birmingham in the late 20th century.

00:25:16.135 --> 00:25:21.585
Next up will be the infamous bank robber John Dillinger, and after that we’ll be looking at

00:25:21.655 --> 00:25:29.025
two identical twins who terrorised the East End of London in the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.

00:25:29.965 --> 00:25:33.275
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:33.795 --> 00:25:36.725
Did you know much about the life of Al Capone before this?

00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:40.415
Why do you think we look back on these kinds of criminals

00:25:40.435 --> 00:25:43.575
and often forget many of their most terrible crimes?

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:45.325
I would love to know.

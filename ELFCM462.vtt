Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.570
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.380
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is the start of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.790
another mini-series, this time on the theme of Scotland.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.579
In part one, in this episode, we are going to have some

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.170
fun talking about unusual Scottish traditions and facts.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.270
In part two, we are going to talk about the time that Donald Trump tried to build

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.000
a golf course in the north of Scotland and, well, it didn’t quite go to plan.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.710
In part three, we are going to talk about the quest for Scottish independence,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.170
and ask ourselves whether Scotland will ever break free from the United Kingdom.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.520
And in part four, yes, lucky you, this is going to be our first four-part mini-series, we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.100
are going to look at one of the bloodiest events in Scottish history, the Glencoe massacre.

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:14.111
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get talking about some unusual Scottish traditions.

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:19.731
There was a famous survey done several years ago of

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:23.311
American tourists considering making a trip to Scotland.

00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:31.881
The survey asked the reason for the trip, and a reported 23% said that they had

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:37.541
come in the belief that they could hunt and catch something called a “haggis”.

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:45.391
When asked to describe this haggis, one tourist said it was “a wild beast of the

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:51.811
Highlands, no bigger than a grouse, which only came out at night”, while another said

00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:57.611
that it was “a creature that sometimes ventured into the cities and was similar to a fox.”

00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:05.041
You may know that haggis is a popular Scottish dish, it’s eaten during special occasions.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:09.831
The problem is…haggis isn’t an animal.

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:16.391
It is a collection of sheep organs mixed together with oats and other spices.

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:20.921
It might sound disgusting, but if you ask me it’s delicious.

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:27.121
Now, this survey was created by an American tour company and a haggis

00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.511
producer, so perhaps we should take the results with a pinch of salt.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:39.901
But even today, if you go to Google and start typing “is haggis…”, the first option that

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:47.181
pops up is “healthy”, and the second is “an animal”, so clearly there are plenty of people

00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:53.091
who still believe this quintessential Scottish dish is in fact a cute furry little animal.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.061
We will talk more about haggis in a moment, but the reason to start with

00:02:59.061 --> 00:03:04.721
this little story was to underline this strange mythology that Scotland and

00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:10.151
Scottish customs have in many people’s minds, especially in those of Americans.

00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:15.181
Scotland is a small country, only five and a half

00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:19.151
million people, but it has an outsized global impact.

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:23.511
It has produced great inventors, scientists and philosophers.

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:29.931
Scottish people are rightfully proud to call themselves Scottish, and the

00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:34.631
hundreds of millions of people with some kind of Scottish heritage, Scottish

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:40.001
ancestors, often embrace it and feel a strong connection with this country

00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:45.741
that in many cases they will have never stepped foot on and know nobody from.

00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:52.291
One of those people with Scottish ancestry is, in fact, me.

00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:59.561
If you’ve been paying attention, you will know that my name is Alastair, which is a Scottish name.

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:05.201
My grandfather was Scottish, I still have a lot of family in Scotland, and

00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:10.918
I partially grew up in Scotland, from when I was 7 until when I was 13.

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:16.901
I might not sound Scottish to you, that’s what lots of moving around a lot and then living in

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:22.581
England does to your accent, but I am more Scottish than several players on the Scottish rugby

00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:29.331
team, and I can actually play the bagpipes, so I am more Scottish than you might have realised.

00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:34.811
So, here we are, someone who is at least partially Scottish,

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:38.651
talking to you about some unusual Scottish traditions.

00:04:39.981 --> 00:04:44.481
For our first one, we are going to return to the haggis.

00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:49.991
You might know that there are some days on which haggis is traditionally eaten.

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:57.201
The most famous of these is Burns Night, which is a celebration of the life of

00:04:57.201 --> 00:05:03.671
the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns, and falls on January 25th every year.

00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:09.701
But what you might not know, and is certainly an unusual

00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:14.231
Scottish tradition, is what is done before the haggis is eaten.

00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:20.551
The haggis is prepared, of course, which really only means boiling it in water.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.921
It is brought to the table, ideally to the sound of bagpipes.

00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:27.871
I have piped in many a haggis, I should add.

00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:36.521
But before the haggis can be eaten, it is tradition to read a poem to celebrate the haggis.

00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:42.811
It was written by Robert Burns himself, and is called “Address to a Haggis”.

00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:48.811
It is written in Scots, so it is hard to understand, even

00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:52.661
for a native English speaker, but it starts like this:

00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:56.431
Fair fa’ your honest, sonsie face,

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.181
Great Chieftain o’ the Puddin-race!

00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:02.508
I imagine you might not have understood any of that.

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:09.718
“ Fair fa” is a way of wishing someone well and “sonsie” means happy or cheerful.

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:16.218
And then he is calling the haggis a “chieftain”, a great leader, of the race of puddings.

00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:21.128
So to translate it into normal English, it would be something like:

00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:24.058
Hello, honest and happy haggis,

00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:26.738
You wonderful leader of all puddings.

00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:33.278
Anyway, I won’t go through the entire poem, it’s quite long and complicated, but about

00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:40.448
a third of the way through the poem the person reading it needs to ceremoniously stab

00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:46.328
the haggis with a knife, cutting it open and spilling all the contents of the pudding.

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:54.108
It is a lot of fun, and if you ever find yourself in Scotland on Burns Night and see an animated

00:06:54.108 --> 00:07:00.718
person reading a poem out loud and holding a large knife, do not worry, this is what is going on.

00:07:02.178 --> 00:07:08.238
Now, for our second unusual tradition, we are going to talk about something called The

00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:13.658
Highland Games, and you will be pleased to hear that haggises feature here as well.

00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:19.068
The Highlands, as you may know, are the northern half of Scotland.

00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:22.468
If you have seen pictures of wonderful mountains and

00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:25.408
forests, you are probably imagining the Highlands.

00:07:26.408 --> 00:07:30.898
And during the summer months, all throughout the Highlands, different

00:07:30.948 --> 00:07:35.838
towns and villages put on “Highland Games”, which are a sort of day of

00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:40.418
sporting activities and competitions, as well as music and celebrations.

00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:46.758
Some of the events will be familiar to you: there are normally running races

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:53.058
and weight lifting, but some of the activities will probably be less familiar.

00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:58.378
There is something called “tossing the caber”, which involves picking up a

00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:05.378
large telegraph pole, a huge pole of wood, typically 5 to 6 metres tall, and

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:10.648
throwing it so that it lands on one end and then flips over on the other.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.568
There is the hammer throw, which involves someone trying to

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:19.388
launch a heavy ball attached to a rope as far as they can.

00:08:20.078 --> 00:08:24.688
It's quite scary and impressive to watch, as the person needs to spin around

00:08:24.688 --> 00:08:29.588
and around and then let go of the rope just at the right time so that it

00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:33.838
doesn’t fly into the crowd and smash into some unsuspecting spectator.

00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:39.168
And then there is also something called “hurling the haggis”.

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:46.308
To hurl is another word for to throw, it means to throw with great force or effort.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:51.798
And haggis hurling is exactly that, it requires

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:55.478
someone to throw a haggis as far as they possibly can.

00:08:56.358 --> 00:09:01.198
But, there are some nuances, some rules to be aware of.

00:09:02.578 --> 00:09:07.598
A real cooked haggis must be used, and the haggis cannot break.

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:13.128
If it splits in mid air or when it lands, the throw is disqualified.

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.748
And this happens quite a lot.

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:23.668
After all, a haggis is only held together with a thin lining, so there is real

00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:30.010
skill in throwing it a long distance but so that the landing is relatively gentle.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.490
And if you are wondering what the world record for haggis hurling

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.750
is, it is 66 metres, which is quite impressive if you ask me.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.210
Now, we are going to move away from haggis-based

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.860
traditions, but we are going to keep on the subject of food.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.890
As you may know, if you are looking to visit somewhere that prides itself on healthy,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:01.630
nutritious food - fresh vegetables and fruit - then Scotland probably isn’t your best bet.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.430
Our first unusual Scottish tradition is one that you might have

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.370
heard of, and that is something called a “deep fried Mars bar”.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:18.390
You probably know what a Mars bar is, it’s a chocolate bar filled with nougat and caramel.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:26.000
And you probably know what to “deep fry” means - it means to submerge something in hot oil.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.140
It’s what you do with chips, or fried chicken, or the fish in “fish and chips”.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.690
And a deep fried Mars bar is exactly what you probably think it is.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:43.710
The Mars bar is chilled, put in a fridge, before being covered in batter and then deep fried.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.070
If you like fried food and you like Mars bars, it will

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.680
be delicious, but it should come with a health warning.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:11:00.820
Each one contains a reported 1,200 calories, almost half the daily recommended allowance for

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:07.890
a man, so it is a treat best enjoyed infrequently unless you also enjoy visiting the hospital.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.000
Now, moving on, you probably know that Scotland is the home of whisky,

00:11:14.538 --> 00:11:20.020
but you might not know a less famous and less alcoholic Scottish drink.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.755
It’s called Irn-Bru, and you can recognise it by its bright orange colour.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.020
And if you are thinking, hmm, delicious, a kind of

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.790
orange-tasting soda, nope, it doesn’t taste like oranges at all.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.270
I actually quite like it, and I used to drink it a lot as a child, but it has such a

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.610
strange taste that it took me quite a while to figure out how to describe it to you.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:55.330
I looked through various forums to see how other people described it, and one of the most

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.830
popular comments was that it tastes “kinda like rust and battery acid and it's magic.”

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.640
It tastes a little bit like bubblegum, a little bit of lemon, but looks highly

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.370
radioactive and tastes like nothing else I’ve tasted anywhere outside Scotland.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.140
And in Scotland, it is exceptionally popular.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.640
It is the best-selling drink in the entire country, outselling Coke and Pepsi.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:29.570
And its recipe, according to folklore at least, is an incredibly closely guarded secret.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:35.550
Only three people in the company know the exact recipe, and they are never allowed

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.810
to travel together, in case there is an accident and the recipe is lost forever.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.350
So, if you happen to be travelling to Scotland and you see people drinking

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.600
what looks like it could be radioactive fluid, that’s what’s going on.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.070
And I would certainly recommend that you try it yourself, as it

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.360
is pretty hard to come by anywhere outside the Scottish borders.

00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:02.640
Right, for our last tradition, I’m going to tell you some unusual

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.680
facts about the national instrument of Scotland, the bagpipes.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.860
As I said at the start of the episode, I can actually play the bagpipes,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.730
so this is something I can tell you about from firsthand experience.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.000
In case you don’t know what I’m talking about, the bagpipes are a

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.550
musical instrument made up of a bag with several tubes coming out of it.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:32.670
To be precise, one tube where you blow air in, three tubes that sit over your shoulder,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.610
called drones, and another tube that you hold with both hands and play a tune with.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.860
It's not an easy instrument to play, you need to properly manage blowing into the bag

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.430
and squeezing it with your left arm, but when you do it properly, it sounds like this.

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:12.694
So, to finish up this episode, here are five unusual facts about the bagpipes.

00:14:13.834 --> 00:14:17.314
Firstly, the bagpipes can never be silent.

00:14:18.204 --> 00:14:23.304
Unlike almost any other instrument, you can’t stop making noise when you are playing, there is

00:14:23.324 --> 00:14:29.614
always the background noise, the drone, and the noise of the chanter, the one that makes the tune.

00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:36.244
Secondly, bagpipes were traditionally made from the skin of an entire

00:14:36.274 --> 00:14:40.364
animal, with the pipes attached to where the neck and head would have been.

00:14:41.478 --> 00:14:47.214
Thirdly, as you may know, forms of bagpipes exist in many different countries.

00:14:47.674 --> 00:14:52.644
France, Spain, Italy, Poland they all have different forms of bagpipes,

00:14:52.804 --> 00:14:56.134
and there are similar kinds of instruments all over the world.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:04.114
Fourth, and this in fact came as news to me, alongside myself, the famous and not

00:15:04.124 --> 00:15:10.144
particularly pleasant Roman emperor, Nero, was said to have been a skilled bagpiper, and

00:15:10.324 --> 00:15:15.754
played a form of bagpipes not so dissimilar to the Scottish “Great Highland bagpipe”.

00:15:17.204 --> 00:15:23.264
And for number five, I’m going to give you a fact that you won’t find anywhere else online.

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:27.504
There is a kind of whisky called Glenmorangie.

00:15:28.034 --> 00:15:31.374
It's a very famous, high quality whisky, made just

00:15:31.404 --> 00:15:34.734
outside a town called Tain in the north of Scotland.

00:15:35.484 --> 00:15:38.754
You can visit the distillery and see how the whisky is made.

00:15:39.694 --> 00:15:43.144
The distillery employs many people in the area, including

00:15:43.154 --> 00:15:47.654
a man called Jimmy, who was also my bagpipe teacher.

00:15:49.404 --> 00:15:54.954
Jimmy was the nightwatchman, so it was his job to monitor everything in the

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:59.624
distillery during the night, to make sure that nothing went wrong overnight.

00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:04.124
And Jimmy would spend his evenings walking up and down the

00:16:04.124 --> 00:16:07.604
distillery floor, playing the bagpipes to pass the time.

00:16:08.984 --> 00:16:14.734
And given that Glenmorangie whisky is 10 years old or more, if you have drunk

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:21.634
Glenmorangie at any point in the last 20 years or so, in all probability that whisky

00:16:21.824 --> 00:16:27.104
has been aged to the sound of a man called Jimmy MacLeod playing the bagpipes.

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:33.904
OK then, that is it for today's episode on weird Scotland,

00:16:34.024 --> 00:16:36.924
the first in our mini-series on this wonderful country.

00:16:37.644 --> 00:16:42.634
As a reminder, next up will be Donald Trump’s battle to build a golf course, and how

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:45.954
he realised that the locals were going to put up more of a fight than he expected.

00:16:46.484 --> 00:16:50.934
Part three will be on Scotland’s quest for independence, and part four will

00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:55.194
be on one of the bloodiest events in Scottish history, the Glencoe massacre.

00:16:55.854 --> 00:17:00.374
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:00.864 --> 00:17:06.134
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

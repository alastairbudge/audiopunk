Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:17.155
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:21.275
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:28.765
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the film ‘Loose Change’.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:36.865
It was a film, or series of films, made by a group of 18 years olds about the September 11th

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:43.755
attacks, where the filmmakers proposed that the entire thing was planned by the US government.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:49.815
The film, which was made for just $2,000 on a laptop, has been watched

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:54.755
by tens of millions of people, and for many has become a gateway

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:59.255
drug to the addictive and dangerous world of conspiracy theories.

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:07.025
So, in this episode we’re going to explore the story behind the movie, some of the key theories

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:14.245
in it, why it was so successful, and the legacy it left on the United States and the world.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.815
Buckle up, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:23.695
Now, I’m sure you need no reminder of what happened on 9/11.

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:29.965
You might even remember exactly where you were when you heard the news - I certainly do.

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:34.895
But let’s just recap very briefly, because the events

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:39.515
of September 11th are at the crux of our story.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:46.615
On 11 September 2001, nineteen members of the terrorist

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.995
group Al Qaeda hijacked and stole four aeroplanes.

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:58.065
They flew two of the aeroplanes into the World Trade Centre, in New York City, one

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:04.795
into the Pentagon in Washington D.C and another crashed into a field in Pennsylvania.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:11.905
The intended destination of the fourth aeroplane is unknown but theories include

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:18.065
the US Capitol Building or a nuclear power plant located on the east coast.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:25.475
Almost 3,000 people died in the attacks, and about 6,000 more were injured.

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:29.435
It was the deadliest attack the United States had

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:33.435
ever seen on its own borders, and shocked the nation.

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:42.025
Even before the dust had settled, questions were being asked about how such an attack was possible.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:46.695
How had the attackers managed to hijack the planes?

00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:49.265
How had they been let into the country?

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:51.695
How had it all been possible?

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:58.386
Then, less than a month after the attack, the United States invaded Afghanistan.

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:05.046
And in March of 2003, a year and a half later, Iraq, an oil-rich

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:09.506
country completely unconnected to the attacks, became its next target.

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:15.816
Deep in the corners of internet chat rooms and online communities, there

00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:21.382
was increasing scepticism about what actually happened on September 11th.

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:27.636
People didn’t trust that the US government was telling the truth, and the fact that

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:33.666
the country had now entered into a costly war in the Middle East seemed suspicious.

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:41.288
Even as early as 2002 there were marches, protests in the United States claiming

00:03:41.398 --> 00:03:46.598
that George Bush and senior members of the US government had orchestrated

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:52.698
the Twin Towers attacks, and that 9/11 was what’s called an “inside job”.

00:03:54.038 --> 00:04:01.643
This movement became known as the “9/11 Truth Movement”, with its followers called “Truthers”.

00:04:02.578 --> 00:04:08.288
But at least for the first few years after 9/11, it was very much a

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:14.178
fringe movement, contained in Internet forums and online communities.

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:22.308
Then, in 2003, this movement was given a shot of adrenaline, it was given a

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:29.508
huge boost and brought into the public eye in an unlikely sequence of events.

00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:37.408
Dylan Avery was only 18 years old at the time, and had hopes of becoming a filmmaker.

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:42.518
He had an idea for a movie, which involved a group of

00:04:42.518 --> 00:04:47.088
friends who discovered evidence that 9/11 was an inside job.

00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:54.698
The film was to be completely fictional, and it does sound like quite a good story for a movie.

00:04:55.738 --> 00:05:01.958
But as Avery was researching 9/11, he started to discover what he

00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:07.008
believed was evidence showing that there was some kind of cover up.

00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:14.508
Hour after hour of research took him further and further down the Internet rabbit hole, and he

00:05:14.508 --> 00:05:21.718
became completely caught up in the idea that there had been a conspiracy to blow up the Twin Towers.

00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:29.808
For Avery, there were too many unanswered questions, so he scrapped the project

00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:35.518
to create a fictional movie, and started his own documentary about 9/11.

00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:39.758
The film was super low budget.

00:05:39.888 --> 00:05:46.758
It only cost $2,000 to make, and it was primarily produced on Avery’s laptop.

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:52.788
He spent about two years collecting and editing the information, and

00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:58.618
recording his own narration, his own voice, to the clips in the movie.

00:06:00.108 --> 00:06:04.028
The clips are mainly video clips from the day of the

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:08.688
attack, and clips from news outlets reporting on 9/11.

00:06:10.318 --> 00:06:18.058
The film was released for free through the file sharing service Bittorrent in April of 2005.

00:06:18.648 --> 00:06:22.328
It was an immediate hit, an immediate success.

00:06:22.868 --> 00:06:27.288
In the first year the film was watched by 2 million people worldwide.

00:06:27.848 --> 00:06:33.448
Now, that might not sound like a lot nowadays, when YouTubers have tens or even

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:40.558
hundreds of millions of subscribers, but let’s not forget that in April of 2005 Facebook

00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:46.108
was only a year old and YouTube had only been launched in February of that year.

00:06:46.827 --> 00:06:54.078
2 million views was a huge amount, and it really turned the 9/11 Truth Movement from

00:06:54.308 --> 00:07:00.558
something that was restricted to internet forums to something that was in the public eye.

00:07:02.138 --> 00:07:11.028
Avery went on to make three more versions of the film between 2005 and 2009, each one adding

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:17.678
supposedly new information that had come to light, and also improving the production quality.

00:07:18.868 --> 00:07:24.768
There were several reasons that this film, or series of films, became so influential.

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:31.378
Firstly, it was that they compiled all of the conspiracy theories, all of the

00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:38.218
questions on the internet, and made them accessible in one quite watchable movie.

00:07:39.803 --> 00:07:45.518
Secondly, the story of the creation of the documentary was attractive.

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:49.028
Boy has an idea for a mystery film.

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:55.318
Boy starts investigating the mystery and discovers a huge conspiracy involving the US government.

00:07:55.518 --> 00:08:00.718
Boy continues to release new films that reveal more and more of the truth.

00:08:01.488 --> 00:08:04.928
You have to admit, it does sound like an exciting story.

00:08:05.988 --> 00:08:11.528
And thirdly, the American public was increasingly receptive to

00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:16.408
conspiracy theories, and there was growing distrust in the US government.

00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:22.378
While only 10% of Americans said they believed in conspiracy

00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:30.328
theories in 2001, that number had almost quadrupled to 36% by 2005.

00:08:31.538 --> 00:08:36.898
The country was growing increasingly weary of the war in Iraq, President

00:08:36.908 --> 00:08:42.278
George Bush was increasingly unpopular, and the theory that there might be

00:08:42.278 --> 00:08:47.488
something that was being hidden from the public was alluring, it was attractive.

00:08:48.618 --> 00:08:53.938
As has become typical with succesful conspiracy theories, Loose

00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:58.728
Change didn’t aim to provide answers, but to ask questions.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:04.738
So, let’s dive in quickly to the key questions and areas of discussion

00:09:04.948 --> 00:09:09.258
in Loose Change, the “unanswered questions” posed by the film.

00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:13.583
You’re probably aware of some of these already, but

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:17.178
here are three of the main questions in the film.

00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:24.658
Firstly, Avery suggests that it’s suspicious the towers crashed to the ground so quickly.

00:09:25.228 --> 00:09:32.058
Avery suggests, but provides little evidence, that there was some kind of controlled demolition

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:38.838
- essentially explosives were placed in the towers and then detonated, in order to destroy the towers.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.840
Long story short, he says, it's unlikely that the planes could have

00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:47.798
actually caused the towers to fall down in the way that they did.

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:55.266
Secondly, Avery suggests that an aeroplane didn’t actually crash into the Pentagon.

00:09:55.726 --> 00:10:00.996
He points at evidence that the size of the hole where the aeroplane crashed was too

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:07.816
small for an aeroplane of that size, and that there wasn’t enough debris, enough rubbish

00:10:07.926 --> 00:10:13.356
from the plane crash to support a theory that an aeroplane actually crashed there.

00:10:14.866 --> 00:10:21.566
And he also suggests that Flight 93, the aeroplane where the passengers fought the

00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:27.806
hijackers and forced them to crash into a field in Pennsylvania, never actually crashed.

00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:32.446
He says that there’s evidence that passengers were let off a plane

00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:37.606
safely at another airport and brought into a research centre for NASA.

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:43.776
Now, these are just a few of the theories put across, but you get the idea.

00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:49.216
They are all seductive, they are attractive, and if you are the sort of person

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:54.666
that is already sceptical that the government is telling you the truth, and you

00:10:54.666 --> 00:11:00.446
don’t trust your elected officials, then it’s understandable if you might see all

00:11:00.446 --> 00:11:06.056
of this “evidence”–at least it was presented as evidence–and be drawn into it.

00:11:07.156 --> 00:11:11.206
The problem, though, is that most of the theories proposed by

00:11:11.226 --> 00:11:16.136
Avery have been debunked, they have been proved to be incorrect.

00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:23.096
This isn’t the time or the place to go through them one by one, but there are perfectly

00:11:23.106 --> 00:11:28.616
reasonable explanations to the key questions that Avery asked in the Loose Change films.

00:11:29.996 --> 00:11:36.886
But to the people swept up in the conspiracy, no explanation was reasonable enough.

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:43.346
You may already know about the idea of Cognitive Dissonance, or perhaps you

00:11:43.346 --> 00:11:49.136
listened to our episode last year about it, but part of this idea is that it’s

00:11:49.136 --> 00:11:54.856
a very natural human reaction to dislike feeling that you have been wrong.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:59.646
This is why, when someone decides that they believe

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:03.216
something, it’s often very hard to change their mind.

00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:09.336
And in the case of the 9/11 Truth Movement, no amount of

00:12:09.346 --> 00:12:13.266
facts could get in the way of what people wanted to believe.

00:12:14.516 --> 00:12:18.096
It got even got more extreme, and the Truther Movement

00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:22.376
grew in ways that Avery could never have been expecting.

00:12:23.556 --> 00:12:28.246
Because some of the arguments in his Loose Change movie were so

00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:33.206
easily debunked, there were people within the 9/11 Truth Movement who

00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:40.086
believed that he, Avery, was an agent in a CIA disinformation campaign.

00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:46.546
They believed that the Loose Change conspiracy theory documentary was a clever

00:12:46.606 --> 00:12:53.666
idea by the CIA, essentially by the US government, to try to discredit the

00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:59.206
conspiracy theory movement by creating an easily disproved conspiracy theory.

00:13:00.286 --> 00:13:05.136
Avery had unleashed something bigger and more powerful than he had

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:09.786
imagined, and once it was out of the box he had no control over it.

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:17.596
It was, in many ways, the original conspiracy theory video, and for many people

00:13:17.706 --> 00:13:25.126
it served as a gateway drug, a first step, to other seductive conspiracy theories.

00:13:25.896 --> 00:13:31.726
People would first start being introduced to Loose Change, then go down

00:13:31.726 --> 00:13:37.526
the Internet rabbit hole of conspiracy theories about JFK, about the moon

00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:42.546
landing, about the fact that the Earth was flat, and all sorts of others.

00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:49.936
And while the first Loose Change might have been released in a world that was relatively

00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:58.136
free from social media, as platforms such as YouTube and Facebook grew, their algorithms

00:13:58.216 --> 00:14:04.636
helped spread and introduce new conspiracy theories to an ever greater number of people.

00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:12.021
If you spend much time on YouTube, you will know that their suggested videos often contain

00:14:12.376 --> 00:14:18.146
just the kind of thing that you’d like, and if you liked a conspiracy theory about 9/11,

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:23.496
well the algorithm knows you’ll probably like a conspiracy theory about something else.

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:26.766
But coming back to Loose Change.

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:31.986
What this documentary did is help accustom people to the idea

00:14:32.216 --> 00:14:36.266
that there can be no trust while there are unanswered questions.

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:42.956
Loose Change doesn’t try to say “this is what happened and this is who ordered

00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:49.726
the 9/11 attacks and why”, but instead cleverly simply asks questions, and

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:55.586
presents the idea that the answers are inadequate, the answers are not enough.

00:14:56.586 --> 00:15:01.796
Of course, there is nothing wrong with asking questions per se - questions are

00:15:01.806 --> 00:15:07.812
healthy and if there are no answers then it is completely justified to be sceptical.

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:14.606
The problem is that the Loose Change films are very easily debunked, but if

00:15:14.616 --> 00:15:20.486
you watch them then it’s so easy to get caught up in the conspiracy theory that

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:24.446
even when you’re presented with the evidence, you don’t want to believe it.

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:31.936
And, although the films are now a little dated, they seem a little old, and there are

00:15:31.936 --> 00:15:38.066
newer and more seductive conspiracy theories–Climate Change, COVID vaccines or stolen US

00:15:38.096 --> 00:15:43.546
elections, for example– these Loose change films have reached tens of millions of people.

00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:50.376
It’s hard to know just how many people have seen them, because the films have been distributed

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:59.326
via file sharing services, but even in 2013 it was estimated that they had been downloaded more

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:05.696
than 50 million times, so that’s twenty percent of the adult population in the United States.

00:16:06.286 --> 00:16:12.446
And that number was from 9 years ago, so of course it’s likely a lot higher today.

00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:19.576
It was, for many, the gateway to the idea that all-powerful people are

00:16:19.576 --> 00:16:24.256
distorting reality and tricking the public for their personal gain.

00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:30.006
These theories, as we all know, can be very seductive.

00:16:30.516 --> 00:16:34.756
There’s something amazing in thinking that you have discovered something

00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:39.366
that most of the rest of the population aren’t smart enough to see, and

00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:44.066
when you discover this you want to share it with as many people as possible.

00:16:45.116 --> 00:16:49.816
And that is exactly how 18-year-old Dylan Avery must

00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:53.406
have felt when he first started “doing his own research”.

00:16:53.826 --> 00:17:01.796
He went from website to website, discovering new evidence, and realising, or at least he thought he

00:17:01.796 --> 00:17:08.546
had realised, that there was some huge conspiracy to defraud the most powerful country in the world.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.766
He got caught up in the movie that he was trying to make, he

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:16.956
became the lead character in his own fictional screenplay.

00:17:17.656 --> 00:17:24.346
Apart from for him, it was no longer fiction, it was true, he was the person who had

00:17:24.346 --> 00:17:30.176
discovered this conspiracy, and it was now his job to reveal the truth to the world.

00:17:31.466 --> 00:17:35.036
Little did he know quite what he had unleashed.

00:17:37.076 --> 00:17:44.636
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Loose Change: The Cult 9/11 Conspiracy Theory Movie.

00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:48.766
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:49.446 --> 00:17:52.906
Of course, if you are interested in the movie, or this

00:17:52.936 --> 00:17:56.226
series of movies, then they are all available online.

00:17:56.676 --> 00:18:00.196
I’m not recommending you go down this conspiracy theory

00:18:00.206 --> 00:18:03.356
rabbit hole, but they do exist if you want to check them out.

00:18:04.196 --> 00:18:07.446
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:09.606
Have you heard of this movie before?

00:18:09.836 --> 00:18:11.066
Have you seen it?

00:18:11.376 --> 00:18:16.176
What do you think is so seductive about the 9/11 conspiracy theory?

00:18:16.426 --> 00:18:21.676
And how do you think it affected our idea of trust in authority?

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:23.606
I would love to know.

00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:26.716

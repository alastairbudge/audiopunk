Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.129
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:21.509
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.789
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Alger Hiss.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.619
He was an American, Harvard educated government lawyer who

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.969
represented the United States on the international stage.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.819
A man directly involved in the creation of the United Nations, one who

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.959
witnessed first hand the allied leaders drawing up the map of post-war Europe.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.499
But he was also a man who, after the war, would be accused of spying against the

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.299
country he pledged to love, accused of being the worst thing he could possibly be….

00:00:58.732 --> 00:00:59.682
A communist.

00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:06.081
So, let’s get into it and talk about Alger Hiss, the man who reached the upper

00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:12.331
echelons of American politics, only to be accused of spying for the USSR.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.461
The marble columned hall was cramped and stuffy.

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.631
The lights were glaring.

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:26.421
Journalists in long coats and hats prowled the perimeter of the room,

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:32.301
and hundreds of people were crammed in, the air thick with anticipation.

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:36.891
Over in the middle of the room, two men leaned forward,

00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:42.001
surrounded by lawyers, their desks stuffed full with microphones.

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:47.981
“One of you is lying!” came the voice of Congressman Herbert.

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:52.441
Mumbles and whispers echoed around the room.

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:58.511
A man put a handkerchief to his forehead, sweat glistening in the light.

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:06.791
His name was Alger Hiss, the American government official accused of being a communist spy.

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:14.631
So, who was this man, and what path led him to that stuffy courtroom in 1948?

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:22.421
Alger Hiss was born on the 11th of November, 1904, in Baltimore, in Maryland.

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:28.271
Both of his parents came from wealthy and well-known Baltimore families.

00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:34.011
His great-great-grandfather had emigrated from Germany all the way

00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:40.151
back in 1729, changing the family name from "Hesse" to "Hiss" when he

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:45.411
arrived, but that was pretty much the only non-American family link.

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:49.661
Alger Hiss was about as American as it got.

00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:57.431
After doing well at high school, where he was a popular student, Hiss attended the prestigious

00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:03.961
John Hopkins University and then went on to be a star student at Harvard Law School.

00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:10.201
At Harvard he was taught by the future Supreme Court Justice Felix

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:16.781
Frankfurter, and upon his graduation in 1929, Frankfurter recommended that

00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:22.731
Hiss become private secretary to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.841
This was, of course, a huge honour for any law student and budding

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:33.421
lawyer, and Holmes would have a profound influence on his young secretary.

00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:40.161
A year later, in 1930, Hiss joined a prestigious Boston law firm but the

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:45.151
following year the family made another move, this time to New York, where

00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.801
his wife, Priscilla, wrote a book and Hiss found work at another law firm.

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:57.211
He stayed with this law firm until 1933, when he received a telegram from his old

00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:03.701
Harvard tutor Frankfurter, saying, rather dramatically, that the country needed him.

00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:10.631
This time Frankfurter suggested that Hiss join Democratic President Franklin D.

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.311
Roosevelt’s New Deal administration as an attorney, as a lawyer.

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:21.421
The New Deal was, as you may know, the 1930s mammoth

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.721
expansion of government activity and expenditure.

00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:30.461
It was created in response to the Great Depression and many of its policy ideas,

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:36.891
ambitious though they were, were unprecedented, nobody had done anything like this before.

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:44.631
As a result, New Deal legislation was attacked by conservatives, and Hiss

00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:49.941
specialised in defending the constitutionality of the new reforms in court.

00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:56.201
In 1939, Hiss was made assistant to Stanley Hornbeck, the

00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:59.931
State Department’s Political Adviser for Far Eastern Affairs.

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:05.691
Then a few years later, in 1944, Hiss focused his efforts

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:10.011
on preparing for peace as the Second World War ended.

00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:16.761
In what he probably imagined would be the defining moment of his life and career,

00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:21.341
he was made deputy director of the Department’s Office of Special Political

00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:27.051
Affairs and actually worked on proposals for the makeup of the United Nations.

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.991
Later that year, he was Secretary General of the

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:33.961
Dumbarton Oaks Conference, which put together the U.N.

00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:40.621
Charter, and in 1945 he served at the Yalta Conference where the victorious allied leaders

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:46.241
Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin chopped up Europe and laid the foundations of the Cold War.

00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:50.761
Hiss was also the chief adviser to the United States delegation

00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:55.321
at the first ever meeting of the UN General Assembly in 1946.

00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:58.931
He then became president of the Carnegie Endowment for

00:05:58.951 --> 00:06:02.781
International Peace, a position he held until 1949.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:07.561
Now, if you haven’t followed all of these details, that’s OK.

00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:14.061
The point to underline is that, by his mid-forties, Hiss had established

00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:20.861
himself not only as a successful lawyer, but as a public American patriot.

00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:29.211
He’d studied at Harvard under future Supreme Court Justices; he’d defended the constitutionality

00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:34.421
of some of the most groundbreaking government reforms in American history; he’d helped

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:41.301
found the U.N; served as a delegate to the U.N’s inaugural General Assembly; and witnessed

00:06:41.491 --> 00:06:47.391
history as the leaders of the allied powers drew up a new age from the ruins of Europe.

00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:53.041
So, how could someone with such a stellar CV end up

00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:57.221
being accused of spying for the country’s greatest enemy?

00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:04.501
Well, in 1939, a man called Whittaker Chambers, a former Communist who had

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:10.191
become disillusioned with the party, confessed to the US government his former

00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:15.731
communist affiliation and activities - including the names of his associates.

00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:23.301
Understandably, at the time, in 1939, the Americans were more concerned

00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:27.721
about the pressing threat of Nazi Germany and less so the Soviets.

00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:33.691
But one of the men that Chambers claimed was a former Communist associate

00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:39.741
of his was Hiss, who, back then in the late 1930s, was a respected

00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:43.571
government lawyer building powerful connections on the Supreme Court.

00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:50.561
Initially, the accusation was ignored, and it wasn’t public knowledge,

00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:55.151
so Hiss retained his support among the upper echelons of government.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:01.471
With the Americans so preoccupied by war in Europe, and focusing most of

00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:06.291
their efforts towards fighting the Germans and Japanese, Hiss continued

00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:11.171
to climb and, a few years later, was representing the U.S abroad.

00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:18.151
But when the war ended, the focus turned to the lurking threat, Communism.

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:25.461
And it was here that the allegations about our friend Hiss’ past come back to haunt him.

00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:34.181
Specifically, on the 3rd of August, 1948, Chambers voluntarily gave evidence

00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:38.961
before the House of Un-American Activities Committee - known as HUAC.

00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:44.231
HUAC was a group of senators that investigated communist

00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:48.511
activity in the U.S and were fiercely anti-communist.

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:54.941
One HUAC committee member who played a very public role in the hearings was a man

00:08:55.081 --> 00:09:00.721
by the name of Richard Nixon, a first-term Republican Congressman from California.

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:05.271
Nixon would, of course, go on to The White House, and

00:09:05.271 --> 00:09:08.661
then be mired in controversy after the Watergate Scandal.

00:09:09.414 --> 00:09:15.334
If you haven’t done so already, you can learn more about the Watergate scandal in episode 283.

00:09:16.374 --> 00:09:18.394
Anyway, back to the main story.

00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:24.484
Nixon’s role in the HUAC hearings put him in the public spotlight, thrust him

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:30.044
into national prominence and proved his fierce anti-communist credentials.

00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:37.614
At HUAC, Chambers claimed that during the 1930s he had worked as a courier for

00:09:37.614 --> 00:09:42.854
an underground Communist organisation in Washington D.C known as the Ware Group.

00:09:43.954 --> 00:09:48.184
And he named Alger Hiss as a man he had dealt with.

00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:55.424
Chambers claimed he first met Hiss in the summer of 1934 in a Washington restaurant.

00:09:56.564 --> 00:10:01.444
They were introduced, Chambers said, by a man referred to as J.

00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:08.734
Peters - someone Chambers claimed was the head of a Communist spy ring working in the United States.

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:15.854
Chambers even claimed that Hiss knew him by his communist party name, Carl.

00:10:17.144 --> 00:10:22.494
Chambers, who had become a determined anti-Communist after leaving the Communist

00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:29.334
Party in 1938, claimed that the organisation’s objective in the 1930s was

00:10:29.334 --> 00:10:35.684
to embed communists - or communist sympathisers - in the U.S government.

00:10:36.644 --> 00:10:39.924
One such man, he said, was Hiss.

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:45.994
Hiss was called to HUAC the next day, on August the 4th, and

00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:51.044
when shown a picture of Chambers he claimed not to know him.

00:10:51.994 --> 00:10:56.364
Testifying under oath, Hiss denied that he had ever been a Communist

00:10:56.394 --> 00:11:00.674
or that he had known or even met anyone called Whittaker Chambers.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:07.964
When they were finally face to face on August the 17th, however, Hiss recognised

00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:15.244
Chambers but swore he knew him as George Crosley, a writer Hiss had known in the 1930s.

00:11:16.494 --> 00:11:18.984
So, who was telling the truth?

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:24.434
Well, in order to find out, the HUAC committee decided to put

00:11:24.444 --> 00:11:29.334
the men - and their versions of events - up against one another.

00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:36.434
With 500 people in the crowd, Hiss and Chambers had a dramatic courtroom

00:11:36.464 --> 00:11:40.894
battle and gave very different versions of their past encounters.

00:11:41.984 --> 00:11:47.144
Hiss claimed that Chambers, or Crosley, as he said he knew him, introduced

00:11:47.144 --> 00:11:50.934
himself when looking for information for an article he was writing.

00:11:52.014 --> 00:11:58.954
He even sublet an apartment to Chambers, Hiss swore, lent him money and gave him an old car.

00:12:00.514 --> 00:12:04.934
Chambers, on the other hand, said Hiss gifted the car to

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:08.534
the Communist Party to help with their underground work.

00:12:09.574 --> 00:12:14.324
Hiss had been, Chambers claimed, his closest friend in the Communist party.

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:20.224
He also revealed details of Hiss' private life that suggested he could

00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:24.514
have had a personal relationship with the government lawyer, a relationship

00:12:24.704 --> 00:12:28.694
much closer than you might have with a passing business acquaintance.

00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:36.751
He told the committee, for example, that Hiss and his wife were enthusiastic birdwatchers,

00:12:37.374 --> 00:12:43.744
and that Hiss had once bragged to him about seeing a particularly rare type of bird.

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:48.394
Now, that might seem like a small detail in the grand scheme

00:12:48.394 --> 00:12:53.234
of things, but this rare bird was actually used against Hiss.

00:12:54.414 --> 00:12:59.914
Donald Wheeler, a HUAC member, came up with a plan, a ruse, to

00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:04.144
casually ask Hiss about his hobbies during a pause in proceedings.

00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:10.144
When he was asked about this, Hiss confirmed that he had seen the

00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:15.984
bird and, in so doing, unknowingly corroborated Chambers' claim.

00:13:16.954 --> 00:13:21.964
This was leaked to the press, and seemed to HUAC and many members

00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:25.014
of the public to be the proof that they had been looking for.

00:13:26.274 --> 00:13:31.484
In response, Hiss demanded that Chambers make his claims outside the

00:13:31.484 --> 00:13:35.973
courtroom, where he wasn’t protected against accusations of slander.

00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:41.371
Then, a few days later, when giving a radio interview on August 30th,

00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:47.531
Chambers swore that ''Alger Hiss was a Communist and may be now.''

00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:55.701
Because Chambers made the accusations publically, as a prominent lawyer, Hiss had few options

00:13:55.941 --> 00:14:02.111
other than to sue him for slander, the crime of making a false public statement about someone.

00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:07.701
He did so, and demanded $75,000 in damages.

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:13.911
But instead of putting the issue to bed, as Hiss might have hoped, at

00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:18.911
a deposition during the trial Chambers intensified his allegations.

00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:23.621
He directly accused Hiss of spying, and of giving

00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:26.511
him State Department documents to be sent to Moscow.

00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:31.881
He brought notes in Hiss's handwriting and dozens of pages of State

00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:37.601
Department documents that were, he claimed, retyped by Hiss’s wife, Priscilla.

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:45.501
Then, in perhaps the most famous episode of the trial, Chambers took Federal agents to

00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:52.451
his Maryland farm to reveal the so-called ‘pumpkin papers’, undeveloped rolls of film

00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:58.271
containing stolen State and Navy Department documents stuffed into a hollowed-out pumpkin.

00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:03.761
In total there were as many as 200 photographs of government documents.

00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:09.301
Hiss, of course, denied that he had stolen documents or given them to Chambers.

00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:14.361
With the grand jury gathering again in New York in December, Hiss

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:19.961
was put on trial not for espionage, for spying, but for perjury,

00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:24.331
because the statute of limitations for espionage had expired.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:29.731
Essentially, the statute of limitations is when someone cannot be punished

00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:34.401
for a crime because a certain amount of time has elapsed, has passed.

00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:43.211
The indictment, this accusation, was that Hiss had perjured himself twice - by lying about

00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:49.621
giving documents to Chambers, and by lying about seeing him after January 1st, of 1937.

00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:57.051
At the first perjury trial in 1949, the result was a hung jury, a

00:15:57.211 --> 00:16:01.143
jury that cannot decide whether the accused is innocent or guilty.

00:16:01.943 --> 00:16:03.563
So, there was a retrial.

00:16:04.903 --> 00:16:11.393
Crucially, at the second trial, which began in November of 1949, a lady called

00:16:11.423 --> 00:16:16.503
Hede Massing, whose testimony was not heard in the first trial or at the HUAC

00:16:16.513 --> 00:16:24.243
hearings, confessed to being a Soviet agent and that Hiss had been Communist in 1935.

00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:32.363
As a result, on January the 21st, 1950, Hiss, the former star

00:16:32.453 --> 00:16:38.163
government lawyer, was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.

00:16:39.643 --> 00:16:45.233
He would serve three years of his five-year sentence, before being released in 1954.

00:16:46.203 --> 00:16:53.123
He still maintained his innocence, but left prison jobless and banned from practising law.

00:16:53.953 --> 00:16:58.373
His government pension was initially denied, and Hiss and

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:02.453
his wife Priscilla separated a few years later in 1959.

00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:07.803
After a few years, Hiss began work selling stationery.

00:17:08.257 --> 00:17:11.703
It was quite the fall from grace for a man who had

00:17:11.703 --> 00:17:14.993
made and witnessed history on the international stage.

00:17:15.983 --> 00:17:22.773
But with time, the suspicions and scrutiny about Hiss' life began to wane.

00:17:23.963 --> 00:17:30.413
In 1967, when The New School for Social Research in New York asked Hiss to

00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:34.803
give lectures on the New Deal, it received just one angry telephone call.

00:17:35.673 --> 00:17:41.533
And he clearly attracted quite a crowd, with five hundred people turning up for his first lecture.

00:17:42.623 --> 00:17:48.413
Hiss spent the following years filing appeals in court and trying to clear his name.

00:17:48.793 --> 00:17:51.623
He was desperate to recover his reputation.

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:56.333
Although he was never convicted of espionage, of

00:17:56.493 --> 00:18:00.613
spying, the court of public opinion had all but decided.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:08.753
For many, Hiss was the name and face most associated with Soviet spying from the Cold War era.

00:18:09.593 --> 00:18:15.463
In 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he even asked Russian

00:18:15.493 --> 00:18:20.823
officials to search the Soviet archives for information related to his case.

00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:27.793
A man called General Dmitri Volkogonov, a historian and the chairman of

00:18:27.793 --> 00:18:32.163
the Russian military intelligence archives, claimed that a search had

00:18:32.163 --> 00:18:36.823
found no evidence that Hiss had been involved in any Soviet spy ring.

00:18:37.893 --> 00:18:43.883
This was inconclusive, of course, as even if Hiss had been a Soviet spy it’s

00:18:44.143 --> 00:18:49.463
unlikely that the Russians would have admitted it, and Volkogonov’s search did

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:54.073
not include Soviet military intelligence files, which might have held the answer.

00:18:55.283 --> 00:18:59.133
Over forty years later, the mystery was still unsolved.

00:18:59.713 --> 00:19:05.283
If Hiss had indeed been a Soviet spy, he was keeping his cards close to

00:19:05.283 --> 00:19:09.413
his chest, he wasn’t spilling the beans, he wasn’t going to reveal it.

00:19:10.103 --> 00:19:11.703
And he never would.

00:19:12.763 --> 00:19:19.173
On November the 15th, 1996, just days after his 92nd birthday, Hiss

00:19:19.553 --> 00:19:24.663
died, taking his secret, or at least “the truth”, to the grave with him.

00:19:25.603 --> 00:19:29.343
He had denied any accusations of espionage, and fought

00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:32.763
against his perjury conviction, until the very end.

00:19:34.253 --> 00:19:38.513
Now, the answer you’re probably waiting for, was he or wasn’t he?

00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:44.593
Historians have continued their trawling through Soviet records ever since Hiss

00:19:44.593 --> 00:19:50.563
died, but no definitive answer has ever been given to the question of Hiss’ guilt.

00:19:51.593 --> 00:19:56.923
Most experts seem to think that he probably was a spy, or was at the

00:19:56.923 --> 00:20:01.383
very least involved with people with communist sympathies in the 1930s.

00:20:02.533 --> 00:20:08.293
The only real truth of the bizarre Alger Hiss case, besides that the truth

00:20:08.293 --> 00:20:13.993
will probably never be known, is that Hiss’ trial paved the way for the rabid

00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:20.203
anti-communist sentiment that dominated American society in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:20:21.044 --> 00:20:23.764
There may not have been the McCarthyite movement in

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:26.894
the United States were it not for Hiss and his trial.

00:20:27.317 --> 00:20:32.674
That he was eventually convicted for perjury and not espionage was besides

00:20:32.694 --> 00:20:38.244
the point - in the mind of many Americans, Hiss was a Soviet spy and his

00:20:38.244 --> 00:20:43.134
trial played into their paranoid fantasies about Soviet infiltration.

00:20:44.124 --> 00:20:51.434
As the historian Allen Weinsten wrote in 1978, ''Alger Hiss' conviction gave McCarthy

00:20:51.504 --> 00:20:57.294
and his supporters the essential touch of credibility, making their charges of Communist

00:20:57.294 --> 00:21:02.884
involvement against other officials headline copy instead of back-page filler.”

00:21:04.224 --> 00:21:10.204
In other words, the legacy of Alger Hiss, whether or not he really was a spy, was to

00:21:10.204 --> 00:21:17.094
put America on high alert and contribute to a deep fear of socialists hiding within

00:21:17.094 --> 00:21:24.044
the ranks of the US government, a fear that, for some, persists even to this very day.

00:21:26.644 --> 00:21:33.944
OK then, that’s it for today’s episode on Alger Hiss, the high-flying Harvard man and government

00:21:33.964 --> 00:21:40.104
lawyer who was brought down to earth - and to prison - amid accusations of being a Soviet spy.

00:21:40.944 --> 00:21:45.244
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Hiss and his life before,

00:21:45.494 --> 00:21:50.204
or this was the first time you’d even heard his name, well I hope you learned something new.

00:21:50.904 --> 00:21:54.364
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:54.794 --> 00:21:57.264
Do you think Hiss really was a Soviet spy?

00:21:57.674 --> 00:21:59.824
What about a communist sympathiser?

00:22:00.354 --> 00:22:06.344
Do you know of any other famous double agents - accused or otherwise - from the Cold War period?

00:22:06.794 --> 00:22:10.354
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

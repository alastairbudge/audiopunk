Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.050
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.180
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our Scottish mini-series,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.330
where we are going to learn about the time that Donald Trump decided

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.430
that he wanted to build a golf course in the north of Scotland.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.610
It’s a fun story, of David vs Goliath, and touches on Scottish culture,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.070
resilience, humour, and how money isn’t the solution to everything.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.410
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.020
Say what you like about Donald Trump, he is a rich and powerful man.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.535
And like most rich and powerful men, he is used to getting his way.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.810
People do what he asks them to, or if they do not initially want to do what he asks, he is able to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.890
take out his wallet and pay them, or else harass and threaten them, until they change their mind.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.530
Whether we are talking about New York City property deals, negotiating with foreign leaders

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.480
or battling the US justice system, he has plenty of experience “winning”, as he would put it.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.410
So, when he decided to purchase a plot of land in the north east of Scotland, with a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.430
view to building a golf resort, he no doubt thought this would be a simple endeavour.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.890
In 2006, it was announced that the American real

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.210
estate mogul had bought the Menie Estate in Aberdeen.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.770
It was a 1,400 acre estate, around 5 kilometres squared.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.960
But it was not exactly a prime location.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.560
It is 20 km north of Aberdeen, three hours away from Edinburgh, not particularly easy to get to.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.480
And the north east coast of Scotland is beautiful, but it is a harsh climate.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.660
It’s windy and cold, and lacks the idyllic islands,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.180
mountains and hidden bays of Scotland’s west coast.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.350
It was an unusual place for Trump to buy, but he had big plans.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.210
As you may know, his mother was Scottish, he embraced this Scottish heritage of his, and he

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.910
wanted to create a premier Scottish golf course, with his name plastered all over it of course.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.910
When it was first announced, there was excitement and broad support from the public.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.470
After all, it was not a particularly economically vibrant area.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.510
The main industry was the offshore oil industry, but

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.940
there wasn’t a huge amount else apart from agriculture.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.580
Land was cheap, and jobs were not exactly in abundance.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.290
And here he was, an American billionaire and then reality TV personality who was pledging

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.710
to invest hundreds of millions and create thousands of local jobs, 6,000 to be precise.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.310
What was there not to like?

00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:28.420
But soon enough, it became clear that things were somewhat more complicated.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.950
For starters, the area was unusual from an environmental point of view.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.260
A large part of the estate consisted of sand dunes, which moved along with the winds and the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.770
seasons, and this was exactly where Trump revealed he wanted to put his signature course.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.870
A bunch of moving sand dunes would clearly not make things easy for a golf

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.720
course, and Trump’s plans included levelling many of these, smoothing them

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.190
out and removing the wildest parts not to get in the way of the golf course.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.180
It needed to be pristine, immaculate, meeting the visual standards

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.170
that Trump had got used to at his other properties all over the world.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.810
Eventually, with the help of the then Scottish Prime Minister, Alex

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.610
Salmond, he managed to get planning permission to build the golf course,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.450
so within the estate itself, on his land, he could control everything.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.360
But what he couldn’t control was what his future guests would see beyond the borders of the estate.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.550
On one side was the sea, and on the other, well, there were a few

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.360
properties that didn’t quite meet Donald Trump’s aesthetic standards.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.730
One such property belonged to a man called Michael Forbes, a local man who had been

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.810
happily living in his small cottage for 40 years before Donald Trump turned up.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.430
Unlike Donald Trump, Michael Forbes was not a rich man in terms of cash in

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.350
the bank, but he was the richest man in the world in terms of where he lived.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.680
He loved his cottage and the view of the sea, the rugged nature, the peace, and the quiet.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:27.390
His house was small and basic, and outside he kept bits of old tractors and farm machinery.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.100
He had every right to do this, of course, it was his

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.280
land, his property, and he was causing harm to nobody.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.750
But Donald Trump didn’t like it.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.920
Or to be precise, he didn’t like looking at it.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.540
He made Forbes an offer for his property, but Forbes refused.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.350
Trump came back and made another offer.

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:54.360
Forbes refused again.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.840
The offers rose to £450,000, over half a million Euros, but Forbes said no.

00:06:04.415 --> 00:06:07.806
I’m not budging, your money isn’t going to work with me.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:14.196
When the carrot didn’t work, Trump turned to the stick.

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:16.146
He did what he always does.

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:21.816
He took to the media to sling mud, to insult Michael Forbes.

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:26.036
He called him a man that Scotland should not be proud of,

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:30.396
called his property a pigsty, saying that it was disgusting.

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:36.116
And when the words didn’t work, things turned nastier.

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:40.526
He sneakily did something that he had promised not to do.

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:44.996
He contacted the local government for something called a “compulsory

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:49.576
purchase order”, which means that an individual is legally obliged

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:53.916
to sell their property if there is a strong public reason to do so.

00:06:55.656 --> 00:07:00.076
These are typically used if the government wants to build a road or bridge

00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:04.826
or some kind of important public good, and there is no viable alternative.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:10.916
But Trump thought that his golf course also fell into this category.

00:07:12.066 --> 00:07:18.006
In other words, he wanted the Scottish government to force Michael Forbes to sell his house.

00:07:19.696 --> 00:07:27.146
Fortunately, this request was rejected, but Trump then turned to intimidation and tricks.

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:32.626
He sent around a member of his team pretending to be someone unrelated to the

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:37.116
Trump organisation, someone who was simply looking to buy a holiday home in the

00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:42.996
region, but the locals soon realised that this man wasn’t who he said he was.

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:49.856
The locals came together, a group of 5 or so homeowners that Trump was trying to kick

00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:56.286
out, Michael Forbes and others, and swore not to sell their properties to the American.

00:07:57.876 --> 00:08:03.906
As these properties were bordering on Trump’s new estate, he took to intimidation, and moved

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:09.726
the ground to create large walls of earth and grass, essentially blocking the residents in.

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:15.036
They used to have lovely clear views of the sea and the dunes,

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:19.726
but Trump created grassy walls to surround them and block them in.

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:26.946
In one case, he even sent a $3,500 bill to one of the residents

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:30.756
to pay for a fence that Trump had built around their house.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:36.746
And at several points the construction of the golf course “accidentally”

00:08:36.846 --> 00:08:40.966
cut off the electricity and water supply to the stubborn residents.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.836
But still, they refused to sell.

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:49.426
All while this was going on, construction was underway for the golf course.

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:54.756
Trump had promised two world class golf courses and a collection of

00:08:54.756 --> 00:08:59.326
houses and cottages, many of them affordable to locals, promising to

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:03.586
inject hundreds of millions of pounds into the investment-starved region.

00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:10.836
But when he got started, there were no signs of the houses and only one golf course.

00:09:12.316 --> 00:09:17.406
The golf course was completed in 2012, and opened for business that year.

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:23.476
It was a large loss maker, unprofitable and losing money every year.

00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:30.326
And still there were no signs of this further investment that Trump had promised, and had

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:34.586
been instrumental for Trump getting the planning permission from the local government.

00:09:36.236 --> 00:09:43.206
It turned out that there were other plans that Trump didn’t like, this time plans at sea.

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:49.946
The Scottish government was planning to build a wind farm in the North Sea, just a few

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:54.696
kilometres away from the piece of coastline where the new “Trump International” golf course was.

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:59.736
And as you may know, Trump does not like wind farms.

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:05.146
He publicly said that they were ugly and that they were dangerous for local birdlife.

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:09.426
He said that he would not make any further investments

00:10:09.436 --> 00:10:12.976
in the region until the government scrapped its plans.

00:10:13.786 --> 00:10:15.636
He was playing hardball.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:20.906
The self-declared master dealmaker knew that the Scottish government was

00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:25.886
keen to attract investment in the region, and that a golf course and large

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:29.558
building project would generate hundreds, perhaps thousands, of jobs.

00:10:30.138 --> 00:10:34.838
But it also did not want to be seen as caving to anyone,

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:39.028
especially to this braggadocious American billionaire.

00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:45.916
Trump even went as far as taking the Scottish government to the Supreme Court in

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:51.266
London, claiming that this new wind farm would spoil the view from his course.

00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:56.416
But the Supreme Court ruled in the Scottish government’s favour.

00:10:57.666 --> 00:11:03.416
Construction of 11 large wind turbines went ahead, and Trump was forced to pay

00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:07.966
the quarter of a million Euros of legal costs incurred by the Scottish government.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:10.087
He was furious.

00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:13.577
He doesn’t like “losing”, he doesn’t like paying other people’s

00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:17.807
bills, and now he had a wind farm in front of his golf course.

00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:22.967
This all happened shortly before he became US president.

00:11:23.797 --> 00:11:27.387
But, as you will know, Trump did not exactly stop

00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:30.267
his business dealing when he took over as president.

00:11:31.487 --> 00:11:36.807
Through associates and his children, the intimidation campaign against the residents went on.

00:11:37.377 --> 00:11:40.567
But they continued to refuse his offers.

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:45.257
And then Trump submitted new plans to the Scottish government.

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:51.777
These included plans for the second promised golf course, but gone were the affordable

00:11:51.787 --> 00:11:57.227
houses, replaced by luxury houses and holiday homes costing millions of pounds.

00:11:59.107 --> 00:12:03.387
In the end, the local government agreed, contingent on Trump

00:12:03.427 --> 00:12:07.257
contributing to a fund for affordable houses and community projects.

00:12:08.637 --> 00:12:16.188
Trump agreed, and in fact, last year, in 2023, he did start work on the second golf course,

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:22.137
with the bulldozers coming in and shifting the sand dunes, making way for this new investment.

00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:27.737
Many local residents, understandably, are furious.

00:12:28.777 --> 00:12:35.917
The area used to be wild, a wonderful piece of untouched Scottish coastline with moving sand dunes.

00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:40.107
It was even a place of designated scientific interest.

00:12:41.487 --> 00:12:45.157
But now it has been replaced by Trump’s golf course.

00:12:45.927 --> 00:12:52.677
The dunes are all but gone, and the nearby residents wake to the sound of bulldozers and drills.

00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:58.167
And when the construction is complete, they will look out of their windows

00:12:58.407 --> 00:13:03.017
and see not the sea, but if they can see over the grassy walls that Trump

00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:07.137
has built around their properties, they will see the roofs of luxury homes.

00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:11.187
Trump has ruined the area, they say.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:16.737
He made large promises about how much money would flow into the region, but all that

00:13:16.737 --> 00:13:22.007
has been left are some unremarkable golf courses that are unaffordable to most locals.

00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:28.807
The price, if you are wondering, reaches £395 for a round

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:33.477
of golf in the summer, almost €500 just for a round of golf.

00:13:35.127 --> 00:13:38.667
Despite these high prices, the golf course remains

00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:42.697
loss making, unprofitable every year of its existence.

00:13:44.077 --> 00:13:47.287
And the construction of the course is far from the

00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:50.357
only golf-related scandal Trump is facing in Scotland.

00:13:51.117 --> 00:13:56.277
There have also been question marks over how he managed to come up with the cash to buy the land

00:13:56.287 --> 00:14:02.257
for this golf course, as well as a second golf course he purchased south of Glasgow in 2014.

00:14:03.227 --> 00:14:07.797
Members of the Scottish government have proposed what’s called an “unexplained wealth order”,

00:14:08.237 --> 00:14:13.807
asking where he got the cash to pay for the transactions, but so far these haven’t come to anything.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:19.707
And this still isn’t the end of the Scottish golf course-related legal troubles.

00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:24.047
It turns out that Trump had claimed that the property was worth

00:14:24.047 --> 00:14:28.037
more than it was when he was applying for a credit line from a bank.

00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:32.317
He had written that he had planning permission for 2,000

00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:36.747
houses, when in reality he only had permission for 500.

00:14:37.537 --> 00:14:42.837
It was fraud, essentially, but Mr Trump is no stranger to legal troubles.

00:14:43.157 --> 00:14:47.177
It was just one more legal issue to add to a lengthy list.

00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:50.867
So, where do things stand today?

00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:55.217
If you go to the north of Scotland this summer, you can play at the Trump

00:14:55.237 --> 00:15:00.577
International golf course, if you are prepared to pay the almost €500 fee that is.

00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:05.557
If you look out to sea, you will see a bunch of wind turbines.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:12.547
Perhaps you will find them an eyesore, terrible to look at and spoiling an otherwise beautiful view.

00:15:13.267 --> 00:15:14.747
Perhaps you won’t notice them.

00:15:15.377 --> 00:15:18.257
Perhaps you might even find them oddly attractive.

00:15:19.617 --> 00:15:24.277
Unless you hit your ball a long way off the fairway, you probably won’t

00:15:24.277 --> 00:15:28.957
see Michael Forbes’ house, the “pigsty”, as described by Donald Trump.

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:38.207
But if you do, you’ll see painted on his shed, “No Golf Course”, and even “No More Trump Lies”.

00:15:39.437 --> 00:15:43.747
You might even see him flying a Mexican flag, in solidarity

00:15:43.867 --> 00:15:46.837
with another neighbour that Donald Trump has been battling.

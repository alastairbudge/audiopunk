Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.040
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.170
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.550
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series on the theme of education.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.590
In case you missed them, part one was on the UK university crisis.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.100
Part two was on private tutoring and the decline of genius, and in part

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.790
three, today’s episode, we are going to talk about the future of education.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.780
In this episode, we’ll look into a crystal ball and talk about some

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.260
theories on what education will look like 10, 20, and 50 years from now.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.540
In case you hadn’t listened to it yet, I would recommend listening to part two before this

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.120
one, as we will talk about some of the ideas from the episode here, so now is the time

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.820
to press pause and go back and listen to that one in case you haven’t done so already.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.690
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.830
Throughout much of the twentieth century, there have been bold predictions

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.979
about new technologies or systems that would “revolutionise” education.

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:33.319
The invention and mass production of TVs was heralded as the start of a new educational revolution,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.639
where anyone, anywhere, could get access to the best possible teaching, right there on their screen.

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:48.309
In the 1960s there was a lot of talk about the idea of a teaching machine, with which students

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:54.649
could learn at their own pace and get personalised feedback from a specially programmed computer.

00:01:55.529 --> 00:02:01.229
Then there were correspondence courses, where people would receive new materials–textbooks,

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.389
videos and audio lectures–every week or fortnight, and they could learn at their own pace.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.789
There were new designs of schools, new ideas about learning styles, increased use of IQ testing.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:23.579
And with the mass-adoption of computers and later the Internet, many people believed that this would

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:30.859
be the real game-changer, allowing anyone, anywhere to access a modern-day library of Alexandria.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:38.129
And then came the MOOCs, the massive open online courses, where you could follow a Harvard

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.307
course on philosophy and then take a computer science course at the University of Oxford.

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:48.917
There was virtual reality, which was trumpeted as yet another tool that

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:53.727
would revolutionise education and have us all learning in the metaverse.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:59.532
None of these, I think it is perfectly fair to say, have had

00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:03.487
the revolutionary impact that many people thought they would.

00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:12.357
We humans are awful at predicting the future, and the future of education is clearly no exception.

00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:18.187
So, with that in mind, let’s talk about some of the most prominent

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:22.867
ideas today about what education will look like in the future.

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:27.607
I read a bunch of different reports on the subject, from

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:32.567
Google, the UN, Unesco, the World Economic Forum, and more.

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:38.499
As you might imagine, there is a lot written about the subject, as the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.509
education of the children of today is ultimately what will decide the future.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.129
There are a lot of buzzwords in all of these reports, a lot of talk

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:54.099
about synergy, best practices, personalisation, and student-led learning.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:02.029
And of course, every single one dedicates a sizable portion to AI, to artificial intelligence.

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:09.059
So, I will try to wade through the fluff, jargon and buzzwords and

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.949
talk about some of the more interesting themes of these reports.

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.344
The first key theme that’s particularly interesting, especially when thinking back

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:25.099
to the last episode and the importance of an inspiring private tutor, is that most

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:31.579
predictions still have a human teacher at the centre of the learning experience.

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:39.432
I say that’s interesting, because many previous predictions of the future of education removed the

00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:46.502
teacher, the teacher was completely replaced by a robot or a TV screen or some form of technology.

00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:51.742
The future in many past predictions was human-free.

00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:58.982
We now have enough experience to know that this doesn’t work, at least not in this format.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:04.596
MOOCs, Massive Open Online Courses, were particularly demonstrative here.

00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:11.006
You could have the best lecturers in the world, record their lectures and make them available

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:17.326
to anyone, anywhere in the world for free, yet a tiny proportion of the world’s population

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:26.156
has ever taken a MOOC, and typically only 7-13% of people who start the course complete it.

00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:31.956
Now, this might not be surprising, especially to those of you who

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:36.608
are teachers, or those of you who have started a MOOC and given up.

00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:41.278
Or to those of you who struggle to motivate yourself with your English studies.

00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:48.598
Not only is it hard to motivate yourself to do the work required, but it is also

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:54.848
hugely beneficial to have a teacher who can help and guide you along the way.

00:05:56.258 --> 00:05:59.528
You might remember the essay we talked about in the last episode,

00:05:59.778 --> 00:06:04.438
by Erik Hoel, where he wrote about the decline of genius.

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:10.258
In one of his follow up essays, he researched the inputs that

00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:15.668
went into “creating genius”, and the first two he mentions are:

00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:23.728
[a] “the total amount of one-on-one time the child has with intellectually-engaged adults”

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:30.048
And [b] “a strong overseer who guides the education at a high

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:34.618
level with the clear intent of producing an exceptional mind.”

00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:41.368
Yes, he was talking about what created genius in the 18th and 19th century,

00:06:41.728 --> 00:06:46.648
before any of this kind of technology was available, but it is clear that

00:06:46.658 --> 00:06:52.878
having as much possible direct contact with a teacher is fundamental, not

00:06:52.888 --> 00:06:57.898
just to create “genius” but to give the best possible education to a child.

00:06:59.328 --> 00:07:04.898
So, perhaps counterintuitively, given that we are talking about predictions of

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:10.198
the future of education, the conclusion is that the teacher is going nowhere.

00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:16.718
However, and this is moving onto the second prediction, it is that the role

00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:22.968
of the teacher will change drastically, and in some ways it will become more

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:28.618
similar to the private tutors of the 18th and 19th centuries that Hoel discussed.

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:35.688
According to the Google report, this means “teachers shift from

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:39.988
being ‘gatekeepers of knowledge’ to ‘choreographers of learning.’”

00:07:41.388 --> 00:07:47.018
Now, that probably sounds like a lot of jargon, so let’s simplify it.

00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:53.578
The idea is that a teacher’s role changes from being someone who stands in front

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:59.118
of a class and imparts information to their students to more of a guide and

00:07:59.118 --> 00:08:04.298
helper, someone who gives them the tools and encouragement to learn on their

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:10.568
own, someone who helps and inspires them to pursue their intellectual curiosity.

00:08:11.488 --> 00:08:16.708
Now, I’m sure that many current and former teachers listening to this will think “I already do

00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:23.218
this as much as I can, it’s just not feasible for me to be a personal guide and helper to 30

00:08:23.218 --> 00:08:28.348
plus different students, there simply isn’t enough time and it would be completely impractical”.

00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:33.318
Of course, you’re right, but this Google report does

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:37.188
emphasise ways in which teacher time can be freed up.

00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:41.548
Specifically, by AI, artificial intelligence.

00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:50.488
According to the report, between 20-40% of the tasks teachers spend time on currently — in

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:56.888
areas such as grading, lesson planning, and administration — could be outsourced to technology.”

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:05.078
If this time is retrieved from teachers, then this opens up a not insignificant

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:09.938
amount of time that can be spent more effectively on guiding and helping students.

00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:17.698
But this brings up an important question: Can AI really replace these tasks effectively?

00:09:18.238 --> 00:09:21.778
Will it actually free up enough time for teachers to

00:09:21.778 --> 00:09:24.648
focus on more meaningful interaction with students?

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:32.238
The optimists would say yes, and of course AI has made significant strides in recent years.

00:09:33.188 --> 00:09:36.538
I imagine that many of you will have experienced this first

00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:40.728
hand, from the user’s perspective, with things like ChatGPT.

00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:46.828
But also behind the scenes there has been remarkable progress made in education.

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:53.398
Automated grading systems already exist and are being improved, algorithms can

00:09:53.478 --> 00:09:58.848
personalise lesson plans, and administrative tasks can certainly be streamlined.

00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:04.798
If teachers no longer have to spend hours marking papers or filling out

00:10:04.798 --> 00:10:10.098
forms, then perhaps more of their time could be spent engaging directly

00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:13.828
with students, guiding their intellectual growth and development.

00:10:14.818 --> 00:10:22.108
This leads us to the third prediction for the future of education: personalised learning pathways.

00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:28.118
The idea here is that instead of a one-size-fits-all model where

00:10:28.368 --> 00:10:32.888
students all learn the same subjects at the same time, technology such

00:10:32.888 --> 00:10:38.318
as AI will help create individualised learning paths for each student.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:43.958
Every child’s strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning speed will

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.590
be taken into account, with algorithms designing lessons just for them.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:56.270
In theory, this could transform education into a much more tailored and effective experience.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:03.190
Imagine a world where a student who struggles with maths but excels in art spends more time building

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.320
their strengths in creative subjects while receiving targeted help in areas where they need it.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.510
The goal is to ensure that students can learn at their own pace and reach their

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.350
full potential, so they aren’t waiting for others in subjects that they are

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.200
strong in and always struggling to follow in subjects that they are weaker in.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.460
But again, there are challenges.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.390
Who creates the learning pathways, and how?

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.250
Who decides what’s important for a child to learn?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:40.430
With the example of the child struggling in maths but who is excellent at art, should

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.540
greater weight be given to improving their mathematical skills or their artistic skills?

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.690
And will this hyper-personalised approach further widen the gap between

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.330
students who thrive in traditional subjects and those who don’t?

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.370
There’s also the concern that too much reliance on AI-driven personalisation might

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:09.410
inadvertently reduce the exposure students have to new ideas or areas they haven’t considered.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.440
Education is not just about mastering skills—it’s also about discovery,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.870
about encountering things you didn’t know you were interested in.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:25.810
A rigidly personalised pathway could potentially limit that kind of intellectual exploration.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.030
The student becomes reliant on AI recommendations rather than

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.540
pursuing their own curiosity and intellectual development.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.780
The fourth prediction concerns the physical space where learning takes place.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:47.340
The pandemic forced a global experiment with virtual learning, as school closures

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:52.220
pushed hundreds of millions of children around the world to join classes online.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.220
From a technical perspective, it worked: a teacher can start a

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.480
Zoom meeting, send a link, and students can join from anywhere.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.370
But from every other perspective, it was a failure.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.970
Early studies show students falling behind academically,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.860
struggling with mental health, and facing social issues.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.170
The full impact of these closures will only become clear in the

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.250
coming years, but these early signs are pretty discouraging.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.360
For those people before COVID predicting that learning could seamlessly move

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.620
online, and this would be the future of education, the experience of COVID

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.160
clearly showed that an online-only experience can’t replace the social interaction

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.780
and connection that come from being in the same space as teachers and peers.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.810
So the prediction about the physical space of learning—somewhat like

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.660
that of the role of the teacher—is that it will remain essential.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.300
To quote this Google report again, tools like virtual classrooms or even virtual reality won’t

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:08.460
replace classrooms, they’ll enhance them, allowing teachers to, as it states, “fulfill an unmet

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:14.570
student need or unlock new learning experiences that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.”

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.590
The final prediction I’ll mention today is perhaps the most

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.170
transformative and, depending on your perspective, the most controversial.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.030
It’s the idea that education will become increasingly detached

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.620
from formal institutions like schools and universities.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:39.400
With the wealth of knowledge available online, from coding boot camps to YouTube tutorials,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:46.030
and the fact that self-directed learning is easier than ever, several of these reports asked

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.610
questions about the role, purpose, and even existence of traditional schools and universities.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:59.780
Will they cease to exist, at least in their current form, in 50 or 100 years from now?

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.000
This movement already exists in the form of self-directed

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.650
learning, where students take control of their own education.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:15.567
In some cases, parents are opting for unschooling, a form of homeschooling

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:20.669
where the child’s learning is entirely self-directed with no formal curriculum.

00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:27.529
If knowledge becomes truly democratised and available at the click of a button,

00:15:27.849 --> 00:15:33.099
if a student’s ability can be measured without a traditional exam, the historical

00:15:33.109 --> 00:15:38.569
gatekeepers of education—schools and universities—may have less relevance in the future.

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:42.949
Students could build their own learning journeys with the help

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:47.429
of online resources, AI-driven tools, and personal curiosity.

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:53.499
And AI would have access to all of their work and the questions that they had asked,

00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:58.229
it could have a better understanding of their ability and knowledge of a subject

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:03.339
than anyone could do after having read a short essay or marked an exam paper.

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:06.499
But there’s a big “if” here.

00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:11.679
Self-directed learning requires a certain level of motivation,

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:16.569
discipline, and access to resources that not every child will have.

00:16:17.979 --> 00:16:22.539
And, as we’ve seen with MOOCs, simply providing access to information

00:16:22.909 --> 00:16:26.899
doesn’t mean everyone will use it or benefit from it equally.

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:33.179
In fact, this future could widen educational inequalities even further.

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:38.609
There’s one fear that wealthier students with access to the best technology and

00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:44.199
resources would flourish, while those without such advantages fall further behind.

00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:50.919
But with the diminishing cost of technology, the bigger question is around motivation.

00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:57.599
If learning becomes increasingly self-directed, will this lead to a greater

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:02.409
gap between students who are able to motivate themselves and those who cannot?

00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:10.539
Now, we’ve asked a lot of questions in this episode, not provided a huge amount of answers, and you

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:16.349
could rightly say not provided very many weird and wacky predictions of the future of education.

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:22.309
That’s on purpose, this was a recurrent theme of all of these reports.

00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:26.299
Almost all of them were surprising in this respect.

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:32.079
Rather than saying that education would be completely revolutionised by a particularly

00:17:32.139 --> 00:17:37.767
technology, or that there was going to be some seismic, step change, they focussed

00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:42.697
on how technology might augment, not revolutionise the learning experience.

00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:50.647
Clearly, if the past has taught us anything, and as the authors of these reports clearly kept in

00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:56.647
mind when writing them, it’s that we often overestimate the revolutionary impact of technology.

00:17:57.567 --> 00:18:03.377
From TVs to teaching machines, to MOOCs and virtual reality, none of

00:18:03.377 --> 00:18:07.537
these have truly transformed education in the way many thought they would.

00:18:08.897 --> 00:18:14.367
And while AI and personalised learning pathways certainly hold promise,

00:18:14.637 --> 00:18:19.707
there is a long track record that suggests technology alone isn’t enough.

00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:23.827
Is this because the technology hasn’t been advanced enough?

00:18:24.657 --> 00:18:30.227
Perhaps, but it seems overly optimistic to think we’re just waiting for the right

00:18:30.257 --> 00:18:35.187
tool that will magically ignite a lifelong love of learning in every student.

00:18:36.447 --> 00:18:40.707
As all of these reports underline, the heart of any effective

00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:45.717
education system is human connection between teacher and student.

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:53.727
As we’ve seen throughout history, it’s the direct interaction with an engaged and dedicated

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:59.377
educator—whether that’s in a classroom or through private tutoring—that helps unlock the full

00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:05.577
potential of a student, no matter whether they are the next Einstein or just a regular Joe Bloggs.

00:19:06.677 --> 00:19:13.677
And as all teachers listening to this, past and present, will be glad to hear, all of these reports

00:19:13.877 --> 00:19:20.867
most firmly predict that the role of the teacher of the future is only going to get more important.

00:19:22.657 --> 00:19:27.477
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the future of education, and

00:19:27.627 --> 00:19:31.877
with that comes the end of this mini-series on the theme of education.

00:19:32.517 --> 00:19:35.437
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:35.857 --> 00:19:41.057
I know we have loads of teachers, current and former, so I’d love to get your thoughts.

00:19:41.377 --> 00:19:44.997
What will school look like in 50 or 100 years from now?

00:19:45.547 --> 00:19:50.527
How will it be different, and perhaps more importantly, how will it remain the same?

00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:54.357
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

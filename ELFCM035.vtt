Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:14.922
English, the show where you can learn fascinating things about the world while improving your

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:15.522
English.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:21.432
I'm Alastair Budge and today we aren't going to be talking about sand.

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:28.542
Specifically is the world really running out of it, and if so, why?

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:36.732
Before we get right into the podcast, let me just remind those of you listening to this on Spotify,

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:43.287
iVoox, Apple Podcasts or wherever you may get your podcasts that you can get a copy of the

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:49.677
transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:55.857
You can download the PDF of the transcript, you can read it on the website, and you can now follow

00:00:55.857 --> 00:01:00.657
it in animating form, which is a bit like subtitles, but way better.

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:06.237
So it's super useful for following every single word and not missing a thing.

00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:12.837
And the key vocabulary explains tricky words, meaning you don't have to pause to look things up in a

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:17.397
dictionary and making it even easier to learn new words and phrases.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.037
So do go and check that out.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.317
That's at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:25.017
Okay then.

00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:33.357
When you think of sand, you might think of a lovely beach with palm trees, or you might think of

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:37.977
rolling desert sand dunes, camels trekking across them.

00:01:39.027 --> 00:01:42.147
And sand seems infinite, right?

00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:46.797
It's on beaches, it's in the desert, it's under the sea.

00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:48.747
It seems like it's everywhere.

00:01:49.827 --> 00:01:56.907
It's completely implausible, so unlikely, so unthinkable, that we might ever run out of it.

00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:01.227
But the reality is that we are.

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:10.957
To keep up with the ever increasing pace of development humans go through, we consume, vast amounts

00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:11.887
of sand.

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:20.107
After air and water sand is actually the third most used natural resource.

00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:23.197
And yes, even more than oil.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:29.367
I guess that you don't personally buy very much sand.

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:37.017
I can't think of the last time that I went to the supermarket and bought a kilo or a tonne of sand.

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:43.947
Yet sand is a crucial ingredient for a lot of things that you probably do use.

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:54.847
It's used to make wine, toothpaste, glass, computer chips, breast implants, cosmetics, paper, paint,

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:55.647
plastics.

00:02:56.307 --> 00:03:03.027
Now I guess you might not consume all of those things, but I'm pretty sure you use some of them.

00:03:04.192 --> 00:03:11.621
But these things are actually relatively small, they are small-fry compared to the one thing that

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.511
uses up most of the sand.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.951
And that's for building, for concrete, and asphalt for construction.

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:27.986
Sand, which is normally referred to, normally called, aggregate when talking from a construction

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:36.056
point of view, it forms 80% of concrete and 94% of asphalt.

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:46.606
So it's what goes into buildings, roads, car parks, runways, bridges, and almost anything that you

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.316
might call 'construction'.

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:52.726
And we use huge amounts of it.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:04:01.574
In fact, a report from the American Geological Institute said that a typical American house requires

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:09.704
more than a hundred tonnes of sand, gravel, and crushed stone for the foundation, the basement, the

00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:10.844
garage, and driveway.

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:18.539
And more than 200 tonnes if you include the share of the street that runs in front of it.

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.759
So, that's 200 tonnes of sand just for one house.

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.149
And of course it's not just houses.

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.569
We use concrete for almost every kind of construction project that goes on around the world.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:42.434
And every year, about two cubic metres of concrete is created for every man, woman, and child on the

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:42.794
planet.

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:51.508
Nowhere is this more true than in the developing world, particularly in China and India.

00:04:52.968 --> 00:05:01.748
While cities in Europe and North America have had in some cases, centuries to develop and build

00:05:01.748 --> 00:05:09.938
housing for their inhabitants, in countries like China, the population growth and urbanisation has

00:05:09.938 --> 00:05:18.308
been so fast that just a phenomenal amount of concrete has been used to construct these cities of

00:05:18.308 --> 00:05:18.848
the future.

00:05:20.618 --> 00:05:29.183
To give you an idea of quite how much concrete China uses, China has about 18.5% of the world's

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:36.893
population, just under 20% of the world's population, but it consumes half of the world's supply of

00:05:36.893 --> 00:05:37.433
concrete.

00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:49.823
In the three year period between 2011 and 2014, so just to reiterate, in just three years, China

00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:57.233
used more concrete than the US, the United States, did in the entire 20th century.

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:06.943
China builds vast amounts of new apartment blocks, of course, but recently it has also embarked on a

00:06:06.943 --> 00:06:17.413
huge new public infrastructure project and created 146,000 kilometres of roads in a single year.

00:06:19.473 --> 00:06:26.468
And the amount of concrete, and therefore the amount of sand required to produce the materials for

00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:29.018
this is absolutely huge.

00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:37.658
China's largest sand producing site produces almost a million tonnes of sand per day.

00:06:39.188 --> 00:06:42.488
So, where is all this sand coming from?

00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:49.298
Do people just go to the desert with big trucks and take it back to cities?

00:06:50.288 --> 00:06:51.758
And if so, what's the big issue?

00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:54.098
The Sahara Desert is huge.

00:06:54.308 --> 00:07:02.498
It's almost 10 million kilometres squared, and about a third of the Earth's land area is desert.

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:06.188
So can't we just go and get the sand from there?

00:07:07.838 --> 00:07:09.488
Unfortunately, no, we can't.

00:07:10.148 --> 00:07:16.478
The sand from the desert is very different to the type of sand that's needed for construction, for

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:16.988
buildings.

00:07:18.383 --> 00:07:25.973
Sand from the desert is very fine as it is constantly blown around by the wind, hitting other grains

00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:32.843
of sand, and so sand from the desert, the grains of sand from the desert, are round, they're very

00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:33.563
spherical.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:42.734
And this might make it nice to walk in barefoot, make it nice to look at, but it's terrible for

00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:43.334
construction.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:53.973
For construction, for cement, what you need is the rough kind of sand, the kind with angular sides.

00:07:55.363 --> 00:08:04.963
This sand is normally found in the beds of lakes or rivers, and how it is collected is actually

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:05.833
pretty simple.

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:10.033
A boat normally just goes above it and sucks it up.

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:19.795
But, as with any natural resource, the supply of this sand is finite and it's getting harder and

00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:20.725
harder to find.

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:25.225
Or at least harder and harder to find legally.

00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:33.425
What this has meant is it has led to the emergence of sand mafias.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:43.050
Criminal gangs that extract sand illegally, often bribing police officers and officials to turn a

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.570
blind eye, to pretend to not notice.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.700
Of course, extracting hundreds of tonnes of sand isn't really something you can do without anyone

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.270
noticing.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.660
It's pretty intensive and noisy work.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.510
And so in almost all cases, there seem to be corrupt officials involved.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.550
Nowhere is this more true than in India where it's thought that the illegal sand business is worth

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.460
$2.3 billion a year.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:27.015
When they aren't using large boats to suck up the sand, what happens is these sand mafias, they pay

00:09:27.015 --> 00:09:35.205
divers to go and get the sand, to dive down and get the sand, and it's thought that about 75,000

00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:43.185
people are employed in India by these sand mafias to dive for sand in rivers.

00:09:44.343 --> 00:09:52.676
It's obviously a nasty, dangerous job, with divers working 12 hours a day and having to go down and

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.156
dive up to 200 times in a single day.

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:05.956
And of course, whether it's being sucked up by a large pipe or being collected by teams of divers,

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:13.006
the removal of the sand from the river beds and the beds of the lakes has a pretty negative effect

00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:14.056
on the ecosystem.

00:10:15.494 --> 00:10:22.835
While scientists don't really know exactly the scale of the damage, they are in agreement that it is

00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:26.675
probably an ecological disaster waiting to happen.

00:10:27.863 --> 00:10:35.802
And although sand is produced naturally, it is produced over the course of thousands of years and

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:43.422
the rate at which it's being consumed greatly outstrips, it's much greater than, the rate at which

00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:44.322
it is created.

00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:48.702
So what can we do about this?

00:10:49.512 --> 00:10:57.674
Well, unfortunately, there isn't a non-sand way of producing concrete at the scale with which it's

00:10:57.674 --> 00:11:01.604
needed to keep up with the construction boom.

00:11:03.134 --> 00:11:10.814
There is research that suggests that small particles of plastic waste, what's called plastic sand,

00:11:11.624 --> 00:11:17.414
can replace some of the natural sand in concrete, but only about 10%.

00:11:19.064 --> 00:11:26.594
That may sound like a small amount, and of course it is only 10%, but it would be about 800 million

00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:29.294
tonnes of sand saved per year.

00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:37.895
There are also some theories that smarter uses of concrete, smarter buildings, will reduce the

00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:44.915
amount of concrete required, but this is just a temporary reduction and by no means a solution.

00:11:46.503 --> 00:11:53.905
The reality is that scientists don't really understand the scale of the ecological destruction that

00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:55.645
our hunger for sand is causing.

00:11:56.165 --> 00:12:01.775
But they are all in agreement that we are going to be hearing a lot more about sand in the years to

00:12:01.775 --> 00:12:02.075
come.

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:09.553
We have just two more stories about sand that I think help reinforce the message.

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:19.979
The Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, clocking in at 832 meters, is in Dubai.

00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:28.704
And Dubai, as you may know, was a small town in the middle of a desert until pretty recently.

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:36.854
You might have thought, well, it's probably pretty easy to get sand to create concrete in Dubai.

00:12:37.454 --> 00:12:41.354
You almost can't move for the amount of sand that's around the city.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.034
It's a city in a desert.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:52.449
But the sand used for the concrete in the Burj Khalifa was imported all the way from Australia.

00:12:53.169 --> 00:12:55.899
The sand nearby was considered too smooth.

00:12:57.056 --> 00:13:05.356
And secondly, if you need another example of some sand-related excess, the sand in almost all of

00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:08.926
Dubai's golf courses is also imported.

00:13:09.886 --> 00:13:14.926
The local sand is too soft and golf balls sink too far into them.

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:24.216
There is an estate called Jumeirah Golf estates and it has two courses, both designed by the famous

00:13:24.216 --> 00:13:25.626
golfer, Greg Norman.

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:34.406
In the course called Earth, the bunkers have white sand imported from North Carolina in the USA.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:43.541
And in the course called Fire, the bunkers have red-brown sand, which looks actually pretty similar

00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:47.621
to the real sand from the desert just across from the golf course.

00:13:49.101 --> 00:13:53.421
But in this case, the sand is from Ontario, in Canada.

00:13:55.451 --> 00:14:01.601
So, to conclude, we are using a vast amount of sand, just a gargantuan amount.

00:14:02.266 --> 00:14:08.566
It's clear that we're using too much, but we don't really know exactly what our hunger for sand is

00:14:08.566 --> 00:14:12.766
doing to the environment and we don't know when it's going to run out.

00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:19.846
So with that uplifting message comes the end of today's podcast.

00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:25.426
I hope it has at least proved to be an interesting look into the world of sand.

00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:32.161
And as a reminder, if you are looking for the transcripts and key vocabulary for the podcast, you

00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:36.061
can get that on the website, both in PDF and animating form.

00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:41.041
It's really worth checking out, so go and have a look if you haven't done so already.

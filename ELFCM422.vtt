Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:15.618
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:19.518
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:23.458
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:23.468 --> 00:00:27.198
about the disgraced American financier, Jeffrey Epstein.

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:32.978
It is a story that brings together billionaires, presidents, princes, private

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:37.878
islands, and unfortunately, decades of sexual abuse of underage girls.

00:00:38.678 --> 00:00:43.258
I imagine that you know a little bit about Jeffrey Epstein already, and if so,

00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:48.658
you’ll know that his story involves some pretty heinous crimes, so please take

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:53.268
this as a warning that there will be references to sexual abuse in this episode.

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:57.788
So if you would prefer to not listen to this, please press pause now.

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:04.443
OK then, let’s get right into the sordid tale of Jeffrey Epstein.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:09.663
It’s often said that the best way of judging someone’s

00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:13.053
character is by seeing what other people say about them.

00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:19.793
In the case of Jeffrey Epstein, people had a lot of nice things to say about him.

00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:24.333
And these weren’t just any people; these were some

00:01:24.343 --> 00:01:27.673
of the richest and most powerful people in the world.

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:33.053
The Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, called him “brilliant”.

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:40.213
The former boss of the British bank Barclays referred to him as his “most cherished friend”.

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:46.543
The former US president Bill Clinton referred to him as “a committed

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:51.403
philanthropist”, and another former president, Donald Trump, called

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:55.823
him “a terrific guy”, adding that “he’s a lot of fun to be with.”

00:01:56.813 --> 00:02:02.193
And in an eerie premonition, or perhaps simply referring to what was

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:08.073
at the time an open secret, Trump added “It is even said that he likes

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:13.163
beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:17.153
No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:23.583
If there were a prize for the world’s biggest euphemism, this would be up there.

00:02:24.463 --> 00:02:27.323
“Liking beautiful women, many of whom are on the younger

00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:31.073
side, and no doubt about it, he enjoys his social life.”

00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:39.173
The man who Trump was talking about, Jeffrey Epstein, would be arrested on charges of sex

00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:45.443
trafficking, with his victims numbering in the hundreds and the youngest being only 14.

00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:50.453
He might have rubbed shoulders with the most powerful people in the

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:55.123
world, but he was right up there with the worst sex offenders of the

00:02:55.123 --> 00:03:01.013
21st century, and he did it all, seemingly, while hiding in plain sight.

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:08.133
As you may know, he was never formally charged, as he was found dead on the floor

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:13.193
of his prison cell 36 days after being arrested, while still awaiting trial.

00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:19.403
This is the story of a man who used his power and money to use and

00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:24.273
abuse vulnerable young women over multiple decades, and a man who

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:28.823
almost certainly took some very damning secrets to the grave with him.

00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:35.503
Now, before we get into the crimes for which Epstein is best known, I want to

00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:40.273
give you some brief background, to tell you a bit about his early life and career.

00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:49.673
He was born in New York in 1953 to working class parents; his father was a groundskeeper and

00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:56.143
gardener, and his mother was a school aide, so she worked in a classroom alongside a teacher.

00:03:57.643 --> 00:04:04.153
He started off his career not as a high-flying banker, but as a maths teacher at a

00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:09.653
prestigious New York school, although he was sacked not long after for poor performance.

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:17.203
From his teaching days, he was known as being charismatic, a good talker, kind of

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:23.213
creepy towards female students, but overall someone who people liked to be around.

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:26.693
And this got him noticed.

00:04:27.983 --> 00:04:32.343
One person who noticed the young Epstein was a man called Alan

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:36.323
Greenberg, who was the boss of the big bank, Bear Stearns.

00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:45.453
And after Epstein was sacked from his teaching job, Greenberg offered Epstein a job at his bank.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:52.018
It was a very junior job, but Epstein quickly proved himself and worked

00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:56.933
his way up the ranks, rubbing shoulders with increasingly wealthy clients.

00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:02.523
He left the bank in 1981, and set out on his own.

00:05:03.863 --> 00:05:07.993
This would be the start of a multi-decade career that involved

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:11.433
Epstein doing a variety of things in the world of finance.

00:05:12.393 --> 00:05:16.973
We aren’t going to go into all of them new, but as a general theme

00:05:17.303 --> 00:05:21.433
they involved managing the financial affairs of the ultra wealthy.

00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:27.493
And we aren’t talking about people with a few million dollars in the bank here; we are talking

00:05:27.523 --> 00:05:34.313
about billions of dollars, yachts, mansions all over the country, money invested all over the place.

00:05:35.173 --> 00:05:39.293
See, managing all of this stuff, all this wealth, all this

00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:44.163
money, it was a full-time job; it required knowledge and skill.

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:51.803
It just so happened that Epstein had this in droves; he was very good at managing

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:57.663
the private financial affairs of billionaires and his client list continued to grow.

00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:04.493
Now, he prided himself on secrecy and discretion, so who

00:06:04.523 --> 00:06:08.003
exactly kept money with Epstein is not public knowledge.

00:06:09.123 --> 00:06:13.678
The one publicly known client was a man called Leslie Wexner, who

00:06:14.013 --> 00:06:17.483
made his money through the lingerie company Victoria’s Secret.

00:06:19.103 --> 00:06:25.190
And in the case of this man, Leslie  Wexner, he trusted Epstein with his life.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.970
Wexner was busy running his company, so he gave Epstein the

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.520
power to do almost anything regarding his personal affairs.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.040
Epstein could buy and sell property on his behalf, he could

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.760
enter into contracts for Wexner, he controlled everything.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.340
Of course, Epstein was rewarded handsomely for this, he was paid a

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.970
lot, but clearly for Wexner it was a price he was willing to pay.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.060
Now, one thing that you’ll see is that how exactly Epstein made his

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.740
money, and how much money he made, is something of a black hole.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.390
Nobody really knows, but it’s been widely speculated

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.620
that it was a lot less than Epstein had claimed it was.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.180
It was in the hundreds of millions, not the billions.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.360
The one area in which Epstein was incredibly rich

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.930
was in terms of his little black book, his contacts.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.110
He made collecting people his business, and he was soon

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.320
mingling with the wealthiest and most powerful people in the US.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.020
Life was good for Epstein.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.513
The boy from a working-class district of New York, the son of a gardener and a school

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.390
teacher, was partying with future presidents and tycoons of the business world.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.850
Sure, he had made some bad investments and lost a few million here

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.550
and there, but he had more money than he knew what to do with.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.130
In 1998 he had even shelled out the modern equivalent

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.800
of $15 million for his own private Caribbean island.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.620
He was on top of the world; there seemed to be nothing that could stop Jeffrey Epstein.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.320
But in March of 2005, the tide turned for this high-flying financier.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.430
Police in Florida had received a complaint from the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.040
The girl told police that she had been brought to Epstein’s mansion by another

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:39.970
older girl, and she had been paid to strip naked for the then 52-year-old Epstein.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.600
The police didn’t immediately bring Epstein in for questioning.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.830
Instead, they launched an undercover investigation, questioning other young

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.430
girls, secretly going through his rubbish, and then searching his home.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.640
What they discovered was very disturbing.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.370
There was evidence of multiple underage girls spending

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.960
time in Epstein’s mansion, with some as young as 14.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.260
When the girls were questioned, they all told a similar story.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.700
They would be brought to the mansion and instructed to give Epstein “a massage”.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.120
During the massage, he would sexually abuse them, and

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.360
typically pay them a few hundred dollars afterwards.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.120
The girls that were brought to the mansion were often flown in from all over the

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.390
world: Brazil, the former Soviet Union, as well as other Latin American countries.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.610
There was even an allegation of 12-year-old triplets being flown in from France.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.510
In terms of just how many there were, it’s thought that there were at least

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.720
80 young girls who were abused in this way, 80 whose identities were known,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.090
so presumably there were many more who will forever remain anonymous.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:06.440
Epstein was arrested in July of 2006, after the evidence was too great to ignore.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.720
This kickstarted a lengthy negotiation process between Epstein’s lawyers and the

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.130
authorities, and ended with Epstein pleading guilty to state, not federal charges, in

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:26.540
exchange for immunity from federal prosecution for him and any other co-conspirators.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.380
In other words, if there were other people, powerful people, who were also

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.800
caught up in this scandal, they would not be prosecuted - this was the agreement.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:43.330
In 2008, Epstein ended up being sentenced to 18 months in prison,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.770
but it wasn’t really “prison” as you or I might imagine it.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.120
Just three and a half months after being sent to this prison, he was allowed

00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.810
to leave not just his cell but the entire prison for 12 hours a day to work.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.400
And when he was in prison, his cell door was mostly left unlocked.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.770
He was released from this pseudo-prison in 2009, after 13 months,

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.650
and told to spend the rest of his sentence under house arrest.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.490
But still, he left his house all the time, even jetting off to his private

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.990
island multiple times, and the authorities did nothing to stop him.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.760
He was forced to register as a sex offender, which of course he most certainly was,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:40.370
but other than that, it was broadly back to life as normal for Jeffrey Epstein.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:48.410
He went on a PR blitz, a public relations campaign to portray himself as a philanthropist

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:54.180
and donor to scientific research, but behind closed doors, nothing changed.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.910
As it would later turn out, life as normal for Jeffrey

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.050
Epstein meant rampant sex abuse of vulnerable young women.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:10.600
He was arrested again on July the 6th, 2019, on charges of sex trafficking.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.980
On the day of his arrest, police raided his Manhattan townhouse and

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.280
uncovered a smorgasbord of incriminating evidence of his crimes.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:27.420
They found, according to some reports, thousands of photos of naked underage girls, and

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.850
digital copies of photos of young girls which had been clearly labelled with their names.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.800
And the police had plenty of witnesses who had come forward and

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.970
told police that they had been trafficked and abused by Epstein.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.420
Some had been brought to the private island and abused, others had

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.490
been abused on his private jet, others in his Manhattan residence.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.990
Some even said that they had been abused in Epstein’s houses by his wealthy and powerful friends.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.340
It would be alleged that Epstein’s purpose in procuring all of these

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.370
young and vulnerable women was threefold, there were three reasons for it.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.660
Firstly, for his own pleasure.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.200
Clearly, he was a vile sex abuser who would abuse multiple

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.370
women a day, and who derived pleasure from his crimes.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.570
But secondly, he would allow his friends and wealthy clients access to these young women.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.790
It was a so-called “perk” of doing business with Epstein.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.570
You got to go to his private island, enjoy the Caribbean crystal clear water, sand

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:44.870
and sun, but, if you wanted, he would also provide underage girls for you to abuse.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.900
And the third reason, or at least the third alleged reason, was related to the second.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:58.510
It was to capture the crimes of his wealthy clients and friends on camera and use these photos

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:05.100
or videos either to blackmail them or as an insurance policy if anything happened to him.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.920
When the police raided Epstein’s house, they found dozens of hidden cameras.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.750
The place was bugged.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.060
When you went through the doors of his townhouse, you were on TV.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.103
The purpose of these cameras, allegedly I should say, was so that

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.520
Epstein could record the abuse of young women by his rich and powerful

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.300
“friends”, and use this as material to blackmail them if the time came.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.190
It should be noted that police have never found any of these

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.600
recordings, but the claims of what is on them are pretty serious.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.350
In the case of one woman, Virginia Giuffre, she has

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.970
said that she was trafficked by Epstein when she was 17.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.010
She was told that she was going to be Epstein’s masseuse, to give him

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.160
massages, but this really involved providing sexual services to him.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:06.370
And not just to him; she was told to provide sexual services to Epstein’s friends,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.020
and was, and I’m quoting directly, "passed around like a platter of fruit".

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:18.360
One of the people she alleged that she was passed around to was none

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.390
other than Prince Andrew, the brother of King Charles, the British king.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:31.090
Giuffre said she was told to “do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey”, and that

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.950
she was "a paedophile's top girl, being trained up for a British prince".

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.280
Those are her exact words.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.970
I should add that Prince Andrew has denied having sex with her, but

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.830
there is a photo of the pair together, and these allegations were enough

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.490
to get the ball rolling on his blacklisting from the royal family.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.920
Now, you probably know what happened next.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.970
Epstein was arrested on July 6th, 2019, and there were all sorts

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.590
of suspicions about what he might reveal under questioning.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.290
After all, he had been rubbing shoulders with some of the richest and most powerful

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:18.330
people on the planet - Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and a

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:24.650
multitude of less famous but in many cases even richer tycoons from the world of business.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.340
What did Epstein know, how much was he prepared to tell, and

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.220
was he going to hand over a load of compromising video tapes?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.440
The first few weeks of his time in jail were filled with visits from

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.080
his lawyers, he spent the days in meetings, planning his next move.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:50.310
Then, on July 23rd, two and a half weeks into his stint in jail, he was

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.780
found on the floor of his jail cell after apparently trying to kill himself.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:02.120
He was revived, taken to another cell and put on suicide watch, but only for

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.220
six days, then he was taken off suicide watch and returned to his previous cell.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.460
Now, it’s worth saying that the conditions in this cell, and the jail he was held

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.830
in, were considerably worse than the conditions of his incarceration 10 years prior.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:26.780
Rats, cockroaches, most certainly locked doors, and Epstein must have known full well

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.710
that his prospects of either being released or having an easier time in jail were minimal.

00:17:33.563 --> 00:17:36.823
Although it seems he never thought there was anything “wrong”

00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:40.583
with what he had done, he knew the gravity of his crimes.

00:17:41.783 --> 00:17:46.743
His lawyers would have told the then 66-year-old Epstein that he would be facing up

00:17:46.743 --> 00:17:52.943
to 45 years behind bars; he had little prospect of ever getting out of prison alive.

00:17:54.343 --> 00:18:01.643
Then, on the morning of August 10, 2019, when doing a routine check, the guards

00:18:01.853 --> 00:18:06.303
found him lying on the floor of his cell, a bedsheet hung around his neck.

00:18:07.563 --> 00:18:10.073
This time there was no saving him.

00:18:10.693 --> 00:18:12.283
Epstein was dead.

00:18:13.263 --> 00:18:17.343
The death was ruled as suicide, that Epstein had killed himself,

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:21.243
but there were numerous question marks over this ruling.

00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:26.733
A bone in his neck called the hyoid was broken, which is relatively

00:18:26.743 --> 00:18:31.233
rare in suicide; it’s much more common in murder by strangulation.

00:18:32.413 --> 00:18:36.443
And there were plenty of question marks over how perhaps the highest

00:18:36.453 --> 00:18:40.763
profile prisoner in the country was allowed to remain in his cell unwatched.

00:18:42.553 --> 00:18:45.993
He had already tried to kill himself, or someone had already tried to

00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:51.243
kill him, so why weren’t the guards watching him like a hawk, especially

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:54.713
given the nature of the people he was thought to have information on?

00:18:56.453 --> 00:19:00.733
What’s more, the two guards who were meant to be watching him had

00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:05.873
fallen asleep, and the CCTV cameras in front of Epstein’s cell had

00:19:05.893 --> 00:19:10.193
malfunctioned, so there was no camera footage of what happened.

00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:15.993
It is, at best, completely incompetent, and at worst,

00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:20.613
evidence of some grand plan to silence Epstein forever.

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:26.053
Now, as you will probably know, there are multiple conspiracy theories about what

00:19:26.053 --> 00:19:31.863
Epstein knew and what he was about to reveal, too many to go into detail here, but what

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:38.123
I will say is that it seems pretty clear that Epstein was guilty a litany of hideous

00:19:38.153 --> 00:19:44.353
abuses going back decades, and that he knew that he was not going to get off scot free.

00:19:45.843 --> 00:19:51.103
For someone who had only really known a life of luxury and Caribbean islands, and the

00:19:51.113 --> 00:19:56.033
freedom to be able to do literally whatever he wanted without ever having to face the

00:19:56.033 --> 00:20:01.643
consequences of his actions, perhaps the prospect of spending a life behind bars and

00:20:01.643 --> 00:20:06.713
sharing a prison cell with half a dozen violent criminals was enough to take his own life.

00:20:08.063 --> 00:20:12.623
But, he had secrets, most likely on very powerful people,

00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:17.473
secrets that could ruin families, fortunes and dynasties.

00:20:18.623 --> 00:20:21.913
All I’ll say on this is that I’m sure we both know that

00:20:21.913 --> 00:20:25.413
people have been killed for knowing an awful lot less.

00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:32.073
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Jeffrey Epstein.

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:36.403
I know it is an uncomfortable subject, but it is one that demonstrates

00:20:36.593 --> 00:20:40.123
quite how far some people think their money and power will take them.

00:20:41.183 --> 00:20:43.883
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:44.303 --> 00:20:48.763
How was the Epstein case covered in your country, and do you have similar stories

00:20:48.953 --> 00:20:52.963
of rich and powerful people who have been convicted of similarly terrible crimes?

00:20:53.803 --> 00:20:58.253
And of course the most obvious answer is “who killed Jeffrey Epstein?”

00:20:58.563 --> 00:21:01.653
Was it Jeffrey Epstein, or was it someone else?

00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:05.383
I would love to know your thoughts, so let’s get this discussion started.

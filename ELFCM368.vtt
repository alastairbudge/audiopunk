Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.979
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.780
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about newspapers.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.780
But not just any newspapers, we are going to be talking

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.580
about a particular type of newspaper, the tabloid.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.460
It’s a form of small, concise newspaper famous for gossip and sensational stories, but

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:45.810
this type of newspaper has gone on to become the dominant form of journalism in Britain.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.663
So, in this exploration of tabloids, and of tabloid culture, we’ll look at how it all

00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:57.283
started, who some of the key players are, the types of stories they write, the controversies

00:00:57.283 --> 00:01:02.283
they’ve faced, and what the future holds for this very particular type of newspaper.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:07.863
This is actually going to be followed by another members-only episode where we’ll look at some

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:12.903
of the most scandalous tabloid stories in history, so keep a lookout for that one next week.

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:18.522
Right, we’ve got a lot to get through, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:27.102
The Irish poet and playwright Oscar Wilde once quipped, he once said, “the public

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:32.742
have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing”.

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:38.142
In other words, people don’t want to know what matters, they want

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:42.962
to know things that don’t matter - gossip, rumour, and scandal.

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:49.052
Oscar Wilde, as you may know already, or you might remember from episode

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:55.542
number 215, was a man who knew all too well the danger of gossip and

00:01:55.542 --> 00:02:00.822
scandal, and of how one’s reputation can be destroyed in an instant.

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:08.282
And it was, in fact, when Oscar Wilde was in prison, from 1895 to

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:13.682
1897, that the first “tabloid” newspaper was created in Britain.

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:19.602
This was something called “The Daily Mail”, and was created by a

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:25.835
man named Alfred Harmsworth, the 1st Viscount Northcliffe, in 1896.

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:32.066
You might know that this newspaper, The Daily Mail, is still alive and well today.

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:37.766
In fact, it’s one of the most popular newspapers in the country by circulation,

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:42.006
and it also has one of the most popular news websites in the world.

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:48.976
It’s popular with many, but hated by others; Jimmy Wales, the founder of

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:55.047
Wikipedia, described it as having mastered “fake news”, and Prince Harry

00:02:55.247 --> 00:03:00.027
referred to it, and the British tabloid press in general as “the devil”.

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:07.477
So, why should a newspaper, or form of journalism, arouse such powerful feelings?

00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:13.907
Why are British tabloids so popular, but at the same time remain so hated?

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:19.907
Well, we should probably start by defining what a tabloid actually is.

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:26.747
A good way to understand this is to compare it to the other type of newspaper: a broadsheet.

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:32.687
Broadsheets are, as you might have guessed from the name, physically bigger

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:37.437
newspapers - broad means wide, and sheet refers to the sheet of paper.

00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:42.727
These types of newspapers generally focus on news through so-called

00:03:42.727 --> 00:03:47.107
‘quality’ journalism based on research, facts and analysis.

00:03:48.357 --> 00:03:50.803
Some traditional British broadsheets.

00:03:50.803 --> 00:03:55.030
you might have heard of include The Times, The Telegraph or The Guardian.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.410
Tabloid newspapers, on the other hand, are generally

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.223
smaller and contain a lot more pictures and advertisements.

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:08.630
Broadsheets tend to focus on ‘hard news’, with articles about

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.490
politics and economics, where the simple facts are stated.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.250
And there is normally a separate section of a broadsheet,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.310
where there is the opinion of various journalists.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.490
Tabloids, on the other hand, often do cover the same stories, but there are a few points to note.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.920
Firstly, there is a more sensationalist angle, the facts and analysis

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.640
are less important, it’s the ‘story’ - that is, how dramatic or

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.700
entertaining it is - that is the most important thing for the tabloids.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.320
Secondly, tabloids are unapologetic in mixing opinion with news, and there is no attempt to

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.320
provide a balanced opinion, to report the story and allow the reader to make up their own mind.

00:04:57.043 --> 00:05:03.873
Sure, arguably any reporting of a story has some political bias, but the

00:05:03.873 --> 00:05:09.573
tabloids mix opinion and reporting, with journalists being free to intertwine

00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:13.103
their own views about current events with the reporting of the story.

00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:20.083
And thirdly, the tabloids also deal in a different type of story to the broadsheets.

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:26.873
For many tabloids their bread and butter, what fills most of the pages in a tabloid,

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:34.113
is “scandal and gossip”, stories of celebrities or famous people doing things that they

00:05:34.123 --> 00:05:39.623
shouldn’t be doing, or simply going about their daily lives, having coffee, taking out

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:44.683
their rubbish bins, or, shock horror, wearing the same dress for the second time that month.

00:05:46.323 --> 00:05:49.703
So, where did they come from, where did it all get started?

00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:56.423
Well, the etymology of the word ‘tabloid', the origin of the word, isn’t actually entirely clear.

00:05:57.163 --> 00:06:02.863
Many people believe the term comes from another industry altogether, the pharmaceutical industry.

00:06:04.243 --> 00:06:10.363
In the late-19th century a tabloid was a type of medicine, a mixture of ‘tablet’ and

00:06:10.593 --> 00:06:16.383
‘alkaloid’ in a condensed tablet, meaning made up of two or more parts or ingredients.

00:06:17.603 --> 00:06:23.343
Historians seem to think that the name could have been used to describe journalism too, one that

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:29.843
focused on shorter, bite-sized articles more digestible to the reader, like taking a tablet.

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:36.857
And the first tabloid arrived on the scenes, as you heard a few minutes ago, in

00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:42.837
1896 when Alfred Harmsworth, the 1st Viscount Northcliffe, founded The Daily Mail.

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:51.186
In one of its first editorials, one of its first opinion columns, the editor, Harmsworth wrote:

00:06:51.906 --> 00:06:56.416
“The World enters today upon the Twentieth or Time-Saving Century.

00:06:56.976 --> 00:07:01.886
I claim that by my system of condensed or tabloid journalism,

00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:05.686
hundreds of working hours can be saved each year.”

00:07:07.286 --> 00:07:12.066
Now, it’s not clear whether Harmsworth was talking about the fact that more dense

00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:18.286
journalism saved the reader time, or the journalist time in their research, perhaps both.

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:24.043
In any case, Harmsworth wasn’t particularly concerned about long, detailed journalism.

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:30.303
A few years later, in 1903, he created another famous British

00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:34.305
tabloid, one that is still in circulation today: The Daily Mirror.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:40.585
The aim of the Daily Mirror, Harmsworth wrote in its first editorial, was to

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:45.895
be “entertaining without being frivolous, and serious without being dull”.

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:52.659
Instead of focusing on hard news with articles about politics and economics and current

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:58.889
events, The Mirror, as it’s widely known, featured gossip, crime reports and mysteries,

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:04.265
as well as celebrity gossip, sports coverage and even puzzles and brain teasers.

00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:11.279
The Mirror’s pages were also filled with photographs and cartoon-like illustrations, far more than

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:16.999
any of its broadsheet competitors, which were filled with wall upon wall of black and white text.

00:08:18.168 --> 00:08:23.330
And this more compact, easy-access format, it seemed, worked.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.920
By 1908 The Mirror was Britain’s second-largest morning newspaper, and

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.460
together with The Daily Express, The Daily Mail, and later on The Sun,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.966
this tabloid format came to dominate the British newspaper market.

00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:47.976
The format for all of these newspapers was pretty similar: lots of pictures, bite-sized articles

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:54.806
written in relatively simple language and short sentences, gossip and astrology columns, agony

00:08:54.806 --> 00:09:01.263
aunts, where readers write in and ask for advice, and even comic strips and comedy columns.

00:09:02.553 --> 00:09:07.870
In the case of some of the tabloids, most notably The Sun, it also included

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.620
pictures of semi-naked women, with “Page 3”, the first page you see when

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.970
you open the newspaper, containing a “Page 3 girl”, a topless model.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.230
The Sun finally stopped this in 2015, but it was, at this

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.560
time, the most popular newspaper in the country by circulation.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.920
And in terms of what are the most popular tabloids today, well, the exact titles

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.820
have changed a little over the years, but the top three almost always include some

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.680
combination of The Sun, The Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror and The Daily Express.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.560
Now, we’re going to go into some of the actual details of tabloid stories in

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.810
the next episode, but let me give you one recent example to illustrate the

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.650
differences in reporting style, particularly with the language used by the tabloids.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.280
In this example, we’ll look at how two different newspapers reported

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.170
on the same story, the story of the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, being

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.260
caught and fined by the police for not wearing a seatbelt in a car.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:25.840
These stories were published on the same day, and both newspapers I'll be talking about

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.320
are owned by the same person, Rupert Murdoch, who we’ll hear more about in a few minutes.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.210
So, in The Times, a broadsheet, the report goes as follows:

00:10:38.217 --> 00:10:43.680
“Rishi Sunak has been fined over his failure to wear a seatbelt in a moving car.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:50.560
Lancashire police confirmed this evening that they had issued a “conditional fixed penalty notice”.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.720
The force did not reveal how much the fine was, but the usual amount is £100.”

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.910
Note the formal language, and the straight, unbiased reporting.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.250
The Times emphasises that though it wasn’t clear how much the fine actually

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.580
was, they made a conservative estimate based on what the usual amount is.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.110
Sounds sensible, right?

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:23.490
Well, the same story was reported in The Sun, a tabloid, and it had a bit of a different feel.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.030
I’m quoting directly here:

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.120
“He was caught riding beltless in the back seat while filming a

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.220
video,” The Sun wrote, “the offence carries a maximum £500 fine, but

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.490
Mr Sunak had last night not been told by cops how much he must pay.”

00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:45.087
Can you see the difference?

00:11:45.797 --> 00:11:51.787
The informal language of ‘caught riding beltless in the backseat while filming a video’ in The

00:11:51.787 --> 00:11:58.467
Sun versus the “failure to wear a seatbelt in a moving car,” as it was worded in The Times.

00:11:58.933 --> 00:12:00.877
Cops versus the police.

00:12:01.577 --> 00:12:09.927
And in terms of the fine, The Sun chose to frame it as a ‘maximum’ of £500, sensationalising

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:16.217
the story somewhat, whereas The Times went for the normal amount, though less scandalous.

00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:22.207
The difference here seems clear: the broadsheet reports the facts in a

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:28.117
calm, conservative way, while the tabloid exaggerated, sensationalised,

00:12:28.127 --> 00:12:31.617
and used informal language to make the story more dramatic.

00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:37.057
The Sun tells an exciting story while The Times tells the facts.

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:42.517
But Prince Harry surely can’t be labelling the tabloid press “the

00:12:42.517 --> 00:12:47.157
devil” for simply using sensational language and a bit of exaggeration.

00:12:48.097 --> 00:12:53.527
One of the mainstays of the British tabloid press, one of its key types of stories,

00:12:53.537 --> 00:13:00.177
of “news”, if we can call it news, is gossip and rumour, of prying into the

00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:05.167
private lives of celebrities and politicians and “revealing” it all to the public.

00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:10.857
Compared to lots of other European countries at least, the UK press has a

00:13:10.887 --> 00:13:16.067
pretty ferocious culture where almost nothing is off-limits to the press.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:22.067
In other words, the British tabloids will go to extreme lengths to get a story

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:27.607
about anything from a celebrity doing drugs or having an affair or behaving

00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:33.007
in an unusual way, and then be very happy to publish it on the front page.

00:13:34.107 --> 00:13:40.767
And in many cases these lengths are extreme indeed, and have led to a huge

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:46.437
backlash when the methods of the British tabloid press are revealed, creating

00:13:46.437 --> 00:13:51.227
a scandal far bigger than the original story the journalist was reporting on.

00:13:52.127 --> 00:13:58.027
We are going to look at several of these scandalous stories in great detail in our next

00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:04.077
episode, but I want to highlight one particular example of this today, a scandal about

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:09.787
journalistic methods that illustrates just how far the tabloids would go to get a story.

00:14:11.254 --> 00:14:17.044
And that is something called the ‘phone hacking scandal’, which involved a popular

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:24.094
but now defunct, now out of print, tabloid called the News of the World, a tabloid

00:14:24.314 --> 00:14:29.884
owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the man who owns The Times and The Sun.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:38.371
In 2005 allegations emerged that journalists from the News of The World were hacking into

00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:43.921
people’s voicemails, they were accessing them without permission, to get information for stories.

00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:52.251
They would hack the voicemail, listen to the private, often intimate conversations, record

00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:59.141
them, and then use that stolen information to write their stories before their rivals

00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:05.121
something known as getting a ‘scoop’ - that is, an exclusive story that nobody else has.

00:15:06.481 --> 00:15:11.851
For these tabloid papers, which we must remember are businesses, after all, getting

00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:17.826
scoops and exclusives are a hugely important part of the job and help sell papers.

00:15:18.756 --> 00:15:25.656
After all, if someone else has reported the “news” before you, your story isn’t really “news”.

00:15:26.756 --> 00:15:32.916
Now, sometimes these voicemails would be members of the Royal Family or celebrities, which

00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:37.775
would lead to stories like Prince William leaving funny voicemails for his younger brother.

00:15:38.565 --> 00:15:42.115
Not so bad, you might think, not the end of the world.

00:15:42.915 --> 00:15:51.175
But this was just the tip of the iceberg, and it would turn out that there was no depth the tabloids

00:15:51.195 --> 00:15:57.445
would not stoop to, no limits they had, in order to get a scoop, get a story before their rivals.

00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:02.485
And this went far deeper than celebrity gossip.

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:11.505
In July of 2011, another story emerged that shocked the British media landscape, when it turned

00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:18.639
out that News of the World journalists had hacked into the voicemail of a murdered teenager.

00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:27.419
Milly Dowler was a 13-year-old British girl who was abducted and murdered in 2002.

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:34.034
It emerged years later that News of the World journalists had hacked her

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:39.359
voicemails after she had been abducted, and published stories about the police

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:44.699
investigation, stories that gave her parents false hope that she was alive.

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:47.919
It was very nasty stuff indeed.

00:16:49.119 --> 00:16:53.619
Under intense political and legal pressure, The News of the World

00:16:53.665 --> 00:16:58.405
eventually closed down in 2011, costing Rupert Murdoch and the paper’s

00:16:58.675 --> 00:17:03.455
parent company a reported hundred million pounds in legal costs.

00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:11.105
And subsequent investigations revealed that this was no isolated incident; phone

00:17:11.115 --> 00:17:15.715
hacking had been commonplace at The News of The World for many, many years.

00:17:17.135 --> 00:17:19.635
Now, looking to the future briefly.

00:17:20.065 --> 00:17:25.075
As is the case all over the world, the internet and social media have

00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:29.085
completely changed the face of journalism and the newspaper industry.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:35.325
Gone are the days when you needed to go to a shop to buy a physical newspaper, and

00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:41.055
to many, gone are the days when you needed to go to a news website to get your news.

00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:47.095
Many people these days get their news from social media accounts and websites

00:17:47.135 --> 00:17:51.315
that aren’t run by journalists, or connected to newspapers in any way.

00:17:52.515 --> 00:17:59.295
Perhaps unsurprisingly, fewer and fewer people are reading newspapers - both broadsheet AND tabloid.

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:08.755
To give you an idea of quite how serious this is in the UK, back in the year 2000, Britain’s

00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:15.615
daily and Sunday national newspapers had a total daily circulation of around 22 million.

00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:22.225
But by January of 2020, those newspapers were selling just

00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:26.745
7 and a half million copies, a huge drop in readership.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:34.225
But between the tabloids and the broadsheets, the former, the tabloids,

00:18:34.435 --> 00:18:39.975
seem to be adapting best to the digital world, both digitally and in print.

00:18:41.407 --> 00:18:46.076
The Sun, for example, still has over a million daily readers.

00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:51.796
And the Daily Mail has almost a million, whereas The Times, which is

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:59.416
a broadsheet, had only 365,000 in 2020, and The Guardian just 105,000.

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:04.196
And it is a similar story online, for the most part.

00:19:05.196 --> 00:19:11.446
The Daily Mail is the country’s 11th most popular website, with 130 million

00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:15.866
monthly visitors being drawn to the website by its so-called “sidebar

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:20.586
of shame”, with never-ending stories of celebrity gossip and rumour.

00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:25.866
The Sun, on the other hand, says it reaches over 30 million

00:19:25.866 --> 00:19:29.066
people a month between its print and digital editions.

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:35.806
In true tabloid style, The Sun claims on its site, and I’m quoting

00:19:35.806 --> 00:19:40.246
directly, “the statistics leave rivals the Daily Mirror and the Daily

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:45.646
Mail in the dust as our loyal readers flock to us for their daily news.”

00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:50.446
Perhaps, you might say, it makes sense that the

00:19:50.466 --> 00:19:53.806
tabloids would make the digital transition more easily.

00:19:54.786 --> 00:20:00.666
Social media is all about hooking people in with a snappy headline, attracting them with

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:06.946
a sensational story, even if that story might be incomplete, or fabricated slightly.

00:20:08.086 --> 00:20:13.136
It is, in many ways, a perfect fit for the form of journalism

00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:16.042
that tabloids have practised for over a century now.

00:20:16.812 --> 00:20:24.252
Short, snappy, elaborate, easy to digest, and often full of scandal and gossip.

00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:30.920
The British tabloid press has spent over a century perfecting this form

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.690
of journalism, and while people might not be going to the newspaper

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.980
stand in the morning, they are going somewhere for their news.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.700
And so long as the public wants news, the tabloid press will do

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.810
its utmost to make sure that it's the place they get it from.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:56.870
Ok then, that’s it for today’s episode on British tabloid culture, the never ending stream of

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:03.420
sensational stories and scandal, and journalists that will stoop to any depth to get a scoop.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.220
As a quick reminder, we are going to follow up this episode with one where we

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.140
look at some of the most scandalous stories printed in the British tabloids.

00:21:13.084 --> 00:21:17.564
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:22.704

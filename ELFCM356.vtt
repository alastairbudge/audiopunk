Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:09.571
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.521
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.331
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:15.831
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.031
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.081
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.091
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.081
are talking about the uncomfortable

00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:27.321
topic of white supremacy.

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.031
And specifically, a white supremacist

00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.411
group that emerged from the ruins of the

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:35.861
war-torn United States, the Ku Klux Klan.

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:39.141
By day, their members appeared as normal

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:41.931
members of society - doctors and lawyers,

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.541
judges, politicians and policemen.

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.471
By night they were an underground group

00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:50.481
who murdered, lynched, tortured and

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:52.461
terrorised people different to them.

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:54.861
You will no doubt have heard of the Ku

00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:58.271
Klux Klan, or the KKK, but in today’s

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:00.201
episode we’ll go a little deeper,

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.241
talking about where they came from,

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.681
what they actually did, why the group

00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.261
was tolerated for so long, and their

00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.701
repeated rises and falls throughout

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.231
the past 150 years of American history.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.779
OK, let’s get right into it and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.419
talk about the Ku Klux Klan.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.509
It is a warm summer night.

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:25.869
It’s dark, but you can see the

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.079
outline of four enormous crosses

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.059
on the hillside, and rows and rows

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.039
of hooded figures beyond them.

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.669
They wear white robes, and the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.219
silhouettes of their hoods spread along

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.469
the hill as far as the eye can see.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.799
There is anticipation in the air, and you

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.129
realise they are waiting for something.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.019
To your left are hundreds of cars,

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.529
and people lounging around, drinking

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.869
beers, observing the spectacle.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.479
Then, coming over the hill,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.959
a man on horseback appears.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.969
“Every Klansmen will salute the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.459
Imperial Cyclops,” says a voice from

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:07.459
under its hood, though it’s hard

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.909
to tell exactly where it came from.

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.531
Slowly thousands of hands

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:14.451
start to rise up in the air.

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:17.941
Then the man on horseback takes a torch

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:20.298
and lights the crosses, one by one.

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:22.378
They burn bright, the

00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:23.878
smell of smoke in the air.

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.598
Their flickering flames light up

00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:29.238
the night sky, and you see that the

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:31.408
rows of hooded figures extend for

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.578
hundreds and hundreds of metres.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:35.688
There are thousands of them,

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.048
their hands raised in the air.

00:02:38.828 --> 00:02:42.418
It is July 1923, and you are in

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:45.048
Seattle, Washington, in the northwestern

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:47.418
United States, at a rally of the

00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:49.838
Ku Klux Klan, the most infamous

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:51.738
hate group in American history.

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:55.418
The Ku Klux Klan, to put it plainly,

00:02:55.568 --> 00:02:57.578
has terrorised the United States

00:02:57.638 --> 00:03:01.415
for over 150 years, but in ebbs and

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.515
flows, we can split the Klan into

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.765
three specific periods of history.

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.945
The first phase started in

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:12.185
1865  and ended in 1872.

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:15.455
The second started in 1915

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:18.611
and ended in around 1944.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.348
And the third started in the

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:24.288
1950s, grew in strength during

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:26.238
the Civil Rights movement, before

00:03:26.418 --> 00:03:28.578
gradually reducing in size to the

00:03:28.578 --> 00:03:30.528
fringe movement that it is today.

00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:34.368
So, to understand these phases, we must

00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:36.964
first go back to where it all started.

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:40.405
The Ku Klux Klan, was founded

00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:43.005
in Pulaski, Tennessee in 1865.

00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:45.905
The name is believed to come

00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:47.715
from a combination of the Greek

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:50.125
word for circle, kyklos, and the

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:52.725
Scottish word clan, meaning group.

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:55.675
Now, if you know anything about

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:57.905
American history, you will probably have

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.395
noticed that the year of its founding,

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:03.715
1865, was quite a significant year.

00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:06.925
It was, of course, the year the American

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:09.955
Civil War ended, and the origins of the

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:13.575
KKK, its very founding and existence,

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.195
come from those Civil War divides.

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:19.955
In fact, the first KKK branch, or

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.125
chapter, was started by former Confederate

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:25.449
soldiers -  those who fought for the south

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:28.149
and the states that were pro-slavery.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.559
By the summer of 1867, a few

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.359
different branches had opened up

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:36.709
across the south, so they met up

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.859
and established what they called

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:41.639
the “Invisible Empire of the South.”

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:43.779
Sounds a little strange,

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.689
perhaps, a little mysterious.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.659
Well, wait until you hear about

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.249
the names they gave members

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.049
of this Invisible Empire.

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.099
The first leader of the KKK, a Confederate

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.999
general named Nathan Bedford Forrest,

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.699
was known as the “grand wizard,” of

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.249
the Klan, and was top of a hierarchy

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.019
of various different grand dragons,

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:09.305
grand titans and grand cyclopses.

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:11.807
A cyclops, by the way, is the

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:14.037
gigantic monster with only one eye,

00:05:14.267 --> 00:05:16.177
the type of creature that Odysseus

00:05:16.414 --> 00:05:18.547
outsmarted by hiding under a sheep.

00:05:19.947 --> 00:05:23.047
At this early stage, some Klan members,

00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:25.684
or Klansmen as they are known, wore

00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:28.784
masks or hoods and occasionally white

00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:31.534
robes, but there was no established

00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:33.374
uniform as there was in later years.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.114
Now, it’s important to remind ourselves

00:05:37.134 --> 00:05:38.844
of the historical and political

00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:41.304
context in which the KKK was born.

00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:44.924
The KKK was born during, and in

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:47.444
response to, the Reconstruction Era.

00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:49.674
As you might have guessed from

00:05:49.674 --> 00:05:51.574
the name, this was the federal

00:05:51.574 --> 00:05:53.754
government’s attempt to reconstruct,

00:05:53.864 --> 00:05:56.544
or put back together, the war-torn

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.584
South after this part of the country

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:00.604
had been destroyed by the Civil War.

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:04.404
As part of Reconstruction, the South

00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:07.154
was split up into five districts, and

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:10.914
each state was told to pass the 14th and

00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:13.574
15th Amendments of the US constitution,

00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:16.544
which gave “equal protection” to former

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.834
slaves and the vote to black men.

00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:22.364
After this, newly freed black

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:24.564
southerners began to become involved

00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:27.184
in politics, sometimes winning election

00:06:27.194 --> 00:06:29.344
to state and even federal government.

00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:32.424
It was, clearly, a large

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.324
change in American society.

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:36.964
One day the law stated that

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:38.934
a man could own another man.

00:06:39.394 --> 00:06:41.534
The next day, the law stated that

00:06:41.544 --> 00:06:43.914
this previously owned man could

00:06:43.914 --> 00:06:45.924
legislate over his former owner.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:48.774
Now, to state the obvious, this is by

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:51.054
no means trying to lessen the horror

00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:52.894
of this previous system of slavery,

00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:55.574
but simply reminding you of what a

00:06:55.574 --> 00:06:57.964
change in American society this was.

00:06:59.134 --> 00:07:01.594
And for those ex-slave owners,

00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:03.514
people who had profited greatly

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:05.684
from and still supported slavery,

00:07:05.974 --> 00:07:07.904
there was a violent backlash.

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:10.954
And nowhere was this stronger

00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:12.784
than with the Ku Klux Klan.

00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:18.204
From 1867 to the early 1870s, it began a

00:07:18.284 --> 00:07:21.134
terror campaign against politicians and

00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:24.244
voters, black and white, in an effort

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.614
to overturn Reconstruction policies and

00:07:26.784 --> 00:07:29.254
restore white supremacy in the South.

00:07:30.374 --> 00:07:32.944
But it wasn’t just the KKK that was

00:07:32.944 --> 00:07:35.874
opposed to Reconstruction, and the KKK was

00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:38.644
far from the only white supremacist group.

00:07:39.904 --> 00:07:41.744
During this period, there were many

00:07:41.804 --> 00:07:44.051
other white supremacist organisations,

00:07:44.224 --> 00:07:46.034
such as the Knights of the White

00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:48.434
Camelia and the White Brotherhood.

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:51.094
Whatever the name of the group, their

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.424
methods and violence were the same.

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.894
Klansmen and other white

00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:58.554
supremacist groups whipped, shot

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:01.054
and hung black Americans and their

00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:02.664
white supporters in the night.

00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:04.954
They burned down the houses of

00:08:04.954 --> 00:08:07.304
black families as they slept, and

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.964
wore their masks or robes not only

00:08:09.964 --> 00:08:12.344
to avoid being identified, but to

00:08:12.344 --> 00:08:14.424
spread terror among the community.

00:08:15.914 --> 00:08:18.904
So, who actually joined this hate

00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:21.654
organisation in its first iteration?

00:08:22.524 --> 00:08:24.884
When people think of the KKK, many

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:27.994
often think of poor, rural, often

00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.354
less-educated, white southerners.

00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:33.047
Now, though it’s true that the Klan’s

00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:35.524
first phase was largely made up of

00:08:35.634 --> 00:08:38.844
poorer, rural members, this stereotype

00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:41.044
of its members is exactly that,

00:08:41.194 --> 00:08:43.574
it’s a stereotype, and it doesn’t

00:08:43.574 --> 00:08:45.714
include all the types of people who

00:08:45.714 --> 00:08:47.734
were attracted to white supremacism.

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:52.074
In reality, the KKK drew its members from

00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:54.894
all social classes, from the poorest of

00:08:54.894 --> 00:08:58.454
farmhands right up to lawyers, doctors and

00:08:58.524 --> 00:09:00.924
church ministers, highly educated people.

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.364
What’s more, many police officers

00:09:04.364 --> 00:09:06.844
and politicians were also members

00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:09.194
or at least supportive of the group,

00:09:09.544 --> 00:09:11.304
meaning that the crimes it committed

00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:13.864
very often went uninvestigated.

00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:16.884
Now, fortunately, their efforts

00:09:16.884 --> 00:09:18.634
to overturn these Restoration

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:21.124
policies failed, the Klan was too

00:09:21.124 --> 00:09:24.494
disorganised, weak and inexperienced

00:09:24.594 --> 00:09:27.544
to do much lasting damage, and is now

00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:29.384
regarded as something of a political

00:09:29.384 --> 00:09:31.394
failure during this first phase.

00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:35.854
But, as we’ll see, the racial tensions

00:09:35.854 --> 00:09:38.654
that gave birth to the KKK were still

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:40.804
bubbling away beneath the surface.

00:09:41.824 --> 00:09:44.574
After forming again in 1915 in

00:09:44.574 --> 00:09:46.674
Georgia, the Klan then registered

00:09:46.674 --> 00:09:49.424
itself as a ‘fraternal organisation’,

00:09:49.884 --> 00:09:52.134
trying to portray itself less as an

00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:54.724
explicitly white supremacist group and

00:09:54.904 --> 00:09:56.950
something closer to the Freemasons.

00:09:58.134 --> 00:10:01.014
Importantly, by doing this, the Klan was

00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:03.464
allowed to claim tax-exemption - meaning

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.304
that it wasn’t required to pay taxes.

00:10:05.824 --> 00:10:07.394
The relevance of this will

00:10:07.394 --> 00:10:08.534
become apparent in a minute.

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:12.644
But this second iteration, or form,

00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:15.124
of the Klan was slightly different to

00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:17.884
the first - it had expanded its hate.

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:21.634
Now the group was not only anti-black

00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:24.714
but also anti-Jew, anti-Catholic,

00:10:24.914 --> 00:10:27.634
generally anti-immigrant and opposed

00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:29.504
to organised labour and trade

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:31.634
unionism, groups with traditionally

00:10:31.634 --> 00:10:33.954
big black and Catholic representation.

00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:37.594
As you will know, at the turn of the

00:10:37.594 --> 00:10:39.604
twentieth-century the United States

00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:41.744
experienced a surge in immigration,

00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:44.124
especially from Europe, with huge

00:10:44.124 --> 00:10:46.604
numbers of Catholics and eastern-European

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.274
Jews arriving in the country.

00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:51.694
The vast majority of this was

00:10:51.694 --> 00:10:54.144
concentrated in the North, and the

00:10:54.144 --> 00:10:56.734
Klan’s revival, its second phase,

00:10:56.854 --> 00:10:59.354
was largely born in reaction to this.

00:11:00.354 --> 00:11:02.734
It also explains, in part at least,

00:11:03.024 --> 00:11:04.774
why the group’s membership was slightly

00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:07.114
different and spread northwards.

00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:11.514
Though the KKK still had its traditional

00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:14.594
southern stronghold, the Klan of the 1920s

00:11:14.784 --> 00:11:17.874
was more northern, more middle-class, with

00:11:17.874 --> 00:11:20.844
a political wing and even women’s groups.

00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:24.164
For white supremacists in the north,

00:11:24.524 --> 00:11:26.494
the migration of black southerners

00:11:26.544 --> 00:11:28.484
northward, combined with the new

00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:31.344
arrival of Catholics and Jews, was

00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:33.574
changing the America they knew.

00:11:34.904 --> 00:11:37.564
During this period, in the 1920s,

00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:40.154
the Klan adopted the burning cross

00:11:40.194 --> 00:11:42.914
as a symbol and began holding grand

00:11:42.924 --> 00:11:44.564
rallies like the one you heard

00:11:44.564 --> 00:11:46.306
about at the start of this episode.

00:11:47.424 --> 00:11:49.994
The uniforms were also standardised,

00:11:50.154 --> 00:11:52.074
and the white robes and pointed

00:11:52.074 --> 00:11:53.684
hoods became more common.

00:11:54.824 --> 00:11:56.934
And during this second phase of the

00:11:56.934 --> 00:11:59.524
Klan, there were more members than ever.

00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:02.034
By one estimate there were

00:12:02.074 --> 00:12:04.364
over 4 million members.

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:07.374
If we take population data from the

00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:10.664
1920 US census, which reports that

00:12:10.684 --> 00:12:13.744
the population was roughly 106 million

00:12:13.744 --> 00:12:16.014
people at the time, that means that

00:12:16.024 --> 00:12:19.304
a staggering 4% of the American

00:12:19.304 --> 00:12:22.044
population were members of the KKK.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.304
And if we take the state of Indiana,

00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:27.094
which had around a quarter of a

00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:29.984
million members in 1925, around

00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:32.854
30% percent of the state’s entire

00:12:33.004 --> 00:12:35.374
white male population were Klansmen.

00:12:36.454 --> 00:12:37.144
Mad, right?

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.754
And this is less than 100 years ago.

00:12:41.084 --> 00:12:43.814
But after a series of scandals,

00:12:43.914 --> 00:12:45.884
including the conviction of Indiana

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:48.934
Grand Dragon D.C Stephenson for rape

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:52.064
and murder in 1925, the Klan lost

00:12:52.094 --> 00:12:54.574
moral credibility, membership started

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.964
to dwindle, started to reduce, and

00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:59.624
it entered the 1930s much weaker.

00:13:00.724 --> 00:13:03.244
And the Great Depression of the 1930s

00:13:03.524 --> 00:13:06.334
substantially cut its membership, and the

00:13:06.334 --> 00:13:09.004
group was even disbanded, or shut down,

00:13:09.174 --> 00:13:12.734
in 1944, when the Internal Revenue Service

00:13:12.824 --> 00:13:14.994
began demanding taxes from the Klan.

00:13:16.184 --> 00:13:18.354
Partly as a result of this, it would

00:13:18.354 --> 00:13:21.024
remain dormant for the next two decades,

00:13:21.024 --> 00:13:23.544
with occasional bursts of localised

00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:26.104
violence, largely in the rural South.

00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:28.814
The second phase was over.

00:13:30.234 --> 00:13:32.854
But the Klan emerged from the ashes

00:13:32.884 --> 00:13:35.994
again in the 1950s, in opposition to the

00:13:35.994 --> 00:13:38.324
civil rights movement, the movement to

00:13:38.324 --> 00:13:40.854
give people of all races equal rights.

00:13:41.774 --> 00:13:44.484
Klan activity in the South surged

00:13:44.634 --> 00:13:46.954
again, and a deadly campaign of

00:13:46.954 --> 00:13:49.764
harassment, intimidation, burnings,

00:13:49.794 --> 00:13:51.464
beatings, bombings, lynchings and

00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:54.124
shootings of African-Americans and white

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:56.204
pro-civil rights campaigners began.

00:13:57.714 --> 00:13:59.424
Like in the aftermath of the Civil

00:13:59.424 --> 00:14:01.924
War, the Klan enjoyed a resurgence in

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:04.334
popularity in response to government

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.784
action: in the mid-nineteenth century

00:14:06.974 --> 00:14:09.004
it was against Reconstruction policies,

00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:11.304
in the mid-twentieth century, it was in

00:14:11.304 --> 00:14:13.324
reaction to the Civil Rights movement.

00:14:14.334 --> 00:14:17.574
In 1954 when the Supreme Court ruled

00:14:17.594 --> 00:14:19.634
that racially segregated schools were

00:14:19.684 --> 00:14:22.354
unconstitutional, and therefore illegal,

00:14:22.514 --> 00:14:25.094
a wave of violence spread across the

00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:27.484
south, membership of the Klan grew

00:14:27.504 --> 00:14:30.384
again, and by the late-1950s it was

00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:32.494
holding rallies with thousands of people.

00:14:33.434 --> 00:14:35.754
And as the Civil Rights movement fought

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:38.284
on, trying to dismantle the so-called

00:14:38.504 --> 00:14:41.044
‘Jim Crow’ laws, the laws outlining

00:14:41.044 --> 00:14:43.554
racial segregation, the Klan’s violence

00:14:43.734 --> 00:14:46.014
became more gruesome, and shocking.

00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:50.724
In Alabama, in 1957, a group

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.744
of KKK members abducted Edward

00:14:53.804 --> 00:14:56.224
“Judge” Aaron, a black handyman

00:14:56.254 --> 00:14:57.824
from Birmingham, in Alabama.

00:14:58.694 --> 00:15:00.754
They castrated him, they cut

00:15:00.754 --> 00:15:02.794
off his testicles, and poured

00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:05.104
boiling chemicals into his wounds.

00:15:06.384 --> 00:15:09.084
The KKK also began to use bombs,

00:15:09.294 --> 00:15:11.864
something that was first done in 1956

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.214
when Klan leaders bombed the house of

00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:16.254
civil rights leader Martin Luther King.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:19.274
During the Civil Rights era, it's

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.174
thought the Klansmen were responsible

00:15:21.364 --> 00:15:23.674
for around 70 bombings in Georgia

00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:26.114
and Alabama and the burning of 30

00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:28.774
black churches in Mississippi alone.

00:15:30.234 --> 00:15:33.374
By the early-1960s the Klan had grown

00:15:33.384 --> 00:15:35.594
into a loosely connected collection of

00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:38.274
white supremacist groups spread out across

00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:40.414
the southern states and all operating

00:15:40.554 --> 00:15:43.374
under the Klan name - the Invisible

00:15:43.384 --> 00:15:45.994
Empire was back, although it wasn’t

00:15:45.994 --> 00:15:48.874
particularly structured or well-organised.

00:15:50.044 --> 00:15:52.654
And unfortunately, just like during the

00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:55.484
Klan’s first two phases, often at the

00:15:55.484 --> 00:15:58.264
local level law enforcement did little

00:15:58.364 --> 00:16:00.164
to stop the group’s terror campaign.

00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:03.624
Like in the post-Civil War era and

00:16:03.854 --> 00:16:06.134
during the 1920s, there were plenty of

00:16:06.214 --> 00:16:08.094
police officers in the south who were

00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:10.714
themselves Klansmen, and many more were

00:16:10.714 --> 00:16:12.984
unsupportive of the Civil Rights movement.

00:16:14.204 --> 00:16:16.214
As a result, there was a response

00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:18.884
at a federal, a national level, a

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:21.654
move from above to infiltrate and

00:16:21.654 --> 00:16:24.264
destroy the Klan once and for good.

00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:28.794
In 1964, the FBI began a major

00:16:28.814 --> 00:16:32.794
operation and by September of 1965 had

00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:35.444
informants in 7 of the 14 different

00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:36.904
Klan groups across the country.

00:16:38.184 --> 00:16:41.444
Amazingly, of the 10,000 or so active

00:16:41.484 --> 00:16:43.384
Klan members, it’s thought that as

00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:46.284
many as 2,000 were giving information

00:16:46.294 --> 00:16:48.774
to the government, and as a result its

00:16:48.784 --> 00:16:50.734
leaders began being sent to prison.

00:16:51.924 --> 00:16:53.974
This more prominent and violent

00:16:53.984 --> 00:16:55.934
iteration was condemned from the

00:16:55.934 --> 00:16:57.644
very top of the American state.

00:16:58.564 --> 00:17:02.284
In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson publicly

00:17:02.284 --> 00:17:04.954
attacked the Klan and announced the arrest

00:17:04.954 --> 00:17:07.184
of four members following the murder of a

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:09.474
white Civil Rights campaigner in Alabama.

00:17:10.814 --> 00:17:13.714
And as the late 1960s moved into

00:17:13.714 --> 00:17:16.234
the 1970s, the combination of the

00:17:16.274 --> 00:17:18.724
FBI operation, public rejection

00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:20.674
of its violence, and its leaders

00:17:20.674 --> 00:17:22.794
going to prison, the Klan became

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.324
even more of a fringe group with an

00:17:25.324 --> 00:17:27.314
increasingly dwindling membership.

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.884
Now, one name you probably associate

00:17:30.994 --> 00:17:34.284
with the KKK is David Duke, who was the

00:17:34.434 --> 00:17:37.034
charismatic and supposedly respectable

00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:40.204
face of the Ku Klux Klan during the 1970s.

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:44.714
His life is too bizarre to do justice in

00:17:44.714 --> 00:17:47.094
a short section of this episode, so we are

00:17:47.124 --> 00:17:49.324
actually going to do a full episode on his

00:17:49.324 --> 00:17:51.744
life and his impact on the Ku Klux Klan.

00:17:52.524 --> 00:17:54.404
That’s going to be the next episode,

00:17:54.604 --> 00:17:56.304
so, a follow-up to this one.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.064
But, in brief, although he was only

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:03.274
leader of the KKK for four years, he

00:18:03.274 --> 00:18:05.814
did a huge amount to portray it as

00:18:05.814 --> 00:18:08.114
a semi-respectable organisation, and

00:18:08.224 --> 00:18:10.864
disguised its hideous beliefs behind a

00:18:10.864 --> 00:18:13.434
respectable smile and a suit and tie.

00:18:14.054 --> 00:18:15.664
He was a dangerous man indeed,

00:18:15.764 --> 00:18:17.264
and we’ll go deep into the

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:19.184
reasons why in the next episode.

00:18:20.254 --> 00:18:21.414
But moving on.

00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:25.024
The KKK enjoyed very brief localised

00:18:25.064 --> 00:18:27.864
revivals in the late-1980s and then again

00:18:28.004 --> 00:18:30.834
in the early 2000s, but nothing close

00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:33.834
to the levels of the 1960s, 1920s, or

00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:36.214
Reconstruction Era, when it all started.

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:39.774
Ever since the 1980s, really, the

00:18:39.774 --> 00:18:41.464
group has continued to become more

00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:43.914
fragmented, lacking in organisation,

00:18:44.194 --> 00:18:46.004
diluted by the emergence of newer

00:18:46.204 --> 00:18:48.364
skinhead and neo-Nazi groups.

00:18:49.234 --> 00:18:50.834
The Southern Poverty Law Center

00:18:51.144 --> 00:18:53.884
estimated in 2017 that there were,

00:18:54.304 --> 00:18:57.424
and I’m quoting directly, "at least 29

00:18:57.654 --> 00:19:00.424
separate, rival Klan groups currently

00:19:00.434 --> 00:19:02.574
active in the United States, and

00:19:02.694 --> 00:19:05.970
they compete for members, dues, news,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.420
media attention and the title of being

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.580
the true heir to the Ku Klux Klan.”

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.040
And all of this brings us back

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.870
to the modern day - the age of

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.510
the internet and social media.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.920
Huge cross burning rallies like the

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.540
one in Seattle you heard about at the

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.790
start thankfully no longer exist, and

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.500
the Klan’s organising and meeting spaces

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.650
are now mostly virtual - among a tiny

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.970
minority of competing online radicals.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.410
This makes it much more difficult

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.960
to accurately assess how many active

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.590
members the Klan has today, but most

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.950
estimates put it at a few thousand.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.280
But clearly, the hateful ideas and values

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.580
of the Ku Klux Klan have gone nowhere.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.920
You might remember the events of August

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.940
of 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.470
when a white supremacist drove his car

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.524
into a crowd, killing one and injuring 35.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.570
This wasn’t the Klan per se, but

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.510
a far-right ‘Unite the Right’

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.320
rally, which was an attempt

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.030
to merge the various far-right

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.350
groups, including the Ku Klux Klan.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.620
So, while the organisation might

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.560
be a shadow of its former self,

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.030
this event served as one of many

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.640
grim reminders to all Americans,

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.230
and to the world, that its hateful

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.150
ideology lives on to this very day.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.360
OK then, that’s it for today’s

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.420
episode on the Ku Klux Klan,

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.360
America’s most infamous hate group.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.280
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.100
and whether you knew a lot about the

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.440
KKK, or this was the first time you’d

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.200
really heard anything about it, well

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.590
I hope you learned something new.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.210
As a quick reminder, we are going

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.680
to be following up this one with

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.110
a members-only episode on the very

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.320
strange life of David Duke, the man

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.380
who took over the KKK when it was in

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.890
decline and tried to change its image.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.500
As always, I would love to know

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.890
what you thought about this episode.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.180
What do you think can and should be

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.370
done about these kinds of hate groups?

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.490
Are there similar types

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.820
of groups in your country?

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.530
And how has this changed over the years?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.780
I would love to know, so let’s

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.160
get this discussion started.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.470

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.000

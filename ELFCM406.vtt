Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.379
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.319
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:27.340
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another mini-series, this time on British social

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.619
class, and in particular, the lives of those at the very top of the British social class system.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.080
In part one, this episode, we are going to talk about the origins of the British aristocracy.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
We’ll look at what being a “Lord” really means, how and why someone can

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.080
become a Duke or Lord, and the roles these people have in modern Britain.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.769
And in part two, we’ll take a look inside the most

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.580
exclusive private school in Britain, Eton College.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.840
It is a school that has educated Prime Ministers, Princes, Archbishops

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.050
and Kings, a school that is as exclusive as it is expensive, but,

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:13.339
as we’ll learn, it is now exclusive in ways that might surprise you.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.290
And finally, in part three, we are going to look at the unusual life of British

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.660
servants, the people who lived and worked for British aristocrats, cooking,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.649
folding napkins, cleaning the toilets, and doing all the sorts of things that

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.024
those at the top of British society considered themselves to be above doing.

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:38.584
I’m super excited for this mini-series, and I hope you will like it.

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:43.011
OK then, an exploration of the British aristocracy.

00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:50.521
If you ever find yourself filling out an application form in the UK, let’s say you are

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:56.401
registering for an appointment with a doctor, you might be asked for lots of details that will

00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:03.491
be unsurprising: your first name, your surname, your phone number, email address, and so on.

00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:07.721
You might then get to the bit where it says “title”.

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:17.211
If it’s an online form, the first few options will no doubt be familiar: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master.

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:24.731
Perhaps these don’t apply to you, and you’ll have to keep scrolling through: Doctor or Professor.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:33.291
For most people, myself and I imagine yourself included, we fit into one of these titles.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.591
But for a tiny percentage of the British population,

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:41.211
they need to keep on scrolling to find their title.

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.511
And if you keep on looking down the list, you might be surprised to see quite

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:53.542
how many options there are: Dame, Lady, Lord, The Right Honourable, Sir,

00:02:54.018 --> 00:02:59.991
Earl, Duke, Baron, Viscount, Viscountess and Marquess, the list goes on.

00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:08.591
So, what do these titles actually mean, how does one become an Earl or a Duke, is it actually

00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:14.741
possible for someone like you or me to become one, and what does it mean when you become one?

00:03:16.011 --> 00:03:21.251
To answer all of these questions, we need to go back to the start, or at least

00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:26.923
back to the arrival of William The Conqueror to Britain in the year 1066.

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:34.821
As a brief reminder, William was a Norman, he came from Normandy in the north of France.

00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:40.061
He arrived in England, beat the Anglo Saxons and crowned

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.461
himself king of England on Christmas Day in 1066.

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:52.291
He implemented a wide range of changes to the country, but the most important for the

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:58.141
purposes of this episode was the introduction of something called the feudal system.

00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:05.081
Previously, England was administered by a group of Anglo-Saxon nobles.

00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:09.581
When William arrived, he took all of this land.

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:17.281
Just under 20% he kept for himself, and the rest was distributed between a

00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:23.411
combination of the church and men who had been given noble titles by King William.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:29.481
In practice, the deal was this: the king would give a nobleman

00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:33.564
a chunk of land, often thousands of square kilometres.

00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:40.071
The nobleman would be in charge of everything and everyone who lived there: he

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:45.381
could do what he wanted, collect taxes, collect rent, he was the boss, essentially.

00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:52.992
In exchange, he needed to pay a small annual fee to the crown, give advice to the king if

00:04:53.052 --> 00:05:00.172
asked, and if the king needed soldiers to fight a war, the nobleman would provide them for him.

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:06.172
It was, for the king and the nobleman at least, a pretty efficient arrangement.

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:11.302
The king didn’t need to worry about minor things going on hundreds

00:05:11.302 --> 00:05:14.402
of kilometres away because someone else would deal with it.

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:21.902
And the nobleman, well, he got to live a pretty good life and was under the protection of the king.

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:28.792
For everyone else, well, life wasn’t quite so rosy, but that isn’t what we’re talking about today.

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:37.742
The catch-all term for these noblemen was “the baronage”, and it consisted of no more than a

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:45.332
couple of hundred “barons”, of whom never more than 25 were bestowed with the title “Earl”.

00:05:46.872 --> 00:05:53.412
As the years went by, more titles were created: Duke, Marquess, and Viscount.

00:05:54.872 --> 00:06:00.492
Initially these titles weren’t actually hereditary: the son of an

00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:04.762
Earl didn’t automatically become an Earl after his father died.

00:06:05.702 --> 00:06:10.172
But within a couple of hundred years, and after a few changes

00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:13.582
that we aren’t going to go into today, this became the case.

00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:19.792
If a man was a baron, let’s say, after his death the title would pass to his son.

00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:23.532
If he didn’t have any children, it went to his brother.

00:06:24.202 --> 00:06:27.302
If he had a daughter, well, her husband would get it.

00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:34.212
Sorry, women couldn’t be trusted to take on the title, it would have to go to the nearest man.

00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:44.066
And, with a few minor updates, this is essentially still the situation today: there are

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:49.796
these different noble titles which pass from father to son and give the holder of the

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:58.667
title the same land and power that can in many cases be traced all the way back to 1066.

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:05.686
Before we go into what this means in practice in the 21st century, let me first

00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:11.016
explain to you the hierarchy of these noble titles, their order of importance,

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:16.526
so if you ever find yourself in a room with a Duke, a Marquess, an Earl,

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:20.766
a Viscount and a Baron, you’ll know in which order you need to greet them.

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:28.226
In fact, the order I just gave you is the right order, going from highest in rank to lowest.

00:07:29.386 --> 00:07:33.636
Right at the top is “Duke”, of which there are only 30.

00:07:34.506 --> 00:07:39.172
These include Dukes you have probably heard of, like the Duke of Cornwall,

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:43.586
otherwise known as Prince William, the Duke of Sussex, which is Prince

00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:49.226
Harry, or their black sheep of an uncle, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:56.966
If you know your English geography, Cornwall, Sussex and York are all areas

00:07:56.976 --> 00:08:02.936
of the country, so being a Duke of a particular area typically meant that

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:07.596
the title came with ownership and management of that area of the country.

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:12.976
Now, in fact in the case of Sussex and York, these titles were created

00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:18.687
more recently specifically for that person, but the Duke of Cornwall

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:23.346
is a title that can be traced all the way back to the year 1337.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:29.966
One step down from a “Duke” is a Marquess, of which there are 34.

00:08:30.726 --> 00:08:34.096
Then comes Earl, of which there are 189.

00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:40.566
There are fewer Viscounts, only 110, but they are still less important than Earls.

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:45.076
And Barons are, comparatively, two a penny.

00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:49.056
There are 426 hereditary barons in England.

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:58.226
If you’ve been doing the maths, that’s 789 people, it’s 0.001% of the population.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:05.426
Given this, and given the fact that these people don't live “normal”

00:09:05.426 --> 00:09:09.786
lives by most people’s definitions, you are unlikely to meet one.

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:14.476
But if you did, let me tell you how to address that person.

00:09:15.666 --> 00:09:16.966
It’s actually quite simple.

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:21.736
If you are addressing one of the 30 Dukes, you say “Your Grace”.

00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:25.876
Unless, that is, that Duke is also a prince or

00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:29.276
princess, in which you would say “Your Royal Highness”.

00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:37.786
And for everyone else, all of the other titles, it is “Lord” for a man, and “Lady” for a lady.

00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:45.576
So a “lord” is actually just the way in which you address someone, it isn’t a rank in its own right.

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:52.293
Right, now that we have an understanding of the order of these titles, and

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:56.643
what we should call people who hold them, it’s time to talk about the role of

00:09:56.643 --> 00:10:02.426
these nobles, and ask ourselves what their purpose is in 21st century Britain.

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:08.946
If you remember, the original role of these people was a practical one:

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:15.256
control the land, advise the king, bring soldiers to fight when the king asks.

00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:21.086
The UK now has a functional government, the monarch is no longer really

00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:25.636
in charge, and fortunately there is limited  need for a large army.

00:10:26.247 --> 00:10:31.083
So, what is the purpose of the nobility in 2023?

00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:39.097
Well, for some people this is a very easy question to answer: there is no purpose at all, there

00:10:39.217 --> 00:10:44.487
hasn’t been any purpose for hundreds of years, and we should dissolve all of these ridiculous

00:10:44.497 --> 00:10:50.937
titles and return the land owned by the 0.001% of the population to the British people.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:59.417
To others, the role of the British nobility is similar to that of the monarchy: it is one of

00:10:59.637 --> 00:11:06.277
historical and cultural preservation and continuity, they are a living link to British history.

00:11:07.757 --> 00:11:13.057
We’ll engage with this question a little more in a bit, but your next question might

00:11:13.057 --> 00:11:19.437
be about what Dukes or Earls or Viscounts have to do…do they have to do anything

00:11:19.437 --> 00:11:24.417
now, or do they just sit around getting frustrated with having to scroll all the way

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:28.277
down to the bottom when it comes to filling out the form for a doctor’s appointment?

00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:35.817
Well, there are some ceremonial and symbolic responsibilities, such as

00:11:35.977 --> 00:11:41.097
going to events, weddings, banquets, opening new buildings and so on.

00:11:41.687 --> 00:11:48.347
But other than this, there is little “official” work required, you don’t need to do anything.

00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:55.417
Other than the status that might come from having this kind of title, and the invitations

00:11:55.417 --> 00:12:02.127
to fancy parties and events, you now don’t get anything directly from being a lord or lady.

00:12:02.817 --> 00:12:06.917
In fact, it is normally a pretty expensive title to hold.

00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:13.917
This kind of title will often come with a very large house that is in varying states of

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:19.597
disrepair, so it needs substantial money put into it every year to stop it from falling down.

00:12:20.517 --> 00:12:24.777
Your family in most cases will still have a very healthy bank

00:12:24.797 --> 00:12:28.717
balance, but there are certain standards that are expected to be

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:33.907
maintained, and the money probably goes out as quickly as it comes in.

00:12:35.027 --> 00:12:39.777
After all, this is no longer the 14th century, and there aren’t hundreds of

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:43.927
thousands of commoners farming your land and paying you rent every month.

00:12:45.447 --> 00:12:50.537
In some cases, however, not that much has changed since the 14th century.

00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:56.357
One of the wealthiest Dukes in the UK is the Duke of Westminster.

00:12:57.507 --> 00:13:01.127
He is only 32 years old as of the time of making this

00:13:01.127 --> 00:13:06.195
episode, and he is worth a staggering €11 billion.

00:13:07.527 --> 00:13:13.457
He does, much like his father and grandfather and their grandfathers before them, sit

00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:19.797
around and collect rent, not from farmers, but from companies and private individuals.

00:13:21.247 --> 00:13:26.507
In his case, this wealth comes from owning just over a kilometre squared

00:13:26.537 --> 00:13:31.397
of property in the fanciest areas of London, Mayfair and Belgravia.

00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:38.487
And his title, the Duke of Westminster, can be traced back hundreds of years.

00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:45.617
Indeed, his father apparently once joked to a group of entrepreneurs that his top piece

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:51.177
of advice was “to have an ancestor who was good friends with William the Conqueror”.

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:59.537
And in just one more example of not that much changing, this Duke of Westminster, Hugh,

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:07.147
had two older sisters, yet the title and wealth passed to him, not his older sisters.

00:14:08.777 --> 00:14:12.927
Now, there is one type of Lord that we haven’t talked about yet.

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:19.157
Up until now we have talked only about hereditary titles, Duke, Earl,

00:14:19.487 --> 00:14:24.767
Viscount and so on, titles that pass from one generation to the next.

00:14:26.427 --> 00:14:31.087
There is another type of Lord which doesn’t pass down, and that is called

00:14:31.107 --> 00:14:36.147
a “Life Peerage”, and if you have a “Life Peerage” you are called a “peer”.

00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:41.277
If you have read much about the British political system, you’ll know that

00:14:41.287 --> 00:14:46.887
the UK Parliament is formed of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

00:14:48.127 --> 00:14:54.387
A commoner is someone without a title, a normal person, and the House of Commons is

00:14:54.387 --> 00:15:00.437
the area of Parliament where elected officials sit and discuss political matters.

00:15:01.247 --> 00:15:05.297
If you’ve seen videos of a long room with green seats and people

00:15:05.307 --> 00:15:08.627
standing up and shouting at each other, that’s the House of Commons.

00:15:09.737 --> 00:15:13.227
But in the same building there is another room.

00:15:13.837 --> 00:15:17.457
It’s a bit smaller, and the seats are red, not green.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:22.957
It’s called The House of Lords, and you have to be a Lord to enter.

00:15:24.107 --> 00:15:29.737
It used to be made up of hereditary peers, Lords and Ladies who inherited

00:15:29.737 --> 00:15:36.147
their titles from their parents, but the law was changed in 1999 so that, with

00:15:36.187 --> 00:15:41.117
a small number of exceptions, you now have to be “elected” as a Lord or Lady.

00:15:42.247 --> 00:15:48.677
The election process, however, is not exactly democratic; typically the Prime

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:53.537
Minister will propose someone because of a particular contribution that they

00:15:53.537 --> 00:15:59.217
have made to the world of politics, arts, science, business or public service.

00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:05.357
And recently, several Prime Ministers, especially Boris Johnson, have

00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:10.447
come under fire for rewarding people loyal to them with life peerages

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:14.887
despite their somewhat dubious contribution to British society.

00:16:16.077 --> 00:16:21.767
And when you become a life peer, you are a peer for life, forever.

00:16:22.447 --> 00:16:27.627
You can put “The Right Honourable” before your name, you can come and vote on issues in the House

00:16:27.627 --> 00:16:33.627
of Lords, you get paid for your contribution, you have a political role to play in the country.

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:38.907
Now, this wasn’t meant to be an episode on how the British political system

00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:45.717
works, but broadly the role of these peers, and the House of Lords, is to

00:16:45.717 --> 00:16:50.977
“make laws, investigate public policy, and hold the government to account.”

00:16:52.687 --> 00:16:57.967
If you are familiar with US politics, it’s somewhat similar to the Senate,

00:16:58.387 --> 00:17:01.747
while the House of Commons is more like the House of Representatives.

00:17:02.607 --> 00:17:06.617
There are fundamental differences, like the fact that members of the House of

00:17:06.617 --> 00:17:12.787
Lords are not elected by the public, but we are in the UK after all, and as you’ll

00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:17.677
have gathered by now, we have a long-standing tradition of unelected rulers.

00:17:18.587 --> 00:17:24.947
Now, the final point I want to talk to you about today is the public perception of nobility.

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:30.807
On one level, it is clearly ridiculous to give people titles

00:17:31.057 --> 00:17:34.627
based on who their ancestors might have been in the 14th century.

00:17:35.427 --> 00:17:40.667
If you were designing a society from scratch, it seems unlikely that you would give a

00:17:40.677 --> 00:17:46.457
large proportion of the country’s land to a tiny slither of the population and allow

00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:52.392
that miniscule group of people to continue to call themselves Duke or Earl or Marquess.

00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:57.697
But on the other hand, both inside and outside of Britain,

00:17:58.207 --> 00:18:02.427
there is a strange obsession with this tiny section of society.

00:18:03.257 --> 00:18:08.427
If you think of the books, films, and TV series that have been made about Lords and

00:18:08.427 --> 00:18:14.787
Ladies, from Downton Abbey to Gosford Park, Poldark to Brideshead Revisited, people

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:21.107
love reading about, watching and experiencing the lives that the aristocracy lead.

00:18:21.577 --> 00:18:23.967
This genre is incredibly popular.

00:18:25.307 --> 00:18:32.407
And if we were to look into a crystal ball and think, hmm, will the British aristocracy be

00:18:32.407 --> 00:18:39.671
any different in 500 or even 1,000 years to come, well this is an interesting question indeed.

00:18:40.811 --> 00:18:46.241
There have been some reforms to this system, but really there is

00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:50.841
very little public support or movement at the moment for any kind of

00:18:50.841 --> 00:18:56.281
dismantling of the system of peerage, of Dukes, Earls, Barons and so on.

00:18:57.551 --> 00:19:02.681
For most people, it is something that doesn’t touch on their life at all, and

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:08.761
if anything, is a curiosity and interesting thing to read about or watch on TV.

00:19:10.301 --> 00:19:15.971
And at the end of the day, the title passes from parent to child, in many

00:19:15.971 --> 00:19:20.891
cases in such a clever way that no inheritance tax is ever paid on it.

00:19:21.851 --> 00:19:27.661
So, for as long as Dukes and Earls keep on having lots of children, and their money

00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:32.701
pots continue to pass from one generation to the next without the taxman getting

00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:37.941
a look inside, there will be more little Lords or Ladies for many years to come.

00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:44.121
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the British

00:19:44.171 --> 00:19:48.121
aristocracy, and what being a Lord or Lady really means.

00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:52.571
As a quick reminder, this was part one of a three-part

00:19:52.571 --> 00:19:56.391
series where we are going to explore British social class.

00:19:56.801 --> 00:20:02.881
Next up, in part two we will talk about the most exclusive school in Britain, Eton, a

00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:07.671
school that has educated a good chunk of the Dukes and Earls we’ve heard about today.

00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:11.961
And in part three we will talk about the “normal” people who

00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:16.121
dashed about fulfilling their master’s orders: the servant class.

00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:20.171
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:24.071
What do you think about these strange titles that we have in Britain?

00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:28.881
Should they be abolished, or are they an important part of British history?

00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:32.551
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

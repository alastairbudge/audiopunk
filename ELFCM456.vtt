Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.030
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.179
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:26.390
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Frederic Tudor.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.148
He was a visionary, in the true sense of the word, and he

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:35.359
single-handedly invented the global ice transportation market.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.069
It’s a fascinating story, of a man who most certainly deserves the nickname of “The Ice King”.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:46.894
OK then, Frederic Tudor, The Ice King.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:53.914
There is an expression in English that someone could “sell ice to the eskimos”.

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:59.564
It means that someone is a smooth and persuasive talker, that they could get

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:04.784
anyone to do anything they wanted, even if it is against their best interests.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:10.104
Eskimos of course have little need for ice.

00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:16.264
People who live in the Arctic Circle are surrounded by more than enough ice if they want it,

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:23.734
and I imagine that the last thing anyone in sub-zero temperatures wants is an ice cold drink.

00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:31.754
It would evidently be much easier to sell ice to someone living in a warm climate, someone who

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:38.574
would love a refreshing ice-cold drink, or who would benefit from ice’s refrigerative powers.

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:45.044
And in the days before industrial freezers, this was even more so.

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.314
People living in warm climates, especially those that weren’t anywhere near

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:56.674
mountain ranges that might have snow or ice on them, well they had no access to ice.

00:01:57.904 --> 00:02:04.714
And further north, or also further south I should add, large parts of the world were covered in

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:12.444
ice, or at least there were rivers and lakes that froze over every year, forming huge masses of ice.

00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:20.780
The only problem was getting this ice from where it occurred naturally to where it did not.

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:28.254
It would take a brave person, a visionary some might even say, to look at this

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:32.934
challenge and say “this is what I am going to dedicate my life to solving”.

00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:37.724
This person’s name was Fredric Tudor.

00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:45.934
You may remember him from episode number 350, when we talked about the Unusual Names of Cocktails.

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:57.274
He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1783, and by his death, in 1864 he would have pioneered

00:02:57.274 --> 00:03:03.894
the transport and sale of ice all over the world, earning himself the nickname of “the Ice King”.

00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:10.334
He was born to a wealthy family, and grew up partially in Boston and

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:14.784
partially in a large estate outside the city, where the family would

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:18.964
spend the summers to escape the city heat, and get some fresh air.

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:25.194
As such, he had experienced firsthand the benefits of having ice.

00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:30.654
Boston is in the north east of the United States, a region

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:34.844
that gets very cold in winter and enjoys warm summers.

00:03:36.394 --> 00:03:39.854
In the grounds of the family’s countryside residence, there

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:43.444
was a large pond that always froze over in the winter.

00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:48.804
Ice would be cut from the pond, and stored in an ice house,

00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:53.164
which was a sort of specially designed insulated shed.

00:03:54.644 --> 00:04:00.984
If the chunks of ice were large enough, and they were cut into holes in the ground and covered up,

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:08.184
the ice would barely melt, allowing the family to use ice in the summer months when it was warmer.

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:14.824
This wasn’t altogether unusual, and there were plenty of

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:18.214
“ice houses” all over the northeastern part of the country.

00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:23.654
Ice would be harvested during the colder months and stored in these large warehouses,

00:04:24.044 --> 00:04:28.774
then sold off to businesses and individuals when the temperature rose in the summer.

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:35.684
Fredric Tudor saw this and thought, well, I can see why someone in

00:04:35.694 --> 00:04:40.194
Boston or New York buys ice in August, the summer months are warm and

00:04:40.194 --> 00:04:44.604
ice is both refreshing in drinks and a useful way of preserving food.

00:04:45.624 --> 00:04:50.684
But how about in the south of the country, or the Caribbean, or even India?

00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:59.194
These are areas that don’t have access to any form of ice, and they need it 365 days a year.

00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:04.384
He had experienced this firsthand when travelling to Cuba.

00:05:04.984 --> 00:05:08.834
It was scorching hot, and the young man would have paid

00:05:08.914 --> 00:05:12.274
any amount of money for some ice to add to his drink.

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.242
In the summer of 1805, when he was 21, he bought a diary which he

00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:24.902
called his “Ice House Diary”, and in it he started to hatch his plan.

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:30.592
In the book, he detailed his thoughts and feelings about a business

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:36.292
opportunity that he felt was guaranteed to make him spectacularly wealthy.

00:05:37.922 --> 00:05:40.292
He didn’t go shouting from the rooftops about it,

00:05:40.352 --> 00:05:42.982
though, out of fear that someone else would copy it.

00:05:43.892 --> 00:05:50.169
He confided in his older brother, William, and the two set out to work on the problem of

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.699
how to transport ice from the rivers and lakes of New England to the south of the country.

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.229
Now, I should probably add that there is some debate about

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.009
whether the idea was Fredric’s or whether it was his brother’s.

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.519
This is a secret that will be consigned to the history books, but whichever of

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:14.739
the pair came up with the idea, clearly it was Fredric that was its main driver.

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:22.169
First was the problem of how to take this from a fledgling business idea to reality.

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.149
As anyone who's ever started a business will know,

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:30.189
business is really a question of supply and demand.

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:36.552
The supply is the thing that you have to sell, the demand is the people who want to buy it.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.749
The Tudor brothers had both, or at least they thought they did.

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.899
Supply was the ice, and that was available in huge

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.999
quantities, for free, in the rivers and lakes around them.

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:57.829
There was new ice every year, a seemingly inexhaustible supply, the only

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:02.799
cost was extracting it, removing the chunks from the rivers and lakes.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.209
And the demand was the people sweltering away in the south of the country.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.069
The brothers didn’t think they needed to do any kind of sophisticated market research,

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:20.149
they had been to the area, they knew it was hot and people didn’t have ice, they knew

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:24.319
that people would want their drinks to be cooler and their food better preserved.

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:30.279
They didn’t need to sell ice to the eskimos, they needed to sell ice to the Louisianans and

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:35.429
the Cubans, it would be business “on easy mode”, at least from the point of convincing someone

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:40.849
in a hot climate that their life would be made more comfortable with the addition of ice.

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:48.319
They had the supply and they knew where to find the demand, but we’re missing something.

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:51.569
Getting the supply to the demand.

00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:58.081
To state the obvious, ice takes up a lot of space and it melts.

00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:02.631
Nobody thought it was possible, nobody was even trying.

00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:07.321
But Fredric was young and full of enthusiasm.

00:08:08.591 --> 00:08:15.151
He had heard stories about ice being transported from Norway to London, and even from

00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:21.731
Paris to Trinidad, it must be possible, he thought, he just needed to figure out how.

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:27.371
His plan was to go to the areas that he wanted to sell the ice too,

00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:31.361
establish an agreement with the local authorities that would grant

00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:36.541
him a monopoly on the ice trade, and then repeat this over and over.

00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:44.481
Now at least when he got started, there was no ice trade, so requesting a monopoly wasn’t

00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:49.261
particularly difficult, his main problem was convincing people that he would actually

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:54.671
be able to transport ice from Massachusetts thousands of kilometres further south.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:09:00.701
His first target was the French island of Martinique, in the Caribbean.

00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:06.781
He sent his brother and his cousin there in late 1805, to present

00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:10.841
their case to the governor, who granted the sought-after monopoly.

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:18.761
Back in Boston, after word had started to get out about the plan, the Tudors found themself

00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:26.051
the object of ridicule, with merchants in Boston society thinking the plan stupid and foolish.

00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:31.551
This didn’t deter Fredric Tudor, but it didn’t make his life any easier.

00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.311
People thought it simply wouldn’t work, and he found it very hard

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:41.731
to find any ship owner willing to risk carrying his icy cargo.

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:46.091
And I do use the word “risk” intentionally.

00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:52.371
Ice was heavy, it would melt on the way, most probably damaging whatever other

00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:57.071
goods were being carried on the boat, and when the melted water went into the

00:09:57.071 --> 00:10:02.601
sea, the boat would be considerably lighter and this would make it less stable.

00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:09.581
Carrying ice was risky for the other goods on a boat, and risky for the boat itself.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:16.061
In the end, Tudor had to buy his own boat, at huge expense.

00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:20.931
What’s more, he had not really figured out how to stop the ice melting.

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:25.591
At this time, there were some ideas about how temperature

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.601
worked, but how to keep stuff cold was still a bit of a mystery.

00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:38.201
Ice houses tended to have thick walls, and the ice was typically packed tight

00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:43.541
and into the ground, but there wasn’t much more known about it than that.

00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:50.761
Tudor didn’t have any great ideas, he didn’t have a scientific background or

00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:56.761
anything like that, but he figured he would try his best, and learn as he went along.

00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:03.651
And back in Boston, he ran into another problem that he hadn’t anticipated.

00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:09.511
It had been a particularly cold winter, which was good in terms of ensuring that there was more

00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:16.001
than enough ice to harvest, but the weather was so bad that the ship couldn’t leave on time.

00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:23.511
Eventually, on the 13th of February, 1806, the ship departed Boston

00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:28.591
harbour, packed to the brim with ice, 130 tonnes of the stuff.

00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:35.661
It arrived 3 weeks later in Martinique, without major loss, but it is

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:39.621
here that we realise that the Tudors hadn’t done all of their homework.

00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:46.811
As there was no ice industry in Martinique, nobody there had any idea what to do with it.

00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:50.931
There were no ice houses, no way of storing it.

00:11:52.054 --> 00:11:57.724
The ice had to remain on the boat, with curious passers by coming to the boat to

00:11:57.724 --> 00:12:03.504
inspect it and buy it directly, only to hurry home with the ice wrapped in cloth.

00:12:04.944 --> 00:12:09.074
Fredric Tudor had hoped to sell $10,000 of the stuff,

00:12:09.574 --> 00:12:13.124
which is something like $250,000 in today’s money.

00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:22.994
In his first two days, he sold a grand total of $50, and the ice was melting before his eyes.

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:30.055
He returned to Boston in late April, having made a significant loss on the trip.

00:12:31.345 --> 00:12:37.255
He knew that he would face the wrath of the Boston business community, with scores of people

00:12:37.565 --> 00:12:43.475
telling him that he was foolish, and muttering “I told you so”, but it seems that Fredric

00:12:43.485 --> 00:12:49.865
Tudor was incredibly stubborn, or too proud to give up, or possessing remarkable foresight.

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:51.725
Or all three.

00:12:53.264 --> 00:12:59.164
He had seen that it was possible to transport ice to the Caribbean, and people

00:12:59.254 --> 00:13:05.234
seemed interested in it when it arrived, now it was a question of making sure that

00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:09.814
there were adequate storage facilities for his merchandise when it arrived there.

00:13:11.204 --> 00:13:15.874
They hadn’t bought it, Tudor thought, because they didn’t know how to store it.

00:13:17.354 --> 00:13:22.394
He tried to secure a monopoly on the ice trade with Cuba, but it wasn’t granted.

00:13:23.564 --> 00:13:27.304
Nevertheless, he built an ice house in Havana, and

00:13:27.564 --> 00:13:30.574
proceeded to deliver ice to the island the following year.

00:13:31.914 --> 00:13:37.174
It was a moderate success, but far from the home run that he had hoped for.

00:13:38.594 --> 00:13:44.034
What’s more, his up-until-then buoyant family finances were taking a hit.

00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:49.434
In other words, his father was running out of money, and there wasn’t

00:13:49.444 --> 00:13:54.414
much left to support this seemingly foolhardy entrepreneurial venture.

00:13:55.924 --> 00:14:01.334
And Tudor still hadn’t properly figured out the best way to stop the ice melting.

00:14:02.204 --> 00:14:07.784
He took it upon himself to do some crude experiments, and came to the conclusion

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:14.114
that peat, the soil-like substance, was particularly good at insulating the ice.

00:14:15.134 --> 00:14:19.174
If he could properly insulate the ice on the ship, and also

00:14:19.394 --> 00:14:22.897
when it got to its destination, he would have cracked it.

00:14:23.974 --> 00:14:29.564
The insulation on the ship was important not only to stop his precious ice melting, it was also

00:14:29.584 --> 00:14:35.604
important because he needed to convince ship owners that melting ice wouldn’t damage their ship.

00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:42.954
If he could convince ship owners to transport his cargo, he would also be doing them a favour.

00:14:44.094 --> 00:14:48.894
See, Boston was an import, rather than an export port.

00:14:49.944 --> 00:14:55.364
Ships arrived packed to the brim with goods, which were unloaded and then sold.

00:14:56.274 --> 00:14:58.624
And the ships then left…empty.

00:15:00.124 --> 00:15:05.684
This was a problem for the ship owners, not just because they weren’t making any money on

00:15:05.684 --> 00:15:11.994
the outward journey, but because the ships were very light, and would capsize more easily.

00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:19.974
As such, many ship owners would even fill up their ships with stones and rocks, to make

00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:24.764
them heavier, only to throw them overboard when they got to their final destination.

00:15:25.914 --> 00:15:31.924
So, if Tudor could find a way to properly insulate the ice, he would be

00:15:31.924 --> 00:15:36.794
able to pay the ship owners a very low rate to transport it, because he

00:15:36.794 --> 00:15:40.164
would be saving them money as they wouldn’t need the stones any more.

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:45.244
It was the money-making opportunity of a lifetime.

00:15:45.874 --> 00:15:50.054
The ice was free, he just needed to pay people to cut it out from the lakes.

00:15:50.724 --> 00:15:54.394
The transport would be practically free, or at least

00:15:54.664 --> 00:15:57.724
very cheap, as he would be saving the ship owners money.

00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:04.624
And when it got to its final destination, there was no price a sweltering

00:16:04.634 --> 00:16:10.194
merchant in Havana or Charleston, or later even Mumbai, no price

00:16:10.234 --> 00:16:14.804
they wouldn’t pay for some refreshing New England ice in their drink.

00:16:16.304 --> 00:16:19.794
As I’m sure anyone who has started their own business will know firsthand,

00:16:20.244 --> 00:16:25.084
the process was full of obstacles, false starts and near misses.

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:32.474
Fredric was arrested for non-payment of a business debt, his family almost went bankrupt, there

00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:38.654
were unexpected bribes to be paid to local officials, shipwrecks, trade embargoes and more.

00:16:40.064 --> 00:16:46.304
The entire operation didn’t turn a profit until 1810, and even then

00:16:46.544 --> 00:16:52.774
it was a profit of a mere $1,000, around $25,000 in today’s money.

00:16:54.144 --> 00:16:58.704
But from then, things soon started to go in a more positive direction.

00:16:59.794 --> 00:17:06.594
Now, his career as “The Ice King” lasted almost 50 years, too long for me to give an

00:17:06.614 --> 00:17:13.014
accurate chronological account, but his success came down to technological advances, a

00:17:13.054 --> 00:17:18.444
cut-throat approach to competition and an understanding of the importance of monopoly.

00:17:19.904 --> 00:17:23.214
On a technological level, he was fighting nature.

00:17:23.754 --> 00:17:27.134
He couldn’t stop the ice melting, but he could do

00:17:27.134 --> 00:17:30.664
his utmost to get it to melt as slowly as possible.

00:17:31.994 --> 00:17:37.154
To do this he would constantly tinker and experiment with new designs for

00:17:37.184 --> 00:17:41.644
ice houses, making them more and more efficient with every passing year.

00:17:43.054 --> 00:17:47.444
And if you are wondering what the key to a successful ice house was, it

00:17:47.444 --> 00:17:52.574
involved a combination of insulation and ventilation, and making sure

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:56.984
that the melted water was taken away from the ice as quickly as possible.

00:17:58.554 --> 00:18:05.384
As sales grew, he also ran into a problem he hadn’t anticipated, and a nice problem to have.

00:18:06.504 --> 00:18:08.004
He was running out of ice.

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:15.734
When rivers or ponds freeze, they freeze from the top downwards, and even in the

00:18:15.744 --> 00:18:21.294
freezing winters of New England, only the top half a metre or so would become ice.

00:18:21.924 --> 00:18:25.944
No matter how cold it got, the ice would be not much more than

00:18:25.994 --> 00:18:30.694
50 centimetres thick, so the water below would remain liquid.

00:18:31.864 --> 00:18:37.134
A clever trick that Tudor figured out was that if he drilled into the ice until he hit the

00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:44.364
water below, the water would rise up through the hole, the ice would sink, and the water on

00:18:44.364 --> 00:18:50.274
top would freeze, thereby increasing the amount of ice that he could extract from each pond.

00:18:51.404 --> 00:18:56.314
In terms of the competition, his better understanding of insulation, as well as

00:18:56.314 --> 00:19:01.664
faster ships meant that his ice would melt less quickly than his competitors’,

00:19:02.054 --> 00:19:07.174
so he could charge a lower price, in the knowledge that selling their ice at the

00:19:07.174 --> 00:19:12.469
same price would be unsustainable for all but the hardiest of his competitors.

00:19:13.434 --> 00:19:20.084
And on the monopoly question, he managed to acquire monopolies in everywhere from Martinque to the

00:19:20.094 --> 00:19:26.144
British West Indies to a destination that would prove to be the jewel in his ice crown, Calcutta.

00:19:27.454 --> 00:19:33.924
Now, he first sent ice to Calcutta in 1833, and he estimated that

00:19:33.934 --> 00:19:39.054
in the 20 years that it was in operation, that single route made

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:45.354
him $200,000, which is something like $7.5 million in today’s money.

00:19:46.804 --> 00:19:53.454
As you might expect, his success meant that the market became increasingly crowded and competitive.

00:19:54.334 --> 00:20:00.034
After all, ice was freely available in all of the ponds and rivers of New England, and

00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:05.404
Tudor’s technological advancements at the Ice Houses were visible for everyone to see.

00:20:06.754 --> 00:20:12.134
He had used technology to his advantage, but, perhaps ironically, it would

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:16.354
be a technological development that would cause Tudor’s entire business

00:20:16.354 --> 00:20:21.884
to evaporate, but that wouldn’t be until well after his death, in 1864.

00:20:23.284 --> 00:20:28.994
Artificial ice plants, which were essentially huge freezers that created ice out

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:34.234
of water, started to become more widespread in the second half of the 19th century,

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:40.214
but they were initially very expensive, and it was cheaper to transport natural ice.

00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:48.984
But with time, this changed, and moving into the 20th century the market for ice, or

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:54.054
“frozen water” as it was called by those in the industry, was starting to melt away.

00:20:55.324 --> 00:21:01.604
Today, not much remains, with barely an ice house or ship from this time still standing.

00:21:02.714 --> 00:21:07.034
What most certainly does remain is the legacy of Fredric Tudor,

00:21:07.574 --> 00:21:12.754
a man who undoubtedly deserves the title of “The Ice King”.

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:20.426
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Fredric Tudor, The Ice King.

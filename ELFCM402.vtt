Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:17.197
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:21.267
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:27.447
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the French Foreign Legion.

00:00:28.277 --> 00:00:32.817
It is, by some measures, the toughest fighting force in the world.

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.307
It is notoriously difficult to get into, the training is

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:41.747
hellish, the conditions once you’re in are extremely harsh.

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:45.927
Yet it continues to attract people from all over the

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:50.697
world, drawn by the promise of a fresh start and adventure.

00:00:51.237 --> 00:00:56.387
So, in this episode we’ll talk about the origins of the French Foreign Legion,

00:00:56.747 --> 00:01:02.337
how you join it, what life is like as a Legionnaire, and why it continues to

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:07.087
attract thousands of people each year from almost every country in the world.

00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:11.173
OK then, The French Foreign Legion.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:16.373
In Britain, people like to eat boiled eggs for breakfast.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:23.223
Most popular are soft boiled eggs, eggs that are boiled in their shells, but

00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:29.133
taken out of the water before the yellow part in the centre, the yolk, goes hard.

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:37.443
You remove the egg from the boiling water, put it onto a small egg cup, then slice the

00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:44.423
top of the egg off with a knife, giving you access to the lovely runny yellow yolk.

00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:50.273
And, crucially, while the egg was in the boiling water, you would have made

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:57.603
toast and cut it into slices, strips of toast that you can dip into the yolk.

00:01:58.943 --> 00:02:03.243
The name for these strips is “soldiers”, because

00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:06.923
they look, sort of like a group of marching soldiers.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.670
Remember this, it’ll be important.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.180
Now, you thought you were listening to an episode about the French Foreign Legion

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.850
but up until now it has been a very basic cooking lesson told by a very amateur chef.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.984
The reason I mention this is so that you can understand a particularly bad British

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:36.274
joke, and that is “what is the difference between a Frenchman and a piece of toast?”

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:40.585
You can make a soldier out of a piece of toast.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:45.405
Now, apologies to all of our wonderful French listeners.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.415
There was no offence intended.

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:52.265
I have many French friends, I have French cousins, I chose to study French at

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:57.105
university, I speak French, I’ve lived in France and I love France as a place.

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.435
But, rightly or wrongly, there is a stereotype in Britain

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:07.275
of the French not being the most ferocious of fighters.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:13.765
There is, however, one branch of the French army having an altogether

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:20.485
different reputation, a reputation for extreme skill, bravery, and toughness.

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:27.162
That branch is, of course, the subject of today’s episode, the French Foreign

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:33.562
Legion, or La Légion étrangère, to give it its French name, or simply, the Legion.

00:03:34.992 --> 00:03:37.492
So, how did it all get started?

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:46.832
Well, the legion was incorporated in 1831, by the second last king of France, Louis Philippe I.

00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:54.914
Initially, it wasn’t intended as some elite fighting force, it was created as a

00:03:54.934 --> 00:04:00.484
solution to the problem of France being filled with thousands of foreign soldiers.

00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:06.744
France has a long history of bolstering its armies with foreign

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:11.884
recruits, ranging from Swiss to German, Polish to Scottish.

00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:19.724
By one estimate, at the end of the 18th century, of the 146,000 soldiers

00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:25.733
serving in the French army, 42,000 of them were foreigners, so 30%.

00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:33.194
So, what happens to these foreign soldiers when there isn’t a war to fight?

00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:38.734
This was a very real question for France in 1830, when

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:42.204
there was a rare moment of peace after the July Revolution.

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:49.614
There were thousands of foreign recruits who were milling around, unemployed, at a loose end.

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:56.624
Many were relatively unskilled, some had joined the army to get away from

00:04:56.624 --> 00:05:00.930
troubles in their home country, and they were drifting around France.

00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:07.675
They were a burden on the French state, and they potentially posed trouble.

00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:11.285
But, Louis Phillipe had a solution.

00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:17.015
It was a cunning solution, because it didn’t just solve the problem of

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:21.805
the thousands of now unemployed soldiers roaming around France, it also

00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:26.175
solved a problem on the other side of the Mediterranean, in Algeria.

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:33.245
France had invaded Algeria in 1830 in a bid to colonise it.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.565
After a promising start, French forces met fierce

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:43.025
resistance, and reinforcements, more soldiers, were needed.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:50.598
And it just so happened that there were thousands of ex-soldiers floating around in France.

00:05:51.645 --> 00:05:56.665
Importantly, thousands of these soldiers were foreigners, they were not

00:05:56.665 --> 00:06:03.025
French, and so if they died in battle, so be it, they weren’t French after all.

00:06:04.415 --> 00:06:08.685
The war in Algeria was already unpopular, and it would be

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:12.845
politically risky to spill the blood of French soldiers.

00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:22.515
So it was, in March 1831, a royal ordinance was issued, creating a new regiment which

00:06:22.525 --> 00:06:29.515
foreign nationals could join, but one that was limited to fighting outside of French borders.

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:33.915
Right from the beginning of the French Foreign Legion,

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:37.835
the conditions for who could join were minimal.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:43.945
If you did not have identity papers, you could simply declare who you were.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:48.875
You could also enlist under a pseudonym, another name.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:56.045
Essentially, who you were or what you had done in the past did not matter.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.295
The only important thing was what you would do in the

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:03.645
future, as a soldier in the French Foreign Legion.

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:11.155
Now, we will talk more specifically about the conflicts that the Legion has been involved in, and

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:17.335
what life in the Legion is like, but before we do that, I think it’s important to consider the

00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:23.715
very strange and somewhat conflicted situation that the men of the Legion found themselves in.

00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:30.938
And the Legion is, in fact, all men; there has apparently only ever been one female member.

00:07:32.158 --> 00:07:38.718
So, you have these thousands of soldiers, Swiss, German, Polish, Italian,

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:45.128
Spanish, even some English, all having sworn allegiance to another country,

00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:51.888
to France, and being deployed to fight and die for French colonial interests.

00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:58.688
If one takes for granted that a key factor in someone taking up arms and

00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:05.158
becoming a soldier is a sense of patriotism, well, this reason did not exist

00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:09.228
for these men, they were fighting for a country that was not their own,

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:14.138
typically in areas of the world that they would have had little knowledge of.

00:08:15.588 --> 00:08:22.188
What’s more, they were often sent to the most difficult conflicts and given the most dangerous jobs.

00:08:23.768 --> 00:08:29.228
It is unusual to say the least, but this gives you some idea both

00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:34.057
of the lack of alternatives that these men must have had, and the

00:08:34.057 --> 00:08:38.038
serious discipline that must have been required to keep them in-line.

00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:42.028
Now, we need to first talk about Algeria.

00:08:42.908 --> 00:08:50.008
Algeria was the first posting for the Legion, and it has forever been associated with Algeria.

00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:57.448
As you may know, the colonial conquest of Algeria was long and messy, with

00:08:57.618 --> 00:09:03.110
French forces, by their own admission, committing all sorts of horrific acts.

00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:10.698
To quote one French commission from 1833, "we have sent to their deaths on simple

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:16.618
suspicion and without trial people whose guilt was always doubtful ... we massacred

00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:22.238
people carrying safe conducts ... we have outdone in barbarity the barbarians".

00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:26.885
And this was where the soldiers of the Legion cut

00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:30.298
their teeth, they got their start and made their name.

00:09:31.808 --> 00:09:36.248
The Legion, however, was not actually involved in the first conflict

00:09:36.248 --> 00:09:41.868
in Algeria for very long, leaving in 1835, when it was sent to Spain

00:09:42.108 --> 00:09:46.778
to help Queen Isabella II in her fight against the Carlist uprising.

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:53.313
In fact, the Legion was handed over to the Spanish briefly during the conflict,

00:09:53.728 --> 00:09:58.998
and a new iteration of it, the so-called “New Foreign Legion” was formed.

00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:05.895
Here, some important changes were made, changes that persist to this very day.

00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:11.238
Previously, people from the same country were put in the

00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:16.218
same units: Swiss with Swiss, Poles with Poles, and so on.

00:10:17.728 --> 00:10:21.698
This policy was scrapped, with everyone being mixed.

00:10:22.748 --> 00:10:27.428
And secondly, French was enforced as the language of command.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.578
Both of these policies still exist today.

00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:36.098
If you join the Legion, and we’ll talk about that shortly, if you

00:10:36.308 --> 00:10:40.018
join the Legion, you will find yourself with a range of different

00:10:40.028 --> 00:10:44.908
nationalities, and you will find that the language you speak is French.

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:54.088
Now, after its time in Spain, the Legion was and still is sent all over the world to support the

00:10:54.088 --> 00:11:02.988
French army, and serve the interests of the French state: Crimea, Mexico, Prussia, Sudan, Gallipoli,

00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:11.118
Vietnam, Algeria again, Korea, Chad, Libya, the Gulf War, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:16.148
Essentially, wherever in the world there was the need for French

00:11:16.148 --> 00:11:20.458
soldiers, for better or for worse, the Legion could be found.

00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:28.438
Now, let’s move on to talk a little bit more about how you actually join the French Foreign Legion.

00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:32.868
It is both very easy and very hard.

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:40.058
It is easy because you need no qualifications, no university or school diploma.

00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:45.098
You can be from any country in the world, you do not need to be French.

00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:50.768
In fact, most Legionnaires are not French, they are foreigners.

00:11:52.308 --> 00:11:58.368
True to the Legion’s origins of not questioning your past, on the Legion’s recruitment website

00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:05.718
there is no mention of having a criminal record being a barrier to entry, although reportedly the

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:12.008
Legion will not accept people who have committed serious crimes: rape, murder, that sort of thing.

00:12:12.968 --> 00:12:16.758
So, on paper, anyone can join, it’s easy!

00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:20.088
Or at least, it might seem easy.

00:12:21.298 --> 00:12:25.158
Actually getting accepted is a different thing altogether.

00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:30.988
First, you have to travel to mainland France and literally

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:34.608
knock on the door of one of the recruitment offices.

00:12:35.318 --> 00:12:41.348
There are no online applications, no letters of recommendation, nothing like that.

00:12:42.508 --> 00:12:47.028
Buy a ticket to France, go to a centre, knock on the door.

00:12:47.988 --> 00:12:55.818
The Legion proudly boasts that it recruits 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year,

00:12:56.448 --> 00:13:01.528
although it does suggest that it’s best to come between 8 in the morning and 5 in the evening.

00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:08.768
When you go there, there is an intense interview process, involving psychological

00:13:08.968 --> 00:13:14.079
and physical tests to see whether you are cut out for life as a Legionnaire.

00:13:14.738 --> 00:13:19.948
It doesn’t matter if you can speak French or not; if you’re accepted, you will learn on the job.

00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:26.458
After a three-week selection process, you are informed if you have made the cut.

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.728
Only 10 to 15 percent of applicants make it.

00:13:31.848 --> 00:13:38.328
For those who don’t, they are told to leave, paid a sum of €40 per day for

00:13:38.328 --> 00:13:42.208
every day that they have been doing the training, and sent on their way.

00:13:43.628 --> 00:13:47.128
For those who make it, life as a Legionnaire awaits.

00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:52.208
This involves signing a 5-year contract, which is the

00:13:52.218 --> 00:13:55.258
minimum amount of time that you are required to join for.

00:13:56.728 --> 00:14:00.928
You also receive a completely new identity, and a new name.

00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:06.648
Who you were in the past, or what you have done in the past, does not matter.

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:10.248
You have the chance to start from scratch.

00:14:11.678 --> 00:14:16.368
In a sign of how much you leave your previous life at the door when you enter the

00:14:16.368 --> 00:14:22.808
Legion, you are not allowed to bring any keys with you, house keys, car keys, nothing.

00:14:23.818 --> 00:14:28.258
When you step through the doors, you leave your previous life behind.

00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:30.758
You are literally a new person.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:40.661
The salary is modest by French standards; for a basic legionnaire it is a net salary of just

00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:48.081
under €1,400 per month, but your accommodation and food is all paid for, you have no major costs.

00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:53.561
Especially for recruits from less economically developed countries,

00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:59.021
be that Nepal, Brazil or Ukraine, the prospect of a new life in

00:14:59.021 --> 00:15:03.561
Europe with a decent salary is understandably a major attraction.

00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:11.071
What’s more, if you perform well, after three years you can become a French citizen.

00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:15.767
Now, back to the process of actually becoming a legionnaire.

00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:21.781
After you are selected, there is an even more arduous training process.

00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:28.231
What actually happens during this process is not public information, but

00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:32.951
former recruits have shared stories about what their training looked like.

00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:39.481
In one account from a recruit in the 1960s, it involved recruits having

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:43.681
to run with stones on their back while their superior whipped them.

00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:51.831
Another account recalls a punishment called “le silo”, the silo, a funnel-shaped hole

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:57.581
which misbehaving recruits would be thrown into, only to be retrieved days later.

00:15:59.131 --> 00:16:02.911
And if you are thinking that this sort of grilling, this kind

00:16:02.911 --> 00:16:06.591
of extreme training, is all a thing of the past, it is not.

00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:12.871
The French Foreign Legion’s unofficial motto is “Marche ou crève”,

00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:19.411
which you might translate as “sink or swim”, or even “march or die”.

00:16:20.911 --> 00:16:25.121
And this is sometimes taken to its literal meaning.

00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:32.371
In 2008 a 25-year-old Slovakian recruit was on one of the Legion’s

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:38.321
famous long marches in the desert, this time in Djibouti, in East Africa.

00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:46.641
He complained of a pain in his knee, but his commanding officer told him to “stop complaining”.

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:51.768
Well, one imagines he might have used slightly more colourful language than that…

00:16:53.098 --> 00:16:59.878
Anyway, he told him to get up, and he even took out all of the man’s water and poured it

00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:06.108
on the floor, ordering the other legionnaires not to give the man any of their own water.

00:17:07.368 --> 00:17:13.138
The soldier continued to complain, and as punishment was made to stay out

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:18.588
in the sun, and forced to run all the way up a hill in the 40 degree heat.

00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:22.518
According to one source, he was even beaten.

00:17:23.468 --> 00:17:26.618
He begged for water, but none was given.

00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:32.988
And shortly after, he keeled over and died of a heart attack, a

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:37.688
perfectly healthy and fit man, thousands of kilometres from home, his

00:17:37.688 --> 00:17:43.276
real name not known to anyone around him, dead in the desert aged 25.

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:51.246
Of course, this is an extreme example, but Legionnaires dying is certainly not uncommon.

00:17:52.666 --> 00:17:57.476
Over the years, 36,000 Legionnaires have died fighting

00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:01.556
for France, a country that is almost always not their own.

00:18:03.056 --> 00:18:07.556
If you look on the Legion’s website, they provide details of the men who have

00:18:07.556 --> 00:18:12.936
been killed in action: when and where they died and their original country.

00:18:14.466 --> 00:18:19.076
It is a stark reminder that behind every death statistic is a human

00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:23.746
being, in the case of a Legionnaire, someone who has left their country

00:18:23.746 --> 00:18:28.676
of birth, travelled to France, and left their previous life behind.

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:33.346
And in almost all cases, they are young men.

00:18:34.726 --> 00:18:36.906
Dmytro MARTYNYOUK from Ukraine.

00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:38.416
29 years old.

00:18:39.923 --> 00:18:42.613
Anthony Paiba Valverde from Ecuador.

00:18:43.353 --> 00:18:44.333
24 years old.

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.113
Bogusz POCHYLSKI, from Poland.

00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:49.583
31 years old.

00:18:50.723 --> 00:18:53.623
All young men who fought and died for France.

00:18:54.523 --> 00:19:00.243
Yes, they did so voluntarily, but reading their stories, at least the little that

00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:04.553
is published about them, makes you wonder what life they must have left behind.

00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:10.173
So, to wrap things up, yes, becoming a legionnaire is

00:19:10.173 --> 00:19:13.103
an extremely difficult and physically demanding job.

00:19:13.963 --> 00:19:17.013
There is a high chance of danger and death.

00:19:17.813 --> 00:19:19.073
The pay is modest.

00:19:19.363 --> 00:19:22.203
And you are fighting on behalf of a country that,

00:19:22.603 --> 00:19:25.363
in all probability, you have absolutely no link to.

00:19:26.803 --> 00:19:29.173
But there are plenty of rewards.

00:19:29.843 --> 00:19:31.963
Your unit becomes your new family.

00:19:32.563 --> 00:19:36.283
You get a roof over your head, and three square meals a day.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:43.173
Yes, the pay is moderate, but it might be a marked improvement on your current situation.

00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:48.213
You get a new identity, a new name, and the opportunity

00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:52.263
for a fresh start and a new life as a French citizen.

00:19:53.383 --> 00:20:01.283
Clearly, for tens of thousands of men since 1831, this is more than enough to risk dying for.

00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:08.841
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the French Foreign Legion.

00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:12.341
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:15.651
Do you know anyone who has been in the French Foreign Legion?

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:19.251
Are you a part of a group of Legionnaires listening to this together?

00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:20.191
That would be fun!

00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:24.331
And are there similar crack-military units in your country?

00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:28.251
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:31.411

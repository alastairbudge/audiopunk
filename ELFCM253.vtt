Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:17.279
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.589
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:26.559
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.569
Niccolò Machiavelli, and his most famous work, The Prince.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.989
He is a man whose very name has become synonymous with a certain immoral

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:42.049
behaviour - if someone is Machiavellian it means they are unscrupulous,

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:47.479
scheming, or cunning, and they will let nothing get between them and power.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:56.209
To explain how the name of an Italian diplomat, philosopher and author has become synonymous with

00:00:56.279 --> 00:01:03.229
treachery and deception, we’re going to travel back in time to Florence in the Early Renaissance.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.326
It was an intense period divided by social upheaval, wars and

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:13.796
political intrigue, yet unified by art, culture and literature.

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:18.126
There’s plenty to discover, and there is a lot more to

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:22.576
Machiavelli than many people think, so let’s dive right into it.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:26.866
Ok then, The Prince by Machiavelli.

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:31.886
Let’s get started by taking a closer look at Machiavelli himself.

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.066
Who actually was Niccolò Machiavelli?

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:37.356
What do we know about his life?

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:43.926
And how did the tumultuous, or agitated, turbulent times in which

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:48.736
Machiavelli lived shape his beliefs and inspire his writings?

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:54.306
Niccolò Machiavelli was born in 1469 in Florence,

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:58.536
Italy, to a family descended from Florentine nobility.

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:04.096
At the time, Florence was the very epicentre of European

00:02:04.286 --> 00:02:08.018
art and culture as the birthplace of the Renaissance.

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:16.196
The Renaissance, as I am sure you will know, was the transitional period between the 14-17th

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:24.306
centuries that revived and attempted to surpass achievements and ideas from classical antiquity.

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:31.366
In contrast to the so-called Dark Ages or Middle Ages, following the fall of

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:37.566
the Western Roman Empire, the Renaissance was a fervent, an intense period of

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:44.506
rediscovery, as well as cultural, scientific, philosophical and artistic progress.

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:51.016
And, as you may well be aware, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:58.126
was fragmented, it was split up into numerous self-ruling city-states and districts.

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:02.819
There was no united Italian nation until 1861.

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:09.203
While Florence was a republic, power was mainly concentrated in the

00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:15.013
hands of wealthy families, especially the influential Medici family who

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:19.963
dominated the Florentine representative government for several centuries.

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:24.613
If you’d like to learn more about the Medici, we

00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:28.310
have an episode on that too, it’s episode number 90.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.843
Well, back to Machiavelli and Florence.

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:39.713
Machiavelli lived in turbulent times, popes would wage wars against city-states, while the

00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:46.323
Holy Roman Empire, France and Spain battled for greater regional influence and control.

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:53.153
Governments were often short-lived and political alliances changed frequently,

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:59.373
as did the mercenary, the paid soldiers who were prone to changing sides without

00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:04.823
warning, depending on which way the wind blew and who paid the most money.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:14.153
It’s undoubtedly thanks to this backdrop of instability and upheaval, of social manoeuvring and

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:21.553
intense power struggles that Machiavelli got the inspiration for his most famous work The Prince.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:29.623
In terms of Machiavelli's life, biographers tend to split it into three distinct

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:35.503
parts, each of which also relates to a distinct period of Florentine history.

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:41.043
The first period of Machiavelli’s life runs from his birth

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:47.483
in 1469 up to the year 1494, the first 25 years of his life.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:54.103
Although for most people this is where much of your character is formed, it’s

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:59.613
crystalised, we have little documentation of Machiavelli’s youth, although

00:04:59.823 --> 00:05:05.343
we do know he was taught rhetoric, grammar and Latin by a well-known teacher.

00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:11.363
During this period, Florence was indirectly ruled by Lorenzo

00:05:11.363 --> 00:05:15.603
de’ Medici, also known as Il Magnifico, the Magnificent.

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:24.323
Lorenzo de’ Medici was the most powerful and ardent, enthusiastic, patron of Renaissance culture.

00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:32.863
However, in 1494, just two years after Lorenzo’s death, the Medici lost power.

00:05:33.443 --> 00:05:38.573
Lorenzo’s son and heir, Piero de’ Medici, was formally exiled

00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:43.706
and the Medici were not to rule Florence again until 1512.

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:53.513
The period of 1494-1512, when Florence was free from the rule of the Medici, forms the second

00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:59.783
part of Machiavelli’s life, during which he served the free Republic of Florence, and it’s

00:05:59.803 --> 00:06:06.213
during this period that it seems that most of his political thought and ideology was shaped.

00:06:07.223 --> 00:06:12.463
Machiavelli was first appointed to an office responsible for reproducing

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:17.618
official government documents, before rising to an important diplomatic role.

00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:24.668
In this role Machiavelli conducted numerous important diplomatic missions meeting

00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:30.718
with Louis XII of France, Emperor Maximilian, the Spanish court and the papacy.

00:06:31.638 --> 00:06:36.351
A lot of Machiavelli’s time spent as a diplomat was occupied with Pope

00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:42.958
Alexander VI and his illegitimate but incredibly powerful son, Cesare Borgia.

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:52.038
The father and son had huge ambitions to carve out a central Italian state for their own benefit.

00:06:53.438 --> 00:07:01.568
Cesare Borgia’s ruthless quest to expand his lands, his immense capabilities as a statesman, general

00:07:01.698 --> 00:07:08.898
and ruler, alongside his ultimate failure to retain power are all discussed at length in The Prince.

00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:13.508
So, now for the third period of Machiavelli’s life.

00:07:14.448 --> 00:07:21.608
France, Germany and Spain allied with a new pope, Pope Julius II, to form the

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:27.348
League of Cambrai with the main intent of crushing the powerful Venetian Republic.

00:07:28.168 --> 00:07:35.898
However, despite the league’s initial success, friction began to grow between the pope and France.

00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:41.888
Ultimately, this led to the pope hiring an army of mercenaries,

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:46.048
of paid soldiers, to drive the French out of Italy.

00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:53.858
This left the Republic of Florence in a delicate situation, having been a long-term ally of France.

00:07:54.618 --> 00:07:59.108
Florence had no choice but to comply with the pope’s demands,

00:07:59.388 --> 00:08:03.098
one of which was to restore the Medici family to power.

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:10.858
Thus in 1512 the Medici returned to rule Florence and Machiavelli was sacked.

00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:19.748
Worse still, he was imprisoned and tortured, under suspicion of having conspired or plotted

00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:25.338
to overthrow the Medici family, which there is no evidence of him having done, by the way.

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:33.078
After the death of Pope Julius II, his successor, Pope Leo X secured Machiavelli’s

00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:38.208
release from prison, and Machiavelli plotted his return to political life.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:43.928
This third and final part of Machiavelli’s life saw him

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:48.188
retreat to his small rural property just outside of Florence.

00:08:49.378 --> 00:08:53.918
It is during this time that he penned, he wrote, The Prince

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:58.878
and his first Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius.

00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:04.408
While neither of these two works, his two most famous writings, were

00:09:04.408 --> 00:09:09.318
published during his lifetime, Machiavelli did write a number of successful

00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:13.378
plays that were popular and widely enjoyed by his contemporaries.

00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:19.408
But he struggled to accept his fate as removed from political life

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:24.478
and his correspondence from this time shows that he attempted to stay

00:09:24.478 --> 00:09:29.148
involved in the political sphere through his friends with connections.

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:36.738
Ultimately, it was not to be and Machiavelli did not manage to take up his old diplomatic post.

00:09:37.448 --> 00:09:41.408
He did, however, manage to achieve a re-entry of

00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:44.878
sorts into society - literary society in particular.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:52.248
In 1520, Giulio de Medici commissioned Machiavelli to write a history of Florence.

00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:58.268
Machiavelli accepted in the hope of getting back into the good books of the Medici

00:09:58.268 --> 00:10:04.608
family, and wrote an eight-part work that portrays the Medici in a favourable light.

00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:11.398
Having Giulio de Medici as a friend and ally would turn out to be a positive thing for

00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:17.863
Machiavelli, because three years later Giulio de Medici would become Pope Clement VII.

00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:24.278
But there are limits to even the pope’s power, as Clement VII found out

00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:29.918
in 1526 when Rome was sacked by the Holy Roman Emperor, the pope was

00:10:29.918 --> 00:10:34.258
kept prisoner and eventually the Medici were kicked out of Florence.

00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:41.718
Machiavelli, ever hopeful of a full return to political life, quickly returned to Florence,

00:10:41.758 --> 00:10:49.464
but shortly after his arrival he took ill and died in June 1527, at the age of 58.

00:10:50.307 --> 00:10:54.478
Now, I know that there were a lot of names and dates there,

00:10:54.678 --> 00:10:58.078
and you are certainly not expected to remember all of them.

00:10:58.718 --> 00:11:02.818
We've really rushed through it, but I share this with you to

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:06.728
give you an idea of the society in which Machiavelli lived.

00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:12.638
It’s very clear that the political upheaval, numerous wars and

00:11:12.668 --> 00:11:18.008
constantly changing alliances were the norm rather than the exception.

00:11:18.868 --> 00:11:24.798
So, where does Machiavelli’s most famous work, The Prince fit into all of this?

00:11:25.158 --> 00:11:27.208
What is The Prince actually about?

00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:29.728
And why are we still reading it today?

00:11:30.828 --> 00:11:35.488
The Prince, in Machiavelli’s own words, is a discussion of the

00:11:35.508 --> 00:11:40.058
conduct of great men and the principles of princely government.

00:11:40.988 --> 00:11:47.438
The text is loosely based on the mirror-of-princes genre - a type of literary work

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:54.298
that advises princes on how to best rule, almost like a handbook of government.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:12:01.628
This genre originated in Ancient Greece and went on to lay the foundations for

00:12:01.628 --> 00:12:07.678
Renaissance political theories, which in turn paved the way for modern political science.

00:12:08.418 --> 00:12:14.738
However, The Prince varies from other works in this genre in its content and style.

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:22.458
Firstly, Machiavelli focuses on ‘new’ princes in The Prince rather than the more traditional

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:28.478
audience of a hereditary prince, a prince who becomes a prince because he is born a prince.

00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:34.998
He states that hereditary princes come to power more easily and retain,

00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:39.978
they keep hold of power, by not upsetting the established scheme of things.

00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:47.078
On the other hand, new princes, Machiavelli notes, find it more difficult to rule.

00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:54.298
They must first of all cement their power with secure and stable foundations.

00:12:55.068 --> 00:12:58.978
The rise to power may be challenging and the previously

00:12:58.998 --> 00:13:02.548
existing order difficult to topple or bring down.

00:13:04.038 --> 00:13:08.948
However, Machiavelli also believed that once a new prince had fully

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:14.168
secured power, he would find it easier to retain it, to keep hold of it.

00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:22.228
This is an important concept in The Prince, with Machiavelli writing that for a new prince to rise

00:13:22.348 --> 00:13:29.628
to the top and secure power, he needs to do it through his own virtues, using cunning and force.

00:13:31.068 --> 00:13:35.708
Once he has forcefully crushed his opponents, the new prince

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:39.928
will earn respect, being stronger and more self-sufficient.

00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:44.991
This highlights another main difference between Machiavelli’s

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:49.241
The Prince and previous texts in the mirror-of-princes genre.

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:57.581
Machiavelli is not setting out an idealised, moral vision of how a ruler should rule.

00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:02.371
There is no right or wrong, no morality, no justice.

00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:07.591
Instead, The Prince focuses upon which character traits and acts

00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:12.021
can be beneficial to a ruler looking to consolidate their power.

00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:17.401
In this respect, Machiavelli is actually showing us the world from a

00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:23.321
perspective completely devoid of, completely separate from moral judgement.

00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:30.131
This was particularly revolutionary because previously, at least in terms of

00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:35.831
written guidance, it was believed that good moral behaviour would ultimately lead

00:14:35.881 --> 00:14:42.361
to positive results - doing the right thing would result in a successful rule.

00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:47.681
In The Prince, Machiavelli said this was not the case.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:53.591
Throughout The Prince, Machiavelli makes his case that princes must be willing to rule

00:14:53.897 --> 00:15:01.391
unscrupulously at times, with private and public morality being almost two separate things.

00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:05.851
Essentially, what he is saying is that:  a prince should do

00:15:05.851 --> 00:15:09.731
whatever needs to be done to obtain and hold on to power.

00:15:10.541 --> 00:15:14.961
Immoral actions, fraud, deceit and violence may all

00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:18.581
be necessary to ensure social stability and security.

00:15:19.391 --> 00:15:24.031
In other words, a leader has to be ruthless to stay in power.

00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:30.591
Throughout its 26 chapters, The Prince draws upon many of Machiavelli's

00:15:30.601 --> 00:15:35.521
first-hand experiences during his diplomatic employment on behalf of the

00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:40.861
Florentine Republic, and indeed Machiavelli is remembered during his diplomatic

00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:46.451
time in Florence as a ruthless but incredibly efficient political operator.

00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:48.791
We see this in the book.

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:55.191
Machiavelli sets himself as an authoritative figure providing sound governmental

00:15:55.191 --> 00:16:00.741
and military advice through his analysis of historical and contemporary commanders.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:06.841
Louis XII of France, for example, is notably referenced in The Prince.

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:12.331
Remember, it was King Louis who tried to expand into northern Italy,

00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:17.181
but ended up being driven out after a series of expensive wars.

00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:24.481
In Chapter III, Machiavelli lists the five main errors of statecraft that Louis

00:16:24.481 --> 00:16:30.001
committed, causing him to lose power in Lombardy and be driven out of Italy.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:36.281
According to Machiavelli, Louis’ errors were as follows: failure to

00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:41.361
settle into the country, making a greater power even stronger, destroying

00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:46.621
minor powers, bringing in a foreign power and not bringing in colonies.

00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:52.541
Machiavelli wrote detailed assessments of power struggles, singling out

00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:57.421
individuals and pinpointing the elements that resulted in their downfall,

00:16:57.781 --> 00:17:01.721
as well as signalling how these downfalls could have been avoided.

00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:06.971
One person from Machiavelli’s first-hand observations who

00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:11.060
features extensively throughout The Prince is Cesare Borgia.

00:17:12.647 --> 00:17:18.321
As we heard earlier on, Cesare Borgia, with his father as pope, attempted

00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:23.191
to create a large central Italian state under his direct control.

00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:30.011
Borgia was a highly capable general and statesman, well equipped with a ruthless,

00:17:30.186 --> 00:17:35.880
cunning nature, and he provided a major inspiration for Machiavelli’s The Prince.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.810
While Cesare Borgia is portrayed as an excellent example of a new prince

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.220
carving out a new state and holding on to power in line with Machiavelli’s

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.470
principles, Borgia struggled to maintain power once his powerful father died.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.680
This, actually, is a fundamental part of the theory presented in The Prince.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:09.000
For Machiavelli, Borgia’s downfall ultimately came down to the hostility of fate or fortune.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.180
While Machiavelli strongly encourages rulers to plan for all eventualities, Borgia,

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:24.780
despite his scheming, planning and intentions, was still brought down by the one event he

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:31.670
did not plan for - being incapacitated, or ill, at the same time as his father’s death.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.090
Sometimes you can plan for everything, but a curveball comes

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.200
your way and there’s very little you can do to stop it.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:46.540
All Machiavelli tries to do here is explain what an aspiring

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.930
leader can do to control their own fate as much as possible.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:59.840
Now, this text, The Prince, was written over 500 years ago, and scholars, politicians,

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.010
and indeed anyone with an interest in power, have been studying it ever since.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:11.630
It was trusted by Thomas Cromwell, referenced by Sir Francis Bacon and Jean-Jacques

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:17.560
Rousseau, it’s thought to have influenced Descartes, Hobbes, and John Locke, Napoleon,

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:24.300
Mussolini and Stalin were all huge fans, and in more recent times President Richard Nixon

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:30.960
and the famed diplomat Henry Kissinger both referenced the book as being highly influential.

00:19:31.695 --> 00:19:37.625
The Prince has made the adjective Machiavellian a byword, an expression, for

00:19:37.785 --> 00:19:42.985
deception and scheming, especially in the context of political manipulation.

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:47.765
The book was banned by the Catholic church, and it has remained

00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:52.035
an extremely controversial text ever since its publication.

00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:59.115
But it seems unlikely that Machiavelli ever intended for it to have such an impact.

00:20:00.025 --> 00:20:06.545
Firstly, it was written in vernacular, or common, Italian rather than Latin, which,

00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:11.725
contrary to what you might think, would have meant that the potential audience was

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:17.405
smaller, as far more Europeans would have been able to read Latin than Italian.

00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:25.205
Secondly, it was dedicated to the Medici family, and really it was written as

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:31.185
an attempt to escape his life of boredom and regain active diplomatic service.

00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:36.155
Essentially, it was a job application, it wasn’t intended to be a

00:20:36.415 --> 00:20:41.305
treatise on political theory, read and studied by a global audience.

00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:46.155
And all this is supported by the fact that he never actually

00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:50.005
tried to publish it - it was only published after his death.

00:20:51.145 --> 00:20:57.105
And as much as Machiavelli has been deviled for The Prince, he has also been named the

00:20:57.115 --> 00:21:03.155
father, or at least one of the fathers, of modern political philosophy and political science.

00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:09.935
While a great many of the suggestions in the book are shockingly immoral, by

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:16.015
explaining what tactics rulers use and completely ignoring any questions of

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:22.425
ethics, Machiavelli has emancipated or detached politics from moral philosophy.

00:21:23.285 --> 00:21:30.565
Reading The Prince today in a modern context, the book still strikes a chord in its call to

00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:38.455
action, with advice on how to succeed in life by being bold, taking risks and being ruthless.

00:21:39.032 --> 00:21:45.763
Machiavelli’s brazen, shameless, recommendations to eliminate, scheme and destroy

00:21:45.823 --> 00:21:51.233
to hold on to power still strike us today, and I’m sure that you can think of

00:21:51.233 --> 00:21:56.633
examples of politicians in your country that people know have done terrible,

00:21:56.773 --> 00:22:01.753
scheming things to their friends and allies just in order to gain power.

00:22:02.343 --> 00:22:08.103
Part of the fascination and what makes The Prince still relevant today is Machiavelli’s

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:15.223
very matter of fact way of describing just how ruthless and devoid of morals humans can

00:22:15.223 --> 00:22:22.393
be to get what they want, whilst still hiding behind a mask of morality and decorum.

00:22:23.173 --> 00:22:28.383
By separating morality from politics and action, it brings us uncomfortably

00:22:28.383 --> 00:22:34.033
closer to a deeper consideration of human nature and whether or not we

00:22:34.033 --> 00:22:39.113
can claim to be inherently moral as individuals or even as a society.

00:22:39.903 --> 00:22:44.093
Perhaps at the end of the day, the question we should be asking ourselves

00:22:44.123 --> 00:22:49.243
is, why does Machiavelli’s The Prince still have such a bad reputation?

00:22:49.943 --> 00:22:55.793
Maybe it isn’t just down to the underhand and often cruel tactics that are recommended,

00:22:56.043 --> 00:23:01.753
but rather, more worryingly, the fact that Machiavelli almost casually exposes a

00:23:02.003 --> 00:23:07.083
brutal dimension of human nature that we normally attempt to hide at all costs.

00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:13.923
While some people read The Prince and interpret Machiavelli as suggesting that this is what

00:23:13.943 --> 00:23:20.223
politicians should do, there are plenty who take an alternative view, that Machiavelli is simply

00:23:20.463 --> 00:23:26.763
documenting the behaviour that he saw and indeed engaged in during his time as a diplomat.

00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:35.313
He isn’t writing some abstract theoretical novel, he is writing a detailed account, full of plenty

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:41.673
of real-life contemporary examples showing the extent to which people will go to gain power.

00:23:42.763 --> 00:23:47.663
When faced with survival, and even in some cases when not, humans

00:23:47.683 --> 00:23:52.683
are capable of committing atrocities and those in power may resort to

00:23:52.683 --> 00:23:57.963
deceitfulness and scheming far more regularly than we are in fact aware of.

00:23:58.713 --> 00:24:03.923
In other words, when push comes to shove, as Machiavelli so famously reminds

00:24:03.923 --> 00:24:09.383
us, morality is often one of the very first things to go out the window.

00:24:10.283 --> 00:24:16.553
And whether we’re talking about Renaissance Florence, 18th century Paris, the 21st century

00:24:16.713 --> 00:24:23.743
British Houses of Parliament or indeed any seat of power and influence, it’s clear that so long

00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:30.863
as there is more power to be taken, men and women will go to extraordinary lengths to get it.

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:39.033
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Niccolò Machiavelli and The Prince.

00:24:39.573 --> 00:24:44.043
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned something new and maybe

00:24:44.103 --> 00:24:49.863
had a chance to reflect a little more deeply upon society and morality in general.

00:24:50.423 --> 00:24:53.843
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:24:54.253 --> 00:24:57.263
Have you read the Prince and what did you think of it?

00:24:57.803 --> 00:25:04.150
Why do you think The Prince is such a popular read over 500 years after it was written?

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.530
Can the theories and ideology of Machiavelli ever be a good thing?

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.890
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

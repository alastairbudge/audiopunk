Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:16.373
The show where you can learn fascinating things about the world, and listen

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:22.143
to weird and wonderful stories, at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:28.943
I’m Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about human rights.

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:36.963
Now, human rights is, to state the obvious, a large and immensely complicated topic.

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:41.433
So in today’s episode we aren’t going to attempt to cover

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:46.573
everything, but we will ask ourselves a few important questions.

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:50.273
What actually are human rights?

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:52.403
Where do they come from?

00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:55.923
What happened before human rights?

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:01.553
What is happening to human rights now, and what might the human

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:06.183
rights of the future look like, if indeed there is a difference?

00:01:07.743 --> 00:01:12.523
But before we get right into that, let me just remind those of you listening to

00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:19.083
this episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, iVoox, or wherever you get your podcasts,

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:24.373
that you can listen to all of the episodes, so that’s a whole lot more than

00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:29.793
you get on the podcast apps, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:36.093
The website is also where you can find the subtitles, key vocabulary, and

00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:40.973
transcripts for every episode, and if you would like to improve your English

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:46.343
in a more interesting way, and become part of a community of curious minds

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:51.233
from all over the world, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.823
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:55.753 --> 00:02:00.623
When you hear the term ‘human rights’, you probably hear it in the

00:02:00.643 --> 00:02:06.813
context of a ‘violation of human rights’, or of ‘human rights abuses’.

00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:13.687
That some people, somewhere, are having their human rights violated by

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:20.067
oppressive governments or regimes, and that this is inherently wrong.

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:28.997
There is, as you may know, a United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which lays out what

00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:36.707
are classified as inalienable human rights, rights that should exist for everyone in the world.

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:42.617
Rights that you receive at birth, rights that we all have, as humans.

00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:50.447
And there are 30 different articles that make up this United Nations Declaration of

00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:56.867
Human Rights, too many to list out here, but they cover a wide range of ‘rights’,

00:02:57.137 --> 00:03:02.947
from the right of all humans to be born free and equal in dignity and the right

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:08.687
to not be held as a slave, then there is the right to free movement within your

00:03:08.707 --> 00:03:15.077
country, the right to own private property, and another 26 different human rights.

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:21.917
It was a hallmark treaty that was only signed in 1948, less

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:26.437
than 100 years ago, just after the end of the Second World War.

00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:34.232
What we’re going to do first though is to trace this back, to go back a little bit in the

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:43.237
history books, because this concept of Human Rights, that all men and women have the same, basic

00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:50.147
rights, is, at least when we compare it to how long humans have been around, it's pretty new.

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:57.603
There is a bit of debate about when the first idea of ‘human rights’ came into existence.

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:06.263
Some historians say that the concept goes back to Persia in the 6th century BC, under

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:12.213
the rule of Cyrus the Great, who proclaimed that people were free to practice whatever

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:18.703
faith they wanted without fear of persecution, or of being forcefully converted.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:25.893
Others point to Ancient Greece, where all citizens had the right to vote.

00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:34.283
But of course, while these civilisations may have proposed some of the things we now know as

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:41.063
human rights, they would definitely be classified as ‘human rights abusers’ in the modern era.

00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:47.193
The Greeks kept slaves, and although Ancient Athens was a

00:04:47.423 --> 00:04:52.843
democracy, it was a democracy for men - women couldn’t vote.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.170
And Cyrus the Great was at war for the majority of his reign, he

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.870
wouldn’t be winning any prizes now for his human rights record.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:08.700
And over the course of history, our concept of human rights in

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.170
general, has evolved, it has gradually changed into what we have today.

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:20.107
After Cyrus the Great and the Ancient Greeks, the idea of ‘human

00:05:20.107 --> 00:05:25.837
rights’ was almost non-existent for over a thousand years.

00:05:27.147 --> 00:05:33.107
Of course, this is a huge generalisation, but we can probably trace back the modern

00:05:33.107 --> 00:05:40.107
idea of ‘human rights’ to ‘natural rights’, which was an idea that came to prominence

00:05:40.297 --> 00:05:46.337
during the Medieval Era, and then was further developed through the enlightenment..

00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:51.457
Philosophers thought that there were two types of rights.

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:58.397
Natural rights, which are the rights that everyone has, regardless of the law.

00:05:59.287 --> 00:06:04.337
And legal rights, which are the rights that people have in the eyes of the law.

00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:11.427
What these ‘natural rights’ actually were though, was up for debate.

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:20.237
John Locke, the famous English philosopher, focussed on the rights of every man to life,

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:27.567
liberty, and property, but the discussion of natural rights was mainly a philosophical

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:34.117
one, and there wasn’t the same kind of consensus around them that we have today with

00:06:34.117 --> 00:06:40.207
these thirty ‘inalienable’ human rights in the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights.

00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:47.347
In the 18th century, there were two events that had a profound impact on

00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:52.507
the development of human rights, and sowed the seeds for what we have today.

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:59.847
Firstly, in 1776, the Declaration of the Independence of the United States

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:05.867
of America, which codified the rights of citizens of this new country.

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:14.497
And then, thirteen years later, in 1789, the French Revolution, and the publication of

00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:20.327
the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which listed seventeen different

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:26.577
articles that set out the rights of man, a lot of which we would recognise today.

00:07:27.827 --> 00:07:30.947
But there were some notable things missing.

00:07:32.287 --> 00:07:36.877
Specifically, these rights were the rights of mankind,

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:43.357
of people, but they mainly applied to men, not to women.

00:07:44.857 --> 00:07:47.947
And secondly, there was nothing against slavery.

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:57.157
To us, in 2020, this might seem strange, hard to believe, and when you

00:07:57.157 --> 00:08:02.197
look at what was in the declaration, it does seem quite contradictory.

00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:08.977
The first Article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen reads:

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:13.117
"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.

00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:18.057
Social distinctions can be founded only on the common good."

00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:24.727
Yet slavery was still accepted, and it wasn’t abolished in all

00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:30.427
of the French colonies until 1848, almost sixty years later.

00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:38.687
So while they declared that all men are born and remain free and equal in rights, slavery

00:08:38.687 --> 00:08:44.707
was allowed - it was literally the opposite of remaining free and equal in rights.

00:08:46.207 --> 00:08:51.437
So yes, of course, these declarations were a step forward, and were

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:56.227
small improvements on the journey towards our current understanding

00:08:56.367 --> 00:09:00.637
of Human Rights, but they definitely were not without contradiction.

00:09:02.137 --> 00:09:05.147
Then the real developments that led us to where we

00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:08.987
are today came after the end of the Second World War.

00:09:10.687 --> 00:09:14.537
The world had just experienced two horrific conflicts,

00:09:14.797 --> 00:09:18.507
where humans had done terrible things to other humans.

00:09:20.007 --> 00:09:27.317
The United Nations was founded in 1945, and there was a feeling, at least among the members of this

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:34.827
new global organisation, that there needed to be a global declaration of human rights that applied

00:09:34.847 --> 00:09:41.767
to every human on the planet, no matter what country they came from, their gender, their religion,

00:09:42.047 --> 00:09:48.327
the colour of their skin, or anything else that might differentiate one person from another.

00:09:49.627 --> 00:09:55.127
These were to be inalienable rights, rights that cannot be taken away.

00:09:56.627 --> 00:10:01.697
And the result of this was this declaration, in 1948, with

00:10:01.707 --> 00:10:06.167
the 30 articles setting out what these rights actually are.

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:13.697
Now, it’s important to note that these rights aren’t binding, the UN doesn’t

00:10:13.707 --> 00:10:19.217
make the law, and the Declaration of Human Rights isn’t a global law.

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:24.877
And this means, on one level, that it is easier for

00:10:25.087 --> 00:10:29.397
countries to break them, or at least not respect them.

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:36.507
And whether this is the more obvious example of people being imprisoned or

00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:43.037
executed for speaking out against the ruling party, or examples that not everyone

00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:47.917
might think of as violations, such as the right to have protection against

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:55.387
unemployment, governments and countries violate this treaty almost every single day.

00:10:56.887 --> 00:11:03.447
And other than some international condemnation, there often isn’t a huge amount that

00:11:03.447 --> 00:11:10.617
gets done - individual interests, normally economic or security-related, come first.

00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:17.497
And this is why we have situations like the United States failing to condemn

00:11:17.497 --> 00:11:23.067
the murder of the Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, or the majority

00:11:23.077 --> 00:11:28.177
of the developed world failing to criticise the treatment of protestors in

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:33.697
Hong Kong, or of the handling of the Black Lives Matter protests in the US.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.870
All of these incidents would classify, technically speaking,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.210
as violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:52.690
So it’s probably more accurate to say that countries often consider human rights as guidelines

00:11:53.150 --> 00:12:00.780
- things that they should aspire to, but despite the fact that they are defined as inalienable,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:08.980
impossible to take away, their importance seems to be cherry-picked - they are considered hugely

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:17.440
important and non-negotiable when they suit your goals, but when they don’t, they are ignored.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.720
They become an inconvenience that gets in the way of your agenda.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:31.240
From waterboarding prisoners in Guantanamo Bay to herding up minorities in prison camps in

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.680
Xinjiang province in China, both in the name of ‘national security’, it’s clear that especially

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:46.180
large and powerful countries often just ignore human rights when they don’t suit their agenda.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.680
This isn’t the only criticism of human rights though, that they are easily and frequently ignored.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:01.160
Another that was a criticism when the declaration was first signed, and is still a

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:08.120
criticism now, is that it takes a Western approach, a Western view to human rights.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:16.320
The whole idea of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is that it is meant to be ‘universal’,

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:23.280
it is meant to apply to you whether you live in California or Cameroon, Paris or Paraguay.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.240
But it was pushed forward at the UN by a majority Western group, and was actually only

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:39.630
signed by 48 countries, so only 48 of the total of 193 countries that there are now.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:47.840
The reason for this was back in 1948 there were only 58 members of the UN,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.460
the countries that have joined since then only got independence afterwards.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.860
But if you’re thinking, hang on, it was signed by 48 countries,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.470
but there were 58 countries there, who voted against it?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:13.760
In fact, no country actually voted against it, but 10 either abstained, they

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.800
said that they wouldn’t participate for or against, or just didn’t participate.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.710
But this was almost the same as voting no - they just didn’t

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.180
want to go down in history as being ‘anti' human rights.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:38.420
These countries were ones that formed part of the former USSR, then South Africa and Saudi Arabia.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:47.880
They didn’t vote for it because it proposed things that were fundamentally opposed to how they

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.730
had run their countries - for the countries in the USSR, freedom of movement within the country

00:14:54.730 --> 00:15:02.090
wasn’t allowed, in Saudi Arabia the idea of equal marriage rights and that everyone has the

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:07.997
right to change their religion wasn’t appreciated, and South Africa was still an apartheid

00:15:07.997 --> 00:15:14.647
country, so a lot of the declaration was completely the opposite to how that country was run.

00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:20.187
So, depending on what country you are from, you may or may

00:15:20.357 --> 00:15:24.657
not agree with everything in the Declaration of Human Rights.

00:15:26.157 --> 00:15:32.172
Certainly, the 30 individual rights in the declaration have evolved from lots of

00:15:32.172 --> 00:15:38.942
ideas and principles that existed in various shapes and forms in Western countries.

00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:47.582
Yes, it is intended to be universal, but some of the ideas in it have formed part

00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:53.202
of various Western norms for longer than they have in other countries, and so

00:15:53.462 --> 00:16:00.252
the criticism is that it has forced a western view onto non-western countries.

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:08.652
It’s also worth noting that, while we put this declaration up on a pedestal and talk about how

00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:16.862
marvelous it is, there are certain things that aren’t on it that you might expect would be on it.

00:16:18.562 --> 00:16:22.252
Perhaps the most obvious one, and one that is frequently

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:26.492
brought up by Amnesty International is the death penalty.

00:16:27.992 --> 00:16:33.222
Article Number Three of the declaration reads “Everyone has the right to

00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:39.762
life, liberty and security of person”, and Number 5 reads “No one shall be

00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:45.882
subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”

00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:51.952
You could interpret that as suggesting that nobody has the right

00:16:51.982 --> 00:16:56.862
to take away the life of another human, but it is not clarified.

00:16:58.692 --> 00:17:05.952
And of course, as of 2020, 58 countries around the world still have the death penalty.

00:17:06.752 --> 00:17:11.432
And of the ten most populous countries in the world, the 10 countries

00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:16.372
with the most people, all but one still have the death penalty.

00:17:17.872 --> 00:17:21.322
And lest we forget, the self-proclaimed leader of the

00:17:21.322 --> 00:17:24.682
free world, the United States of America, still has it.

00:17:26.182 --> 00:17:31.342
So, it is interesting to ask ourselves where human rights are going.

00:17:32.362 --> 00:17:38.932
If we look at what people just over 200 years ago thought as the most amazing developments,

00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:45.432
with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen in France, and consider that some of

00:17:45.502 --> 00:17:52.532
the things that they did back then are now considered horrendous and barbaric, I wonder what

00:17:52.532 --> 00:17:59.692
people 200 years from now will think about some of the things that we, as humans, are doing now.

00:18:01.312 --> 00:18:09.222
Will people 200 years from now feel the same way about humans in 2020 as about how we

00:18:09.222 --> 00:18:16.292
feel about things like slavery, that it is almost unfathomable how it was tolerated?

00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:22.092
Something that is already getting more attention from a human rights point of

00:18:22.092 --> 00:18:27.892
view, and is becoming more and more important as the Earth’s population grows,

00:18:28.352 --> 00:18:33.982
is how climate change is forcing us to think about shared usage of the planet.

00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:40.862
There is a growing view that environmental rights are human rights - that

00:18:40.892 --> 00:18:46.852
everyone deserves the right to land, shelter, water, food, and air.

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:55.765
And in a world where sea levels are rising and land is being lost, rainforests are being chopped

00:18:55.765 --> 00:19:03.789
down, water supplies are being disrupted, droughts are causing food shortages, and even the air

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:11.785
is being polluted, it is clear that these rights are not rights that exist for everyone, equally.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:19.965
But the difference here is that, instead of the oppressor being the police battering

00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:25.895
down your door, or another human forcing you into a truck and taking you to a different

00:19:25.895 --> 00:19:34.135
country, the oppressor is firstly less easy to see, and secondly, it isn’t just one person.

00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:39.665
It’s millions of people, billions of people, all of whom are

00:19:39.715 --> 00:19:44.039
contributing a little bit, but with some more than others.

00:19:45.209 --> 00:19:51.319
And this, of course, makes it incredibly difficult to point the finger, to assign blame.

00:19:52.999 --> 00:20:00.369
So although 70 years ago in Paris, at the signing of the Declaration of Human Rights, people

00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:06.939
may have thought, great we’ve cracked it, it certainly looks like our own understanding of

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:13.779
what constitutes human rights is not fixed, and will need to be adapted as the world changes.

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:20.519
And even though we may agree on what these human rights are, we aren’t

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:25.929
any closer to agreeing what can be done to stop them being violated.

00:20:28.532 --> 00:20:34.362
OK then, that is it for today’s little jaunt into the world of Human Rights.

00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:40.282
I know it wasn’t a particularly happy ending, but it is fascinating to think

00:20:40.342 --> 00:20:47.042
how this man-made concept was created, has evolved, and will continue to evolve.

00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:52.962
Philosophy is forever changing and adapting, and it will be

00:20:52.972 --> 00:20:57.752
amazing to see how our customs and norms adapt as the world does.

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:02.532

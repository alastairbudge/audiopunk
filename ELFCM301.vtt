Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:17.035
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:21.425
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:26.475
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:31.152
Stanislav Petrov, the man who some have said “saved the world”.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:36.892
At a time of intense geopolitical tension, Petrov’s common sense,

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:42.212
his cool and calm demeanour, saved the world from nuclear holocaust.

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:48.432
But interestingly enough, it wasn’t because of what he did, but rather, what he didn’t do…

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:55.922
So let's jump straight into it, and talk about Stanislav Petrov - the man who saved the world.

00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:01.122
It was the 26th of September, 1983.

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:03.552
The world was on edge.

00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:09.576
The world’s two major superpowers, the United States and the Union of Socialist

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:16.286
Soviet Republics, the USSR, were trapped in a tense ‘Cold War’ - a decades-long

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:21.476
political standoff that threatened to plunge the globe into nuclear war.

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:24.846
You may well remember this time yourself.

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:29.886
It was an era where people across the world genuinely worried that

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:34.846
World War III, and the end of the world, could come at any minute.

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:39.706
That morning a Lieutenant Colonel in the Soviet Air Defence

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:44.686
Forces was on duty at the Serpukhov-15 bunker near Moscow.

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:49.846
The bunker base housed the command centre of the Soviet

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:54.406
early-warning satellites, which operated under the code name Oko.

00:01:55.706 --> 00:02:00.954
This Oko early-warning system was used to detect incoming nuclear

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:04.604
missiles, missiles that had been launched at the Soviet Union.

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:11.164
In the early hours of the morning on the 26th, 44 year old Stansilav Petrov

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:16.834
was working, like any other day, until, suddenly, there was an alarm.

00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:20.844
The Soviet nuclear early-warning system was going off.

00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:22.334
What was happening?

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:24.114
Were the Americans attacking?

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.414
Was the Cold War about to blow hot?

00:02:28.644 --> 00:02:35.844
To his horror, Petrov realised it wasn’t just one missile, or two, or even three, but

00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:42.134
five intercontinental ballistic missiles that were heading straight for the Soviet Union.

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:47.834
Soviet protocol, standard procedure, at the time, was to launch

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:53.294
immediate retaliatory strikes, to fire weapons back at the United States.

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.453
Effectively, to plunge the world into the kind of

00:02:57.463 --> 00:03:01.173
nuclear conflict that everyone had feared for so long.

00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:07.983
But Petrov, whose job was to detect incoming threats and report

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:11.643
them to his superiors, thought there was something ‘off.’

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:13.913
Something just wasn’t quite right.

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:19.343
Breaking protocol, Petrov did not report the incoming

00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:22.703
missiles to his military bosses, to his superiors.

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:27.793
He gathered his thoughts, and decided it was a false alarm.

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:30.343
Then, he waited.

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:31.663
And waited.

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:38.663
Were five nuclear bombs about to rain down on the Soviet Union, and had Petrov’s

00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:43.943
decision to not tell his bosses, to fail to do the one job that he was supposed

00:03:43.943 --> 00:03:49.593
to do, had this cost the Soviet Union crucial time at the start of World War III?

00:03:50.983 --> 00:03:54.273
Fortunately, as you might have guessed by now, there

00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:57.413
were no nuclear bombs flying towards the Soviet Union.

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:00.853
Petrov, it later turned out, was right.

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:05.423
The system had malfunctioned - it was a false alarm.

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:13.663
This decision, this decision that went against all Soviet protocols and all of his training, and a

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:20.183
decision that would later cost him dearly, may well have saved the world from nuclear destruction.

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:25.593
So, who was this man, this man who you could convincingly

00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:28.513
argue we are to thank for preventing nuclear war?

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.643
He’s perhaps an unlikely hero.

00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:39.533
Stanilsav Petrov was born on the 7th of September, 1939, just six days after

00:04:39.543 --> 00:04:45.666
Hitler invaded Poland, in a small town near Vladivostok - a far-eastern outpost

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:50.731
of the Soviet Union close to the modern day borders with China and North Korea.

00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:57.114
He was the son of a nurse and a fighter pilot who flew aircraft during the Second World War.

00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:04.984
After graduating from Kyiv Military Aviation Engineering Academy in 1972, Petrov

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:09.884
followed in his father’s footsteps and joined the Soviet Air Defence Force.

00:05:10.724 --> 00:05:15.514
He quickly began working on the newly-designed early warning system that detected

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:20.544
ballistic missile attacks from NATO countries - in particular the United States.

00:05:21.974 --> 00:05:24.834
This was the very system that would malfunction,

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:28.214
and leave Petrov with a monumental decision to make.

00:05:29.684 --> 00:05:36.004
Before we move into the events of that fateful day, and exactly how Petrov saved the world

00:05:36.194 --> 00:05:41.234
from near-certain nuclear destruction, we should talk first, briefly, about the Cold War.

00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:46.094
Now, you will no doubt know about the Cold War, and if you were born

00:05:46.094 --> 00:05:50.634
before the early 1990s, well, you also lived through at least part of it.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:55.614
But let’s quickly remind ourselves about how it “started”, and what

00:05:55.614 --> 00:06:00.335
had happened in the lead up to the events of September 26th of 1983.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.484
We need to go back to the end of the Second World War.

00:06:05.174 --> 00:06:09.934
During World War II, the threat of Hitler brought together some unlikely

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:16.744
countries, including the UK, the US, and Russia - the Soviet Union as it was then.

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:22.194
This predominantly Western alliance fought together, on the same side,

00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:27.504
united against Nazi Germany and its Axis allies, Italy and Japan.

00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:34.664
While the British and Americans forces fought against the Nazis on the western front, in Germany,

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:41.512
France, and Belgium, the Soviets fought alone, sustaining heavy losses, on the brutal Eastern front.

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:50.184
At the end of the war, in 1945, the Americans and Soviets eventually encircled Berlin - the

00:06:50.394 --> 00:06:55.628
Soviets approaching from the East, the Americans from the West - and defeated Nazism.

00:06:56.434 --> 00:06:57.694
Allies, yes.

00:06:58.044 --> 00:06:58.904
Trusting friends?

00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:00.564
Most definitely not.

00:07:01.668 --> 00:07:05.508
Although the wartime leaders, American President Franklin D.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:11.188
Roosevelt, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin, leader of the

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:17.234
Communist Party, worked together militarily, and even appeared in public and took photos

00:07:17.234 --> 00:07:22.911
together, this was mainly for propaganda reasons, and to maintain the wartime spirit.

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:28.801
For many on both the Soviet and American sides, their wartime relationship

00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:33.271
was a case of the famous saying, ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend.’

00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:37.611
But below the surface all was not as it seemed.

00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:44.611
The Americans in particular had deep fears and suspicions about communism, they were worried about

00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:50.921
Stalin’s own authoritarian regime in the Soviet Union, and what he would do after the war had ended.

00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:58.511
Stalin, on the other hand, hated that the British and Americans had for years refused to include

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:05.396
Russia as a major player in world politics, treated it as an outsider, not to be trusted, but were

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:11.236
happy to allow tens of millions of Russians to die fighting their common enemy on the eastern front.

00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:15.776
And he also saw the defeat of Hitler as an opportunity

00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:19.176
to greatly expand his territories to the West of Russia.

00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:27.396
When the war ended and Germany was split in two, this distrust between East and West grew.

00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:32.046
Americans feared Stalin wanted the rest of Germany, and to

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:36.016
continue expanding communism across Eastern and Central Europe.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:42.156
The Soviets hated the amount of soldiers and weapons the Americans kept in Europe after the

00:08:42.156 --> 00:08:49.066
war - so close to the USSR - as well as America’s increasing role on the global political scene.

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:55.086
In order to try and slow down the expansion of the USSR, the Americans

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:59.226
initially adopted a policy of what they called ‘containment’.

00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:04.816
This containment strategy meant the U.S was committed to fighting

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:09.066
the growth of communism wherever it was in the world, and, as a

00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:14.156
result, meant they began stockpiling arms, making and storing weapons.

00:09:15.536 --> 00:09:19.876
After the atomic bombs Americans had dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima

00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:24.826
in Japan at the end of the war, both the Americans and the Soviets knew

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:29.756
the power of atomic weapons and their capacity to end wars immediately.

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:32.866
So, an ‘arms race’ began.

00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:38.076
In August of 1949, the Soviets tested their own atomic bomb.

00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:39.976
What did the Americans do?

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:44.636
President Truman, who had taken over from Roosevelt during the last

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:48.586
year of the war, announced that the U.S was going to create an even

00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:53.796
more destructive and dangerous weapon, known as the hydrogen, or H-bomb.

00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:55.606
What did Stalin do?

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:57.426
Well, the same thing, of course.

00:09:57.666 --> 00:09:59.746
And this kept going and going.

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:08.186
The Cold War was, in effect, a major standoff between two paranoid and nervous nuclear superpowers.

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:14.486
And the first Hydrogen bomb tests, on the pacific Marshall Islands in

00:10:14.486 --> 00:10:19.886
November of 1952, showed just how destructive they could be, and that

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:24.726
humans now had the technological capabilities to destroy life on earth.

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:33.116
The first test on the Marshall Islands set off a 65-square-km fireball that vaporised

00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:38.976
one of the islands, and was so powerful that it blew a hole in the ocean floor.

00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:46.346
The Americans calculated that just one H-bomb had the power to destroy half of Manhattan.

00:10:47.656 --> 00:10:51.586
With each side knowing that the other had the capability to launch

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:56.206
an H-bomb at the push of a button, the Cold War was heating up.

00:10:57.126 --> 00:11:00.286
And the weapons stockpile continued to grow.

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:11.748
By 1955 the Soviets had around 200 nuclear weapons stockpiled, and the Americans a staggering 2,422.

00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:17.886
So the 1950’s and 1960’s were an incredibly tense time,

00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:22.046
with paranoia growing on both sides of the Iron Curtain.

00:11:23.076 --> 00:11:28.076
The Iron Curtain, by the way, was a term used to describe the political and

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:32.996
ideological barrier between eastern and western Europe following the Second World War.

00:11:34.496 --> 00:11:38.356
In the US, the threat of nuclear destruction at the

00:11:38.356 --> 00:11:42.036
hands of the USSR seeped into everyday life and culture.

00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:48.846
The phrase ‘reds under the bed’ - red meaning communists, or communist sympathisers - was

00:11:48.846 --> 00:11:53.946
commonplace, and spoke to the obsessive paranoia about the Soviets in America.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:57.816
Americans built bomb shelters in their gardens.

00:11:58.026 --> 00:12:05.356
British and American films depicted nuclear holocausts and foreign, mutant creatures and UFO’s

00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:10.366
attacking the West - bringing the threat into the living rooms of hundreds of millions of people.

00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:17.096
The Cold War even went into space, with each side desperate not to fall behind in

00:12:17.096 --> 00:12:22.706
terms of technological developments, and to be seen to be trailing in the arms race.

00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:29.706
This was not only in preparation for what everyone thought was an inevitable conflict,

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:36.886
but also to prove the supremacy of capitalism or communism in the battle of ideologies.

00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:43.976
But when Richard Nixon became President in 1969, he began a different policy

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:49.486
known as “détente” toward the Soviet Union, and things began to change.

00:12:50.106 --> 00:12:52.686
The Cold War cooled down, for a while.

00:12:53.016 --> 00:12:54.946
Or at least it didn’t get any hotter.

00:12:56.086 --> 00:13:00.206
Knowing that both sides had the military capabilities to wipe each other

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:04.806
out, the Soviets and Americans reluctantly came to the negotiating table.

00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:13.126
In 1972, Nixon and the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, agreed to the ‘Strategic Arms

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:19.856
Limitation Treaty’, known as SALT, which took a small step towards reducing the threat of war.

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:27.306
SALT, this agreement, limited the number of anti ballistic missile sites each side could have to

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:33.416
two, and stopped production of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles.

00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:40.546
Yet, despite the agreement being hailed as a diplomatic success, it did not deal with

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:46.046
single missiles carrying multiple nuclear warheads, nor the development of new weapons.

00:13:47.206 --> 00:13:53.936
And despite the progress made, domestic politics soon changed the temperature of the Cold War again.

00:13:54.966 --> 00:14:00.286
When Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1981, his strict

00:14:00.466 --> 00:14:04.786
anti-communist approach meant the Cold War began heating up again.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:09.426
Reagan ordered more nuclear weapons to be produced, and

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:13.286
publically called the Soviet Union an ‘evil empire.’

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:16.386
Both sides were getting nervous.

00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:23.096
A 1979 report had calculated that a Soviet nuclear assault would kill 35

00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:30.136
to 77 percent of the U.S population - between 82 and 180 million people.

00:14:31.236 --> 00:14:36.536
A U.S retaliatory strike, they estimated, could have killed 20 to 40

00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:41.646
percent of the Soviet population, between 54 million and 108 million people.

00:14:42.766 --> 00:14:45.108
Why such a difference, you might be wondering?

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:50.548
Well, according to the report, the USSR’s sparse population density

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:55.436
worked in its favour, along with the sheer size of its weapons meaning

00:14:55.586 --> 00:14:58.866
they were “likely to kill more people while aiming at something else.”

00:15:00.026 --> 00:15:06.846
What’s more, the Soviets knew that top-of-the-range medium-range missiles called Pershing II were

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:13.266
about to be strategically placed in western Europe, which would make US missile launches much faster

00:15:13.776 --> 00:15:20.536
and give the Soviets - people like Petrov - less time to detect and respond to incoming strikes.

00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:24.906
Clearly, having an effective early-warning missile

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:29.296
detection system was of crucial importance for the USSR.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.926
The Soviets were expecting something.

00:15:32.646 --> 00:15:35.586
And American behaviour didn’t help their paranoia.

00:15:36.356 --> 00:15:40.586
American ships and submarines circled the Norwegian, Black and

00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:44.066
Baltic seas, showing the Soviets just how close they could get.

00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:48.136
American bomber planes regularly flew straight for Soviet

00:15:48.176 --> 00:15:51.786
airspace, only to turn away at the last possible moment.

00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:59.626
And, to make things worse, and more tense, just three weeks before Petrov had to make one of the

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:06.706
biggest decisions in human history, the Soviets shot down an aeroplane, Korean Airlines Flight 007.

00:16:08.096 --> 00:16:12.506
Flight 007 was going from New York to Seoul via Alaska.

00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:19.206
When the Soviets realised it had accidentally strayed into their airspace, just north

00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:25.906
of Japan, they shot it down, paranoid that it was an American spy plane or bomber.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.916
Everyone on board was killed.

00:16:29.632 --> 00:16:35.344
And to make matters worse, included among the dead was a US politician, a

00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:39.474
Democratic representative in the House of Congress called Larry McDonald.

00:16:40.324 --> 00:16:44.444
The Soviets had unknowingly killed an American politician.

00:16:45.284 --> 00:16:50.864
It had, until a few weeks later, been one of the tensest moments of the Cold War…so far.

00:16:51.854 --> 00:16:55.584
And that’s how we find ourselves just 3 weeks later, on

00:16:55.584 --> 00:17:00.004
the night of September 26th 1983, with Stanislav Petrov.

00:17:00.884 --> 00:17:03.784
Now, what actually happened that day in September?

00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:09.004
How could the fate of the human race have come down to the temperament of one man?

00:17:10.294 --> 00:17:12.954
Much of the answer comes down to technology.

00:17:13.294 --> 00:17:15.394
It was a technology malfunction.

00:17:15.894 --> 00:17:21.664
A breakdown in the missile-alert system very nearly caused the Soviets to launch their own strike.

00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:27.094
The answer to why this malfunction happened lies in how the Soviet system worked.

00:17:27.884 --> 00:17:31.344
The Americans and Soviets used different alert systems, you

00:17:31.344 --> 00:17:35.314
see, and had different ways of detecting incoming missiles.

00:17:36.274 --> 00:17:41.504
Whereas the Americans used satellites that looked down on the earth in its

00:17:41.504 --> 00:17:47.064
entirety, and tracked missile launches that way, the Soviets did it differently.

00:17:48.074 --> 00:17:52.994
They pointed their satellites at the edge of the earth, the idea being

00:17:53.214 --> 00:17:57.064
that when missiles were launched, they would quickly rise and show

00:17:57.084 --> 00:18:01.814
up as silhouettes, shadows against the black background of space.

00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:08.294
Ironically, perhaps, one of the main reasons for this system was to prevent weather

00:18:08.294 --> 00:18:13.414
phenomena appearing like missile launches to satellites and causing false alarms.

00:18:14.554 --> 00:18:20.864
However, shortly after midnight on September 26th, 1983, a freak weather

00:18:20.904 --> 00:18:25.444
incident caused Soviet satellites to line up with the sun and the U.S.

00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:31.394
missile fields it was observing to reflect a huge amount of sunlight directly onto the satellites.

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:38.284
"The siren howled,” Petrov later said, “but I just sat there for a few seconds,

00:18:38.644 --> 00:18:43.654
staring at the big, back-lit, red screen with the word 'launch' on it."

00:18:44.984 --> 00:18:48.104
The new system told Petrov that it was not just an

00:18:48.104 --> 00:18:51.684
alert, but the highest level of alert the system had.

00:18:52.644 --> 00:18:58.934
The Americans had, it seemed, launched preliminary strikes to wipe out the Soviet Union.

00:18:59.384 --> 00:19:01.186
Nuclear war had begun.

00:19:02.424 --> 00:19:07.154
"A minute later the siren went off,” Petrov said, “the second missile was launched.

00:19:07.424 --> 00:19:09.934
Then the third, and the fourth, and the fifth.

00:19:10.564 --> 00:19:15.204
Computers changed their alerts from 'launch' to 'missile strike'."

00:19:16.704 --> 00:19:21.464
Soviet protocol at the time was to launch immediate retaliatory strikes,

00:19:21.604 --> 00:19:26.054
and Petrov’s job was to pass the information onto his superiors.

00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:32.714
To underline, it wasn’t his job to decide what to do, or to launch a strike, he wasn’t

00:19:32.744 --> 00:19:39.124
senior in the military, he only had one task: if the siren goes off, tell someone.

00:19:40.234 --> 00:19:44.524
He knew, however, that his superiors would launch a strike before

00:19:44.584 --> 00:19:48.144
Petrov had had the chance to properly confirm what was happening.

00:19:49.209 --> 00:19:53.377
But, with the fate of the world in his hands - and literally,

00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:57.577
a phone in one, an intercom the other - Petrov remained calm.

00:19:58.017 --> 00:19:59.857
Something didn’t feel right.

00:20:01.027 --> 00:20:04.332
Knowing it was still a new system, he had his doubts.

00:20:05.417 --> 00:20:10.557
In addition to tech specialists like Petrov, the Soviets also had other alert

00:20:10.557 --> 00:20:15.227
systems, and experts tracking potential American missiles from the ground.

00:20:16.187 --> 00:20:20.827
When another satellite radar operator told Petrov that they hadn’t received

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:26.027
any alerts on their systems, Petrov began to think it might be a false alarm.

00:20:26.787 --> 00:20:30.877
Why would the Americans only launch a handful of missiles, he thought?

00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:37.527
“When people start a war,” Petrov would later say, “they don’t start it with only five missiles.

00:20:37.897 --> 00:20:40.487
You can do little damage with just five missiles.”

00:20:41.247 --> 00:20:44.767
“All I had to do was to reach for the phone, to raise the

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:48.337
direct line to our top commanders but I couldn't move.

00:20:48.757 --> 00:20:51.727
I felt as if I was sitting on a hot frying pan.”

00:20:51.847 --> 00:20:54.012
So, what did Petrov do?

00:20:54.992 --> 00:20:56.582
In the end, nothing.

00:20:57.222 --> 00:21:00.542
Petrov never reported the missile alert to his superiors.

00:21:01.172 --> 00:21:06.234
Instead, he waited, and eventually reported it as a system malfunction.

00:21:07.084 --> 00:21:09.434
The whole incident took just a few minutes.

00:21:10.264 --> 00:21:11.974
So what happened next?

00:21:12.434 --> 00:21:16.562
Well, nothing, in fact, and most of the world had no

00:21:16.562 --> 00:21:19.752
idea that the planet had come so close to nuclear war.

00:21:20.782 --> 00:21:25.792
In the short-term, Petrov’s cool and collected nature prevented a retaliatory

00:21:25.792 --> 00:21:29.922
strike from the Soviets, which would have surely made the Americans fire

00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:34.632
back and, just like that, probably plunged the world into nuclear war.

00:21:35.682 --> 00:21:41.932
But in the medium to long-term, things weren’t so positive for Petrov or his career.

00:21:42.652 --> 00:21:46.862
Petrov’s military superiors questioned him at length about his decision making

00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:51.942
process and judgement, and why he did what he did, going against protocol.

00:21:52.892 --> 00:21:57.542
Initially, he was praised internally for his common sense decision making.

00:21:58.772 --> 00:22:05.482
General Yury Votintsev, the Commander of the USSR’s Missile Defence Units at the time - and

00:22:05.612 --> 00:22:10.732
the man who made Petrov’s story public years later - praised him and promised him an award.

00:22:11.612 --> 00:22:18.226
He was, however, also reprimanded, told off, for not logging the incident correctly in the systems.

00:22:19.326 --> 00:22:22.066
In the end, Petrov never got his reward.

00:22:22.486 --> 00:22:26.596
Rewarding him would have put Soviet military leaders in a difficult position.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:32.296
Not only did he go against military protocol, but the false alarm

00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:36.286
highlighted bugs within the Soviet missile detection system, and

00:22:36.536 --> 00:22:40.346
embarrassed the military bosses and the scientists who had designed it.

00:22:41.516 --> 00:22:46.636
If Petrov was to be publicly recognised and honoured, they would have had to be punished.

00:22:47.236 --> 00:22:51.406
So instead of being celebrated and thanked, he was

00:22:51.556 --> 00:22:55.786
denied promotions, reassigned, and took early retirement.

00:22:56.476 --> 00:23:01.376
Indeed, the story was not even known outside the secretive world of the Soviet

00:23:01.386 --> 00:23:07.906
military until the late 1990s when Votintsev wrote about Petrov in his 1998 memoir.

00:23:08.926 --> 00:23:13.036
With time, however, people began to recoginise what Petrov had done.

00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:18.346
In 2006 he received an award from the Association of World

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:23.596
Citizens in New York, and in 2013 won the Dresden Peace Prize.

00:23:24.306 --> 00:23:29.676
The country he served never rewarded him for his actions, and he would retire with

00:23:29.676 --> 00:23:36.196
a small pension in a suburb outside Moscow, before passing away in May of 2017.

00:23:37.136 --> 00:23:43.748
He will go down in history, however, as the unlikely man who just might have saved the world.

00:23:46.338 --> 00:23:52.584
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Stanislav Petrov, a man who, with his

00:23:52.654 --> 00:23:57.534
calm, common sense approach, prevented the world from being plunged into nuclear war.

00:23:58.224 --> 00:24:03.464
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Petrov and his life before today,

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:08.824
or this was the first time you’d heard anything about him, well I hope you learned something new.

00:24:09.644 --> 00:24:12.914
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:16.954
It’s one of those times when one unlikely person is required

00:24:16.964 --> 00:24:20.144
to make a huge decision with far-reaching consequences.

00:24:20.574 --> 00:24:22.534
Can you think of other examples?

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:28.752
What do you think would’ve happened if Petrov hadn’t been working that morning in September 1983?

00:24:29.378 --> 00:24:31.314
How different would the world look now?

00:24:32.064 --> 00:24:35.234
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:17.403
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:21.563
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.533
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.523
talking about Predictions Of The Future From The Past.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:37.253
This episode is going to be released on December 31st of 2021, New Year’s Eve.

00:00:37.753 --> 00:00:42.223
And as we move from one year to the next, it’s a time for

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.843
reflection, a time to think about the future, and what it holds.

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:52.783
So, in today’s episode we are going to think about the future, but we’re going

00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:57.273
to look at predictions of what people thought their future would be like.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:04.433
From predictions of a global population bomb to flying cars, buildings that travelled on

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:10.973
trains to living on Mars, we are going to take a long hard look at visions of the future.

00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:16.083
First we’re going to look at some predictions of the future that turned

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:21.393
out not to be correct, either not correct yet or not correct at all.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:27.753
Then we’ll look at some predictions that were eerily correct, people who correctly

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:32.943
predicted what today’s world would be like despite their world looking very different.

00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:38.923
And finally we’ll take a look at some of the predictions of what some of the

00:01:38.923 --> 00:01:44.873
most respected futurists, that is, men and women whose job is to predict the

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:50.623
future, think the future might hold for us, our children and our grandchildren.

00:01:52.936 --> 00:01:57.096
OK then, Predictions Of The Future From The Past.

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:06.126
In general, as I hope will become clear as you listen to this episode, we humans are not very

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:12.036
good at predicting the future, at least we haven’t been very good in the past hundred years or so.

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:19.352
Before this, especially before the Industrial Revolution, there wasn’t nearly as much interest

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:26.362
in predicting the future, partly due to the fact that the future was thought to be pre-defined

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:34.052
by a divine being, by a God, but also as the world simply didn’t change nearly as much.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:42.962
If you took the average person living in let’s say Rome in the year 100BC,

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:49.162
the year Julius Caesar was born, and transported them 1,000 years into the

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:54.645
future, into the year 900, would they be so surprised at what they found?

00:02:55.475 --> 00:03:00.755
Of course there would be some surprises - the Roman empire would have disappeared and the

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:07.815
city of Rome would look very different, but people’s day-to-day lives would be fairly similar.

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:16.175
Our time-traveller from 100 BC might easily adapt to life 1,000 years in the future.

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:21.735
If we think, however, of what life might be like for you or me,

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:29.225
transported into the year 3,021, in the 31st century, it is completely

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:33.555
unfathomable, it is impossible to think of what it might look like.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:42.285
And even going back 100 years, to 1921, it was hard enough for people then to imagine

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:47.865
what a world might look like only 100 years in their future, where we are now.

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:53.755
This is, of course, due to the pace of technological change.

00:03:54.175 --> 00:04:00.665
Technology, from the smartphone you might be listening to this on or the semiconductors in the

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:07.485
cars you drive, has created worlds that our predecessors had a huge amount of trouble imagining.

00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:12.925
Our lives have been changed in ways that people simply didn’t think possible.

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:17.255
And in many other ways, our lives have not changed, we

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:20.555
have not progressed as fast as people had predicted.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:28.045
So, on that note, let’s look at a few of the predictions from the past that have not come true.

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:33.415
Our first prediction comes from Thomas Robert Malthus, in

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:38.915
his 1798 essay "An Essay on the Principle of Population".

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:44.555
At this time the world population was around 1 billion and the

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:49.075
fast-growing population of England had reached 8 million people.

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:57.535
Long story short, Malthus believed that we were on course for a population explosion, and

00:04:57.745 --> 00:05:03.315
that there would not be enough food to support the bulging, the fast growing, population.

00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:09.095
This wasn’t some crazy theory from an eccentric outsider.

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:15.705
Malthus was an influential and respected economist and scholar, and his book

00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:21.165
contained detailed theory and calculations about why this was going to happen.

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:26.965
Malthus proposed that population growth happens more quickly

00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:31.355
than the ability of a society to increase its food production.

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:38.455
So, because the population grows more quickly than the food supply, the amount of food

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:45.545
per person decreases, meaning that societies lose the ability to feed everyone, there

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:53.065
is famine, war and death, and then the population returns to its normal, correct size.

00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:59.565
Essentially, there is a kind of doomsday scenario where the world runs out of food.

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:04.135
Fortunately, he has been proved incorrect so far.

00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:11.775
Malthus failed to predict the impact of the Industrial Revolution, which came shortly

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:18.205
afterwards, and resulted in huge improvements in mankind’s ability to feed itself.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:24.825
Of course, some parts of the world do experience great famine and a lack of food,

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:31.475
but this is not due to an inherent inability of the world to feed its population.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.935
There’s more than enough food to go around, despite the global population being

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:42.295
almost 10 times what it was when Malthus was predicting this gloomy future.

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:49.565
This was in 1798, but his theory has continued to remain popular.

00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:58.055
170 years later, in 1968 Paul Ehrlich, an economist at Stanford University,

00:06:58.345 --> 00:07:04.205
followed in his footsteps with an explosive book called “The Population Bomb”.

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:12.505
The first sentence of the book read “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.”

00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:21.365
Again, fortunately Ehrlich has not been proved correct, and the world population is set to peak at

00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:29.455
around 2064, so the current view is that it is not population growth per se that we have to fear.

00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:37.295
On the subject of sociological predictions by economists, while it is of course good news that the

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:43.795
predictions of Malthus and Ehrlich have been proved incorrect, no doubt many of us feel slightly

00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:50.445
disappointed that one prediction of the economist John Maynard Keynes hasn’t yet come to fruition.

00:07:51.965 --> 00:07:59.915
Writing in 1930, in an essay called "Economic Possibilities For Our Grandchildren”, Maynard

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:06.825
Keynes wrote that when his children would be grown up people would work just 15 hours a week.

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:13.985
The logic behind this was that productivity gains would mean that we simply didn’t

00:08:13.985 --> 00:08:21.495
need to work any more than 15 hours, because automation and mechanisation would mean

00:08:21.495 --> 00:08:27.875
that after 15 hours of work we would be able to produce enough to meet our needs.

00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:35.025
Now, if you are the sort of person who does only 15 hours of work a week, well done.

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:38.625
It’s safe to say that for the majority of the world

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:42.325
population, our working weeks haven’t got any shorter.

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:46.175
In fact, for many people it’s the opposite.

00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:51.255
The technologies that people thought would make them more efficient

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:55.815
are actually blurring the boundaries between work and leisure.

00:08:56.695 --> 00:09:01.975
If you have your email on your phone and your boss expects you to read and

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:07.165
respond to emails in the evening and on weekends, you are probably working

00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:12.295
longer hours than someone did in the era of Maynard Keynes, where you would

00:09:12.515 --> 00:09:18.195
leave your desk at 5pm on a Friday and not return until 9am on a Monday.

00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:25.255
And while there are constant promises that new technologies and automation will

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:32.195
allow us to lead more fulfilling working lives, where tedious administrative work is

00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:38.025
performed by technology, despite all of the technological advances that have been made

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:43.775
in the almost 100 years since Maynard Keynes prediction, we are not working any less.

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:46.735
And in some cases, we’re working a lot more.

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:53.655
Now, when it comes to the more fun, wacky, strange predictions, some

00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:58.885
of my favourites involve the design of cities and urban environments.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:06.225
In Europe of the 18th and 19th centuries there had been mass migration to the cities.

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:15.545
Before 1600, it’s estimated that less than 5% of the world’s population lived in urban environments.

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:24.695
By 1800, it was 7%; and by 1900 it had more than doubled again, increasing to 16%.

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:29.530
Western Europe was ahead of the curve here.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:41.810
In 1700, 13% of the population lived in cities, in 1800 it was 21% then by 1900 it was 41%.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.760
Understandably, if it seemed inevitable that society was becoming

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.240
urban, people wondered what these cities of the future would look like.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.130
You’ve probably seen artists' impressions of cities of

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.970
the future having flying cars and trains in the sky.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:08.550
In 1900 there were a series of postcards created by a German chocolate factory

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.410
named Theodor Hildebrand & Son, which showed worlds and cities of the future.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:20.890
Some particularly interesting ideas included having a ship that would

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:26.500
move seamlessly from the water onto a train track, and turn into a train.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:34.700
It also envisioned entire houses or buildings that would be able to move on train tracks, as

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.420
well as humans being able to have personal flying machines, essentially giving themselves wings.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.960
Another interesting urban vision was that entire cities would have roofs, that

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.760
there would be huge coverings that would go over cities and protect them from rain.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.330
They also imagined a world in which you wouldn’t have to walk anywhere to go around the city.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:09.460
Instead, the pavements would move on rails, so it would be a little bit like being in an airport.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:17.350
But, almost all of these predictions from only 121 years ago have not come true.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:25.920
And even moving into the more recent future, anyone who is over the age of 30 or so will

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:34.520
no doubt remember the Millennium Bug, the fear in 1999 that when the clocks changed from

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:45.850
23:59 on December 31st of 1999 to midnight, to 00:00, in the year 2000 there would be some

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:52.950
huge collapse as computer systems wouldn't be able to manage the change of date correctly.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.140
There were predictions that it could cost the global economy anything from

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:05.900
$400 million to $600 billion to fix, there were stories of people stockpiling

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:12.250
food, water, and guns in preparation for some kind of armageddon and then...

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.600
it was actually all ok in the end.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.970
Now, while it might be easy to look back at some of these predictions and think, “how ridiculous

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:27.800
- did people actually believe that?”, there have been plenty of predictions that might have

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:35.180
seemed completely wacky and unrealistic at the time, but are now part of our daily lives.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.360
Nikola Tesla, the Serbian-American inventor and electrical engineer who was

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:48.940
born in 1856 was one person who had an uncanny ability to predict the future.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:56.960
He wrote, “As early as 1898, I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:04.120
concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:11.410
itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgement”.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.920
By an automobile carriage, he’s talking about a car, and when he says “left

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:23.100
to itself would perform a great variety of operations involving something

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.640
akin to judgement”, he’s essentially saying it would be able to drive itself.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:37.230
So, this was over 120 years ago, but there is Tesla predicting the creation of the self-driving car.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.276
Yes, I hear you say, self-driving cars aren’t here yet, but they are certainly on the way.

00:14:44.876 --> 00:14:49.156
And there are plenty of Tesla’s predictions that are already here.

00:14:50.196 --> 00:14:55.786
In 1926, which was the same year that the first transatlantic

00:14:55.836 --> 00:15:00.186
telephone call was made, Tesla imagined where this might lead.

00:15:01.316 --> 00:15:06.716
He wrote, and I’m quoting directly here: “When wireless is perfectly

00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:12.056
applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:16.796
fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.

00:15:17.426 --> 00:15:23.096
We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance.

00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:29.536
Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear

00:15:29.586 --> 00:15:34.506
one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:39.976
distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we will be

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:45.046
able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:49.726
A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”

00:15:50.906 --> 00:15:54.626
Now, a wireless instrument through which you can communicate with

00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:58.446
anyone, irrespective of distance, which you carry in your vest pocket.

00:15:58.946 --> 00:16:03.864
Perhaps that’s exactly the device with which you are listening to this now, a mobile phone.

00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:10.974
Indeed, you could say that the most incorrect part of Tesla’s prediction is that he is

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:18.084
assuming that people in the future would still have the same fashion sense as they did in 1926.

00:16:18.584 --> 00:16:23.384
Now, of course, significantly fewer men wear suits and therefore

00:16:23.464 --> 00:16:26.504
would have a vest pocket to put this special device into.

00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:32.064
We could go on and on with Tesla, and he correctly predicted the need

00:16:32.064 --> 00:16:36.844
for us to protect our water supply, he correctly predicted WiFi and

00:16:36.854 --> 00:16:41.454
wireless internet, he even predicted what we would now call “drones”.

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:46.204
And his predictions weren’t only about specific types of

00:16:46.204 --> 00:16:51.934
technology, but how societies would change relating to technology.

00:16:52.964 --> 00:16:56.374
He wrote, and again I’m quoting directly here:

00:16:56.954 --> 00:17:00.424
“Today the most civilized countries of the world spend a

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:05.134
maximum of their income on war and a minimum on education.

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:08.684
The twenty-first century will reverse this order.

00:17:09.144 --> 00:17:15.024
It will be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to die on the field of battle.

00:17:15.544 --> 00:17:22.234
The discovery of a new scientific truth will be more important than the squabbles of diplomats.

00:17:22.664 --> 00:17:26.924
Even the newspapers of our own day are beginning to treat scientific

00:17:26.924 --> 00:17:32.044
discoveries and the creation of fresh philosophical concepts as news.

00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:37.764
The newspapers of the twenty-first century will give a mere ”stick” in

00:17:37.764 --> 00:17:43.024
the back pages to accounts of crime or political controversies, but will

00:17:43.034 --> 00:17:48.904
headline on the front pages the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis.”

00:17:49.844 --> 00:17:56.104
Again, this might seem obvious with the benefit of hindsight, but Tesla was

00:17:56.104 --> 00:18:04.684
born in 1856 and died in 1943 - his entire life was dominated by warfare.

00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:10.664
He would no doubt be disappointed to see how much countries still spend

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:15.754
on war, but he would be pleased to see an increasing spend on education.

00:18:16.894 --> 00:18:23.054
Now, this brings us onto some predictions people are making today about our futures.

00:18:24.094 --> 00:18:30.374
Keeping in mind that what might have seemed possible and probable 100 years ago, for example

00:18:30.664 --> 00:18:36.914
having roofs on cities, has not transpired, it's not happened, and something that might

00:18:36.924 --> 00:18:42.844
have seemed completely impossible, such as being able to talk to anyone, anywhere in the

00:18:42.844 --> 00:18:49.054
world, has proved possible, here are some ideas about what the future might look like.

00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:53.424
I’ll leave it to you to decide whether you believe these might come true.

00:18:54.814 --> 00:19:03.124
So, one famous futurist and American theoretical physicist, Michio Kaku, believes that in the future

00:19:03.474 --> 00:19:10.654
cancer simply won’t exist, and it will be as much of a problem for mankind as the common cold.

00:19:11.404 --> 00:19:17.404
He believes that technology in things like our toilets will be constantly monitoring our bodies,

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:24.434
so that at the first sign of a cancerous cell, it would be able to be treated before it multiplies.

00:19:25.324 --> 00:19:31.904
He goes so far as to say that the word “tumour”, which are the groups of abnormal

00:19:31.914 --> 00:19:37.584
cells often caused by cancer, would simply disappear from the English language.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:42.094
Further afield, there are plenty of people who believe that our

00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:46.714
future is multiplanetary, that humans will live on other planets.

00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:52.764
Elon Musk has made no secret of his belief that humans need to colonise Mars,

00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:58.264
and is busy building companies that will go there and build a new civilisation.

00:19:59.204 --> 00:20:04.104
And, on a more recent note, you may well have seen the announcement from

00:20:04.368 --> 00:20:09.815
Facebook, or should I say Meta, about its vision for the not-so-distant future.

00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:16.205
Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, believes that one future has people spending

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:21.955
long periods of time living in virtual worlds, further blurring the line between the

00:20:21.965 --> 00:20:28.465
physical and digital world, allowing people to exist in this Metaverse, as he calls it.

00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:32.845
Mark Zuckerberg has been right about a lot of things that people

00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:37.120
thought he was crazy about at the time, from buying Instagram to

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:42.155
WhatsApp, so this is no doubt a future that he thinks is very probable.

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:47.895
Now, before you go, I want to share some of the worst predictions with you,

00:20:48.245 --> 00:20:53.615
some that have simply proved to be incredibly incorrect, just in case you need

00:20:53.645 --> 00:20:59.455
any more evidence that we humans are awful at imagining the future, even those

00:20:59.455 --> 00:21:04.005
people who are clearly very intelligent and good at understanding the present.

00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:11.545
So, we are going to do a little mini-Olympics of bad predictions, and we are going to award

00:21:11.575 --> 00:21:19.075
the bronze medal, the third place, to Thomas Watson, the chairman of IBM, the technology

00:21:19.075 --> 00:21:26.545
company, who said in 1943, "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.".

00:21:28.155 --> 00:21:33.305
Then, the runner up, our silver medal, the second place, goes to H.

00:21:33.355 --> 00:21:33.625
M.

00:21:33.655 --> 00:21:38.495
Warner, from Warner Brothers, the film production company, who said in

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:45.065
1927, in the era of silent films, "Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?".

00:21:46.485 --> 00:21:49.395
And the gold medal goes to Charles H.

00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:51.785
Duell, Commissioner of the U.S.

00:21:51.825 --> 00:21:53.215
Office of Patents.

00:21:53.365 --> 00:21:58.685
Now, some people think this is an urban legend, but the story goes that

00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:04.845
in 1899 he said “Everything that can be invented has been invented.”

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:11.225
Whether or not Duell actually said that, it is anyone’s guess, but it is certainly

00:22:11.225 --> 00:22:17.235
true that in general we are simply very bad at predicting what lies ahead of us.

00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:24.199
So, if we go back to the start of the episode, to our man born in 100

00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:28.715
BC in Ancient Rome, he probably wasn’t so concerned with what the future

00:22:28.905 --> 00:22:33.445
might contain for him, as the past wasn’t so different from his present.

00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:40.105
It was only really as the world started to change so quickly, and the society and

00:22:40.105 --> 00:22:45.415
environment we lived in changed that we started to really think about what lay ahead.

00:22:46.395 --> 00:22:51.285
Obviously, there are some pretty frightening predictions about the future, but there is

00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:57.735
a lot to be excited about, and one can only hope, and indeed take actions, that reduce

00:22:57.765 --> 00:23:03.545
the likelihood of the gloomiest of predictions and bring in a brighter future for us all.

00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:11.595
Ok, that is it for today’s episode on Predictions Of The Future From The Past.

00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:15.405
If you are listening to this episode on the day it comes out, on

00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:20.745
December 31st of 2021, then I hope you have a very Happy New Year’s Eve.

00:23:21.255 --> 00:23:27.795
And if you are listening to this episode from 2022, from the future, then I hope it is bright.

00:23:28.505 --> 00:23:32.075
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:32.415 --> 00:23:37.085
What are some other interesting predictions of the future from the past that you know about?

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:41.865
What are some predictions for the future that interest you, that scare

00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:46.425
you, or that you just think are particularly ridiculous or improbable?

00:23:46.765 --> 00:23:50.505
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

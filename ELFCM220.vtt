Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.180
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.514
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:30.866
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another mini-series, this time a 4-part mini-series.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:35.956
And the subject of this mini-series will be gangsters and villains,

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.936
organised criminals with illegal, brutal but interesting stories.

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:48.636
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll talk about The Real Peaky Blinders, the gangsters and criminals

00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:54.186
who roamed the streets of Birmingham, in England, in the late 19th and early 20th century.

00:00:54.906 --> 00:01:01.116
Then in part two, which is going to be one of our member-only ones, we’ll move stateside, to the

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:08.256
United States, to listen to the story of America’s most notorious organised criminal, Al Capone.

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:13.876
In part three we will remain in America, and this time follow the story

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:18.627
of the most famous bank robber of the 20th century, John Dillinger.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:23.786
And then in part four, we’ll come back to the United Kingdom, to the

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.726
East End of London to be precise, and hear about Reggie and Ronnie

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:34.856
Kray, the two twins who terrorised the streets of London in the 1960s.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.150
This mini-series has been hugely interesting to make, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:45.428
OK then, the Real Peaky Blinders.

00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:49.644
A quick administrative point if you’ve never watched the

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:53.684
series, and you’ve never even heard the name “Peaky Blinders”.

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:58.234
It doesn’t matter at all - you don’t need to have seen it to enjoy this episode.

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:04.516
So, with that out of the way, let me paint you a picture, a picture

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:08.176
that will be familiar to those of you who have seen the series.

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:17.511
The year is 1919 and the location is Birmingham, an industrial city in the Midlands of England.

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:27.041
A good looking, clean shaven man wearing a wide hat and a fine suit rides an elegant

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:34.011
black horse slowly down a long street of back-to-back brick houses populated by

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:40.631
Chinese immigrants who look out at the horse and its rider, their eyes full of fear.

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.561
Going about their business on this street were the poorly

00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:48.061
dressed working-class inhabitants of Birmingham, England.

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:56.181
As the people of this inner-city street become aware of the identity of the stony-faced man

00:02:56.381 --> 00:03:03.951
on his magnificent horse, they continue to scatter indoors, clearly afraid of being near him.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:10.301
Further down the street a young Chinese girl, a fortune teller, appears

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:16.601
in front of the horse and, when asked to tell the rider‘s fortune, blows a

00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:23.221
bright red powder into the horse‘s nostrils; this shot, a beautiful piece of

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:29.181
cinematography, lingers as the film moves into Tarantino-like slow motion.

00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:35.811
As the girl runs away, the man on the horse shouts out the name of the horse

00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:40.801
that will win a certain race, telling the listeners not to tell anyone else.

00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:47.701
The man’s name is Thomas Shelby, and he is the protagonist of this series,

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:56.081
“Peaky Blinders”, which first aired in 2013 and has gone on to be a cult hit.

00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.751
Without revealing too much for those of you who haven’t watched the series, “Peaky

00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:08.941
Blinders” follows the story of Thomas Shelby as he battles local gangs, expands

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:16.151
his criminal enterprise throughout the UK, meets gypsies, communists, fascists,

00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:21.971
Russian aristocrats, Italian criminal gangs, Irish separatists, corrupt policemen,

00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:28.151
politicians, Prime Ministers, and generally fights with anyone who gets in his way.

00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:33.221
This series has won critical acclaim for its cinematography,

00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:37.251
its use of music, its actors, and its narrative.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:44.191
But did Thomas Shelby actually exist, and who were the real “Peaky Blinders”?

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.891
Well, unfortunately Thomas Shelby is an invented character.

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:55.541
The Peaky Blinders, on the other hand, existed, and a lot of the events of

00:04:55.591 --> 00:05:01.251
the series have some historical truth to them, but, as is often the case with

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:07.411
dramas inspired by historical events, the real history was quite different.

00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:15.011
So, in this episode we are going to unpack the Real Peaky Blinders, and I’m happy

00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:21.239
to report that the true story is very interesting, albeit slightly less dramatic.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.539
Let’s start by reminding ourselves that Victorian England, that is England of

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.299
the mid to late 19th century, was not a great place to be if you were poor.

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:40.499
And given that around 25% of the population in the late 19th century lived

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:46.039
below the subsistence level, that is the level at which you have enough money

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.919
to eat, it wasn’t a great place to live for large parts of the population.

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:59.029
The Industrial Revolution, which had started in the 18th century, had sucked very large numbers

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:05.429
of working class people, who had previously lived and worked in the countryside, into the cities.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:11.419
Here people lived in crowded urban spaces with poor sanitation.

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:16.129
And the population of English cities expanded quickly.

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:23.239
Birmingham, which will be the setting for today’s episode, and the home for both the real and

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:32.559
fictional Peaky Blinders, went from 74,000 people to over 630,000 during the 19th century.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:34.719
Life was hard.

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:41.784
Pay was poor, living conditions were cramped, worker protections were almost non-existent.

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:48.834
Men tended to work in the factories, or in some sort of manual trade, and women,

00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:54.384
broadly speaking, would remain at home, bringing up an average of 5 children.

00:06:55.364 --> 00:07:00.144
For both men and women, there were very few legitimate ways

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:04.344
of relaxing, there wasn’t much to do in terms of leisure.

00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:11.074
There were practically no open spaces, parks or places for people to have fun.

00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:17.924
For this new breed of mainly male industrial workers, the typical activity

00:07:18.114 --> 00:07:22.884
after long working hours, six days a week, would be drinking in the pubs.

00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:29.424
And for many the twin activity of going to the pub would be fighting.

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:37.644
Small gangs of often young men would form and one of the main ways they would blow off steam, they

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:44.114
would relax and escape from the monotony of their daily working lives would be to fight each other.

00:07:44.894 --> 00:07:49.644
Alongside this, petty crime was rife, it was very common.

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:55.714
Since the 1850s there had been groups of mainly young men who would

00:07:55.894 --> 00:08:00.196
go around the city picking people’s pockets, robbing them, taking

00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:04.877
their money, and generally causing a nuisance, causing problems.

00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:10.857
This was partly due to the fact that there were very few economic opportunities

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:16.107
for young people, and school was still not compulsory, it wasn't required.

00:08:16.847 --> 00:08:21.367
It was also due to the fact that there was little chance of being punished for it.

00:08:22.097 --> 00:08:28.587
There was no official police force until 1856 in the UK, so these

00:08:28.607 --> 00:08:33.507
young men were able to commit crimes without much fear of being caught.

00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:40.927
After the introduction of the police to Birmingham, they started to crack down on these young men.

00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:48.747
But instead of simply stopping committing crimes, these young men fought back against the police.

00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:53.087
They would fight the police, throwing rocks at them, attacking

00:08:53.087 --> 00:08:57.747
them with belts and hammers, and generally causing a nuisance.

00:08:58.827 --> 00:09:02.627
In the early years of the existence of the police force, policemen

00:09:02.627 --> 00:09:06.887
were severely outnumbered by the young men they were at war with.

00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:11.907
And policemen would expect to be regularly attacked by these young men.

00:09:12.447 --> 00:09:20.947
In 1873 there were 450 policemen in Birmingham, and 473 recorded assaults on policemen.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:26.087
So each policeman could expect to be attacked at least once a year.

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:33.127
These groups of young men, the nemesis of the police force, became known as “sloggers”.

00:09:33.827 --> 00:09:39.997
This is an unusual word in English as it generally either describes the process

00:09:40.007 --> 00:09:45.887
of hitting an object, a cricket ball for example, very hard and successfully

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:51.698
or, usually as a noun, meaning something that is hard or difficult –  so

00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:56.758
you might say that climbing a particular mountain will be a hard slog.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:04.748
Sloggers in the sense of violent people means men who go around terrorising others and beating

00:10:04.748 --> 00:10:12.858
them up, usually in the case of the Birmingham sloggers, with fists and the large buckles of belts.

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:18.118
was in the 1880s that we first started hearing about a

00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:22.468
gang of sloggers that calls itself the Peaky Blinders.

00:10:23.418 --> 00:10:26.268
They weren’t sophisticated criminals, they didn’t have

00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:30.998
sprawling criminal empires and alliances with other gangs.

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:33.801
They were rough, tough, street fighters.

00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:38.831
They would rob and steal, they would extort local businesses,

00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:42.655
and they would fight with policemen and other gangs alike.

00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:48.385
And unlike the glamorous and at times honourable Peaky Blinders

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:53.265
of the TV series, the Real Peaky Blinders were far from it.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:59.625
There is a police record of a police officer encountering six or seven gang

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:04.346
members who had been “drinking all the day and fighting all the evening”.

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:09.326
When the police officer arrested one of them for “lewd

00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:14.126
language”, that is for swearing, his friends came to release him.

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:21.916
One of the friends, a 19-year-old boy, threw a brick at the policeman’s head, killing him.

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:30.976
Another story has a peaky blinder seeing someone order a non-alcoholic ginger beer at a pub, and,

00:11:31.206 --> 00:11:37.636
for the crime of wanting a non-alcoholic drink, he was brutally attacked and his skull fractured.

00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:43.786
Let’s just say that the real Peaky Blinders were incredibly violent criminals.

00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:49.046
Soon enough the term “Peaky Blinder” became synonymous with

00:11:49.046 --> 00:11:53.816
a particular type of Birmingham small-time violent criminal.

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:59.926
Although the Peaky Blinders towards the end of the 19th century actually contained

00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:05.916
up to 50 different street gangs, many of them shared a particular sense of style.

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:12.296
The Peaky Blinders TV series has the characters all wearing a particular type of

00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:18.916
hat that would be pulled down over their head, and in the hat these men would have

00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:25.836
put sharp razor blades that they would use to slash, to cut, their enemies faces.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:30.856
There is historical evidence of them wearing particularly

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:35.246
fashionable hats, which would often be pulled down over one eye.

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:40.796
But, as far as these hats containing razor blades and being used as

00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:45.646
weapons, I’m afraid to say that there is really no historical truth to it.

00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:50.286
There’s simply no evidence that the hats were ever used as weapons.

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:56.569
Firstly, these men would use hammers, bricks and heavy belts to fight.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:02.686
A hat, even if it had a sharp razor blade in it, would just not be a

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:06.636
very good weapon in the kind of fight that they would be involved in.

00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:13.926
Secondly, the sort of small disposable razors that they use in the TV series weren’t

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:19.856
actually invented until the start of the 20th century, and they would have been a luxury

00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:25.446
item, not something that was affordable to an impoverished member of a street gang.

00:13:25.966 --> 00:13:33.106
But you might be thinking, “hang on, you started by saying that the series starts in 1919,

00:13:33.686 --> 00:13:39.729
and after World War II, so disposable razor blades would have been invented by this time”

00:13:40.292 --> 00:13:43.252
Well, if this was what you were thinking, well done.

00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:50.512
The series does take place in the post-war period, but the real Peaky Blinders had

00:13:50.522 --> 00:13:56.782
disbanded at least 20 years before this, the original Peaky Blinders had disappeared.

00:13:57.592 --> 00:14:03.012
Instead, they were replaced by new kinds of gangs, led by more sophisticated

00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:07.796
and more ambitious criminals, men who were much more like the Thomas

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:13.236
Shelby of the TV series, much more like the fictional Peaky Blinders.

00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:19.616
These sophisticated and ambitious criminals also exist in the TV series.

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:25.186
The series has characters such as a man called Billy Kimber, who

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:29.936
controls the racetracks, the places where horse races take place.

00:14:30.646 --> 00:14:36.346
There’s also another character called Alfie Solomons, a Jewish gangster from London.

00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:42.576
And another called Charles Sabini, an English-Italian gangster also from London.

00:14:43.376 --> 00:14:50.736
These three men really did exist, and the genius of the series is to transport a

00:14:50.736 --> 00:14:58.306
small violent street gang from the 1880s to the post-war period, in the 1920s, and

00:14:58.476 --> 00:15:03.646
to have this fictional gang fight against all of the real historical characters.

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:11.396
And this world, this underworld of post-World War I England, is full of fascinating people.

00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:17.253
Billy Kimber, a real-life gangster who we meet in the first series of

00:15:17.253 --> 00:15:22.676
Peaky Blinders, was a sophisticated criminal who controlled the bookkeeping

00:15:22.686 --> 00:15:28.446
activities at race tracks, that is the betting on the result of horse races.

00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:33.756
This was one of the only forms of gambling that was allowed in Britain,

00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:39.697
and indeed almost all other forms of betting were illegal until 1960.

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:45.636
The result of this was that betting on horse races was an incredibly

00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:51.606
popular activity, and one where a lot of money was won and mainly lost.

00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:54.846
It was also a rough world.

00:15:55.256 --> 00:16:01.186
Petty criminals would roam around racetracks waiting to see someone who had won big,

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:06.286
who had won a large amount of money, and then rob them, they would steal their money.

00:16:06.996 --> 00:16:10.746
And organised criminals took it a step further.

00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:15.976
They would intimidate the bookkeepers, forcing them to pay them a proportion

00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:21.306
of their profits, and then pay them for protection from other criminal gangs.

00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:29.150
Put short, controlling the race tracks was very profitable, and Billy Kimber and his gang, known

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:35.910
as the Brummagem Boys or the Birmingham Boys, had a monopoly on race tracks in the Midlands area.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.052
Given how profitable this activity was, there were fierce fights over control of the racetracks.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:51.470
Kimber tried to push south to gain control over the more lucrative, the more profitable

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.160
race tracks in the south of the country, but was pushed back by the English-Italian

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.420
gangster, Sabini, another character you’ll come across in the Peaky Blinders series.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:09.270
The rivalry between these two gangs was played out at the race tracks, where they would fight each

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:16.498
other with belts, hammers and bricks, and culminated in something called the Epsom Road Battle.

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:23.258
In 1921, after a race at a town called Epsom, to the south of London,

00:17:23.858 --> 00:17:28.388
Billy Kimber’s men waited for Sabini’s men to return home to London.

00:17:28.988 --> 00:17:34.328
They hid in wait on the main road between Epsom and London, knowing that

00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:38.698
this would be the route that Sabini’s men would take to return to the city.

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:44.938
When what they thought was Sabini’s crew arrived, they blocked the road, and a group

00:17:44.948 --> 00:17:50.878
of 60 men jumped out with axes, bricks and hammers, and violently attacked them.

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:56.668
Terrified residents and onlookers cried out as they called the police,

00:17:57.018 --> 00:18:02.228
fearing that this was a riot by Sinn Fein, the Irish separatists.

00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:09.108
Only afterwards would Kimber’s men find out that it was a case of mistaken identity

00:18:09.428 --> 00:18:15.418
- the men weren’t Sabini’s at all, they were from a group of bookmakers from Leeds.

00:18:16.118 --> 00:18:18.778
This mistake cost Kimber dearly.

00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:25.308
Not only did he understandably aggravate the Leeds bookmakers, but 23 of

00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:30.558
his men were arrested and imprisoned and all of Sabini’s men got away.

00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:36.458
Kimber’s bid to take control of the southern racecourses had failed, and he

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:41.498
would actually end up making peace with Sabini, and retiring to the south

00:18:41.498 --> 00:18:47.564
coast of England where he died in a nursing home in 1945 at the age of 63.

00:18:48.648 --> 00:18:55.318
And as for Sabini, he too seemed to live to a ripe old age, at least for a gangster.

00:18:55.778 --> 00:19:00.270
He died peacefully at home in 1950, aged 62.

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:07.197
So, as to the question of who the real “Peaky Blinders” were, the criminals called

00:19:07.257 --> 00:19:12.597
“Peaky Blinders” were small-time, violent criminals, certainly not the kind of

00:19:12.617 --> 00:19:18.007
people that you would like to meet on a dark street, and not the sort of people

00:19:18.307 --> 00:19:22.627
you would like to be caught ordering a non-alcoholic ginger beer in front of.

00:19:23.647 --> 00:19:27.987
In the interests of balance, there are some similarities between the Peaky

00:19:27.987 --> 00:19:32.747
Blinders of the TV series and the real criminals they are named after.

00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:39.227
The real Peaky Blinders wore smart clothes, they were violent, and they were mostly young men.

00:19:39.607 --> 00:19:43.117
But that’s about where the similarities end.

00:19:43.587 --> 00:19:46.717
The world in which the Peaky Blinders of the TV

00:19:46.717 --> 00:19:50.567
series is set, on the other hand, certainly did exist.

00:19:50.942 --> 00:19:55.902
There was a well-developed criminal underworld, which centred around the race tracks.

00:19:56.532 --> 00:20:00.502
Criminal gangs violently fought each other for control of the

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:04.732
gambling sites, and winning this control could be very profitable.

00:20:05.422 --> 00:20:10.918
But, the Real Peaky Blinders were never in that world, not at that time at least.

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:18.388
By the start of the 20th century they had fizzled out, the small-time gangs of Birmingham,

00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:25.678
which by this time were all given the generic name of the Peaky Blinders, had disbanded and been

00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:31.688
replaced by these more sophisticated, better organised and better managed criminal enterprises.

00:20:32.338 --> 00:20:38.498
Enterprises run by men such as Billy Kimber and Charles Sabini, men who were just

00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:43.988
as violent and ferocious, but fought with their brains as well as their fists.

00:20:44.658 --> 00:20:47.568
So then, who were the real Peaky Blinders?

00:20:47.998 --> 00:20:51.198
They were small-time criminals, ruffians and villains.

00:20:51.378 --> 00:20:57.068
They were certainly products of a cruel system that denied them economic opportunities.

00:20:57.428 --> 00:21:01.598
But they were violent, aggressive, and at times murderous

00:21:01.598 --> 00:21:05.718
thugs, and Birmingham is certainly a safer place without them.

00:21:08.148 --> 00:21:14.528
OK then, that is it for part one, this exploration of The Real Peaky Blinders.

00:21:14.968 --> 00:21:18.378
For those of you who have seen the show, I hope you enjoyed

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:21.868
it and it shed some light on the truth behind the series.

00:21:22.398 --> 00:21:25.908
And if you have never seen the TV Series Peaky Blinders,

00:21:25.908 --> 00:21:28.948
perhaps you’ll be interested in giving it a watch now.

00:21:29.478 --> 00:21:33.218
If you have Netflix, it should be on there, and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.

00:21:33.818 --> 00:21:38.718
And if you’re interested in reading more about the real Peaky Blinders, then there’s an

00:21:38.768 --> 00:21:44.802
excellent book by a historian named Carl Chinn called Peaky Blinders - The Real Story,

00:21:44.962 --> 00:21:49.862
which I would highly recommend, and was very helpful when researching this episode.

00:21:50.702 --> 00:21:54.642
As a quick reminder, this is part one of a four-part series.

00:21:54.912 --> 00:22:00.892
Next up is the Chicago mob-boss Al Capone, then we have the Depression-era

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:06.412
bank robber John Dillinger and then it’s the London gangster twins, The Krays.

00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:10.232
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:10.232 --> 00:22:14.332
Did you know that the real Peaky Blinders actually aren’t much

00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:16.652
like the Peaky Blinders you might have seen on the screen?

00:22:17.092 --> 00:22:20.482
If you’ve seen the series, what did you like about it?

00:22:20.722 --> 00:22:23.322
Who was your favourite character, and why?

00:22:24.112 --> 00:22:28.232
And on an English language level, what did you think of the accent?

00:22:28.732 --> 00:22:34.112
I know that the accent from Birmingham, the Brummie accent, is one that lots of English

00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:38.962
learners have a tough time understanding, so I would love to know what you thought.

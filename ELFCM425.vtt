Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.690
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.540
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.039
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about an

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.380
important political shift: the rise of the political strongman.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.579
Across the world, a series of so-called strong men are now in charge.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.339
Leaders who position themselves as strong and powerful, a defender of their citizens

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.530
and their values, and men who are prepared to do anything to remain in power.

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:50.849
So, in this episode we’ll discuss how this happened, who some of the key “strong

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:56.030
men” are, the strategies that unite them all, and what this means for the world.

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:59.963
OK then, The Rise Of The Modern Strongman.

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:07.583
The famous political theorist Niccolò Macchiavelli once wrote, “Men judge

00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:14.193
generally more by the eye than by the hand, for everyone can see and few can feel.

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:20.421
Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are.”

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.641
Macchiavelli had a firm understanding of the importance

00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.401
of perception; what seems to be, rather than what is.

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:38.301
Fast forward 400 years or so, and his countryman, and one of the fathers of the modern

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:44.281
strongman, Benito Mussolini, had his own reasons to think carefully about this advice.

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.101
Appearance is more important than reality.

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:54.177
Mussolini, as you may know or as you may remember from episode number

00:01:54.177 --> 00:02:00.711
343, was a journalist by training, and knew all too well the power of

00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:05.381
the press, the power of a persuasive article and a powerful picture.

00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:11.521
Mussolini wanted to present himself as a strong and powerful leader,

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.911
someone who could lead a newly-unified Italy into the modern world.

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:22.031
Mussolini’s problem, however, or at least something he felt

00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:26.591
acutely, was that he was very short, he was not a tall man.

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:33.181
At 1.69 m, he would have been looked down on by much of the male

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:37.581
population and a good chunk of the female population at the time.

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:42.811
Although he was a powerful public speaker and was more than

00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:48.001
capable of inspiring a crowd, his stature posed him a problem.

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:56.221
He thought that if people saw his small stature, his words would not have the same powerful impact.

00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:04.051
He solved this, reportedly, by a combination of making sure that he was always photographed

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:10.306
from below, so that he appeared tall in photos, and standing on a box to make himself

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:16.216
seem taller to the crowd, and therefore stronger and more powerful, more of a leader.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:23.556
Clearly, it worked, or at least he was able to project the image of a strong and

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:29.116
decisive leader and as you will know, he went on to rule Italy for two decades.

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:33.626
And Mussolini set an example that was followed by

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:37.096
leaders not just in Europe, but all over the world.

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:45.556
Think of a man, often clad in military gear, standing up straight with his chin jutting out.

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:51.626
He is on a podium surrounded by flags, medals shining on his puffed out chest,

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:56.636
as he takes the salute with his admiring soldiers marching rhythmically past.

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:02.036
Now, you could replace Mussolini with a wide array of different leaders,

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:07.546
from Franco in Spain, to Hitler in Germany or Stalin in the Soviet Union.

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:15.306
They were a recognisable type – they caused massive, untold bloodshed and chaos across the world.

00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:22.176
But, with a few exceptions such as Franco in Spain, Mao in China or

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:27.496
Pinochet in Chile, this type of strongman leader tended to fizzle

00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:31.686
out, at least in the countries where they had previously been popular.

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:37.986
In most Western democracies at least, the post-war political landscape

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:42.666
tended to be characterised by leaders who displayed a subtler

00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:47.576
approach to power, rather than indulging in authoritarian showmanship.

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:53.826
After all, the international system that was created in the aftermath of the Second

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:59.836
World War favoured a more pragmatic, rules-based approach to politics, the kind of

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:04.946
international system which favoured a subtler and more diplomatic approach to politics.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:10.876
Global organisations such as the United Nations and International Monetary

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:15.346
Fund were founded, and playing by the rules, obeying international

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:19.846
law and being a democracy would give countries natural advantages.

00:05:20.856 --> 00:05:25.996
Indeed, in the aftermath of the war, as well as the process of decolonisation,

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:30.806
there was a boom in the number of people living under democratic political systems.

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:35.996
In 1945 there were only 12 democracies in the world.

00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:42.706
By 2002 there were 92, and there has been a general trend towards more

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:47.516
open political systems and governments not dominated by one individual.

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:55.506
But look around the political stage in 2023, or if you're listening to this in 2024, then I'm sure

00:05:55.506 --> 00:06:03.296
in 2024 and you will find dozens of leaders who buck this trend, they do not follow this example.

00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:08.847
Stylistically at least, they have more in common with people like Benito

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:13.217
Mussolini than the leaders of liberal democracies in the late 20th century.

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:21.727
From Russia’s Vladimir Putin to Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, India’s Narendra Modi to the former

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:28.117
Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the former

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:34.467
US President, Donald Trump, the political stage is filled with modern political “strongmen”.

00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:37.117
So, what’s going on?

00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:44.807
Why did strongmen “die out” for a period of 50 years or so, only to reemerge in the 21st century?

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:50.947
Clearly, this is a vast and complicated topic, and the reasons for the rise of

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:56.687
Modi are different to that of Vladimir Putin or Benjamin Netanyahu or Donald Trump.

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:02.527
So, rather than examining the often unique circumstances and characteristics

00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:07.947
of every global strongman, we are going to split this episode into three parts.

00:07:08.787 --> 00:07:13.037
First, we’ll look at some of the common factors that brought the strongmen to power.

00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:18.057
Then, we’ll look at some of the common characteristics of the modern strongman.

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:21.327
And finally, we’ll look at the effect of the world

00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:25.757
being strongmanified, and ask ourselves what comes next.

00:07:26.677 --> 00:07:32.747
So, firstly, what are some of the key factors that caused the rise of the modern strongman?

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:38.227
Well there are five key factors that commentators typically point at.

00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:42.567
First, economic instability and inequality.

00:07:43.517 --> 00:07:48.837
Globalisation has created great wealth, but in developed and less developed

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:53.897
countries, as we all know, this wealth is far from evenly distributed.

00:07:54.897 --> 00:08:01.567
For people who feel like they have been left behind by globalisation, a strongman who promises a

00:08:01.567 --> 00:08:08.224
return to a former situation where things were rosier, well this can be an attractive proposition.

00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:16.694
Secondly, and related to globalisation, mass immigration and large cultural changes.

00:08:17.824 --> 00:08:23.910
Change is scary, and the strongman typically positions himself as a

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.520
guardian of the national identity, someone who will protect a country

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.840
against a wave of people who look and sound…different and dangerous.

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:39.630
Thirdly, the inefficiency of the existing governmental institutions.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:47.118
Donald Trump made a campaign promise to “drain the swamp”, describing Washington and the US

00:08:47.138 --> 00:08:53.278
government apparatus as filled with corrupt career politicians who cared more about lining

00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:59.058
their pockets than working for US citizens, and it was an incredibly effective message.

00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:05.908
Fourth, technological developments have made it far easier to spread information.

00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:12.338
The original strongman, Mussolini, was a journalist at heart, and he knew

00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:16.173
the power of controlling the information that the Italian people received.

00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:22.403
He was one of the first leaders to record his speeches so that they could be spread all over

00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:29.523
Italy, harnessing what was at the time the cutting edge technology of radio to amplify his message.

00:09:30.473 --> 00:09:36.793
And fast forward almost 100 years, and whether it’s social media in the Facebook or

00:09:36.893 --> 00:09:42.903
TikTok sense, or simple messaging apps like Whatsapp, the fact that information can be

00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:49.923
transferred so quickly and easily has created a fertile ground for polarising beliefs, which

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:55.793
attract people to more polarising candidates, and strongmen are nothing if not polarising.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:02.673
And on this note, the fifth and final factor to mention is this increased

00:10:02.763 --> 00:10:08.223
polarisation of political beliefs, the increasing difference between those on

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:13.253
the right and those on the left, and the shrinking space in the political centre.

00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:19.213
If we take the United States as an example, according to a recent

00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:26.073
Pew Research study, 92% of Republicans are to the right of the median

00:10:26.073 --> 00:10:32.073
Democrat and 94% of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.

00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:38.673
In other words, there is very little overlap in political beliefs, the right

00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:42.423
has gone further to the right and the left has gone further to the left.

00:10:43.463 --> 00:10:44.483
To quote W.B.

00:10:44.483 --> 00:10:48.253
Yeats, “the centre cannot hold”, the political centre

00:10:48.443 --> 00:10:52.543
is, in many countries, an empty and lonely place.

00:10:54.243 --> 00:11:01.033
So, to recap, the five key factors that tend to be cited by commentators for creating

00:11:01.033 --> 00:11:06.219
the fertile ground for the modern strongman were economic instability and inequality.

00:11:06.881 --> 00:11:11.381
immigration and cultural changes, weak or inefficient institutions,

00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:14.881
technological developments and political polarisation.

00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:21.811
Of course, there are others in particular cases: religious division in the case of Modi in

00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:29.011
India, and national security in the case of Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, but these five factors

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:33.641
are ones that are most commonly seen in the countries in which strongmen have come to power.

00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.331
Now, let’s move on to look at some of the themes that

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:42.051
unite the modern strongmen themselves, as individuals.

00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:46.421
The first one is that they tend to be men.

00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:51.721
You might have noted that I’ve referred to these strongmen as “he”,

00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:57.231
rather than the more gender neutral “they”, but the reality is, for

00:11:57.231 --> 00:12:02.631
better or for worse, the strongman genre has been almost unanimously male.

00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:08.951
If we go back a few decades, we could classify someone like “The

00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.411
Iron Lady”, Margaret Thatcher, as having “strongman” characteristics.

00:12:14.181 --> 00:12:17.591
And Giorgia Meloni, the female Prime Minister of

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:21.291
Italy, could be categorised as a “modern strongman”.

00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:25.331
But, as of the time of recording this episode at least, she

00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:29.731
hasn't been quite as authoritarian as many of her critics feared.

00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:36.431
So, that’s our first theme that unites the modern strongman: they tend to be male.

00:12:37.941 --> 00:12:43.171
Secondly, the 21st century strongman is typically deeply nationalistic,

00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:48.733
promoting patriotism and loyalty to the nation state above global cooperation.

00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:53.053
No international alliance trumps the national interest.

00:12:54.713 --> 00:12:59.463
And thirdly, on a related note, the strongman is almost

00:12:59.483 --> 00:13:03.313
without exception anti-foreigner and anti-immigration.

00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:10.113
Our country is full as is, he says, we must tighten the borders and stop the flow of foreigners.

00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:16.123
The foreigner is almost always the enemy of the strongman, but he

00:13:16.123 --> 00:13:20.883
will usually add some more enemies in for good measure, scapegoats to

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:25.313
point at and say “hey, these people are causing all of our problems”.

00:13:26.353 --> 00:13:31.783
Ethnic or religious minorities, the media, foreign countries, academics and

00:13:31.793 --> 00:13:36.563
intellectuals, political opponents, of course, and the global system more generally.

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:42.793
Now, you might be listening to this and shaking your head, thinking “but group x or

00:13:42.803 --> 00:13:48.323
y are actually the root cause of many of our problems”, and this might be the case.

00:13:48.713 --> 00:13:54.523
I’m not suggesting that these are always wrong, but rather that the strongman is prepared to

00:13:54.523 --> 00:14:01.043
draw attention to a chosen enemy in a way that more traditional, mainstream politicians are not.

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:09.813
Thirdly, the strongman will also flaunt international rules and norms, simply disregarding

00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:16.363
them as unnecessary, a minor inconvenience rather than a rule to obey and respect.

00:14:17.862 --> 00:14:22.132
The most egregious example of this in recent years must surely be

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:26.492
Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, in violation of international law.

00:14:27.332 --> 00:14:31.602
But you could also point to Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the US

00:14:31.622 --> 00:14:36.412
presidential election, Xi Jinping’s construction of artificial islands in the South

00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:42.012
China Sea or Jair Bolsonaro’s support of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.

00:14:43.212 --> 00:14:49.132
The point is, for the modern strongman, the normal international rules and norms do not apply.

00:14:50.232 --> 00:14:54.982
And when it comes to domestic politics, and tolerance of opposition

00:14:54.982 --> 00:14:59.685
voices, the normal international rules and norms certainly do not apply.

00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:06.245
If you speak out against a strongman, whether that be Putin, Xi, Bolsonaro

00:15:06.275 --> 00:15:12.385
or Erdogan, well your life will be made unpleasant at best, and at worst you

00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:16.225
might find that you have unfortunately fallen out of a tenth floor window.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:22.675
And our final characteristic of the modern strongman follows on the theme of domestic

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:28.445
politics and abuse, and that is that the strongman wants to stay in power for as long

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:33.965
as possible, and is even prepared to adjust the constitution of his country to do this.

00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:39.365
Erdogan has done it, Putin has done it, Xi Jinping has done it, even Trump

00:15:39.615 --> 00:15:43.355
tried to discredit the result of the election when it didn’t go his way.

00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:48.675
Right, let’s move on to the final part of the episode, where we’ll talk about

00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:53.045
the effect of the new era of the strongman, what this means both domestically,

00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:57.375
in the countries the strongman rules over, and the effect on global politics.

00:15:58.655 --> 00:16:01.665
We have, in fact, hinted at many of them already.

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:06.885
On a domestic level, the preference of the modern strongman for strong

00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:11.335
immigration controls, crushing of the opposition and control of the media

00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:16.086
has caused there to be little viable opposition in many strongman countries.

00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:24.396
Nations like China and Russia might be extreme examples, but even the world’s largest democracy,

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:31.456
India, has had its cherished status as the “world’s largest democracy” come into question.

00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:39.646
The NGO Freedom House, which publishes a “democracy score” for each country, changed its rating for

00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:47.800
India from “free” to only “partially free”, giving it the same score as Hungary, which of course

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.866
is run by one of Europe’s most outspoken modern strongmen and favourite of Fox News, Viktor Orbán.

00:16:55.356 --> 00:16:59.788
In terms of the push for constitutional changes, normally to do with the

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:05.488
maximum term length, these of course have long-lasting domestic implications.

00:17:06.488 --> 00:17:10.868
Not only do they mean that that particular strongman is unlikely to

00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:15.588
be going anywhere anytime soon, but it also makes it difficult to roll

00:17:15.598 --> 00:17:19.798
back those changes because the constitution has literally been amended.

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:25.388
Now, in the interest of balance, the strongman would certainly argue

00:17:25.608 --> 00:17:29.548
that he brings a sense of law and order to a country that needs it.

00:17:30.378 --> 00:17:35.618
This is the main message of the strongman, and why this image of strength is so important.

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.978
I am strong enough to crush my opponents, I am the

00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:43.368
strong leader you need to lift you out of this mess.

00:17:44.878 --> 00:17:49.968
In the Philippines, for example, the former strongman president Rodrigo Duterte,

00:17:50.408 --> 00:17:55.498
launched a campaign against drug dealers and drug addicts, once boasting that

00:17:55.498 --> 00:18:00.938
he would be prepared to kill 3 million drug users, an extreme declaration.

00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:08.218
But, clearly, this was a powerful message, and one that resonated with a particular group of

00:18:08.218 --> 00:18:13.878
people who felt like a restoration of law and order was exactly what their country needed.

00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.398
In fact, it resonated with more than just a particular group of

00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:23.808
people; Duterte had a 91% trust rating when he came into office.

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:27.028
He and his policies were incredibly popular.

00:18:28.628 --> 00:18:32.708
And the other main appeal of strongman leaders is that they promise

00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:37.188
to deliver better economic growth than their weak predecessors, but

00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:42.038
unfortunately the statistics show that this does not always play out.

00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:49.408
Clearly, listeners in Turkey will know all too well that Erdogan has not steered the Turkish

00:18:49.408 --> 00:18:55.978
economy in a positive direction, and in fact, a large study from 2019 that looked at the

00:18:55.998 --> 00:19:01.648
economic performance of strongmen and dictators over the past 150 years showed that they

00:19:01.751 --> 00:19:06.875
tended to result in worse economic performance than their more democratic counterparts.

00:19:07.725 --> 00:19:11.345
So, even in the area for which many strongmen are voted

00:19:11.445 --> 00:19:15.005
into power, the economy, they end up underperforming.

00:19:16.025 --> 00:19:22.774
Now, let’s move onto the final section, the international impact of the rise of new era strongmen.

00:19:24.405 --> 00:19:29.925
On the one hand, the strongman is typically less interested in getting involved in international

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:37.068
conflicts that do not directly affect the national security of his The strongman has only one

00:19:37.098 --> 00:19:43.138
interest: his own country, or perhaps if we’re being more cynical, staying in power in his own

00:19:43.138 --> 00:19:50.678
country, and anything that does not directly affect this interest will be deprioritised or ignored.

00:19:51.818 --> 00:19:56.108
But when it comes to international interests that are considered to be of

00:19:56.118 --> 00:20:00.998
deep national interest to the strongman, it is a completely different picture.

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:07.698
If you recall, these new era strongmen are often modelled on the strongmen leaders of the

00:20:07.698 --> 00:20:14.568
1920s and 1930s, brutal dictators whose international ambitions brought on a world war.

00:20:16.028 --> 00:20:21.810
Fortunately, this fate has not been repeated, but, as our Ukrainian listeners will

00:20:21.838 --> 00:20:26.328
know all too well, international sovereignty is something the modern strongman

00:20:26.588 --> 00:20:31.058
takes with a grain of salt, it is something to acknowledge but not respect.

00:20:32.048 --> 00:20:35.108
And the knock-on consequences are very dangerous.

00:20:36.218 --> 00:20:40.768
It seems clear that the war in Ukraine has not gone exactly how Vladimir

00:20:40.768 --> 00:20:45.308
Putin planned, but it has not yet been completely disastrous for him.

00:20:46.228 --> 00:20:47.398
Has he “got away with it”?

00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:48.538
Perhaps.

00:20:49.508 --> 00:20:53.548
Even if you think that he certainly hasn’t got away with it, it has shown

00:20:53.578 --> 00:20:58.148
other strongmen around the world, both strongmen in power and strongmen

00:20:58.148 --> 00:21:01.700
in waiting, what happens when you invade  another sovereign nation.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.280
One must only hope that it is, at least, a suitably unattractive blueprint to follow.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.950
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the rise of the modern strongman.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.600
and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.020
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.480
Is your country ruled by someone who might be called a “strongman”?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.070
If so, who is it and what was their route to power?

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.370
What other factors do you think come into play when we talk about the rise of the modern strongman?

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.920
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:16.418
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:20.409
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.989
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the third and final part of our French mini-series.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.474
In case you missed them, in part one we learned about Joan of Arc,

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.739
the young lady who claimed she had received a message from God to save

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.369
France, and, well, according to some people, that’s exactly what she did.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.489
In part two we jumped forward a few hundred years to learn

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.749
about Le Petit Caporal, the little Corporal, Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.069
And in today’s episode we will learn about The Dreyfus Affair.

00:00:55.669 --> 00:01:02.819
It’s a story that involves the military, the press, suicide, murder, treason, anti-Semitism,

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.539
“Devil’s Island” prison, and the most famous miscarriage of justice in French history.

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:13.229
It’s an amazing story, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.109
On the 21st of February 1895, a 35-year-old Frenchman boarded a ship.

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.089
It would take him across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.719
The journey was long and arduous, most unpleasant.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:38.369
He finally arrived at his destination, a small island off the coast of South America.

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:45.989
This was no 19th century tourism pioneer, no daring French explorer.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.529
And this was no ordinary island.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.259
It was nicknamed “Devil’s Island”, and it was used only

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.229
for the most dangerous, the worst, political prisoners.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:08.689
The man would call this island home for four and a half years, and these years were hellish indeed.

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:16.449
He lived in a 16 metre square stone hut, often chained up, tormented by

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:22.279
his guards, mosquitoes, torrential rain and the scorching heat of the sun.

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:28.049
On this island, he was completely cut off from the outside world,

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.439
he had no idea what was going on in his home country of France.

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:38.972
What was going on, in fact, was the biggest political scandal in French

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:44.492
history, a scandal that had divided the country in two, caused one of its

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:50.372
most famous authors to flee, and had exposed deep tensions in the country.

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:58.272
Although the man had no idea of its very existence, the scandal was all about him.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:05.912
The scandal was L’Affaire Dreyfus, the Dreyfus Affair, and the man imprisoned on the

00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:11.662
island was, of course, Alfred Dreyfus, or as we’d say in English, Alfred Dreyfus.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:18.972
Now, before we go into the details of how Dreyfus ended up on Devil’s Island in the first place,

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:25.322
it’s worth spending a few moments reflecting on some French history leading up to this period.

00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:32.032
There was the revolution in 1789, subsequent serious reforms of the French state,

00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:37.442
and intermittent wars with other European powers running throughout the 19th century.

00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:47.122
Most importantly for our story, the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian war had resulted in

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:53.692
a major defeat for France, the loss of French territories including Alsace, and the

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:58.842
unification of Germany, which was what the whole war had been fought to try to stop.

00:04:00.232 --> 00:04:07.638
Given that much of the 19th century had been marred by war, it seemed inevitable that

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:12.998
fighting would break out again, so there was something of an arms race between France

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:18.718
and Germany, with both nations building up their military, investing in military

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:25.068
technology and, importantly, trying to figure out what the other’s next move would be.

00:04:26.168 --> 00:04:31.608
On a social level, as has unfortunately been the case throughout much of history,

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:37.518
Jewish people all across Europe had experienced persecution in various forms.

00:04:38.648 --> 00:04:45.158
In Eastern Europe this often took the form of pogroms, violent protests where Jews were

00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:51.058
attacked, murdered, forced out of towns and cities in state-sanctioned anti-Semitism.

00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:56.634
In France, on the other hand, with the Declaration of the Rights of Man,

00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:01.614
Jews had been granted the same rights as every other French citizen.

00:05:03.064 --> 00:05:07.104
Finally, Jewish people were legally treated the same as everyone

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:11.554
else, but this didn’t mean that they were actually treated the same.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:17.558
There was a resurgence of anti-Semitism, anti-Jewish feeling in France.

00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:22.978
There was even something called the Anti Semitic League that was formed

00:05:22.978 --> 00:05:29.278
in 1889 by a journalist named Eduard Drummond, a man who had published a

00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:34.399
popular anti-Semitic manifesto called “Jewish France” a few years beforehand.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:42.589
So, the point to remember is that you have a politically and militarily tense situation between

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.469
France and Germany combined with Jewish people theoretically having the same rights as everyone

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:55.629
else in France, but in reality battling some heavily entrenched anti-Semitism in French society.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.679
So, as to the affair itself, what happened?

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.389
Well, it all started in September 1894 after a cleaner

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.759
went to empty the bins at the German Embassy in Paris.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.520
The cleaner found a note.

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:19.875
Although it had been torn into six pieces, its contents were clearly legible.

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:26.919
It was addressed to Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, the Germany military attaché to France.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:35.069
It was unsigned, anonymous, but it was clearly from a French officer who was

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:41.529
passing French military secrets to Schwartzkoppen, and thereby the German state.

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.979
A spy had been caught red handed!

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:50.849
In fact, this discovery was no coincidence.

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:56.439
The cleaner wasn’t just a cleaner; she was the wife of a French soldier, and

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:01.299
had been enlisted specifically to try to dig up secrets on Schwartzkoppen,

00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:06.461
to root through his belongings to try to identify his French contacts.

00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:13.421
See, Schwartzkoppen had long been known to the French, they knew he was trying to dig

00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:19.391
up French military secrets and they suspected he had a source in the French military.

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:24.011
He was a spy, essentially, but not a particularly good one.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:29.981
In fact, he had quite an interesting private life and plenty of secrets of his own.

00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:36.751
He had had an affair with the wife of the Counsellor at the Dutch Embassy in Paris as well as

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:42.201
an affair with the male Italian military attaché, both of which were relatively well known.

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:47.651
Anyway, all of this plus the fact that he tore up this deeply

00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:53.181
incriminating letter and simply left it in his rubbish bin suggests that

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:57.541
he wasn’t particularly good at covering his tracks, at keeping secrets.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:04.461
When the cleaner found this note she immediately took it to her handlers, and

00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:10.418
it made its way up to the French Minister of War, General Auguste Mercier.

00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:16.641
To state the obvious, whoever wrote the note was in serious trouble.

00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:23.101
They had committed the worst crime a French soldier could: treason,

00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:29.231
and what’s more, against its greatest enemy and rival, Germany.

00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:36.781
The culprit needed to be found, not only to stop the flow of valuable information but

00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:42.511
to make an example of, to show what happens to someone when they betray their country.

00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:49.351
The problem was that the only evidence against the traitor was the unsigned note.

00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:59.051
An investigation was launched, and it focussed on two areas: firstly, motive, so, who would

00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:05.031
want to do this, what kind of person might be inclined to pass information to the Germans.

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.571
And secondly, the note itself.

00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:13.761
If the investigators could find someone with the same handwriting

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:17.221
as in the note, they would have found their guilty man.

00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:21.131
It didn’t take the investigators much time.

00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:28.411
On October 15th, 1894, a 35-year-old artillery officer called

00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:32.141
Alfred Dreyfus was summoned to speak with his superiors.

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:38.601
He was told that they knew he was a spy, it was him who had written the letter.

00:09:39.471 --> 00:09:44.201
They told him to confess his guilt and sign a written confession.

00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:46.331
He refused.

00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:50.001
It wasn’t me, he said, you have the wrong man.

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:56.541
His interrogators wouldn’t listen; they seemed keener on getting him to confess than

00:09:56.751 --> 00:10:01.011
uncovering any kind of evidence that it was indeed Dreyfus who had written the letter.

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:09.191
One of the officers even placed a pistol on the desk in front of the prisoner, indicating to

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:15.951
him that he should commit suicide, he should kill himself as the only way out of this situation.

00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:21.911
But Dreyfus maintained his innocence, he didn’t sign a confession,

00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:26.271
and he didn’t pick up the gun and put a bullet in his brain.

00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:30.741
It turned out that the evidence that they had against him

00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:36.091
was flimsy at best, or really it was completely non-existent.

00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:44.421
He had been identified as someone who probably would be a spy, first because he was from Alsace, he

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:49.971
was from the area of eastern France that had been won by the Germans after the Franco-Prussian war.

00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:57.341
This was the main reason that he was suspected of being the guilty party, but he was also rich

00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:04.771
and Jewish, an easy target in a country where anti-Semitism was widespread and Jewish people were

00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:11.931
often considered untrustworthy, part of some wider Jewish conspiracy and not loyal to France.

00:11:13.328 --> 00:11:21.088
Dreyfus, being Alsatian and Jewish, was soon identified as a prime suspect and taken into

00:11:21.108 --> 00:11:27.828
custody for questioning, or perhaps more accurately, taken into custody and pressured to confess.

00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:34.118
This all happened behind closed doors, it was not known to the public.

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:40.878
But on October the 29th, two weeks after his arrest, news

00:11:40.898 --> 00:11:45.208
of Dreyfus’ alleged treachery broke in the French press.

00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:52.058
It broke in a newspaper called La Libre Parole, a newspaper which was owned by Édouard

00:11:52.058 --> 00:11:56.488
Drumont, the founder of the anti-Semitic league you heard about a few minutes ago.

00:11:57.945 --> 00:12:02.245
La Libre Parole, If you translated it into English would be something

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:07.605
like “Free Speech”, but this newspaper did not give Alfred Dreyfus

00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:11.255
the freedom to defend himself of the accusations it made against him.

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:17.895
It reported only the fact that a rich Jewish soldier had been found

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:23.595
spying not just against France, but for its archenemy, Germany.

00:12:24.985 --> 00:12:28.455
The article didn’t say anything about the fact that there was essentially

00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:33.125
no evidence against Dreyfus, firstly because the military kept all of the

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:38.815
details about the investigation secret and secondly because the story of a

00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:44.555
rich Jewish officer colluding with the enemy just sounded right to its readers.

00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:51.175
The fact that Dreyfus was a Jew meant that of course he would do something like this, the

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:57.125
evidence would surely show that he was the traitor the paper’s readers believed French jews to be.

00:12:58.575 --> 00:13:02.405
There was one person, however, who simply didn’t believe

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:05.815
the accusations, Mathieu Dreyfus, Alfred’s brother.

00:13:07.135 --> 00:13:12.545
He knew his brother, he knew this was something he would never do, and he

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:18.075
embarked on what would become a five year campaign to clear his brother’s name.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:25.165
He rushed to Paris, found a well-known and respected lawyer, and tried to defend

00:13:25.165 --> 00:13:30.485
his brother against the allegations both in the legal system and in the press.

00:13:31.815 --> 00:13:37.305
Articles continued to come out in the French newspapers about Dreyfus, especially in the

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:44.095
anti-Semitic newspapers, which pointed at Dreyfus’s treachery and said, “look, we told you so,

00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:49.895
we’ve been telling you that Jews were up to no good, and now one has been caught in the act”.

00:13:51.305 --> 00:13:56.365
All the while, military prosecutors were gathering evidence against Dreyfus.

00:13:57.505 --> 00:13:59.785
The problem was… there was none.

00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:05.315
The only piece of actual evidence against the spy was the note.

00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:10.785
The investigators had compared Dreyfus’ handwriting to the handwriting on the

00:14:10.785 --> 00:14:15.975
note and concluded that they were similar enough to bring him in for questioning.

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:21.175
A handwriting expert had been consulted, but he had said that

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:24.975
the two handwritings weren’t a match, they weren’t the same.

00:14:26.285 --> 00:14:33.295
A second expert was consulted, but this man wasn’t a handwriting expert, he was just the inventor

00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:38.708
of something called forensic anthropometry, which is basically the science of human measurements.

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:44.908
The man, somewhat bafflingly, suggested that Drefyus had faked

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:48.618
his own handwriting, and that he was certainly the culprit.

00:14:49.948 --> 00:14:54.358
Now, these details weren’t revealed until afterwards, the entire

00:14:54.358 --> 00:14:58.168
investigation was kept secret from the public while it was going on.

00:14:59.408 --> 00:15:06.608
Dreyfus was taken to a military tribunal, a military court, on December 19th, and it was only

00:15:06.618 --> 00:15:11.378
then that the lawyer his brother had retained got a chance to see the evidence against him.

00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:18.018
The good news was that this evidence was no evidence at all - there was only the note, there

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:23.278
was no agreement between handwriting experts about whether this was definitely Dreyfus.

00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:30.918
What’s more, there were plenty of witnesses who would testify as to Dreyfus’ good character - he was

00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:38.098
a well-respected, clever and talented army officer with no discernible motive to betray his country.

00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:44.908
The bad news, however, was that Dreyfus’ name and reputation had been dragged

00:15:45.128 --> 00:15:49.598
through the mud in the press for the previous month and a half, and that it

00:15:49.608 --> 00:15:54.138
would be deeply embarrassing for the French military to admit that they had

00:15:54.168 --> 00:15:59.738
got the wrong man, and consequently, that the real spy was still walking free.

00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:04.751
Still, the military court needed to come to a decision.

00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:10.584
On the 22nd of December 1894 the verdict was announced.

00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:18.081
Alfred Dreyfus, the 35 year old army officer was found guilty of high treason.

00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:20.121
The sentence?

00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:25.731
Fortunately it wasn’t the death penalty; France had abolished the death

00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:30.561
penalty for political crimes in 1848, although there were no doubt

00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:34.201
moments on Devil’s Island where Dreyfus would have preferred to be dead.

00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:42.551
His punishment was to be deported, to be sent to a penal colony for the rest of his life.

00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:47.361
First he needed to be stripped of his military title.

00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:54.761
He was, up until this point, a distinguished army officer, and had enjoyed a successful career.

00:16:56.104 --> 00:17:02.971
But on January 5th, 1895, he was paraded through the streets of Paris where he was

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:10.011
confronted by jeering crowds yelling taunts at him - “Death to Judas, death to the Jew”.

00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:16.781
His final destination was the Military School in Paris, where he was publicly

00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:22.031
stripped of his military uniform - the ultimate embarrassment for a military officer.

00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:29.541
And after a month in solitary confinement, allowed only to see his wife twice a week in

00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:36.061
the presence of a prison guard, he was packed off on a ship and sent to Devil’s Island.

00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:41.381
As he sat on the boat, convinced of his own innocence,

00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:45.111
he must have felt a sense of complete helplessness.

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.821
He was public enemy number one.

00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:53.191
People had been calling for his execution, demanding that an exception

00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:57.521
be made in the case of this man who had conspired against France.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:03.731
Dreyfus knew, of course, that he was innocent, he was no traitor, but

00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:08.211
thousands of kilometres away from France, chained up on a tropical

00:18:08.231 --> 00:18:12.511
island with no means of escape, he was powerless to do anything about it.

00:18:13.431 --> 00:18:19.141
Fortunately his brother, Mathieu, did not stop fighting to clear his brother’s name.

00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:26.861
He was helped in the summer of 1895 when a man called Major Picquart took over as the head

00:18:26.871 --> 00:18:32.781
of staff at the Military Intelligence Service, essentially the French spying organisation.

00:18:34.121 --> 00:18:40.911
In March the following year, so this is 1896, he found a telegram that Schwartzkoppen,

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:47.571
the German spy, had intended to send to a French military officer called Major Esterhazy.

00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:54.841
And shortly afterwards he found a note from Major Esterhazy to Schwartzkoppen, the German.

00:18:56.161 --> 00:19:01.711
When he looked at Esterhazy’s handwriting, it was an exact match for the

00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:06.631
handwriting on the original note, the note that had caused this entire scandal.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:11.751
Major Esterhazy was the spy, not Alfred Dreyfus.

00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:14.131
The truth had finally been revealed!

00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:19.271
But if you’re thinking that this is the end of the story, and that

00:19:19.271 --> 00:19:23.431
Dreyfus would be immediately returned from Devil’s Island and given a

00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:27.651
hero’s welcome by the French state, you will be sorely disappointed.

00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:34.841
Major Picquart went to his superiors, but he was told to shut up, essentially.

00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:40.821
Dreyfus was a rich Jew, why was Picquart making such a fuss about him?

00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:44.751
Why not just let him rot on Devil’s Island, he was told.

00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:51.931
Dreyfus had been found guilty not only in the military court but in the court of public opinion.

00:19:52.761 --> 00:19:59.391
Going back and saying “oops, we got the wrong guy” would be of huge embarrassment for the military.

00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:06.811
What’s more, the man Picquart accused, Esterhazy, was a close friend of one of the men

00:20:07.031 --> 00:20:12.841
who had first accused Dreyfus, Major Henry, so he had powerful friends in the army.

00:20:14.331 --> 00:20:19.311
Major Picquart would be a problem for the French military, and as a result

00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:23.471
he was transferred to North Africa where he would be out of the way.

00:20:24.688 --> 00:20:31.101
But Picquart didn’t stop; he had told Mathieu Dreyfus of his discovery, and it became

00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:36.941
public knowledge that this man, Esterhazy, stood accused of being the real traitor.

00:20:38.272 --> 00:20:43.092
The country was divided between those who believed that Dreyfus was innocent - the

00:20:43.282 --> 00:20:49.236
so-called Dreyfusites, and those who thought he was guilty, the anti-Dreyfusites.

00:20:50.492 --> 00:20:54.892
Despite the best attempts of the anti-Dreyfusites in the military, Mathieu

00:20:54.892 --> 00:20:59.342
Dreyfus lodged a formal complaint against Esterhazy with the French

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:03.892
Minister of War, meaning that there was a legal duty to investigate it.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:11.932
Although it was clearly him, incredibly, the military found Esterhazy innocent and acquitted him.

00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:19.172
Esterhazy had powerful friends in the military, and it turned out that his treachery had

00:21:19.172 --> 00:21:25.102
been motivated by financial reasons, as he was a degenerate gambler and heavily in debt.

00:21:26.132 --> 00:21:31.732
Essentially, he wasn’t deemed a threat and his friends in the army thought they could

00:21:31.732 --> 00:21:37.092
allow him to slip off into the night, never to reveal the actual truth of the matter.

00:21:38.492 --> 00:21:45.040
But anyone who examined the evidence calmly and rationally could see that Esterhazy,

00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:51.232
the man who had just been declared innocent, was guilty, and the man chained up on

00:21:51.232 --> 00:21:57.472
Devil’s Island, the man who had been declared guilty in December of 1894, was innocent.

00:21:58.972 --> 00:22:04.972
Bizarrely free, Esterhazy promptly fled to England, never to return to France again.

00:22:06.462 --> 00:22:12.422
Back in France, the fight to clear Dreyfus’ name intensified, and his case was

00:22:12.422 --> 00:22:17.592
taken on by people much more powerful and notable than Dreyfus' brother, Mathieu.

00:22:18.852 --> 00:22:24.922
Most famously, on January 13th, 1898, one of France’s most famous

00:22:24.922 --> 00:22:29.792
writers, Emile Zola, penned an open letter to the French president.

00:22:31.152 --> 00:22:35.192
It was published in a liberal newspaper called l’Aurore, and

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:40.502
led with the headline “J’Accuse”, “I’m accusing”, or “I accuse”.

00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:46.672
In it he implored the French president personally to look into the

00:22:46.672 --> 00:22:52.232
case, which by this time was clearly full of fabrications and lies.

00:22:53.512 --> 00:23:00.692
Perhaps amazingly, Emile Zola found himself now accused of defamation, of damaging the

00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:07.032
good reputation, not of Esterhazy or of any individual, but of the French government.

00:23:08.202 --> 00:23:12.082
He had, essentially, called into question the judgement

00:23:12.212 --> 00:23:15.602
of the French military court, and this was a crime.

00:23:16.882 --> 00:23:20.652
The author was sentenced to a year in prison and given

00:23:20.812 --> 00:23:25.312
a heavy fine, and was then forced to escape to England.

00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:33.012
This was perhaps the height of the division of France into Dreyfusites and anti-Dreyfusites

00:23:33.672 --> 00:23:38.542
with the country deeply divided between those who thought that Dreyfus was innocent and

00:23:38.552 --> 00:23:44.302
those who thought he was guilty, with anti-Semitic feelings dominating the latter group.

00:23:45.302 --> 00:23:48.832
After all, there simply was no evidence he was guilty,

00:23:49.202 --> 00:23:52.292
and there was plenty of evidence that another man was.

00:23:53.762 --> 00:24:00.192
While all of this was going on, the man at the centre of the entire affair, Alfred Dreyfus, was

00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:06.802
withering away on Devil’s Island; his condition was getting worse and worse, he had lost his teeth

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:12.852
and his ability to speak, and he had no idea about what was happening back in his home country.

00:24:14.032 --> 00:24:17.872
Back in France he would have been horrified to find out that there were

00:24:18.002 --> 00:24:23.342
anti-Semitic riots and increasing violence against the country’s Jewish population.

00:24:24.612 --> 00:24:30.882
But slowly slowly, evidence was mounting, evidence that would prove his innocence.

00:24:32.242 --> 00:24:38.312
First, Esterhazy confessed to a British newspaper that he was the spy, and in

00:24:38.372 --> 00:24:44.122
August 1898 Major Henry, the major who had originally pointed the finger at

00:24:44.122 --> 00:24:49.472
Dreyfus, admitted that he had forged documents to make Dreyfus seem guilty.

00:24:50.792 --> 00:24:56.092
The next day he took a razor and slit his own throat, Henry killed himself.

00:24:57.592 --> 00:25:00.202
The evidence was now too great to ignore.

00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:05.762
The case was referred to the Supreme Court, and a retrial ordered.

00:25:07.062 --> 00:25:11.952
Alfred Dreyfus was called back to France to face trial for a second time.

00:25:12.962 --> 00:25:19.982
He stepped foot on French soil on June 30th, 1899, four and a half years after he

00:25:19.982 --> 00:25:24.802
had departed, only to find a very different country to the one he had left behind.

00:25:26.172 --> 00:25:27.962
He still wasn’t a free man, though.

00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:33.272
There was another trial, and incredibly, despite the fact that Esterhazy had

00:25:33.272 --> 00:25:39.342
admitted he was guilty, and Major Henry admitted he had forged evidence, Dreyfus

00:25:39.512 --> 00:25:45.252
was found guilty of treason again, and sentenced to another ten years in prison.

00:25:46.622 --> 00:25:50.732
The good news, however, was that the court decided that there were

00:25:50.952 --> 00:25:56.582
“extenuating circumstances”, unusual factors, and offered to pardon Dreyfus.

00:25:57.702 --> 00:26:02.592
The bad news was that you can only be pardoned for something you admit you are

00:26:02.592 --> 00:26:08.052
guilty of, so Dreyfus would have to admit he was guilty in order to go free.

00:26:09.552 --> 00:26:11.232
So, what did he do?

00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:16.212
He admitted his guilt, knowing full well that he was innocent.

00:26:17.712 --> 00:26:19.312
You can hardly blame him.

00:26:19.652 --> 00:26:23.952
He had been in prison, away from his family, for almost five years,

00:26:24.322 --> 00:26:27.922
he was already guilty in the eyes of a particular section of the

00:26:27.922 --> 00:26:32.472
French public, and by admitting this fake guilt he would go free.

00:26:33.672 --> 00:26:40.702
So, this is exactly what he did, on September the 21st 1899, almost exactly five

00:26:40.702 --> 00:26:46.072
years after the incriminating letter was discovered, Alfred Dreyfus walked free.

00:26:47.412 --> 00:26:52.792
It wouldn’t be until 1906, however, that Dreyfus was officially cleared of

00:26:52.792 --> 00:26:58.702
all his crimes, and in fact reinstated as an army officer, being promoted to

00:26:58.702 --> 00:27:02.392
the rank of major, which would have realistically been where he would have got

00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:06.282
to had he not become the centre of the country’s biggest political scandal.

00:27:07.622 --> 00:27:11.972
He served for a year before retiring, and lived for another

00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:16.638
three decades until his death at the age of 75 in 1935.

00:27:17.812 --> 00:27:24.582
Now, as to the legacy of the Dreyfus Affair, it was a deeply divisive period in French history,

00:27:24.912 --> 00:27:31.222
a period where the fate of one man came to symbolise something much greater than the man himself.

00:27:32.412 --> 00:27:39.052
France was theoretically a place where everyone enjoyed the freedom of liberty, equality

00:27:39.272 --> 00:27:45.252
and brotherhood, but the Dreyfus Affair, as it would come to be known, revealed that

00:27:45.262 --> 00:27:51.432
these rights were not equally enjoyed, most markedly by the country’s Jewish population.

00:27:52.892 --> 00:27:58.302
And the case continues to divide France, or at least be controversial, to this very day.

00:27:59.482 --> 00:28:03.932
President Macron has publicly stated that France must not repeat the

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:08.592
injustices of the Dreyfus Affair, yet doubts over Dreyfus’ innocence

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:13.522
continue to be raised by several prominent figures on the French far right.

00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:23.022
It has been over 100 years since his exoneration, and almost 100 years since his death, but

00:28:23.172 --> 00:28:29.682
it seems that Alfred Dreyfus will forever be remembered as France’s most famous innocent man.

00:28:32.472 --> 00:28:36.862
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Dreyfus Affair,

00:28:37.202 --> 00:28:41.112
and with it comes the end of this French-themed mini-series.

00:28:41.662 --> 00:28:46.882
As a reminder, in part one we talked about Joan of Arc and in part two it was Napoleon.

00:28:47.982 --> 00:28:50.422
As always, I would love to know what you thought about

00:28:50.442 --> 00:28:53.142
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:28:54.022 --> 00:28:57.052
For the French listeners among you, what do you think

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:00.482
the lasting legacy of the Dreyfus Affair in France?

00:29:00.882 --> 00:29:03.602
Who else should we have covered in this mini-series?

00:29:03.962 --> 00:29:06.992
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:21.396
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:29.476
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Curious History of Spice.

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:35.036
In this episode we will learn about what spices actually are, why they

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:39.866
became so popular, when countries literally went to war over them,

00:00:40.116 --> 00:00:44.616
and the impact that the spice trade had on the world we live in today.

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:48.866
It is a really interesting topic, and I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:54.806
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:36.096
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:40.846
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:44.996
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:53.528
Now, if there is one thing we probably all take for granted in life, it is spice.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:58.658
On almost any restaurant table in Europe you would find a little container

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:03.888
with salt and pepper, the stuff is literally given away for free with a meal.

00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:11.769
And most supermarkets have an extraordinary collection of spices, from cinnamon to oregano,

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:19.839
nutmeg to lavender, it is possible to buy almost any spice for a relatively small amount of money.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.609
But it hasn’t always been like this.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.349
And indeed, spices, even the most common and cheapest today, used

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.189
to be incredibly expensive, the preserve of the richest in society.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.279
The history of how they went from rich man’s luxury to

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.379
something we can all sprinkle on our food is fascinating.

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:49.279
But before we dive right into the history, it’s worth asking ourselves what

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:55.529
we actually mean by spices, where spices grow, and what spices actually are.

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.379
To start off with, let’s clarify one thing.

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.089
Salt is not a spice, it’s a mineral, it is Sodium Chloride.

00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:06.789
A spice is part of a plant.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:13.169
It normally comes from the seed, from the bark, the fruit, or the root of the plant.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.459
It’s different from a herb, which typically comes from the leaves or flowers of a plant.

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:23.046
And why do we eat spices?

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.876
Why do we put them on our food?

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.816
Well, because we like the taste, of course.

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:33.306
Whether you are the sort of person who puts tonnes of chillies on their food and

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:39.016
gets excited by a vindaloo curry, or if you are the sort of person who just likes a

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:44.906
little bit of pepper with their food, almost everyone consumes some amount of spice.

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:51.096
And if you consider sugar to be a spice, which by some it is still is considered

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:55.766
to be a spice, then there is probably spice in almost everything you eat.

00:03:56.556 --> 00:04:00.226
To put it simply, spices make food taste better.

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:07.086
How much spice you like on your food probably depends on where you are from, and where you grew up.

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:12.926
If you are from a northern European country, like I am, then you might have

00:04:12.926 --> 00:04:18.056
grown up eating not very much spicy food, and this is of course one of the great

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:23.046
criticisms of much of northern-European food - that it doesn’t taste of anything.

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:29.126
But if you are from, let’s say southern India, west Africa, or

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:34.236
Mexico, then you are probably used to having a relatively spicy diet.

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:42.476
There is, as you no doubt know already, a correlation between how close to the equator a country is,

00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:49.606
how hot that country is, and how much spice is traditionally used in its cuisine, in its cooking.

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:51.906
Why, you might ask.

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:55.326
Well, there are several theories about this.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:05:02.676
The first and most obvious is that this is where spices grow, so obviously these cuisines

00:05:02.796 --> 00:05:09.276
had primary access to them, and they became part of the style of food preparation.

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:16.316
There are also theories that using spices in food makes you sweat, and sweating

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:22.236
helps you cool down (which of course is handy if you are living in a hot climate).

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:28.926
Another theory is that, because spices contain antibacterial properties, they were

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:34.746
used to preserve meat and food, which would go bad more quickly in hotter climates.

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:42.796
The theory goes that people who used spices on food tended to live for longer, because their

00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:48.356
food wouldn’t have bacteria in it, and they would teach their children to use spices to

00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:54.366
preserve food, and thus spice became part of their cuisine, and they developed a taste for it.

00:05:55.296 --> 00:06:01.156
While we might never know the real reason, and food historians still don’t agree

00:06:01.156 --> 00:06:06.456
on the reason for this, there was a clear division between the regions, between

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:11.766
the parts of the world, that had and used spices, and the regions that didn’t.

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:17.876
And this division is key to our story, and helps us understand

00:06:18.016 --> 00:06:21.936
how the spice trade shaped the world we live in today.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:26.676
There is evidence of spices being prized, of them being

00:06:26.676 --> 00:06:30.336
highly valued, almost since the beginning of time.

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:36.676
When archaeologists were examining the mummified body of the Egyptian pharaoh,

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:45.096
Ramses II, who died in 1224 BC, they found two peppercorns inside his nose.

00:06:46.086 --> 00:06:51.486
We know that the Egyptians would bury valuable possessions with their pharaohs,

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:58.176
and this gives us an indication of the importance of pepper, over 3,000 years ago.

00:06:59.266 --> 00:07:05.546
The Romans and Greeks used any spices, and food flavourings, that they could get their hands on.

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:11.816
Roman soldiers would be paid partly in salt, giving us the word salary.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:17.436
As we already clarified, salt is a mineral, not a spice, but Romans

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:21.116
weren’t worrying too much about the distinctions between the two.

00:07:21.636 --> 00:07:26.876
The point here is about quite how much value was placed on something that

00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:32.596
nowadays is practically free, or at least is a tiny cost for most people.

00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:38.706
Certainly, I imagine if your employer was to suggest that part of your

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:43.906
salary was to be paid in salt, you would probably not be too happy about it.

00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:50.106
In the Middle Ages, as the trade routes between Europe and the rest

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:54.696
of the world started to develop, spices started flowing to Europe.

00:07:55.146 --> 00:07:57.946
And one spice in particular: pepper.

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:05.046
In a world where different states all had different currencies, and where there was no

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:13.176
centralised financial system, pepper also doubled up as a currency, as a borderless form of money.

00:08:13.996 --> 00:08:19.876
It kept for quite a long time, it didn’t go bad, and it was easy to weigh.

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:26.226
For example, early in the 12th Century the Venetians, aware of the importance

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:30.916
of staying on the right side of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, presented

00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:37.656
him with a gift of pepper that weighed 50 lb in weight, or 23 kilos.

00:08:38.676 --> 00:08:45.836
You might think that a gift of 23 kilos worth of pepper wasn’t a great gift, but this was

00:08:45.856 --> 00:08:52.076
incredibly valuable, pepper was incredibly expensive compared to what pepper costs today.

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:58.806
To give you an example of the change in cost and therefore affordability

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:03.936
of pepper, here are some examples of how much it cost in terms of labour,

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:09.726
of how long an average man would have to work to buy half a kilo of pepper.

00:09:10.376 --> 00:09:15.006
In England, in the year 1250, it would take an average manual labourer

00:09:15.286 --> 00:09:19.246
about a week to earn enough money to buy half a kilo of pepper.

00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:26.826
So this gift of 23 kilos of pepper would have been almost the annual salary of a manual labourer.

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:34.666
By the year 1400 it would only take 2 days, so the cost of pepper had more than halved.

00:09:35.456 --> 00:09:40.036
This didn’t mean that most manual labourers would be able to afford

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:45.146
pepper, but the cost had reduced, and it wasn’t completely out of reach.

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:51.326
By the 16th century the cost had reduced further, and a bag of pepper

00:09:51.606 --> 00:09:56.356
was found preserved on the body of one of the sailors of the Mary Rose,

00:09:56.686 --> 00:10:00.976
the magnificent ship of King Henry VIII, which sank in the year 1545.

00:10:03.106 --> 00:10:09.116
In terms of the use of spices in Medieval England, they really were a status symbol.

00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:13.836
Salt and pepper were expensive, and spices were a way of

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:17.876
showing off your wealth, of showing off how rich you were.

00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:25.076
With it being a feudal society, one dominated by kings and queens at the top,

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:30.546
and everyone else below in a sort of pyramid, this meant huge extravagant

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:36.606
meals by the kings and queens, which were a way of displaying power and status.

00:10:37.326 --> 00:10:40.876
The king and his followers literally consumed a high

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:44.586
proportion of the spices brought from the East to London.

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:51.776
Take, for example, King Edward I, who was King of England from 1272 to 1307.

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:56.926
When he returned from fighting the neighbouring Welsh at the end of the 13th

00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:05.846
century, his officials spent over £1755 on spices – a huge sum at the time.

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:12.676
To help give you an idea of the scale of this, his spending on spice was

00:11:12.686 --> 00:11:19.126
similar to the total annual income of one of his top aristocrats, or earls – so,

00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:23.576
that's one of the 12 richest people in the kingdom of England at the time.

00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:30.036
So in today’s money we are talking millions of euros, just on spices.

00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:37.216
You might be asking yourself, why were spices so expensive, when they are so cheap now?

00:11:38.376 --> 00:11:43.049
Why did it cost the equivalent of a week’s wages to buy half a kilo

00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:47.216
of pepper when it might take half an hour’s wages to buy it now?

00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:52.236
The main reason was because the supply of spices from

00:11:52.236 --> 00:11:55.846
the East to Europe was tightly controlled by traders.

00:11:56.416 --> 00:12:00.716
Pepper would have come primarily from Kerala, in southern India.

00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:04.186
It would have been transported across the Indian Ocean,

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:08.956
up the Red Sea, through Alexandria, and up to Venice.

00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:15.816
There was a large cost involved in the transportation, and lots of different merchants involved,

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:22.006
each taking their cut, each taking their percentage, and each getting rich through the trade.

00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:29.616
Given how prized spices were, given how in demand and valuable these spices

00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:34.506
were, it was no surprise that various different European countries thought,

00:12:34.896 --> 00:12:40.086
“well, why don’t we just go to where the spices are and take them for ourselves?”

00:12:41.256 --> 00:12:46.566
The first European countries to make a real effort to do this were Spain and Portugal.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:52.056
They had been forced to buy spices from the Venetian merchants, and

00:12:52.066 --> 00:12:56.646
thought if they could go directly to the source, they would be able

00:12:56.646 --> 00:13:01.436
to cut out the middleman and secure more spices at a better price.

00:13:02.726 --> 00:13:03.396
They were right.

00:13:04.196 --> 00:13:11.426
The Portuguese were the first, and in 1498 the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama set

00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:17.236
off from Europe to India, sailing around the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa.

00:13:18.276 --> 00:13:24.976
Much to his surprise, he discovered a highly sophisticated harvesting and trading operation:

00:13:25.576 --> 00:13:31.726
cinnamon and pepper were already the major exports from this fertile and beautiful part of India.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:39.506
Da Gama had found the source, and this was to be a huge blow for Arab traders.

00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:47.526
6 years before Vasco Da Gama, another man had set off representing the Spanish King, King Ferdinand.

00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:54.856
That man was Christopher Columbus, and he too had been looking for a source of Indian spices.

00:13:55.806 --> 00:13:59.856
As we know, he didn’t find it, he went the wrong way and found

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:04.126
the Americas instead, leaving India open to the Portuguese.

00:14:05.106 --> 00:14:10.486
The subsequent years saw different European countries squabble, battle

00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:14.886
for power over different spice-producing regions in south East Asia.

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:21.386
A hotspot for this was a collection of around 1000 different islands in

00:14:21.406 --> 00:14:26.296
Indonesia called the Maluku Islands, better known as the Spice Islands.

00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:34.076
These islands saw fierce competition between the Portuguese and the Dutch, and as

00:14:34.086 --> 00:14:40.226
you might imagine, severe persecution of the local inhabitants, who were at best

00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:46.326
forced to harvest spices for little to no money, and at worst, brutally killed.

00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:52.606
In 1609, the British also got involved, taking over control of

00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:57.276
one of the islands, and threatening to disrupt the Dutch monopoly.

00:14:58.296 --> 00:15:02.726
The Dutch, eager to maintain their monopoly, later offered to give

00:15:02.746 --> 00:15:07.176
the British an island on the other side of the world in exchange

00:15:07.346 --> 00:15:10.536
for leaving one of The Spice Islands they had under their control.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:16.156
What was the island that the Dutch offered the British, you might be asking yourself?

00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:23.086
It was a small island just off the east coast of America called Manhattan.

00:15:24.296 --> 00:15:31.146
This must surely go down as one of the greatest swaps in history, a great bargain for the British.

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:39.066
As trade routes developed even further, and traders realised that spices could be grown elsewhere,

00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:46.766
prices started to fall, and not only did the spice trade become not as immensely profitable as

00:15:46.766 --> 00:15:52.966
it previously had been, but spices became more and more affordable to normal people in society.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:59.756
Britain was left with Manhattan, which is now one of the most valuable pieces of land in the world.

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:05.666
The Dutch were left with Pulau Run, an island which is not particularly valuable.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:13.776
Of course, a lot of this early spice trade was enabled by colonialism, and its ugly twin, slavery.

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:18.806
From cinnamon to sugar, slaves were involved with the production

00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:22.906
of much of these spices that Europeans enjoyed on their plates.

00:16:23.814 --> 00:16:28.390
It is, perhaps, even more horrifying when you consider that many spices

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.650
have zero nutritional value; they just make your food taste nicer.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:39.920
Now, let’s return to the modern day, and consider some of the implications of the spice trade.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.080
Nowadays, spices are ubiquitous, they are everywhere,

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.510
and–with a few exceptions–they are incredibly cheap.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.890
India is still the world’s centre for spice production,

00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:57.408
producing around 75% of all of the world’s spices.

00:16:58.438 --> 00:17:03.738
And the global spice market is valued at around $13 billion dollars.

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:09.607
It might sound like a lot, but when you think about the fact that spice is something

00:17:09.607 --> 00:17:14.357
that a majority of the people on the planet consumes in some shape or form at

00:17:14.357 --> 00:17:20.087
least once a day, it gives you an indication of quite how cheap spices really are.

00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:26.237
So, the curious history of spice is of something that was an expensive

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:31.937
addition to food for pharaohs, an exotic luxury of kings, of parts of

00:17:31.937 --> 00:17:36.457
a plant worth so much that countries literally went to war over them.

00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:43.347
Yet now they are very cheap, if you go to a European city you are more likely to

00:17:43.347 --> 00:17:49.437
find piles of spices in small low-cost grocery shops rather than luxury boutiques.

00:17:50.477 --> 00:17:53.557
But spices are an instrumental part of our history.

00:17:53.937 --> 00:18:00.397
Their high prices encouraged merchants to make long journeys to bring them from East to West,

00:18:00.487 --> 00:18:06.347
and in doing so they enabled connections, the sharing of ideas between people of different

00:18:06.347 --> 00:18:12.547
cultures, and the start of the system of global trade that we are all beneficiaries of today.

00:18:13.497 --> 00:18:19.497
And of course let’s not forget that they make everything taste just so much better.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:26.387
OK then, that is it for the curious history of spice.

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:30.727
It is a really interesting subject, and I think it’s fascinating to

00:18:30.727 --> 00:18:35.927
consider how something that used to be such a luxury is available to

00:18:36.097 --> 00:18:39.927
a large proportion of people in the world, at a very affordable price.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:44.157

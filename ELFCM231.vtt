Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.239
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.649
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:28.569
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Business of Formula 1.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:36.469
It is a sport that has gone from being only followed by a handful of amateur fans to one followed

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.809
by 400 million people globally, and it is one of the fastest growing sports in the world.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:49.469
So, in this episode we are going to look at the business of Formula 1.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.089
We’ll start by looking at the history of the sport, how it went from

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.169
amateur to professional, and who got fabulously wealthy along the way.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:06.769
We’ll then go on to look at who actually makes money from Formula 1, how this all works, and why

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.629
car manufacturers and advertisers pay tens of millions of dollars to be associated with the brand.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.709
And we’ll finish with some thoughts about what comes next for Formula 1.

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:23.709
We have got a lot to get through today, so let’s fire

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.279
the starting gun and get this episode on the road.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:35.469
Let’s start with a few numbers, just to remind ourselves of quite how big Formula 1 actually is.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.739
For the Formula 1 fans out there, you might be thinking

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:44.639
“duh”, but here’s a quick reminder of the scale of this sport.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.549
Every year there is a Formula One Championship.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.619
Over the course of around 6 months, drivers from 10 different

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.369
teams compete in races, called Grand Prixs, all over the world.

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:06.709
Last year there were meant to be 23 races, but only 22 actually took place, because of the pandemic.

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.109
And it is a huge business.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.549
Globally there are 433 million people who watch Formula 1,

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.349
and Formula 1 “the company” makes about $2 billion a year.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:30.789
And until relatively recently, until 2005 to be precise, total control lay with one man,

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:38.039
an Englishman called Bernard Charles Ecclestone, known to everyone as Bernie Ecclestone.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:45.019
The story of the business of Formula One is inseparable from this man.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.209
For many, he was Formula One, so he is an important part of our story.

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.299
He was born in 1930, in a county in South East England called Suffolk.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.939
His father was a fisherman, and his mother a housewife.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.729
Money was always tight at the Ecclestones, they weren’t a wealthy family,

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.269
and a keen eye on reducing all possible costs seems to have been a

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:19.039
characteristic that was to stay with Ecclestone in all his business dealings.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:24.183
From a young age he showed a talent for business, always

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:28.653
engaging in little schemes and money-making activities.

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:37.043
He wasn’t much interested in school, and as soon as he could leave school, he did, at the age of 16.

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:41.003
This was just at the end of the Second World War.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:46.373
Britain was in recovery mode, and Bernie Ecclestone was in

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:50.423
money-making mode, a mode he hasn’t turned off to this day.

00:03:51.873 --> 00:03:56.653
He had developed a keen interest in motorbikes, and soon started

00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:02.643
scouring, or looking closely at the classifieds pages in newspapers to

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:07.203
find parts of motorbikes that he could buy, and later sell at a profit.

00:04:08.673 --> 00:04:13.273
This led to him getting a job selling motorbikes, then owning a

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:17.163
motorbike showroom, a place where people would buy motorbikes.

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:24.230
He was developing a reputation as a shrewd businessman, and by the mid 1950s

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:29.423
he owned a series of car and motorbike showrooms across the south of England.

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:37.063
He was also a racing fanatic - he raced motorbikes and cars - but decided

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:42.173
to focus on his business interests instead after some bad accidents.

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:48.933
Then in 1972 he bought a small Formula One team called

00:04:48.963 --> 00:04:53.703
Brabham, and set about to change motorsport forever.

00:04:55.231 --> 00:05:01.423
Motorsport, or car racing, had existed since the 1920s, shortly after the

00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:07.851
invention of the car, but Formula One only came into existence in 1946.

00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:13.613
The “formula” in Formula One, by the way, refers to the regulations

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:18.583
of engine capacity, of how large a motor a car could have in it.

00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:27.343
For the first 35 years or so of Formula One’s existence, it was run really as quite an amateur

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:33.483
organisation, it was far from the professional, billion-dollar outfit that it is today.

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:42.033
Teams would compete for prize money, but each racing team would negotiate its own agreements

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:48.653
with the race providers and there was no requirement for a team to actually come to a race.

00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:56.483
What this meant was that the number of teams in each Formula One championship was inconsistent,

00:05:56.723 --> 00:06:03.253
and sometimes the championships wouldn’t even be shown on television, as the TV networks

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:09.293
didn’t know for sure how many cars would be racing, or even if the race would happen.

00:06:10.383 --> 00:06:16.913
In short, it was more of a hobby, an amateur sport than anything resembling a business.

00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:25.193
Bernie Ecclestone’s genius was to convince all of the teams in Formula One to sign an agreement,

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:31.933
called The Concorde Agreement, that required them to take part in the race for the upcoming season.

00:06:32.973 --> 00:06:39.033
He could then go to TV networks all over the world and say “look, we know

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:43.583
that this race is taking place and all of these teams will be competing.

00:06:44.093 --> 00:06:46.423
Would you like to pay to show it on your channel?”

00:06:47.503 --> 00:06:53.063
If the TV networks knew that a race was happening, that allowed them to plan

00:06:53.063 --> 00:06:58.353
ahead, it meant that advertisers were happier to pay for it, the number of

00:06:58.353 --> 00:07:03.483
television viewers started to increase, as did the amounts of money involved.

00:07:04.573 --> 00:07:08.073
Of course, Bernie Ecclestone didn’t do this out of the

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:10.973
goodness of his own heart, he didn’t do it for free.

00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:16.963
His company, called Formula One Promotions and Administration, otherwise known

00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:23.103
as FOPA, took a percentage of the money that the TV networks paid, and the

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:28.353
rest was distributed to the teams and an organisation called the Fédération

00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:34.403
Internationale de l’Automobile, the FIA, which was the governing body of the sport.

00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:43.393
This Concorde Agreement was signed in 1981, and over the course of the next 13 years

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:49.053
Bernie Ecclestone became an even more powerful force in the world of Formula One.

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:56.863
Then, in 1994, he seized the opportunity and bought the commercial rights

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:03.423
for all of Formula One in exchange for paying the FIA $10 million a year.

00:08:04.503 --> 00:08:10.753
$10 million might sound like a lot of money, but for this Bernie Ecclestone

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:15.873
received complete control of all of the commercial rights of Formula One.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.723
It was the best deal of his life.

00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:27.503
He negotiated agreements with TV companies all over the world, taking Formula One away from its

00:08:27.803 --> 00:08:34.523
historical base in Western Europe and opening it up in new markets in China and the Middle East.

00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:41.083
It grew and grew, and with it grew Mr Ecclestone’s bank balance.

00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:46.933
By 1996, Bernie Ecclestone was the world’s best paid

00:08:46.983 --> 00:08:52.473
businessman, with a salary of a whopping $83.7 million.

00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:59.273
Although he has now sold his Formula One shareholding, and is no longer in

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:05.003
control of the company, his fortune is estimated at around $3.5 billion.

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:09.943
So, that was the man behind it, or the man who got it

00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:13.543
all going, let’s move on to the actual business of it.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:20.513
How does it work, who makes all the money [apart from Bernie Ecclestone], and how do they do it?

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:26.923
Well, Formula One, the company, essentially makes money in three main ways.

00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:32.663
Firstly, there are what’s called “race fees”, or “promotor fees”.

00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:38.883
See, Formula One doesn’t actually own the race tracks or have anything to do with them.

00:09:39.643 --> 00:09:43.813
Race tracks are typically built, owned and operated

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:47.133
by people in the countries where the race takes place.

00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:55.753
You might think that Formula One pays to use the race track, but it’s actually the other way around.

00:09:56.133 --> 00:10:01.183
The owner of the race track pays Formula One an average of around

00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:06.187
$30 million just to be able to hold a Grand Prix at their race track.

00:10:07.047 --> 00:10:13.007
The local partner obviously hopes to make their money back, through ticket sales

00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:19.257
and so on, but they need to invest a lot of money to pay the fee to Formula One.

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:25.107
This makes up about 30% of the money that Formula One makes, by the way.

00:10:26.197 --> 00:10:30.897
Then there’s the money they get from broadcast rights, from selling

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:34.927
the rights to TV companies to show the race on their channel.

00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:41.777
Formula One pays for the creation of the content - the cameras, cameramen and so

00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:47.737
on, but it then packages this up and sells it to TV channels around the world.

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:52.047
This makes up around a third of the money it makes.

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:57.597
Then another 15% is sponsorship and advertising.

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:05.237
With over 400 million Formula One fans around the world, there are a lot of eyeballs

00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:11.737
on races, and so Formula One can command high prices to advertisers to sponsor it.

00:11:12.557 --> 00:11:18.877
And there’s another final category, a fourth category, of other miscellaneous revenue.

00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:26.417
Formula One has exclusive clubs and areas at each Grand Prix, it makes money from transporting

00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:32.447
cars and teams around the world, and all sorts of smaller things that don’t contribute much.

00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:38.197
Of course, Formula One [the company] doesn’t keep all of this money for itself.

00:11:38.827 --> 00:11:46.237
It is essentially one giant competition, so it does need to pay out to the teams for taking part.

00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:53.887
The amount of money it pays to each team depends on factors such as their final

00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:59.097
position in the tournament, and how long the team has been part of the tournament.

00:12:00.597 --> 00:12:05.587
And as far as the teams go, the best performing teams can receive

00:12:05.607 --> 00:12:10.027
payments of hundreds of millions of dollars directly from Formula One.

00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:17.347
Alongside the direct payments from Formula One, teams are often given money by car manufacturers.

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:22.127
The Mercedes Formula One team, for example, gets around $80

00:12:22.127 --> 00:12:27.207
million per season from the parent company of Mercedes, Daimler.

00:12:28.027 --> 00:12:34.447
On top of this the main other source of revenue for the teams is advertising and sponsorship.

00:12:35.107 --> 00:12:41.707
Cigarette companies used to be the main sponsors for Formula One, but since they were banned

00:12:41.717 --> 00:12:48.107
from advertising in the sport in 2006, plenty of other companies have stepped up to the mark.

00:12:48.957 --> 00:12:54.507
Add this all up and some of the best Formula One teams can generate hundreds

00:12:54.537 --> 00:12:59.287
of millions of dollars per year, but this certainly doesn’t mean that they are

00:12:59.287 --> 00:13:04.057
making hundreds of millions, or even tens of millions of dollars in profit.

00:13:05.027 --> 00:13:09.847
Competing in a Formula One season is an incredibly expensive thing to do.

00:13:10.527 --> 00:13:17.517
Yes, there might only be one person in the car, but that person has a sky-high salary.

00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:24.007
The drivers, the people behind the wheel, are some of the best paid sportspeople on the planet.

00:13:25.027 --> 00:13:33.217
Lewis Hamilton, the driver of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team has an annual salary of 55

00:13:33.217 --> 00:13:39.557
million dollars, and that’s before you start to take into account money he gets from sponsorships.

00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:42.977
That’s money that he is directly paid by his team.

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:48.597
Even the lowest paid Formula One driver, the 21-year-old

00:13:48.647 --> 00:13:53.907
Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda, has an annual salary of $500,000.

00:13:54.723 --> 00:14:01.257
Of course, the drivers are only a small part of a Formula One team, albeit the most visible part.

00:14:02.057 --> 00:14:05.527
Formula One teams can have one and a half thousand

00:14:05.527 --> 00:14:09.337
people on them, everything from engineers to mechanics.

00:14:09.467 --> 00:14:12.077
And of course there’s the car itself.

00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:20.847
A Formula One car costs around $15 million to produce, and transporting a car and a small army

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:26.537
of team members around the world every week for half the year is an expensive thing to do.

00:14:27.657 --> 00:14:34.047
The reality is that Formula One teams, such as Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:39.677
so on, don't typically make much money in profit, and are often loss-making.

00:14:40.757 --> 00:14:48.507
They might make anywhere from $100 million to $400 million in revenue, but they almost all spend as

00:14:48.527 --> 00:14:55.267
much, meaning that actually owning a Formula One team is not normally a very profitable activity.

00:14:56.097 --> 00:15:01.567
Indeed, there’s a conventional view that if a Formula One team has ended up

00:15:01.697 --> 00:15:07.027
making a lot of money one year, they have been particularly profitable, then this

00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:12.347
isn’t a good sign, as it shows that they should have invested more money into

00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:17.547
the car itself, thereby giving it a better chance at victory the following year.

00:15:18.707 --> 00:15:21.247
So, why own a team then?

00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:26.397
Why do companies like Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull invest so much

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:31.187
money into the sport every year if they aren’t seeing a financial return?

00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:36.017
Well, they clearly do believe that they are making a sizeable

00:15:36.037 --> 00:15:40.227
return on their investment, although it is an indirect one.

00:15:41.687 --> 00:15:47.297
For car companies like Mercedes and Ferrari, they believe that having a successful

00:15:47.307 --> 00:15:53.747
Formula One team helps them sell more road cars to consumers, to people like me and you.

00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:59.977
If you or I see a Mercedes winning a Grand Prix, when it comes to

00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:05.397
choosing what car to buy next, we might just choose that car over another.

00:16:06.317 --> 00:16:12.067
Indeed, Mercedes stated in 2020 that it believes it generates over

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:17.617
$5 billion just in advertising value through having a Formula One

00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:22.537
team, so it certainly makes smart financial sense for them to do it.

00:16:24.027 --> 00:16:29.077
What’s more, there is a huge amount of money invested in research and development in

00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:35.297
Formula One, and this can be used by car manufacturers to improve their own road cars.

00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:41.747
And as for a company like Red Bull, it clearly believes that spending

00:16:41.757 --> 00:16:46.767
hundreds of millions of dollars a year on its Formula One team is a good

00:16:46.767 --> 00:16:52.527
investment, as its brand is associated with the fastest sport in the world.

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:58.367
Ultimately, it believes that by being associated with a successful

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:02.627
Formula One team it will be able to sell more energy drinks.

00:17:02.797 --> 00:17:04.297
It’s really that simple.

00:17:05.417 --> 00:17:08.987
Coming to our final section of this episode, what

00:17:09.017 --> 00:17:12.527
does the future hold for the business of Formula One?

00:17:13.977 --> 00:17:20.017
Firstly, on a practical basis, the start of 2021 saw an update to

00:17:20.017 --> 00:17:24.667
the Concorde Agreement, the agreement outlining the rules of how

00:17:24.707 --> 00:17:29.587
teams compete, how money is distributed, and how Formula One works.

00:17:30.497 --> 00:17:35.647
The most important part of this was the introduction of a budget cap,

00:17:35.977 --> 00:17:42.687
meaning that no Formula One team can spend more than $145 million per year.

00:17:43.807 --> 00:17:48.427
That might sound like a lot of money, but big teams such as

00:17:48.437 --> 00:17:53.457
Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull can have budgets three times this.

00:17:54.617 --> 00:18:00.647
The idea behind the budget cap is to level the playing field, to make it more

00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:06.137
equal and harder for the bigger teams that are backed by car manufacturers to

00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:11.417
simply outspend all of the others, to spend more money than the other teams.

00:18:12.687 --> 00:18:19.527
This is effective now, and will last for five years, so it will certainly require a period

00:18:19.537 --> 00:18:25.517
of adjustment for the teams - they’ll simply have to get used to doing more with less.

00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:30.747
Now, looking further afield, there is another potential long

00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:34.857
term threat, or at least factor, that isn’t much talked about.

00:18:36.317 --> 00:18:42.017
One of the reasons that it’s thought to be so appealing as a sport to so many people

00:18:42.207 --> 00:18:48.377
is that billions of people around the world can drive a car, and do so every day.

00:18:48.967 --> 00:18:55.867
We know what it feels like to drive, and so we have an inherent understanding of, or perhaps we

00:18:55.867 --> 00:19:02.357
just think we understand, what it might feel like to drive incredibly fast, like a Formula 1 driver.

00:19:03.817 --> 00:19:09.337
For most other sports - whether that’s football, basketball, or rugby - there

00:19:09.337 --> 00:19:14.617
are significantly fewer people that play these sports frequently, and so

00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:19.397
it's harder to empathise with what the stars on the pitch are going through.

00:19:20.047 --> 00:19:21.187
That’s the theory anyway.

00:19:22.667 --> 00:19:27.337
So, how is this relevant to the future of the business of Formula One?

00:19:27.897 --> 00:19:34.457
Well, in a future of self-driving cars, where fewer people actually know how to drive

00:19:34.457 --> 00:19:40.417
a car and do it on a daily basis, how will this affect the appeal of motor sport?

00:19:41.217 --> 00:19:47.537
Will it make it less appealing, will it make it more so, or will it simply not have any effect?

00:19:48.837 --> 00:19:54.667
There seems to be little argument that Formula One cars will ever go driverless, that the

00:19:54.667 --> 00:20:00.552
cars will ever completely drive themselves, because one of the main attractions of the sport

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:06.497
is the people in the driving seat, the human beings with their hands on the steering wheel.

00:20:07.357 --> 00:20:13.017
A Grand Prix with 10 driverless cars racing around the track, and the

00:20:13.017 --> 00:20:17.747
fastest computer wins, is unlikely to be attractive in the near future.

00:20:18.897 --> 00:20:23.277
But it is an interesting question to think about the extent to which

00:20:23.417 --> 00:20:28.727
the appeal of Formula One comes from the shared experience of driving,

00:20:29.077 --> 00:20:33.667
and how this might change in a future where cars drive themselves.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:38.547
One area that suggests that this isn’t a threat at

00:20:38.547 --> 00:20:43.077
all is the rise of ESports, of racing computer games.

00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:50.247
Formula One is investing heavily in this area, and promoting the idea of “virtual”

00:20:50.307 --> 00:20:56.557
Formula One as an alternative, or at least companion to the original Formula One.

00:20:57.777 --> 00:21:04.357
In 2017 Formula One launched the official Formula One esports tournament, and

00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:09.487
it is already followed by tens of millions of esports fans around the world.

00:21:10.357 --> 00:21:18.237
The idea here is that Formula One already has this very strong brand, and that allowing people

00:21:18.327 --> 00:21:25.817
to also participate through ESport is yet another way to monetise it, to make money from it.

00:21:26.747 --> 00:21:32.537
It also has the benefit that it can act as an excellent way to introduce people

00:21:32.637 --> 00:21:37.787
to the real, physical world Formula One - people who might never have become

00:21:37.787 --> 00:21:42.897
Formula One fans had they not first become hooked by the esports version.

00:21:43.747 --> 00:21:49.047
If you have never watched Formula One ESports by the way, it actually looks incredibly

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:55.027
realistic - you could certainly be forgiven for thinking it is real, the quality of

00:21:55.027 --> 00:22:00.297
the graphics and design is so good that it is hard to distinguish it from reality.

00:22:01.557 --> 00:22:06.447
So, Formula One, with all of its different arms and divisions, is a

00:22:06.597 --> 00:22:11.327
massive, massive business, worth just over thirty billion dollars.

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:16.807
But if you listen to any interviews with senior executives at Formula

00:22:16.807 --> 00:22:21.127
One, it’s clear that they believe there is a lot of room to grow.

00:22:22.347 --> 00:22:26.157
Formula One makes around $2 billion dollars per year from

00:22:26.348 --> 00:22:31.447
400 million fans, so that’s about $5 per fan per year.

00:22:32.287 --> 00:22:36.857
Contrast this to the NFL, the American Football league, this makes

00:22:37.017 --> 00:22:43.327
about $16 billion dollars from 100 million fans, so that’s $160 per fan.

00:22:44.087 --> 00:22:47.947
And the English Premier League makes $6 billion dollars

00:22:47.947 --> 00:22:53.017
from around 300 million fans, so that’s about $20 per fan.

00:22:54.527 --> 00:22:58.547
So, Formula One is a sport that anyone who has ever been

00:22:58.557 --> 00:23:02.737
in a car can empathise with, or at least understand.

00:23:03.107 --> 00:23:10.247
It’s currently a sport with only ten teams, not much more than 20 races per year, and one

00:23:10.257 --> 00:23:15.877
without complicated rules, because it’s just a question of who passes the finish line first.

00:23:16.367 --> 00:23:22.867
When you think about all this, and if you read the Formula One Strategic Plan you’ll discover

00:23:23.057 --> 00:23:29.327
that the boss wants to - and I'm quoting directly here - “unleash the greatest racing spectacle

00:23:29.487 --> 00:23:36.887
on the planet” - then it’s not so hard to believe that Formula One is only just getting started.

00:23:38.577 --> 00:23:44.007
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Business of Formula One.

00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:48.577
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:52.517
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:52.827 --> 00:23:57.507
If you are one of the 400 or so million Formula One fans around the

00:23:57.507 --> 00:24:01.544
world, I would particularly like to know what you thought of this episode.

00:24:02.084 --> 00:24:04.754
What is so appealing about the sport for you?

00:24:05.064 --> 00:24:06.104
Is it the cars?

00:24:06.324 --> 00:24:07.044
The drivers?

00:24:07.354 --> 00:24:09.154
The actual race itself?

00:24:09.594 --> 00:24:15.374
How did you get into Formula One, and what keeps you glued to the screen during a Grand Prix?

00:24:16.004 --> 00:24:20.774

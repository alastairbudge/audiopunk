Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.055
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:22.625
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:29.970
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the battle of Blur vs.

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.765
Oasis, the battle of Britpop.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.725
We haven’t really had that many music-themed episodes yet,

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:40.995
so I’m really excited to share this one with you today.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.625
It’s not just about music though.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:48.635
Through this story you’ll learn about British culture, regional

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:53.325
rivalries, and the UK in the 90s, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:58.945
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:04.405
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, that transcript and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:09.375
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:14.141
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:19.121
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:24.161
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:28.901
So if that is of interest, and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:33.251
wouldn't be, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:36.148
.
OK, then, Blur vs.

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:37.128
Oasis.

00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:43.338
I imagine you will have heard of Oasis, and you may well have heard of Blur too.

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.818
As a reminder, here’s Oasis:

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:12.689
And here’s Blur:

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:44.414
Oasis are far better known internationally now, as the band stayed together for a

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:50.794
lot longer, but back in the mid 1990s they were both incredibly popular in the UK.

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:57.834
These two bands were at the forefront of a movement called Britpop, British

00:02:57.854 --> 00:03:03.844
pop music, which was a musical and cultural movement that emerged in the 1990s.

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:11.584
Britpop was a celebration of all things British, it was a reaction to the dark, grunge

00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:17.264
type rock music that was coming out of the US, stuff like Nirvana and Pearl Jam.

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:22.994
It emerged as a reaction to this fixation with American,

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:29.654
dark music, instead Britpop was optimistic and celebratory.

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:33.224
Britpop celebrated the very fact that it was British.

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:37.804
Bands at this time would pose in front of the Union Jack, the

00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:42.084
British flag, and they would sing about very British things.

00:03:42.964 --> 00:03:46.204
And, unlike in the era of Spotify and streaming,

00:03:46.454 --> 00:03:50.394
actually selling music was big business in the 1990s.

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:57.774
How this would work is that a band would make an album, but one or more singles, the single

00:03:57.774 --> 00:04:03.174
songs, would be released before the album, and then also after the album was released.

00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:10.234
The singles served the purpose of being an advert for the future album, and also being a nice

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:16.804
way for record labels to sell songs twice - once as a single, and again as part of the album.

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:24.064
The charts, the position in the rankings of what song was the most popular that week,

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:30.304
what song was ‘number one’, was decided by how many copies of a song was sold each week.

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:35.644
The song that sold the most copies of its single got to number one, simple.

00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:43.354
As Britpop became more and more popular, the media latched on to this cultural phenomenon

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:49.484
to try to drive more and more interest in it - the popularity of Britpop, at least from a

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:55.504
cultural interest point of view, was powered by a huge amount of interest from the media.

00:04:56.584 --> 00:05:00.004
And Oasis and Blur were the kings of Britpop.

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:05.224
There were other bands, such as Suede and Pulp, but they

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:08.740
weren’t really in the same category, at least of popularity.

00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:14.834
Although Oasis and Blur were both Britpop, they were very different.

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:18.914
Oasis were from the north of the country, they were from Manchester.

00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:20.704
Blur were from London.

00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:27.684
Oasis were ostensibly working class, with two brothers as frontmen, Liam and

00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:31.224
Noel Gallagher, who had been playing music together since they were kids.

00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:39.184
Blur had met at art school, and were labelled by the media as middle class, soft, southerners.

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:43.644
Liam and Noel Gallagher were loud and confrontational.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.864
Blur, in general, were more reserved.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:53.654
The lead guitarist, a guy called Graham Coxon, seemed to hate interviews, and they

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:59.494
didn’t seem so interested in insulting other Britpop bands or fighting journalists.

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:07.714
But the differences were there, and the media started to create this huge circus based on the idea

00:06:07.714 --> 00:06:15.094
that Blur and Oasis hated each other, and the fact that music fans needed to choose between them.

00:06:15.664 --> 00:06:18.824
You were either Blur, or you were Oasis.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:23.544
And your choice of group reflected on you as a person.

00:06:24.614 --> 00:06:27.834
If you were from Manchester, you better not be a Blur fan.

00:06:28.474 --> 00:06:32.894
And if you thought of yourself as more of an artsy type of

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:36.624
person, well you probably weren’t going to be an Oasis fan.

00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:42.664
In one British tabloid, The Sun, there was a story about a married couple.

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:46.364
The husband was Blur, and the wife was Oasis.

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:49.514
They couldn’t get over their musical disagreements,

00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:53.844
and she ended up smashing up all of his Blur records.

00:06:55.084 --> 00:07:00.784
There were the inevitable comparisons to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, with Oasis being The

00:07:00.784 --> 00:07:07.304
Beatles and Blur being The Rolling Stones, and the newspapers were full of these kinds of stories.

00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:13.574
Even though it might have been hyped up, it might have been exaggerated, the bands

00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:18.344
knew that it helped sell their records, sell their music, so they kept it up.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:24.424
There were stories about the frontmen insulting each other at parties, and talking

00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:29.284
each other down to the press, saying bad things about each other to the newspapers.

00:07:30.114 --> 00:07:34.184
Oasis were the more aggressive of the two, and what might have

00:07:34.184 --> 00:07:38.004
started out as a bit of fun turned into a serious rivalry.

00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:46.264
All this came to a head in August 1995, it culminated in the summer of 1995.

00:07:47.494 --> 00:07:53.584
Blur had scheduled to release their lead single, the first single of the band’s fourth album.

00:07:54.184 --> 00:07:58.714
It was called Country House, and the album was called The Great Escape.

00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:04.234
Rival bands would not normally release their songs too close together,

00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:09.374
because doing so would harm their chances of selling as much as possible.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:14.704
Instead, the record labels would carefully coordinate the release

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:19.344
dates so that there was enough time between them to maximise sales.

00:08:20.444 --> 00:08:22.774
But Oasis had a different idea.

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:28.734
They knew the date that Blur’s lead single was to be released, and they decided

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:33.464
to release a single from their upcoming album, one week before Blur’s one.

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:41.414
The single Oasis chose was called Roll With It, from the album What’s The Story Morning Glory?

00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:47.814
Releasing it a week before Blur’s would really hurt Blur’s chances of getting

00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:53.414
to number one, and give an opportunity for Oasis to get one up on Blur.

00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:57.134
So, Blur had to do something.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:01.884
They had to move the release date of their song otherwise it would be crowded

00:09:01.894 --> 00:09:07.264
out by Oasis’s Roll With It, which would have had a week’s time on the airwaves.

00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:14.964
A week after Oasis was just not going to work, but instead of pushing it back a few weeks or

00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:22.234
forward a few weeks, Blur decided to release Country House on exactly the same day as Roll With It.

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:27.134
This was something that just wasn’t done in the music industry,

00:09:27.424 --> 00:09:32.044
as it would hurt both song’s chances, and both groups would end up

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:35.644
selling fewer records than they would if there wasn’t this clash.

00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:41.734
Nevertheless, the date was set, August 14th 1995.

00:09:43.044 --> 00:09:46.484
Now, just in case you hadn’t heard these tracks before, these songs

00:09:46.484 --> 00:09:51.324
before, or you need a quick reminder, here is Blur’s Country House.

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:21.632
And here’s Roll with It from Oasis.

00:11:06.993 --> 00:11:10.393
The funny thing is that neither of these songs were the

00:11:10.393 --> 00:11:14.243
bands’ best songs, and they both knew it at the time.

00:11:15.433 --> 00:11:19.993
Country House is a relatively straightforward, it's an uncomplicated

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:25.703
song, and no serious Oasis fan would rate Roll With It in their top 5.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:30.903
Nevertheless, these two tracks were chosen, and they

00:11:30.903 --> 00:11:33.643
were set to be released on exactly the same day.

00:11:34.763 --> 00:11:39.803
This was something that just wasn’t done, and the media went mad reporting on it.

00:11:40.843 --> 00:11:46.783
The month of August in the UK is nicknamed ‘silly season’ because there isn’t a huge

00:11:46.783 --> 00:11:53.193
amount that happens in the news, and the newspapers and news shows end up reporting

00:11:53.203 --> 00:11:58.393
on a load of stories that really wouldn’t make the headlines in a normal news period.

00:11:59.603 --> 00:12:01.403
This battle of Blur vs.

00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:06.753
Oasis, the battle to see who would be number one that week, was dubbed by the

00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:12.483
media as ‘The Battle Of Britpop’, and with not a huge amount of other, more

00:12:12.483 --> 00:12:17.803
important news to be reporting on, it was all over the front pages and TV news.

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:24.729
Two of Britain's most popular pop groups have begun the biggest chart war in 30 years.

00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:29.129
The Manchester band Oasis and their arch rivals Blur released new

00:12:29.199 --> 00:12:32.409
singles today, each hoping to reach the number one spot next week.

00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:37.792
The fight was on, the two giants of Britpop were releasing songs

00:12:37.822 --> 00:12:42.462
on exactly the same day, and it was to be a battle for number one.

00:12:43.702 --> 00:12:48.722
The media did everything they could to remind everyone about the differences

00:12:48.722 --> 00:12:54.332
between the bands, and that your choice of what single to buy wasn’t just about

00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:59.722
which one you wanted to listen to, it was also about what sort of person you were.

00:13:00.442 --> 00:13:02.992
Were you Blur, or were you Oasis?

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:08.802
It was almost like a general election, but instead of going to the polling booth,

00:13:09.132 --> 00:13:13.962
to the polling station, you went to the local record store and made your choice.

00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:20.092
And much like politicians do in the run up to an election, the bands did

00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:25.132
everything they could to make sure their single was as attractive as possible.

00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:31.232
With Blur, you actually got an extra CD with your purchase of Country

00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:36.222
House, so you got two CDs for 99p, which was the price of the single.

00:13:37.572 --> 00:13:42.102
Oasis tried to do a similar thing, but they were a little too late and

00:13:42.262 --> 00:13:46.842
couldn’t actually give an extra CD away with the single, so they put

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:51.452
barcodes inside the single which gave you the right to get another CD.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.875
But of course that wasn’t nearly as enticing as getting two CDs immediately.

00:13:58.245 --> 00:14:03.605
So, who ended up winning the battle of Britpop, who ended up with the number one single?

00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:11.115
It was a tense week, as music fans made the pilgrimage to the record store and cast their votes.

00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:16.225
It ended up being the best week in a decade for single sales,

00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:24.365
but Blur beat Oasis, selling 274,000 records to Oasis’s 216,000.

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:29.555
Blur’s record label threw a huge party, a big

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:33.785
celebration, but the victory didn’t really mean very much.

00:14:34.445 --> 00:14:41.635
In the interviews years afterwards most of Blur and Oasis admitted that the entire ‘battle’

00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:48.475
was created by the record labels and the media, and that Oasis added fuel to the fire.

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:55.425
And if Blur won the battle, there are few that would contest the fact that Oasis

00:14:55.445 --> 00:15:00.445
won the war, at least from a popularity point of view, from a sales point of view.

00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:07.895
While Blur grew apart and the lead guitarist left in 2001, Oasis’s

00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:12.455
popularity grew and grew, despite the rivalries of the Gallagher brothers.

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:17.565
And although both bands have devoted followings outside

00:15:17.605 --> 00:15:22.965
the UK, Oasis’s worldwide popularity far outstrips Blur’s.

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:29.135
In what goes for ‘popularity’ nowadays, Blur has around 6

00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:32.568
million monthly listeners on Spotify while Oasis has 14 million.

00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:40.255
And as for Britpop, it survived for a few more years after the Battle of Britpop.

00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:47.015
Noel Gallagher, the guitarist from Oasis was invited to 10 Downing Street, the

00:15:47.195 --> 00:15:51.675
home of the Prime Minister, for a party when Tony Blair won the election of

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:59.075
1997, and both Oasis and Blur continued to release critically acclaimed albums.

00:16:00.195 --> 00:16:05.175
But August 1995, and this battle, was its height, and

00:16:05.395 --> 00:16:08.685
Britpop mania never reached the same levels again.

00:16:09.815 --> 00:16:14.675
Within a few years manufactured pop was back, with acts like

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:18.335
the Spice Girls dominating the top of the charts for years.

00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:24.615
But this battle of Britpop went down in history as one of the great chart

00:16:24.685 --> 00:16:30.275
rivalries, and was the high point of one of the defining moments in British music.

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:35.895
Neither song may have been particularly great, and it might have all been

00:16:35.915 --> 00:16:40.885
hyped up just a little bit, manufactured so that people were even more

00:16:40.915 --> 00:16:46.215
interested in it, but it certainly was a lot of fun, and sold a lot of records.

00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:51.205
And if you want a good way to start off a long conversation with

00:16:51.205 --> 00:16:55.595
a Brit, you can always ask them who’s better, Blur, or Oasis.

00:16:56.705 --> 00:17:01.565
At least now you’ll know a little bit more about what their response will reveal.

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:07.315
Ok then, that is it for the story of Blur vs.

00:17:07.405 --> 00:17:09.395
Oasis, and the battle of Britpop.

00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:14.935
It is a fun story, and one that not that many people outside the UK know.

00:17:15.315 --> 00:17:16.765
So I hope you enjoyed it.

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:22.465
And as a final reminder, if you are looking to improve your English in a more interesting

00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:28.495
way, to join a community of curious minds from all over the world, to unlock the transcripts,

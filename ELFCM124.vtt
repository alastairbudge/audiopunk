Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.055
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:22.625
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:29.970
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the battle of Blur vs.

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:32.765
Oasis, the battle of Britpop.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.725
We haven’t really had that many music-themed episodes yet,

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:40.995
so I’m really excited to share this one with you today.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.625
It’s not just about music though.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:48.635
Through this story you’ll learn about British culture, regional

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:53.325
rivalries, and the UK in the 90s, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:58.665
Before we get right into that though, I just wanted to quickly remind you about

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:03.735
our super exciting, start of the year special offer for new annual members.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:09.075
Leonardo English has teamed up with an absolutely awesome English teacher called

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:14.605
Amy, who is from Vancouver, in Canada, and she has kindly agreed to give a

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:19.815
one hour private lesson to anyone who becomes a Learner member for the year.

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:25.085
If you’re thinking that 2021 will be the year that you really improve your

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:30.405
English, and you are ready to do it with podcasts, transcripts, subtitles and key

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:35.375
vocabulary, and a supportive community of fellow learners, then you are in luck.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:40.605
Until January 31st everyone who joins as an annual Learner member

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:45.045
will get a one hour, private session with Amy, where she’ll assess

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:49.695
your level, help you define your goals, and set you up for success.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:54.375
Just one word of warning though - because Amy is in super high

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:57.985
demand, we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:03.415
This episode is scheduled to come out on January the 15th, so I hope

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.825
there will still be some places left, but I guess there won’t be many.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:10.555
So, if that is of interest, and I can’t see why it

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:14.185
wouldn’t be, the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:17.475
OK, then, Blur vs.

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:18.455
Oasis.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:24.665
I imagine you will have heard of Oasis, and you may well have heard of Blur too.

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.145
As a reminder, here’s Oasis:

00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:54.016
And here’s Blur:

00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:25.742
Oasis are far better known internationally now, as the band stayed together for a

00:03:25.742 --> 00:03:32.122
lot longer, but back in the mid 1990s they were both incredibly popular in the UK.

00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:39.162
These two bands were at the forefront of a movement called Britpop, British

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:45.172
pop music, which was a musical and cultural movement that emerged in the 1990s.

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:52.912
Britpop was a celebration of all things British, it was a reaction to the dark, grunge

00:03:52.922 --> 00:03:58.592
type rock music that was coming out of the US, stuff like Nirvana and Pearl Jam.

00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:04.322
It emerged as a reaction to this fixation with American,

00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:10.982
dark music, instead Britpop was optimistic and celebratory.

00:04:11.312 --> 00:04:14.552
Britpop celebrated the very fact that it was British.

00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:19.132
Bands at this time would pose in front of the Union Jack, the

00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:23.412
British flag, and they would sing about very British things.

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:27.532
And, unlike in the era of Spotify and streaming,

00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:31.722
actually selling music was big business in the 1990s.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:39.102
How this would work is that a band would make an album, but one or more singles, the single

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:44.502
songs, would be released before the album, and then also after the album was released.

00:04:45.212 --> 00:04:51.562
The singles served the purpose of being an advert for the future album, and also being a nice

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:58.132
way for record labels to sell songs twice - once as a single, and again as part of the album.

00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:05.392
The charts, the position in the rankings of what song was the most popular that week,

00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:11.632
what song was ‘number one’, was decided by how many copies of a song was sold each week.

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:16.972
The song that sold the most copies of its single got to number one, simple.

00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:24.682
As Britpop became more and more popular, the media latched on to this cultural phenomenon

00:05:24.862 --> 00:05:30.812
to try to drive more and more interest in it - the popularity of Britpop, at least from a

00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:36.832
cultural interest point of view, was powered by a huge amount of interest from the media.

00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:41.332
And Oasis and Blur were the kings of Britpop.

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:46.552
There were other bands, such as Suede and Pulp, but they

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:50.067
weren’t really in the same category, at least of popularity.

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:56.162
Although Oasis and Blur were both Britpop, they were very different.

00:05:56.902 --> 00:06:00.242
Oasis were from the north of the country, they were from Manchester.

00:06:00.742 --> 00:06:02.032
Blur were from London.

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:09.012
Oasis were ostensibly working class, with two brothers as frontmen, Liam and

00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:12.552
Noel Gallagher, who had been playing music together since they were kids.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:20.512
Blur had met at art school, and were labelled by the media as middle class, soft, southerners.

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:24.972
Liam and Noel Gallagher were loud and confrontational.

00:06:25.772 --> 00:06:28.192
Blur, in general, were more reserved.

00:06:28.592 --> 00:06:34.982
The lead guitarist, a guy called Graham Coxon, seemed to hate interviews, and they

00:06:34.982 --> 00:06:40.822
didn’t seem so interested in insulting other Britpop bands or fighting journalists.

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:49.042
But the differences were there, and the media started to create this huge circus based on the idea

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:56.422
that Blur and Oasis hated each other, and the fact that music fans needed to choose between them.

00:06:56.992 --> 00:07:00.152
You were either Blur, or you were Oasis.

00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:04.872
And your choice of group reflected on you as a person.

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:09.162
If you were from Manchester, you better not be a Blur fan.

00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:14.222
And if you thought of yourself as more of an artsy type of

00:07:14.512 --> 00:07:17.952
person, well you probably weren’t going to be an Oasis fan.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:23.992
In one British tabloid, The Sun, there was a story about a married couple.

00:07:24.712 --> 00:07:27.692
The husband was Blur, and the wife was Oasis.

00:07:28.342 --> 00:07:30.842
They couldn’t get over their musical disagreements,

00:07:30.912 --> 00:07:35.172
and she ended up smashing up all of his Blur records.

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:42.112
There were the inevitable comparisons to tThe Beatles and The Rolling Stones, with Oasis being The

00:07:42.112 --> 00:07:48.632
Beatles and Blur being The Rolling Stones, and the newspapers were full of these kinds of stories.

00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:54.902
Even though it might have been hyped up, it might have been exaggerated, the bands

00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:59.672
knew that it helped sell their records, sell their music, so they kept it up.

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:05.752
There were stories about the frontmen insulting each other at parties, and talking

00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:10.612
each other down to the press, saying bad things about each other to the newspapers.

00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:15.512
Oasis were the more aggressive of the two, and what might have

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:19.332
started out as a bit of fun turned into a serious rivalry.

00:08:20.572 --> 00:08:27.592
All this came to a head in August 1995, it culminated in the summer of 1995.

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:34.912
Blur had scheduled to release their lead single, the first single of the band’s fourth album.

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:40.042
It was called Country House, and the album was called The Great Escape.

00:08:41.132 --> 00:08:45.562
Rival bands would not normally release their songs too close together,

00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:50.702
because doing so would harm their chances of selling as much as possible.

00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:56.032
Instead, the record labels would carefully coordinate the release

00:08:56.032 --> 00:09:00.672
dates so that there was enough time between them to maximise sales.

00:09:01.772 --> 00:09:04.102
But Oasis had a different idea.

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:10.062
They knew the date that Blur’s lead single was to be released, and they decided

00:09:10.212 --> 00:09:14.792
to release a single from their upcoming album, one week before Blur’s one.

00:09:16.052 --> 00:09:22.742
The single Oasis chose was called Roll With It, from the album What’s The Story Morning Glory?

00:09:23.992 --> 00:09:29.142
Releasing it a week before Blur’s would really hurt Blur’s chances of getting

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:34.742
to number one, and give an opportunity for Oasis to get one up on Blur.

00:09:35.982 --> 00:09:38.462
So, Blur had to do something.

00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:43.212
They had to move the release date of their song otherwise it would be crowded

00:09:43.222 --> 00:09:48.592
out by Oasis’s Roll With It, which would have had a week’s time on the airwaves.

00:09:49.972 --> 00:09:56.292
A week after Oasis was just not going to work, but instead of pushing it back a few weeks or

00:09:56.502 --> 00:10:03.562
forward a few weeks, Blur decided to release Country House on exactly the same day as Roll With It.

00:10:04.802 --> 00:10:08.462
This was something that just wasn’t done in the music industry,

00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:13.372
as it would hurt both song’s chances, and both groups would end up

00:10:13.372 --> 00:10:16.972
selling fewer records than they would if there wasn’t this clash.

00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:23.062
Nevertheless, the date was set, August 14th 1995.

00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:27.812
Now, just in case you hadn’t heard these tracks before, these songs

00:10:27.812 --> 00:10:32.652
before, or you need a quick reminder, here is Blur’s Country House.

00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.959
And here’s Roll with It from Oasis.

00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:51.721
The funny thing is that neither of these songs were the

00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:55.571
bands’ best songs, and they both knew it at the time.

00:11:56.761 --> 00:12:01.321
Country House is a relatively straightforward, it's an uncomplicated

00:12:01.341 --> 00:12:07.031
song, and no serious Oasis fan would rate Roll With It in their top 5.

00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:12.231
Nevertheless, these two tracks were chosen, and they

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.971
were set to be released on exactly the same day.

00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:21.131
This was something that just wasn’t done, and the media went mad reporting on it.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:28.111
The month of August in the UK is nicknamed ‘silly season’ because there isn’t a huge

00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:34.521
amount that happens in the news, and the newspapers and news shows end up reporting

00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:39.721
on a load of stories that really wouldn’t make the headlines in a normal news period.

00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:42.731
This battle of Blur vs.

00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:48.081
Oasis, the battle to see who would be number one that week, was dubbed by the

00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:53.811
media as ‘The Battle Of Britpop’, and with not a huge amount of other, more

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:59.131
important news to be reporting on, it was all over the front pages and TV news.

00:13:00.277 --> 00:13:06.057
Two of Britain's most popular pop groups have begun the biggest chart war in 30 years.

00:13:06.057 --> 00:13:10.457
The Manchester band Oasis and their arch rivals Blur released new

00:13:10.527 --> 00:13:13.737
singles today, each hoping to reach the number one spot next week.

00:13:14.448 --> 00:13:19.119
The fight was on, the two giants of Britpop were releasing songs

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:23.789
on exactly the same day, and it was to be a battle for number one.

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:30.049
The media did everything they could to remind everyone about the differences

00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:35.659
between the bands, and that your choice of what single to buy wasn’t just about

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:41.049
which one you wanted to listen to, it was also about what sort of person you were.

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:44.319
Were you Blur, or were you Oasis?

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:50.129
It was almost like a general election, but instead of going to the polling booth,

00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:55.289
to the polling station, you went to the local record store and made your choice.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:14:01.419
And much like politicians do in the run up to an election, the bands did

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:06.459
everything they could to make sure their single was as attractive as possible.

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:12.559
With Blur, you actually got an extra CD with your purchase of Country

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:17.549
House, so you got two CDs for 99p, which was the price of the single.

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:23.429
Oasis tried to do a similar thing, but they were a little too late and

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:28.169
couldn’t actually give an extra CD away with the single, so they put

00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:32.779
barcodes inside the single which gave you the right to get another CD.

00:14:33.377 --> 00:14:38.203
But of course that wasn’t nearly as enticing as getting two CDs immediately.

00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:44.933
So, who ended up winning the battle of Britpop, who ended up with the number one single?

00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:52.443
It was a tense week, as music fans made the pilgrimage to the record store and cast their votes.

00:14:53.573 --> 00:14:57.553
It ended up being the best week in a decade for single sales,

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:05.693
but Blur beat Oasis, selling 274,000 records to Oasis’s 216,000.

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:10.883
Blur’s record label threw a huge party, a big

00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:15.113
celebration, but the victory didn’t really mean very much.

00:15:15.773 --> 00:15:22.963
In the interviews years afterwards most of Blur and Oasis admitted that the entire ‘battle’

00:15:22.973 --> 00:15:29.803
was created by the record labels and the media, and that Oasis added fuel to the fire.

00:15:31.083 --> 00:15:36.753
And if Blur won the battle, there are few that would contest the fact that Oasis

00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:41.773
won the war, at least from a popularity point of view, from a sales point of view.

00:15:42.993 --> 00:15:49.223
While Blur grew apart and the lead guitarist left in 2001, Oasis’s

00:15:49.223 --> 00:15:53.783
popularity grew and grew, despite the rivalries of the Gallagher brothers.

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:58.893
And although both bands have devoted followings outside

00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:04.293
the UK, Oasis’s worldwide popularity far outstrips Blur’s.

00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:10.463
In what goes for ‘popularity’ nowadays, Blur has around 6

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:13.895
million monthly listeners on Spotify while Oasis has 14 million.

00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:21.583
And as for Britpop, it survived for a few more years after the Battle of Britpop.

00:16:22.753 --> 00:16:28.343
Noel Gallagher, the guitarist from Oasis was invited to 10 Downing Street, the

00:16:28.523 --> 00:16:33.003
home of the Prime Minister, for a party when Tony Blair won the election of

00:16:33.613 --> 00:16:40.403
1997, and both Oasis and Blur continued to release critically acclaimed albums.

00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:46.503
But August 1995, and this battle, was its height, and

00:16:46.723 --> 00:16:50.013
Britpop mania never reached the same levels again.

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:56.003
Within a few years manufactured pop was back, with acts like

00:16:56.003 --> 00:16:59.663
the Spice Girls dominating the top of the charts for years.

00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:05.943
But this battle of Britpop went down in history as one of the great chart

00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:11.603
rivalries, and was the high point of one of the defining moments in British music.

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:17.223
Neither song may have been particularly great, and it might have all been

00:17:17.243 --> 00:17:22.213
hyped up just a little bit, manufactured so that people were even more

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:27.543
interested in it, but it certainly was a lot of fun, and sold a lot of records.

00:17:28.553 --> 00:17:32.533
And if you want a good way to start off a long conversation with

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:36.923
a Brit, you can always ask them who’s better, Blur, or Oasis.

00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:42.893
At least now you’ll know a little bit more about what their response will reveal.

00:17:45.263 --> 00:17:48.643
Ok then, that is it for the story of Blur vs.

00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:50.723
Oasis, and the battle of Britpop.

00:17:51.563 --> 00:17:56.263
It is a fun story, and one that not that many people outside the UK know.

00:17:56.643 --> 00:17:58.093
So I hope you enjoyed it.

00:17:59.353 --> 00:18:03.863
As a quick reminder, if you are looking for a more interesting way to improve your

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:09.643
English in 2021, then I’d recommend checking out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:14.763
Not only does this mean you’ll get immediate access to all of our bonus episodes,

00:18:14.763 --> 00:18:20.033
and all of the fantastic learning materials that come with them, but I’ve managed to

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:25.983
persuade the amazing Amy, who is from Vancouver in Canada, to give a one hour English

00:18:26.003 --> 00:18:31.313
strategy lesson to anyone who becomes an annual Learner member before the end of January.

00:18:31.973 --> 00:18:35.393
As I said at the start, Amy is in super high demand, so

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:38.323
we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:43.833
I guess these will go quite quickly, so if this is of interest, and it certainly

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:49.273
would be if I were in your position, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:18:50.473 --> 00:18:54.933
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:55.543 --> 00:19:00.023
I’m Alastair Budge, you stay safe and I’ll catch you in the next episode.

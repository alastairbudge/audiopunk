Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.210
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.630
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.870
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.220
about Meyer Lansky, the man known as the “Mob’s Accountant”.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.100
Meyer Lansky was a legendary figure in American Mafia circles.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.310
So much so that he even had his own character in the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.380
all-time classic Mafia film the Godfather - Hyman Roth.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.590
At one point, his total wealth was estimated at around $300 million

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.940
. 
Yet when Lansky died, there was no trace of these hidden millions.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.057
So, in this episode we’ll look at the life of Meyer Lansky, h ow he managed to become a

00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:09.338
well-respected member of the mob, despite not being Italian, how he befriended the Cuban

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:15.752
president and helped build Las Vegas all while spending very little time behind bars.

00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:20.818
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:29.958
Meyer Lansky was born in 1902, in what is modern-day Belarus, to Jewish-Polish parents.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:38.418
The family emigrated, they relocated, to New York in 1911, under pressure to escape

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:45.218
the anti-semitic, the anti-Jewish environment that was widespread in Imperial Russia.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:51.450
Lansky's father found work in Brooklyn, where the family first settled.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.050
Lansky was a good pupil at school and appeared to take his lessons in his stride.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.980
Later on in life, his excellent mathematics skills would help

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.300
him to earn a fortune and propel him to the top tier of the mob.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.770
While he may have had more money than he knew what to do with

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.470
later on in life, as a young boy there was never much money around.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.157
In an effort to cut costs, Lansky's family moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan's Lower East Side.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:33.607
During the early 1900s, the Lower East Side was home to a large number of Jewish families from

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:40.247
Eastern Europe, often working in garment manufacturing or selling goods from pavement stalls.

00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:47.907
At the time, the Lower East Side was one of the most densely populated places in the world,

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:55.097
with families living in cramped, overcrowded apartments with very basic sanitation facilities.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:03:02.907
It was here that Lansky began to deviate, to stray from the straight and narrow.

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:08.486
While Lansky continued to do well at his new school, he quickly became

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:13.526
involved in local kid’s street gangs and illegal street gambling.

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:17.736
While Lansky was at school, he became friends with

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:21.976
another Jewish boy called Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel.

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:27.646
The pair would form a long-lasting friendship and go on to create

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:33.216
the Bugs and Meyer Mob - a very violent Prohibition-era gang.

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:39.137
Lansky's move to the Lower East Side was also responsible for his close

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:44.047
relationship with the Italian Charles “Lucky” Luciano, who would later

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:48.957
become one of the most powerful figures of organised crime in America.

00:03:50.107 --> 00:03:56.467
Legend has it that Luciano was the child leader of a gang of boys originally from Italy who

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:03.500
would pick on Jewish children, like Lansky and Siegel, forcing them to pay them protection money.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.270
This practice is also known as an extortion racket.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.180
It’s a common criminal activity, “protection”.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.110
You pay me otherwise I’ll beat you up.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.820
It’s one of the simplest Mafia extortion techniques,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.400
making it an easy way for most gangsters to get started.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:32.590
Despite his short height and younger age, landscape refused to give in to surrender to Luciano.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.550
His plucky, his brave, refusals led to Luciano respecting him

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.920
and they then became friends, and later business associates.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.290
His partnership with Luciano would open the door to working with high-ranking,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.650
older mob members such as Arnold Rothstein, a man nicknamed “The Brain”, who

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.980
was rumoured to have fixed the 1919 World Series in Major League Baseball.

00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:07.130
At the time, the Jewish and the Italian mobs were the two main criminal groups

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.240
operating in New York, and they didn’t get along, they were not friends.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.350
Each side stuck to their ethnic roots and competed for power, money and territory.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.720
Unlike previous generations who formed these independent criminal groups based on their

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.730
ethnicity or nationality, Lansky, Luciano and Siegel were part of a new generation, one

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.200
where criminals from different backgrounds would work together to maximise their profits.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.890
When Lansky finished school, aged 14 as was common at the time,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.520
he got his first real job working in the manufacturing industry.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.120
Later, he progressed to working on cars as a mechanic, but he still kept his street

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.780
gambling habits from his school days and still kept contact with street gang members.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.540
Before long, he took up a second job in the evening,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.380
working as a strong-arm man at a gambling parlour.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.410
Aside from providing security, strong-arm men were also often very

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.410
violent, using threats, force and intimidation as required by their bosses.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.660
At this time, organised criminals mainly made money from illegal gambling

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.890
and extortion, but in 1920 there would be a new, incredibly lucrative

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.950
money-making opportunity: Prohibition, or the banning of alcohol.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.490
We actually did an episode on Prohibition a couple of weeks ago, it was one of our

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.010
member-only ones, so if you’re interested in that one I’d recommend checking it out.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.810
In 1920, when Prohibition came into effect, sales of alcohol

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.790
were forced underground, and a golden opportunity was presented.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.210
Naturally, people didn’t stop drinking altogether, and the illegal supply of

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.560
alcohol, or bootlegging, as it was known, was taken over by criminal gangs.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:21.110
Bootlegging often went hand-in-hand with the illegal gambling

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.143
industry, with drinking now forced to take place behind locked doors.

00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:33.433
Lansky decided to leave his day job altogether and go full-time with his illegal activities.

00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:38.143
Lansky and Siegel became partners specialising in

00:07:38.353 --> 00:07:42.343
bootlegging, in the distribution and sale of illegal alcohol.

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:47.603
But Lansky wasn't only involved with bootlegged alcohol.

00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:53.233
His Bugs and Meyer Mob, as it had became known, had developed a violent

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:59.813
reputation, specialising in assasinations - performing hits, or murders, to

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:05.473
order, as well as illegal gambling, truck hijacking and protection rackets.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:10.803
Lansky was reportedly the brains, organising the criminal

00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:14.883
activities while Siegel would handle the violent crime.

00:08:16.053 --> 00:08:20.883
Lansky and Siegel worked in close partnership with Luciano, as well

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:25.653
as providing him with the hitmen he needed to reorganise the mafia.

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:33.063
Lansky also became a protégé of the powerful Rothstein, the man nicknamed The Brain.

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:38.263
Clearly Lansky was on his way up in the criminal underworld.

00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:44.151
He was Jewish, not Italian, which would mean he would struggle to ever be

00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:50.021
accepted at the very upper echelons, right at the top, but his brains and

00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:55.331
his business sense meant that he became trusted by many major mob figures.

00:08:55.981 --> 00:09:02.171
This became a winning formula and Lansky was known for his honest and fair dealings.

00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:09.601
Given his new status, it is no surprise that Lansky was an influential

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:15.631
presence at the now infamous mafia conference in Atlantic city in 1929.

00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:22.058
The Atlantic City Conference was the brainchild, the invention of, Lucky

00:09:22.198 --> 00:09:27.658
Luciano who wanted the Italian and Jewish mobs to pool their resources

00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:32.728
and talent, and work together rather than in competition with one another.

00:09:34.218 --> 00:09:38.368
The conference was attended by all of the big mafia kingpins and

00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:42.978
led to the creation of something called the United Crime Syndicate.

00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:45.018
The logic was simple.

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:48.768
We’ll all make more money and have less trouble with the

00:09:48.768 --> 00:09:52.118
police if we work together rather than fight each other.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:59.668
After Prohibition ended in 1933, and alcohol was suddenly legal again,

00:09:59.984 --> 00:10:04.690
Lansky and his other mob colleagues needed to find another way to make money.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:12.010
Illegal money, of course, as making money legally is just… well, it's hard and boring.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.620
For Lansky, this would be gambling, which was still illegal

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:23.206
He had experience from his school day street corner gambling games and his

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:29.226
superior mathematical skills meant that he understood the basics of gambling much

00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:34.276
better than some other criminals who were simply out to make cash by cheating.

00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:41.276
From the very beginning, Lansky was determined to set up his gambling business fairly.

00:10:42.086 --> 00:10:46.886
Even though this might sound like a contradiction, Lansky wanted

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:50.496
his customers to have confidence in his gambling establishments.

00:10:50.981 --> 00:10:56.021
He knew that the house, the business, the casino always wins in the end.

00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:01.841
So rather than rigging his tables so that they paid out quickly,

00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:06.071
Lansky made sure that his establishments were always fair.

00:11:06.858 --> 00:11:10.878
Thanks to his honesty in this respect, Lansky's gambling

00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:15.468
ventures really began to take off and with them, his profits.

00:11:16.618 --> 00:11:21.003
But, not content with illegal gambling dens and bootlegging,

00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:25.393
Lansky wanted to open what was known as a "carpet joint".

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:32.053
“Joint” in this context means a place, but it can also be slang for

00:11:32.153 --> 00:11:36.993
a prison or a cigarette containing marijuana - it's a great example

00:11:37.023 --> 00:11:40.843
of the different contextual meanings of slang words in English.

00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:45.489
Going back to what Lansky wanted to open it was a “carpet

00:11:45.489 --> 00:11:51.459
joint” - and "carpet joint" is a slang term for a luxury casino.

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:58.899
Lansky's first big venture was the creation of a casino in Saratoga Springs, New York.

00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:05.956
He partnered with Mafia bigwigs, or VIPs, Frank Costello and Joe Adonis.

00:12:06.603 --> 00:12:09.603
Like numerous other illegal gambling establishments,

00:12:09.923 --> 00:12:13.793
their casino was protected by corrupt local politicians.

00:12:14.753 --> 00:12:19.733
In fact, it was due to his illegal gambling operation in Saratoga Springs

00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:25.403
that Lansky would spend his only time in prison, - a total of just 24 days.

00:12:26.443 --> 00:12:31.213
This was due to a widespread crackdown on illegal gambling which

00:12:31.363 --> 00:12:35.743
officials and local residents had previously turned a blind eye to.

00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:43.173
Lansky decided to head south, for sun, sand, and easily-bribed politicians.

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:47.643
He went to Florida, and opened a series of casinos in the

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:51.003
state with the unofficial agreement of the local government.

00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:56.763
Illegal gambling had become a major source of income for some local governments.

00:12:57.123 --> 00:13:04.973
Criminals would make huge donations to local synagogues, churches, hospitals and city organisations.

00:13:05.463 --> 00:13:09.967
Local residents and politicians, many of whom benefited directly from

00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:15.349
this illegal industry, would often turn a blind eye to these casinos.

00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:23.257
Lansky's reputation as someone who was able to build well-run, respectable casinos meant

00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:29.956
that he was invited to Cuba in the late 1930s, by a then military colonel, Fulgencio Batista.

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:37.967
Batista had a vision to make Cuba into a playground for the rich and famous, and sought

00:13:37.997 --> 00:13:44.247
Lansky's services as someone who would be able to rebuild the country’s corrupt casino industry.

00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:50.047
This would be just the start of a project that was later to become his main focus

00:13:50.067 --> 00:13:56.447
in life, but there was a spanner in the works when Batista unexpectedly lost power

00:13:56.457 --> 00:14:02.347
and influence after his appointed political successor lost the 1944 election.

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:10.857
Lansky, without a sympathetic ear in Cuba, focussed his attention back on the US, and he

00:14:10.857 --> 00:14:16.687
was instrumental in planting the seeds for what would become America’s gambling capital.

00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:23.727
In 1946, he helped his childhood friend and partner Bugsy Siegel to take control

00:14:23.937 --> 00:14:30.487
of the mob’s interests in Las Vegas, where Siegel would create the Flamingo Hotel.

00:14:31.677 --> 00:14:37.907
However, this hotel ran massively over budget, and suspicions were running

00:14:37.907 --> 00:14:43.457
high that Siegel was on the take, that he was syphoning money off for himself.

00:14:44.844 --> 00:14:48.544
Lansky is said to have spared his friend the mob's

00:14:48.564 --> 00:14:53.034
wrath, their anger, but he wasn't able to do so forever.

00:14:54.234 --> 00:14:58.674
Eventually it seems that Lansky had little choice but to agree

00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:02.694
with the growing demands to have Siegel taken out or killed.

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:09.994
Now up until now, you might have thought that Lansky sounded like any other gangster

00:15:10.354 --> 00:15:15.724
running protection rackets being involved with bootlegged alcohol and violent crime

00:15:16.484 --> 00:15:21.014
.
Sure, he did all that, and he was certainly not a very nice man.

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:27.184
But the reality was that he was quite unlike the typical mafioso of the time.

00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:33.608
Lansky had always been particular about money, both his own and the profits

00:15:33.608 --> 00:15:38.708
that he collected and shared with or on behalf of his various partners.

00:15:39.818 --> 00:15:45.758
In an attempt to avoid prison, Lansky is said to have channeled money through Swiss

00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:52.058
banks and various holding companies in order to hide his wealth and that of his partners.

00:15:53.087 --> 00:15:59.157
It’s for this reason that he is still known today as the “Mob’s Accountant”, as someone

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:05.737
who knew how to read a balance sheet, how to squeeze the maximum amount of money out of a

00:16:05.737 --> 00:16:11.867
business, and most importantly, how to hide it from the authorities to avoid getting caught.

00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:17.849
However, Lansky was not completely against taking risks, and

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:22.399
despite being spectacularly wealthy, it never seemed to be enough.

00:16:23.539 --> 00:16:29.089
After returning to power in a military coup in 1952, Cuban President

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:35.119
Fulgencio Batista invited Lansky back to Cuba to further reform the gambling

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:40.319
industry, after his early stint, or stay, in Cuba several years before.

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:47.949
As gambling had become increasingly cracked down upon in America during the 1940s, and with

00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:54.489
many of his casinos being closed down, Cuba seemed like a golden opportunity for Lansky.

00:16:55.419 --> 00:17:02.569
Batista and Lansky worked out a deal together, Batista and Lansky would control Cuban gambling

00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:08.499
in return for secret payments or kickbacks, and favourable treatment from the government.

00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:13.359
The mafia would also be free to control everything that came along

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:18.609
with gambling: alcohol, prostitution, drugs, essentially turning

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:23.833
Cuba into a den of iniquity only a short flight away from Florida.

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:29.859
Lansky had already made clear that he believed Cuba was a golden opportunity

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:35.429
for the mafia, and several years before coming back, he had organised the Havana

00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:41.099
Conference - the biggest mob meeting since the Atlantic City Conference in 1929.

00:17:41.717 --> 00:17:46.302
Batista and Lansky' business arrangement would last for 10 years.

00:17:47.052 --> 00:17:51.342
Aside from taking over casinos Lansky also built his

00:17:51.342 --> 00:17:55.422
own, including his crown jewel, the Riviera hotel.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.380
The hotel's grand opening starred the award-winning

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.390
actress Ginger Rogers and was even shown on American TV.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.720
However, as the saying goes all good things come to an end.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:15.360
Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, when Fidel Castro took power and the

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.057
country became communist, all American-owned businesses were nationalised.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.670
Casinos were closed down and property seized.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.680
It is estimated that Lansky lost around $7 million at the

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.634
time, approximately 44 million euros in today's money.

00:18:33.414 --> 00:18:36.554
In Lansky's own words, he crapped out.

00:18:36.674 --> 00:18:38.534
He lost it all on a gamble.

00:18:39.464 --> 00:18:45.524
This phrase, by the way, crapped out, comes from the dice game craps, which was the

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:51.014
first form of gambling that Lansky encountered on the streets of New York as a child.

00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:58.492
After losing everything in Cuba, Lansky had no choice, but to move back to the U S, where he

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:05.602
was put under surveillance, under watch, by the tax authorities for suspected income tax fraud.

00:19:06.432 --> 00:19:12.982
After coming under continued pressure from the US authorities, Lansky decided to sell all of his

00:19:12.982 --> 00:19:19.752
business interests, leave America and moved to Israel under Israel's law of return programme.

00:19:21.062 --> 00:19:27.532
However, given Lansky's criminal record and America wanting to press tax evasion charges

00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:33.862
against him, Lansky was deported, he was sent back to the USA just two years later.

00:19:34.862 --> 00:19:38.852
Back in the USA Lansky faced criminal charges.

00:19:39.437 --> 00:19:45.817
He was cleared of the tax evasion charges and given his poor health and old age,

00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:51.037
the judge suspended, or stopped, the other charges from being brought to court.

00:19:51.817 --> 00:19:56.417
He died in 1983 of lung cancer at the age of 80.

00:19:56.887 --> 00:20:01.697
No mean feat for one of the most powerful organised criminals in 20th

00:20:01.697 --> 00:20:06.257
century America, and it is certainly quite something that he only spent

00:20:06.297 --> 00:20:11.857
less than a month in prison, lived to the age of 80 and died a free man.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:15.587
You couldn’t say the same about many of his business associates.

00:20:16.597 --> 00:20:22.347
But while he might have lived a long and free life, and certainly would have made vast

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:28.317
amounts of money from everything from bootlegging to extortion, then later the drugs

00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:34.297
and casino trade, after his death this money seemed to have vanished into thin air.

00:20:35.147 --> 00:20:40.767
His family, reportedly I should say, were surprised to say that his estate

00:20:40.957 --> 00:20:47.247
amounted to little more than $35,000, around 100,000 euros in today’s money.

00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:52.017
So what exactly happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:56.367
that the U S federal authorities believed Lansky had hidden?

00:20:57.158 --> 00:20:58.458
Did they ever exist?

00:20:58.788 --> 00:21:01.658
Are they still sitting in a Swiss bank somewhere?

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:06.588
Or did he really lose everything in Cuba, he put everything

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:10.478
on black and he wasn’t expecting communist “red”?

00:21:11.798 --> 00:21:17.296
Before his death, despite Forbes magazine suggesting that he was one of the richest

00:21:17.296 --> 00:21:23.096
men in America,  Lansky had claimed that he was almost broke, almost out of money.

00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:28.462
He openly stated that he lost almost everything he had in Cuba, but

00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:32.355
there does seem to be a large difference between his estimated 300

00:21:32.355 --> 00:21:37.622
million dollar fortune and the 7 million dollars that he lost in Cuba.

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:42.542
I don’t think you need to be an accountant to see that, as far as

00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:46.932
the Mob’s Accountant is concerned, something doesn’t quite add up.

00:21:49.032 --> 00:21:54.112
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Meyer Lansky.

00:21:54.422 --> 00:21:57.622
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned a bit

00:21:57.782 --> 00:22:01.432
about the life and times of the so-called “Mob’s Accountant”.

00:22:01.992 --> 00:22:05.522
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:05.842 --> 00:22:11.522
What do you think of Meyer Lansky, was he really any different from any other mob boss?

00:22:11.832 --> 00:22:14.832
Do you really believe that Lansky lost all his money?

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:20.047
And do you think that these gangsters of the 1930s and 40s are

00:22:20.287 --> 00:22:23.407
really any different from the organised criminals of today?

00:22:24.137 --> 00:22:27.627
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

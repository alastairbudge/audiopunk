Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.170
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.800
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.438
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Great Siege of Malta.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.820
It’s often portrayed as the story of East vs West, of Islam vs.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.730
Christianity, and of Goliath vs.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.230
David

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.420
.
There are elements of all that in the story of the Siege of Malta, but it is

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.960
also the story of two aging military leaders, of the role of morale in battle,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.800
and of the importance of keeping hydrated on a small mediterranean island.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.010
And it’s also just a fantastic story.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.720
We have got a lot to get through in today’s episode - So, let’s jump right into it.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.570
The islands of Malta sit just under 100 kilometres south of Sicily.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.140
There are, technically speaking, several islands, the main ones being

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.980
Malta and Gozo, but I’ll refer to it all here as Malta, for sake of ease.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.950
If you’ve been there, you will know that it is very small,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.380
just 316 kilometres squared, about half the size of Madrid.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.830
It was to be on this small island that one of the most amazing battles in Mediterranean history took

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:56.535
place in the summer of the year 1565, a battle that is now referred to as The Great Siege of Malta.

00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:04.355
Malta, given that it was such a small island but in such a strategic location in the

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:09.805
centre of the Mediterranean, and because it didn’t really have any sizable military

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:16.205
at all, had been occupied by various different rulers and forces over the course of

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:21.795
its history, from the Phoenecians to the Byzantines, then the Arabs and the Normans.

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:30.538
In 1530, the islands of Malta were given to a religious order called The Knights of St John.

00:02:31.438 --> 00:02:35.418
This religious order, which contained Knights from all over

00:02:35.418 --> 00:02:41.368
Europe, traced its roots back to the 1060s, in Amalfi, in Italy.

00:02:42.547 --> 00:02:50.908
In 1099, the Knights of the order had set up a hospital in Jerusalem, to care for wounded Crusaders,

00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:56.508
which gave them another name you might have heard them referred to as - the Knights Hospitaller.

00:02:57.508 --> 00:03:06.078
After being kicked out of Jerusalem in the 1290s, they then settled on the island of Rhodes, where

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:13.953
they stayed for just over 200 years before being kicked out again and arriving in Malta in 1530.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:21.164
The Knights were allowed to have the entire island for the rent of one Maltese

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:27.618
falcon per year, one bird, which was payable to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V.

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:35.738
Meanwhile, further to the east, lay the Ottoman empire, one of the world’s most powerful

00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:43.778
empires, and importantly, an Islamic one, which was at that time the sworn enemy of Christianity.

00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:52.048
The Ottoman Empire originated in modern day Turkey, but its tentacles stretched

00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:58.548
across huge swathes of central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.

00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:05.778
It was led, at the time, by a man called Suleiman The Magnificent, who was the most

00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:13.248
powerful of the Ottoman emperors, and commanded an empire that oversaw 25 million people.

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:19.648
Although he is known in the West as Suleiman The Magnificent, in Turkey he

00:04:19.648 --> 00:04:25.848
is known as Suleiman The Lawgiver, and is known mainly for his ability as a

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:30.998
skilled governor and leader of an empire, rather than as a ferocious warrior.

00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:37.728
From his throne in Istanbul, Suleiman ruled over his vast empire.

00:04:38.468 --> 00:04:43.088
The small island of Malta was one and a half thousand kilometres away.

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:49.138
Neither its native inhabitants nor the Knights living there posed much of a

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:58.078
direct threat to King Suleiman, yet in 1565 a fleet of 40,000 Ottomans soldiers

00:04:58.338 --> 00:05:03.748
set off on a mission to capture the island and destroy the Knights living there.

00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:05.208
Why?

00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:10.928
Interestingly enough, historians are a little divided about

00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:15.758
the actual reasons Suleiman decided to set sail for Malta.

00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:20.268
The Knights of St John were a little bit annoying.

00:05:20.538 --> 00:05:25.878
They would capture Ottoman trade ships on the route between Venice and the

00:05:25.878 --> 00:05:32.628
east, and in the summer of 1564, a year before the siege, they captured

00:05:32.758 --> 00:05:37.708
a particularly valuable Ottoman ship which was on the way to Venice.

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:42.588
So, there is one theory that the Knights of St John were a

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:46.648
bit annoying, a thorn in the side of the powerful emperor.

00:05:47.798 --> 00:05:54.128
The other theory goes that Suleiman was interested in Malta’s value as a strategic

00:05:54.198 --> 00:06:00.308
outpost, a valuable point on the map, and he could use this as a base for

00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:06.118
further attacks into Sicily, up through Calabria, and as a route into Europe.

00:06:07.058 --> 00:06:12.498
From a strategic point of view, Malta is in an excellent location.

00:06:13.368 --> 00:06:19.658
It has a very deep natural harbour, so it’s a good place to leave large ships.

00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:24.728
And from there you can relatively easily defend the Eastern

00:06:24.728 --> 00:06:29.118
Mediterranean, from ships wanting to travel from west to east.

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:35.528
What Suleiman’s true intentions were perhaps we will never know, but he was

00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:40.548
a shrewd leader, and the decision to attack Malta would not have been one

00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:44.948
he would have taken without careful consideration, and adequate planning.

00:06:46.088 --> 00:06:55.308
And so it was, on March 22nd 1565 one of the largest Turkish naval forces ever put

00:06:55.308 --> 00:07:01.888
together set sail from Constantinople, west, with Malta as their final destination.

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:09.488
Accounts differ about exactly how large the invading forces were, but most

00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:17.708
estimates are around 40,000 men, and somewhere between 130 and 300 ships.

00:07:19.018 --> 00:07:22.988
The largest of these ships could have held 700 men.

00:07:23.798 --> 00:07:27.588
They did have sails, which obviously came in useful

00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:29.798
when the wind was blowing in the right direction.

00:07:30.558 --> 00:07:37.008
But they also had vast quantities of slaves who would pull huge oars.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:43.408
The Ottomans were great takers of slaves, and one of the unfortunate

00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:48.768
destinies if you were taken prisoner by the Ottoman army was to become a

00:07:48.788 --> 00:07:54.078
galley slave, someone tasked with rowing these huge ships across the seas.

00:07:55.438 --> 00:08:00.129
A man who knew this all too well was Jean De la Valette,

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:03.659
the ageing Grand Master of The Knights of Malta.

00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:11.230
He had actually been taken prisoner himself by Barbary pirates, allies of the Ottomans,

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:18.129
and been kept as a galley slave for a year, before being freed in a prisoner exchange.

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:24.639
No doubt this was an experience that was hard to forget, and Jean De la

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:30.249
Valette knew that if he or any of his men were to be taken prisoner by the

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:34.729
Ottomans, this would be a fate that would await them, if they were lucky.

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:41.279
It’s worth pausing briefly to explain a little bit about the geography of the

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:46.389
island of Malta, and explaining where things were at the time of the Great Siege.

00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:52.969
The capital was a town called Mdina, to the west, at the highest point of the island.

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:59.369
The majority of the west coast of Malta is characterised by high

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:04.109
and dangerous cliffs - not a place for ships to land safely.

00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:11.969
To the east of the island, which is only about 15km wide, is a deep natural

00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:17.219
harbour, with a peninsula, a sort of finger that sticks out into the sea.

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:24.149
The Knights had built several forts in this area to protect the harbour from invaders.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:31.151
They were pretty well-built forts, but they also have the natural advantage that the

00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:38.979
land shoots up almost vertically meaning not only were the defending soldiers higher up

00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:45.819
and it was easier to fire cannons and weapons down onto invading forces, but it was also

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:52.789
very difficult for an enemy ship to land safely and for soldiers to get up to the fort.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:58.979
On the other hand, to the south of the island there are nice, shallow

00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:03.929
bays, perfect for ships to land and for forces to come ashore.

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:10.189
This was, of course, where the Ottoman forces disembarked, where they came

00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:16.765
off their ships and set their feet onto Maltese soil on May 19th 1565.

00:10:17.749 --> 00:10:22.539
Their arrival did not take the Knights by surprise, they knew they were coming.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:29.394
Jean De la Valette had prepared the forts on the island, and outside the forts, in the

00:10:29.474 --> 00:10:35.294
settlements that the Ottomans were likely to pass through, Jean De la Valette had ordered for

00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:42.264
the wells to be poisoned, so that there was no drinking water, and for any food to be destroyed.

00:10:43.524 --> 00:10:50.024
The defending forces were seriously outnumbered - there were reportedly around 700

00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:58.064
Knights and around 8000 Maltese soldiers facing the 40,000 strong Ottoman army.

00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:03.934
Even before the Ottoman forces reached land, there was disagreement

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:07.644
about exactly which part of Malta they should attack first.

00:11:08.494 --> 00:11:14.754
This disagreement was between the two main commanders, Mustafa Pasha, who was in charge

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:20.804
of the land forces, and a man called Piyale Pasha, who was in charge of the navy.

00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:28.164
The naval commander, Piyale Pasha won the argument, and the Ottoman forces marched

00:11:28.194 --> 00:11:34.484
north to attack a fort on the peninsula to the east of the island, called Fort St Elmo.

00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:40.184
It was believed that they could take this fort easily, just in a couple of days.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:46.594
In addition to the commander of the land forces and the commander of the navy, the Ottoman

00:11:46.594 --> 00:11:53.955
forces were joined by another supreme commander, an 80 year old man called Dragut, who was a

00:11:53.955 --> 00:12:01.165
fearless Ottoman military champion and was once called "the greatest pirate warrior of all time".

00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:07.515
To make matters even more confusing, both the commander of the navy and the

00:12:07.515 --> 00:12:11.775
commander of the army were told by Suleiman the Magnificent that they should

00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:18.085
ultimately answer to Dragut, so the ageing pirate Dragut was in charge of everything.

00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:26.805
The fort proved to be not nearly as easy to capture as the Ottomans had thought, and it was only on

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:34.145
the 27th of June, over a month after the attack first started, that they managed to take the fort.

00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:40.555
A few Maltese soldiers managed to escape, swimming across the bay to the other

00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:47.115
side, but almost all the other men, both Knights of St John and Maltese soldiers

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:53.815
were slaughtered, around 1,500 in total, leaving only a handful as prisoners.

00:12:54.675 --> 00:13:00.865
But while this was a strategic loss for the Knights, the attack on the fort had cost

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:08.605
the Ottoman forces dearly, with an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Ottoman soldiers dead.

00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:14.205
And the loss of one particular Ottoman was even more tragic.

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:21.725
Dragut, the supreme commander, the greatest pirate warrior of all time was killed in the attack.

00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:27.565
He had been arguing with his soldiers about how to direct a cannon.

00:13:27.885 --> 00:13:33.235
The cannon fired, its ball knocked off part of a wall and killed

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:37.885
Dragut outright, he had been killed accidentally by his own men.

00:13:38.675 --> 00:13:44.245
This was a great shock to the Ottoman forces, and just as it damaged

00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:48.895
their morale, it was a great morale boost to the Knights and the Maltese.

00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:56.475
The Knights were a religious order, and they saw this as a sign from God that he was

00:13:56.485 --> 00:14:02.325
on their side, and he was supporting them in their fight against the Muslim invaders.

00:14:03.395 --> 00:14:08.905
But even though the Ottomans had lost their supreme commander, as well as up to

00:14:08.905 --> 00:14:14.235
8,000 of their men, they still greatly outnumbered the defenders of the island,

00:14:14.685 --> 00:14:20.285
who by this time had retreated to another fort on the other side of the harbour,

00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:26.515
as well as to the poorly defended capital city, Mdina, 15 km to the west.

00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:34.035
To try to terrify the Knights into a surrender, to try to make them give up, Mustafa

00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:39.695
Pasha, the commander of the land forces, ordered for all of the Knights who were

00:14:39.725 --> 00:14:45.915
taken prisoner at Fort St Elmo to be executed, for their heads to be chopped off.

00:14:46.675 --> 00:14:53.685
Their bodies were put onto fake crucifixes, fake crosses, and pushed out to sea, across

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:59.095
the harbour to the fort that the remaining Knights and Maltese forces were defending.

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:04.955
As a revenge for this, Jean De la Valette ordered for all of the Ottoman

00:15:04.965 --> 00:15:09.795
prisoners they were holding to be executed, and for their heads to

00:15:09.795 --> 00:15:15.533
be used as cannonballs and fired back across the bay at the Ottomans.

00:15:16.675 --> 00:15:23.445
The entire Great Siege was, in many ways, a battle of morale, with both

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:28.805
sides trying to scare the other, and damage the morale of their troops.

00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:34.915
The Knights were offered the opportunity to surrender, but Jean De la Valette

00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:41.245
rejected it, presumably knowing that a surrender would mean becoming a galley slave

00:15:41.335 --> 00:15:45.925
if you were very lucky, and probably something very unpleasant if you weren’t.

00:15:46.955 --> 00:15:51.905
What’s more, summer was approaching, and if you have been to Malta in the

00:15:51.905 --> 00:15:57.325
summer you will know it gets very hot, and there isn’t a huge amount of water.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:02.335
For the Knights, they had ample supplies, they had enough

00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:06.515
food and water, and they could almost just wait it out.

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.213
But the Ottomans didn’t.

00:16:09.793 --> 00:16:12.473
They needed to make progress, and fast.

00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:19.203
After several failed attempts to take the fort on the southern harbour, Fort St Angelo, they

00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:25.353
launched a huge attack in mid-August, which almost broke through the Knights’ defences and

00:16:25.353 --> 00:16:30.703
took the fort, which was being guarded by the 70-year-old Jean De la Valette personally.

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:35.683
The Ottomans were nervously looking over their shoulders by this point,

00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:41.388
as they knew that a large force of reinforcements was on its way to

00:16:41.388 --> 00:16:46.338
help the nights but they didn't know exactly when it would arrive.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:52.590
A smaller force had arrived, called Il Piccolo Soccorso, at the start of July.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:58.970
This consisted of some soldiers from Sicily, and although it was a help to

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.830
the defending forces, it wasn’t enough to completely see off the Ottomans.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.610
Throughout the rest of Europe, leaders were awaiting news from the Siege, fearing that Malta

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:17.880
would fall and be taken over by the Ottomans, who would be dangerously close to Christian Europe.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:26.430
Indeed, even back in England, Queen Elizabeth The First wrote “If the Turks should prevail against

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:33.600
the Isle of Malta, it is uncertain what further peril might follow to the rest of Christendom”.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.650
The Knights knew this, and they appealed to European monarchs for

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.800
reinforcements, for more soldiers to help them defeat the Ottoman invaders.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:51.750
They didn’t just sit still though, they used some cunning tactics to confuse the

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:57.320
Ottomans, and trick them into thinking that reinforcements were on their way.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:03.420
One example of how they did this was by allowing an Ottoman prisoner to

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:09.270
overhear the news of huge forces arriving, then allowing him to return

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.375
to his camp, where of course he told his commanders what he had heard.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.660
The one thing was, there was no big army arriving, or at least not at that point.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:26.670
It had already got to September, the Ottoman forces were exhausted and they needed

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:32.300
to set sail East before Autumn arrived to avoid difficult sailing conditions.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:39.020
Also the Knights and the Maltese forces were exhausted, and although they had managed

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.980
so far to resist, they were still waiting for the reinforcement Europe had promised.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.940
Then, on September 7th reinforcements did finally arrive from

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.070
Sicily, the so-called ‘Grande Soccorso’ ‘The Great Relief’.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.440
This was an army of 7,000 men, a mixture of Spanish

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.772
and Italian soldiers, sent to support the Knights.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:10.990
They were trained soldiers, they were ready to fight, and perhaps most importantly they were fresh.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:17.870
The demoralised Ottoman troops, weary after 4 months of solid fighting,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.630
were no match for them, and the very next day they retreated, clambering

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.920
into the remaining ships and sailing away on the 13th of September.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:37.580
Although this was hailed very much as a victory for the Knights, a triumph of West vs.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.850
East, of Christianity vs.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.200
Islam, and of David vs.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.741
Goliath , it came very close to being a very different result.

00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:53.451
If the Ottomans had managed to take control of Malta, they would have had a

00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:58.931
stronghold in the Mediterranean, been able to defend the eastern part of the sea,

00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:04.211
and that part of the world may have looked very different to what it does now.

00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:12.261
But they didn’t, and the Maltese have never forgotten it - The Great Siege of Malta is a source

00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:20.941
of huge pride for local Maltese, and it is still to this day quoted as a way of saying “we Maltese

00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:27.641
can do anything - we beat off the Turks in 1565 - we may be small but don’t underestimate us”.

00:20:28.731 --> 00:20:34.981
That tiny peninsula, the finger sticking out into the sea where the first ferocious

00:20:34.991 --> 00:20:39.943
battle was fought is now the capital of Malta, called Valletta, after Jean De la

00:20:39.971 --> 00:20:45.801
Valette, the grandmaster believed by many to have saved Malta from the Ottomans.

00:20:46.761 --> 00:20:51.351
The 8th of September, the day that the Ottoman forces turned

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:55.071
around and retreated, is a national holiday, Victory Day.

00:20:55.611 --> 00:21:01.931
It actually recalls the end of three historical sieges made on the Maltese archipelago: the

00:21:02.241 --> 00:21:07.911
Great Siege of Malta we are talking about; the Siege of Valletta by the French Blockade ending

00:21:07.921 --> 00:21:15.547
in 1800 and the Siege of Malta during the Second World War by the Axis forces ending in 1943.

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:19.467
...but these are two great stories for another episode.

00:21:19.877 --> 00:21:25.557
Everywhere you go in Malta you can buy little souvenir Knights of St John, reminding

00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:32.445
you of the events of 1565, and still today in Turkey the Great Siege is taught in

00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:38.275
military strategy schools as an example of military mistakes not to make again.

00:21:39.275 --> 00:21:43.855
Soon after the Knights' victory, the news of the Siege quickly travelled

00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:48.985
all over Europe, really rejuvenating the order of the Knights of St John.

00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:53.925
Donations flooded in, with people keen to support these

00:21:53.925 --> 00:21:57.875
men who were viewed as great defenders of Christianity.

00:21:58.705 --> 00:22:03.335
This money went towards great palaces, forts and churches,

00:22:03.495 --> 00:22:06.851
and went towards building the new capital city, Valletta.

00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:13.785
Even almost 200 years after The Great Siege, Voltaire, the great French

00:22:13.805 --> 00:22:18.815
Enlightenment thinker, wrote “Nothing is more known than The Siege of Malta”.

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:23.935
And while you might not have known what Voltaire was talking about 20 minutes

00:22:23.935 --> 00:22:28.635
ago, at least now you know a little bit more about this fascinating story.

00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:35.645
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Great Siege of Malta.

00:22:36.575 --> 00:22:41.005
If you have been paying attention in some of the other episodes, you may

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:45.105
remember that I have actually been living in this little island of Malta for

00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:49.905
the past 4 years, and so The Great Siege is a subject I’m quite familiar with.

00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:55.295
It is an amazing story, and knowing about it really helps you understand

00:22:55.305 --> 00:22:59.625
the Maltese psyche, and helps you better understand the country.

00:23:00.185 --> 00:23:01.845
So, I hope you enjoyed it.

00:23:02.685 --> 00:23:06.095
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:08.625
Did you know about the Great Siege of Malta?

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:14.445
And especially for the Turkish members out there, what do you think of this event?

00:23:14.695 --> 00:23:18.025
How common is knowledge of it in Turkish history?

00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:19.575
I would love to know.

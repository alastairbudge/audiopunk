Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:16.366
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:21.386
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:26.856
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about patents.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.596
Patents are a way for inventors, and for companies to protect their inventions for a fixed period.

00:00:35.156 --> 00:00:39.986
Exploring the idea of patents is fascinating, as it raises several

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:45.576
questions: how to incentivise scientific and technological progress?

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:49.036
What actually is the value of an idea?

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:56.026
Should we change these laws, and under what conditions, if millions of lives are at stake?

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:02.806
I guess I should start by saying that this isn’t legal advice, but rather an exploration

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:08.896
of this weird and wonderful world, with a few fun examples thrown in for good measure.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:13.376
Right, with that out of the way, let’s get started.

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:18.556
We are all beneficiaries of the inventions of other people.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:23.106
From the phone or computer you’re listening to this on through to the

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:29.126
microwave oven, from the traffic light to the USB socket, our lives are

00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:33.586
infinitely better and easier thanks to the inventions of other people.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:39.276
It does seem strange to think that almost everything we use in our day to

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:45.056
day lives was invented by someone, somewhere, and at some point in history.

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:50.736
And in the vast majority of these cases–and we’ll come on to discuss

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:55.046
several of these in due course–that person would have got a patent.

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:56.566
The best way

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:58.256
to think about what a patent

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:03.806
is, and what it does, is to encourage society to keep inventing things.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:06.486
The idea goes something like this.

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:11.826
An inventor, or a company, might spend many years, and in the

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:16.606
case of a company, vast amounts of money developing an invention.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:21.272
Perhaps it's a new drug, perhaps it’s a new type of computer,

00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:24.776
or it might just be something a bit less life-changing.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:31.056
Let’s say it’s a device that scratches your back at the same time as it plays music.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:36.716
In all of these cases, there has been a large amount of time, effort, and

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:41.226
money, or a combination of all of them, invested in this new invention.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:47.576
The person or the company wouldn’t like the idea that anyone can just come along and copy it.

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:51.786
A patent is the tool that protects them against this.

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:58.726
By the way, if I were American, I’d say ‘patent’, but let’s stick with the British pronunciation.

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:05.016
So, I can apply for this marvellous patent, but what does it actually do?

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:11.476
Contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t actually stop people from copying me.

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:17.366
All it does is say that I have a legal right to go to court if someone else

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:24.136
makes and sells my invention, for a period of typically from 10 to 30 years.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:31.816
So, if I have invented this fantastic back-scratching device that also plays music, if I

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:38.126
manage to get a patent for it, then it doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t make it, it just

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:43.196
means that if you start making it and selling it, then I can take you to court and sue you.

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:49.516
The idea behind patents, the rationale for them existing, is so that the

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:54.566
inventor is given a fixed period of time to allow them to make money from it.

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:58.796
A sort of time-limited monopoly on their invention.

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:06.346
This is both to reward them for their invention, and also so that they can make enough money to

00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:14.246
reinvest in new research, to make new inventions, and for the world to generally be a better place.

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:19.996
The other, related reason for patents is that they actually require

00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:24.356
the inventor, or the company applying for the patent, to provide

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:29.136
very clear instructions about how someone else can make this object.

00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:37.294
So, while on the one hand, it prevents, or at least discourages, other people from copying it

00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:44.694
for a fixed period, once that period of time is up, once it is finished, anyone can copy it

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:51.214
relatively easily because they have the information about how to do so right there in the patent.

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:58.331
This takes us very nicely on to two other points, firstly the origin of the patent,

00:04:58.574 --> 00:05:04.304
and secondly the law about how you can actually apply, and be awarded a patent.

00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:06.564
So, the origins.

00:05:07.164 --> 00:05:11.684
The word ‘patent’ comes from the Latin, patere, which means

00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:15.964
to ‘lay open’, or to make available for public inspection.

00:05:16.754 --> 00:05:19.274
This is exactly what a patent is doing.

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:23.434
It isn’t just saying “I have a special invention and you can’t make

00:05:23.434 --> 00:05:28.634
it”, it’s saying “this is my invention, this is exactly how it works,

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:32.434
but you aren’t allowed to make it for a specified period of time”.

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:36.254
Now, how do you actually get a patent?

00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:40.584
What actually qualifies as being so new and special

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:44.564
that it deserves the legal protection to not be copied?

00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:49.594
The law varies in different countries, and there are different types

00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:54.935
of patents, but for something to be patentable, for you to be able

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:59.214
to get a patent, it generally needs to meet 5 different criteria.

00:06:00.254 --> 00:06:04.864
First, it must fit into a category of something that can be patented.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:06.554
Not everything can.

00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:13.124
New drugs, new tools, new types of software, even new business methods can be patented.

00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:15.884
Art, for example, can’t.

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:21.524
A theory can’t, and nor can any kind of abstract process.

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:24.904
Secondly, it has to be new.

00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:31.334
This might sound obvious, but you can’t patent something that is already known about.

00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:36.144
Thirdly, it needs to be what’s called “inventive”.

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:38.764
It can’t be obvious to someone.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:45.664
For example, you might say that my music-playing back-scratching tool is new and

00:06:45.664 --> 00:06:50.058
inventive, and that you wouldn’t have thought of it, or perhaps you wouldn't.

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:55.658
Fourthly, it needs to be what is defined as ‘useful’, but

00:06:55.828 --> 00:06:59.538
‘useful’ here doesn’t mean what useful normally means.

00:07:00.098 --> 00:07:03.808
It doesn’t mean that it has to be of great benefit for mankind,

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:08.188
otherwise, my music-playing back scratcher might not meet the criteria.

00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:14.898
But rather, that you can show that it works, and it isn’t just an unproven theory.

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:21.398
I couldn’t, for example, patent a helicopter that can travel at 10,000km

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:26.568
an hour if I have no way of explaining how I would actually get it to work.

00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:31.908
It might be ‘useful’ in the traditional sense of the word, but it isn’t

00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:36.358
‘useful’ in the patent sense, because I can’t show how to actually make it.

00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:43.488
And the final requirement,in the US at least, is that it has to be something

00:07:43.548 --> 00:07:48.028
that is new and hasn’t been on sale before, it hasn't been sold before.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:53.688
So, these are the criteria that your invention normally needs to meet.

00:07:54.538 --> 00:07:58.638
As you can see, there is quite a lot of room for interpretation.

00:07:58.758 --> 00:08:00.788
It’s certainly not black and white.

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:06.488
I should add that the process of getting a patent can be time-consuming

00:08:06.508 --> 00:08:11.358
and expensive, involving lots of lawyers and different fees.

00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:16.858
So it’s not the sort of thing that you should do unless you know it’s going to be worth it.

00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:22.788
Indeed, these fees can easily be more than $10,000, and this

00:08:22.788 --> 00:08:26.478
is only to have the legal defence in case someone copies it.

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:33.608
In the vast majority of cases, especially with smaller-time inventors who are convinced

00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:37.758
that their creation is going to make them a millionaire, they end up spending much

00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:42.978
more money on the patent application than their invention ever brings in sales.

00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:48.728
And by vast majority, 97% of patents that are filed

00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:51.918
never actually get back the cost of filing the patent.

00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:58.558
I can remember a colleague from an early job who was convinced that he had invented

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:04.538
an amazing way to stop the wires for your headphones getting tangled in your pocket.

00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:08.928
He spent thousands of dollars on a patent, and I

00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:11.718
don’t think he ever sold a single set of headphones.

00:09:12.358 --> 00:09:18.158
Of course, with the arrival of wireless headphones, I think he’ll probably remain in the 97%.

00:09:19.248 --> 00:09:22.698
But when it comes to patents and making money, there are

00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:25.988
three main categories of people who make money from them.

00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:29.098
Firstly, the lawyers, of course.

00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:33.438
Patent attorneys are expensive, and they will be very happy

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:37.088
to help you file a patent, for a sizable fee, of course.

00:09:38.028 --> 00:09:42.458
Secondly, the large companies who are making groundbreaking discoveries,

00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:46.708
and need to patent their inventions to stop their competitors from

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:50.378
stealing them, or who are buying patents from other companies.

00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:55.338
Companies such as Google, Apple, or big pharmaceutical

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:58.918
companies want to recoup the costs of their research.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:05.204
Other companies buy patents directly from an inventor, if they think they will be able

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:09.694
to make more money from producing the product than the cost of paying for the patent.

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:15.114
A great example of this is for a product that I’m sure you will have

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:19.634
used at one point in your life, and perhaps you are even holding one now.

00:10:20.514 --> 00:10:25.164
A man called Laszlo Biro sold his invention to the Bic company

00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:30.104
for today’s equivalent of $2 million dollars back in 1945.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:31.764
The invention?

00:10:32.384 --> 00:10:35.644
The ballpoint pen, or the biro, or a bic.

00:10:36.264 --> 00:10:42.104
It might have seemed like a good deal for Laszlo Biro, but it was an even better

00:10:42.104 --> 00:10:48.804
deal for Bic, which has gone on to sell over 100 billion pens, and benefited

00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:53.494
greatly from having this early advantage of the patent to sell these pens.

00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:57.944
Now our third category of people who make money from

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:01.214
patents is a category that you might not expect.

00:11:01.884 --> 00:11:05.194
This is the category of the ‘patent troll’.

00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:12.754
Now, a troll is a nasty animal that lives under a bridge and makes people pay for crossing it.

00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:19.334
It has also become the term for an anonymous person who insults people on the internet.

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:24.724
When it comes to patents, a troll is something very different, although

00:11:24.724 --> 00:11:28.894
perhaps nastier than the animal version and the internet version.

00:11:30.204 --> 00:11:35.874
A patent troll is normally an individual or a company who either creates

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:41.434
or buys different patents, with the express intention of threatening

00:11:41.474 --> 00:11:46.224
other people and companies with lawsuits and making money that way.

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:53.304
A patent troll company might own hundreds or thousands of patents, and wait until it sees

00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:58.534
a company with a vaguely similar invention to something that it already has a patent for.

00:11:59.374 --> 00:12:03.144
It sends this company threatening letters, saying that they have

00:12:03.154 --> 00:12:06.774
infringed on its patent, and that it will take them to court.

00:12:07.964 --> 00:12:14.274
The costs of going to court for a patent dispute are typically anywhere from 1 to 5

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:20.784
million dollars, in the US that is, and so these companies will typically settle, they

00:12:20.784 --> 00:12:27.224
will agree to not go to court, and they will agree to pay the patent troll to go away.

00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:33.774
Even if they know that they might win in court, they would rather pay a few hundred

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:38.794
thousand dollars and avoid going to court than know that they would spend several

00:12:38.804 --> 00:12:43.714
million and have a court process that would take months or years to complete.

00:12:44.574 --> 00:12:47.594
You might think, is this really a problem?

00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.264
In the US it certainly is.

00:12:50.497 --> 00:12:57.614
Patent trolls are estimated to cost US businesses 29 billion dollars every single year.

00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:03.994
In the EU patent trolls aren’t quite so much of a problem, because the legal

00:13:03.994 --> 00:13:09.304
system requires the side that loses to pay the other side’s legal fees.

00:13:10.084 --> 00:13:15.514
In the US, this isn’t the norm, and each side has to pay its own legal fees.

00:13:15.974 --> 00:13:21.674
This means that there is a much bigger disincentive to go to court in the US because

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:28.374
even if you win the court case, you’ll still end up having to pay millions in legal fees.

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:33.244
I should add that there are movements to try to change the legislation

00:13:33.484 --> 00:13:37.174
around patent trolls in the US, but they are moving pretty slowly.

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:43.184
By now I hope you will have a decent idea of what patents do, why

00:13:43.204 --> 00:13:46.874
they can be useful, and what some of the issues with patents can be.

00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:52.314
Now it’s time to explore the question of the justification for patents,

00:13:52.484 --> 00:13:57.604
and if there is ever a right to essentially waive the patent, to

00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:01.834
say “this time it doesn’t count, and anyone can copy my invention”.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:06.960
For things like new software, and–dare I say it, my

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.730
musical back-scratcher –there isn’t really a case for it.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.680
People and companies have invested thousands of hours and millions of

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.560
dollars in creating this invention, so it is only fair, the argument

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.240
goes, that they are allowed to be the first ones to benefit from it.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.540
But what about when there is something that is so beneficial to mankind that

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.810
people are dying because only one, or a handful of, companies can produce it?

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.680
To give you a specific example, the COVID-19 vaccines.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.940
As it stands, these companies that invested in

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.100
developing the vaccines have the right to patent them.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.560
What is actually in the vaccines, and the manufacture of them is the

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.640
relatively easy part, and companies all over the world could start to produce

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.490
vaccines for their unvaccinated population and start the vaccination process.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.040
But they legally aren’t allowed to do it, so they have to wait.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:16.070
There is pressure from a variety of public health campaigners for governments to waive these

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:22.720
patents, for them to allow other companies to copy the vaccine, to speed up the process.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.390
At the time of writing this episode, the UK is blocking this, as is the US.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.700
Of course, from a legal point of view, these pharmaceutical companies are doing nothing wrong.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.920
AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are supplying the vaccine at

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.240
the price it costs them to make it, they aren’t making a profit.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.910
But they have evidently invested a lot of money in developing it, so should they be

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:55.200
allowed to have a monopoly on its production, even though from a public health point of

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.550
view there would be a large benefit from allowing it to be produced all over the world?

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.150
As it stands, many countries especially in the developing world, in the global south,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:12.820
will have to wait years for COVID vaccines, despite the technology already existing.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.630
For those that say that the patents should be waived, the argument is

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.050
that this is a global health problem, not a national health problem.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:29.030
A country isn’t safe until the world is safe, and thus there is a strong incentive to

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:35.350
temporarily change the legislation to allow the manufacture of vaccines to be sped up.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:41.980
It should be said that just because something is invented it doesn’t need to be patented.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:49.490
Indeed one of the first polio vaccines, which was first used in 1954, wasn’t patented.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:56.750
In an interview a year later, its creator, a man called Jonas Salk, was asked about it.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.850
Why was there no patent for this vaccine that was going to go on to save tens of millions

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:08.060
of lives, and could no doubt have made him and his company hundreds of millions of dollars?

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:15.220
The interviewer asked him who owned the vaccine, and he responded, “Well, the people, I would say.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.900
There is no patent.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.590
Could you patent the sun?”

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.080
Salk isn’t the only example of someone who has, in effect, donated

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:28.690
their invention to the world, allowing anyone to use it and produce it.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.590
The World Wide Web, which was created by Tim Berners-Lee, has no patent.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:40.170
Matches, which were first invented in the 1820s, had no patent.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.050
The emoticon, an invention that you perhaps might consider

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.350
less important, also had no patent, as did the karaoke machine.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.360
These are all inventions that were given to the world

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.260
free of charge, for anyone to start making right away.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.530
And, so the argument goes, COVID vaccines should follow their lead.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.520
Patents might sound dry and boring, unless you are a lawyer, but

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.150
when we unpack them, I think you’ll agree that they are fascinating.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:17.240
Through patents, we ask ourselves questions about what ownership actually

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.390
means, what actually is an invention, and how should we incentivise

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.350
people to invent new technologies and create medicines that save lives.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.040
Patents exist, theoretically speaking, to help all of us.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.580
They are, of course, imperfect.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.320
The business of patent trolls is a dirty one indeed, and in many cases an

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.550
invention isn’t just one person, or one company, but tens, hundreds, or

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.770
thousands of people around the world all working towards a common goal.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.350
The question we need to ask ourselves is whether there are times that an invention

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.870
is too important to be patented, and if so, whether now is one of those times.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:11.900
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the mysterious, but fascinating, world of Patents.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.710
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.970
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.060
I know that we have some lawyers as members, and I wonder if we have any patent lawyers.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.470
If so, I would love to know what your professional opinion of this is.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.430
And even if you aren’t a lawyer, I would love to know what you think.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.050
Should the companies making the COVID-19 vaccines waive their

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.310
patents on them, and allow for them to be mass-produced by anyone?

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.770
Let’s get the conversation started.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.450

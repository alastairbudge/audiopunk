Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.020
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.060
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:24.639
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a period

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.270
of British history that is perhaps too recent to really call it “history”.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.670
It is the story of “Cool Britannia”, when 1990s Britain saw a cultural

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.979
awakening, involving politics, rock stars, artists, fashion designers,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.070
and a supposed rebirth of the Swinging Sixties of 1960s London.

00:00:46.953 --> 00:00:49.433
OK then, Cool Britannia.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:56.203
The March 1997 edition of Vanity Fair magazine had a provocative cover.

00:00:56.983 --> 00:01:03.813
It featured the lead singer of Oasis, Liam Gallagher, and his girlfriend, the actress Patsy Kensit.

00:01:04.783 --> 00:01:08.503
The pair lay in bed, staring up at the camera, with

00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:12.263
Patsy Kensit in particular not wearing many clothes.

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:17.733
The duvet cover on the bed was a Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom.

00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:23.583
And the headline on the front cover was “London Swings Again”.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:32.913
The magazine then went on to dedicate 27 pages to a celebration of all things British, informing

00:01:32.923 --> 00:01:38.133
its predominantly American audience about a new cultural renaissance that was happening

00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:43.573
across the pond, in Britain, a movement that would come to be known as “Cool Britannia”.

00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:50.013
It was a movement that united musicians, fashion designers, restaurateurs,

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:55.643
and even politicians, the magazine proclaimed, and was billed as a revival

00:01:55.673 --> 00:02:00.973
of the cultural phenomenon of the Swinging Sixties, London in the 1960s.

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:03.403
So, where did this come from?

00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:05.183
How did it get started?

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:10.703
And to what extent did it really happen, and to what extent was it

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:15.633
a load of fluff pushed by politicians, spin doctors and journalists?

00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:19.333
As always, it’s helpful to start with a bit of background.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:25.653
The 1990s were a period of seismic political change for

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:29.343
Britain, both on a domestic and international level.

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:34.273
Margaret Thatcher stepped down as Prime Minister after almost

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:38.473
12 years in power, ending the so-called “Thatcherite” years.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:42.763
In November 1989, the Berlin Wall had come down,

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:47.936
and in 1991 the Soviet Union was officially no more.

00:02:48.663 --> 00:02:53.723
The American political scientist Francis Fukuyama proclaimed “the end of

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:58.883
history”, as it seemed clear that after almost 100 years of experimentation,

00:02:59.383 --> 00:03:04.833
capitalism and democracy had emerged as a superior system to communism.

00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:11.993
Back in the UK, in 1994 Tony Blair became leader of the British

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:17.023
Labour Party, and proudly announced that this was “New Labour”.

00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:23.383
No longer would the Labour party be the party of flat caps, coal miners,

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:28.053
and factory workers, predominantly in the industrial north of the country.

00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:36.673
No longer was it all about trade unions; he was about business, creativity, and doing whatever

00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:43.953
needed to be done to position Britain as an example to follow of a modern, dynamic global power.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:49.173
He became Prime Minister 3 years later in a landslide victory against the

00:03:49.173 --> 00:03:54.323
Conservatives, achieving the greatest electoral success in Labour party history.

00:03:55.843 --> 00:04:00.313
Now, you may know Tony Blair today for his involvement

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:04.033
in the Iraq War, and for cosying up to George W.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:10.553
Bush, but it is hard to overstate how popular he was when he was first elected.

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:16.273
He was a breath of fresh air, he seemed different to other politicians.

00:04:17.263 --> 00:04:22.303
For starters, he was young, only 43 when he became Prime Minister.

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:29.953
His main opponent, John Major, wasn’t that much older, only 54 at the

00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:34.673
time of the election, but he seemed like he was of a different generation.

00:04:35.423 --> 00:04:43.173
John Major had grey hair, big glasses, wore business suits and gave dull press conferences.

00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:48.193
Tony Blair didn’t have a speck of grey, he talked about how he used

00:04:48.193 --> 00:04:51.983
to have long hair when he was younger, how he played in a band.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:58.273
He would be photographed playing electric guitar and would happily talk about his favourite bands.

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:04.523
He was even mentioned by Noel Gallagher of Oasis at the Brit Awards ceremony

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:10.113
in 1996 as being a person who was giving hope to young people in the country.

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:14.123
He was, dare I say it, “cool”.

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:21.053
And as any teenager knows, the ultimate barometer of how cool

00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:25.893
or uncool you are is who you can get to come to your party.

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:32.893
And so it was that on the 30th of July, 1997, just a few months

00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:38.123
after his landslide electoral victory, Tony Blair decided to throw

00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:42.853
a party at 10 Downing Street, the residence of the Prime Minister.

00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:51.183
But this wouldn’t be a normal party with political allies and grandees from the world of business.

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:58.003
Tony Blair decided to invite a “who’s who” of British cultural talent.

00:05:59.183 --> 00:06:04.713
Noel Gallagher, the lead singer of Oasis who had endorsed him the year before, was there, and

00:06:04.883 --> 00:06:10.533
was photographed, champagne flute in hand, sharing a joke with the new British Prime Minister.

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:16.993
He was followed by people from the world of film and comedy, like Eddie Izzard and Lenny

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:22.973
Henry, fashion designers such as Vivienne Westwood, and an extensive list of celebrities.

00:06:24.003 --> 00:06:28.903
For the first time ever, really, people from the world of film and

00:06:28.913 --> 00:06:32.813
music were happy to be associated with a sitting Prime Minister.

00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:38.873
And the soundtrack for the evening, which was reportedly playing

00:06:38.893 --> 00:06:43.423
practically on repeat, was D:Ream’s “things can only get better”.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:47.163
There was a sense of optimism in the air.

00:06:47.493 --> 00:06:51.263
Things were getting better, at least for the people at the party.

00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:59.663
After the deregulation of the late 1980s and early 1990s, London had become a global financial

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:05.283
hub to rival New York, with hundreds of billions of dollars flowing through the city every day.

00:07:05.783 --> 00:07:11.373
The economy was back on its feet after a recession at the start of the 1990s.

00:07:11.823 --> 00:07:15.893
England had even almost won the Euro 1996 tournament.

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:20.943
Well, not really almost won, they were knocked out in the semi finals by

00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:26.003
old enemies Germany, but there was a national sense that we could have won.

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:31.823
And on a cultural level, Britain was punching above its weight.

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:36.603
Musically, Britpop had been a great success, with

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:40.749
bands such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp topping the charts.

00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:46.353
The Spice Girls were hugely commercially successful, and they also seemed to

00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:51.693
be talented, smart business women who were in control of their own destiny.

00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:56.883
There was a new generation of British artists, the so-called “Young

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:01.443
British Artists”, which included figures like Tracy Emin and Damian Hirst.

00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:08.833
And the centre of all this activity, where most of it was happening, was London, the capital.

00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:15.123
Rock stars were buying up houses in trendy Primrose Hill, new restaurants

00:08:15.143 --> 00:08:18.723
and clubs were opening up every night, it was the place to be.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.633
Of course, eager young creative minds flocked to the city.

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:28.723
Young artists, young writers, musicians, and people who just

00:08:28.723 --> 00:08:32.563
wanted to be a part of what felt like it could be the next 1960s.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.413
Compared to now at least, the city was affordable.

00:08:38.353 --> 00:08:43.143
As an art student you could live in a flat in central London and pay your rent

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:49.703
with a part-time job in a pub or a gallery; it was a far cry from today where rents

00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:55.343
are sky-high and nobody can afford to live in those areas on a student budget.

00:08:56.643 --> 00:09:05.243
To give you some sense of perspective, the average house price in London in 1996 was £79,000.

00:09:05.903 --> 00:09:15.163
Today it is £720,000, an almost tenfold increase, and rents have increased at a comparable level.

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:23.883
This affordability, increasing cultural activity and melting pot of creative talent, this all

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:30.223
combined to form the perfect storm for what journalists would call “Cool Britannia”, a sort

00:09:30.223 --> 00:09:37.523
of cultural revival both of the London of the 1960s and a celebration of all things British.

00:09:38.303 --> 00:09:43.053
The British flag, the Union Jack, was suddenly cool again.

00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:47.063
You heard at the start of the episode that Noel Gallagher

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:50.483
of Oasis was photographed in a Union Jack duvet.

00:09:51.253 --> 00:09:57.973
Geri Halliwell, Ginger Spice from The Spice Girls, wore a Union Jack dress during the 1997 Brit

00:09:57.973 --> 00:10:04.853
Awards, and the lead singer of The Smiths, Morrisey would pull out Union Jack flags at concerts.

00:10:05.613 --> 00:10:12.403
There was this new sense of British identity, all centred around this idea of being proud

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:18.513
of British culture and the music, art and really everything that was coming out of Britain.

00:10:19.483 --> 00:10:20.743
Or…was there?

00:10:22.203 --> 00:10:27.783
Ever since this period, people have asked themselves how much substance there was to

00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:34.483
it and questioned the extent to which this was a genuine bottom up movement or whether

00:10:34.493 --> 00:10:40.703
it was one manufactured and encouraged by politicians, journalists and spin doctors.

00:10:42.113 --> 00:10:48.213
The term “Cool Britannia”, which is a pun on the British patriotic song “Rule

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:53.383
Britannia”, was encouraged mainly by journalists and politicians; it wasn’t a

00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:57.833
phrase that you would hear Noel Gallagher or Damian Hirst using about themselves.

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:05.110
It was a politically useful term, and it certainly seems that the main beneficiaries of the

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:11.430
so-called “Cool Britannia” movement were New Labour politicians, in particular, Tony Blair.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:17.190
It gave him a sense of legitimacy and an appeal to a section of

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.060
the population that might not necessarily have voted for Labour.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.570
It was also just good business.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:32.620
The UK is, objectively speaking, a cultural powerhouse, and the so-called creative industries

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:40.500
are worth €150 billion annually to the UK, making up around 6% of the British economy.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.810
Celebrating the burgeoning creative industries was

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.290
simply a sensible economic choice for the country.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:53.110
It showed that there was more to Britain than a divided, dual economy, with

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.760
manufacturing and manual labour on one side and bankers and lawyers on the other.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.480
There was a third way, an outlet that allowed creative

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.560
talent to flourish and generate huge value for the country.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.460
But, how much of this value did the average person in Britain actually receive?

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.300
Yes, there was great music, art, and culture, but this was

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:23.330
concentrated in the capital, and really only in tiny pockets of London.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:29.960
And to state the obvious, life in 1990s Britain was not all champagne

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.850
parties at Downing Street, football tournaments and a booming economy.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:40.510
Perhaps most famously there was the racially motivated murder of a black teenage boy

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.640
called Stephen Lawrence and the failure of the police to properly investigate it.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:52.660
There were race riots in London, and outside of London, especially in former industrial areas in the

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:58.720
north of the country, few people felt the supposed benefits of Britain’s booming cultural economy.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.840
According to its critics, Cool Britannia did very little to address the systemic problems facing the

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.470
country: failing schools, long hospital waiting lists, high unemployment, these were the very real

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:19.120
problems that Tony Blair should have dedicated his time to, not quaffing champagne with rock stars.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.570
But with time, these voices seemed to fade.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.610
And what we are left with is the music, photos and memories of the period,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.810
and it is a period which many people look back on with great nostalgia.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.610
The pictures of Noel Gallagher and Geri Halliwell, the songs and the stories,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:47.630
these are some of the most powerful images that we have from that period, and we

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.290
humans have a tendency to look back on the past with a sense of hope and optimism.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:14:00.390
And perhaps one of the reasons that many British people are so nostalgic for this period is because

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.730
it might just be the last in which there was a strong sense of shared national culture and identity.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.460
The 2000s saw the arrival of social networks, ubiquitous

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.760
internet and hyper personalisation of interests.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:22.350
Two people of the same age could have completely separate cultural lives in a way that

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:28.940
they couldn’t in a pre-Internet era, like in the 1990s, the “Cool Britannia” years.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:35.380
Things like which band was number one in the musical charts was an important weekly

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.490
announcement, the news came out at a set time on the TV every evening or in the morning

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:47.540
newspapers, people’s experience of the world was much more homogenous than it is now,

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.030
when we are constantly connected to the global culture of our choice via our smartphones.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.900
So, the argument goes, Cool Britannia was the last big shared cultural movement, and

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.230
that’s the reason why there is often such a nostalgia for this among the people who

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.590
lived through it, either the musicians and artists, such as Noel Gallagher and Tracy

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:17.690
Emin, or people like me who were children and teenagers at the time, and grew up with

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.150
some sense that this was a time of optimism and change but not truly understanding why.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.630
So, to wrap things up, Cool Britania was a defining period in modern British history.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:37.280
A period in which bands made great music, politicians seemed different, London was

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.410
cool again, and anything seemed possible, even England winning a football tournament.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.550
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cool Britannia, a period

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.710
of recent British history that you may well remember yourself.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.220
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.710
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.160
Did you visit Britain in the 1990s?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.900
What are your memories of it?

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.390
Are there similar cultural renaissances that you would like us to make an episode about?

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.130
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.910

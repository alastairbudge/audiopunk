Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.460
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.820
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:30.010
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we’re going to be talking about the history of dueling, the practice

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.610
of two individuals settling an argument by fighting in physical combat and sometimes, to the death.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.450
In this episode we’ll meet Romans, Vikings, Germanic tribes, Medieval

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.810
knights, Renaissance thinkers, Queen Victoria and even an American president.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.980
It is a fascinating story, and I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:57.785
OK then, duelling.

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:02.655
Now, there are probably people you have come across in your

00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:06.795
life, people you have known, who you haven’t particularly liked.

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:11.265
Perhaps you’ve had an argument with them, you’ve had a disagreement with them.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.275
Perhaps you might even have got in a fight.

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:18.485
It’s ok, we're all human beings, these things happen.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:26.575
But you have probably not ever felt the need to challenge them to a duel, to meet them at a

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:34.745
specified time and place, bringing swords or guns, and fighting until one of you surrenders or dies.

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:36.635
At least I hope you haven’t.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:43.135
And you might well think that this seems all very archaic, something from so

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:48.595
long ago that it’s hard for us to understand, but let me tell you that if you are

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:55.625
older than 55, you were actually alive when the last duel took place in Europe.

00:01:56.565 --> 00:02:03.405
If that surprises you, it might surprise you even more to find out that one of the men who took

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:10.365
part in this duel was a candidate for the President of France, a man called Gaston Defferre,

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:19.385
who beat another French politician, a man named René Ribière in a duel in France in 1967.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:25.635
And if you don’t believe me, there’s even a video of the two men duelling on YouTube.

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:33.015
This might have been the last known duel in Europe, but the history of duelling is long,

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:40.825
sometimes bloody, and varied; people fought for very different reasons during different periods.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:46.035
Of course, people fighting each other is as old as time.

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:53.185
Going back to Homer, Livy, and even the Bible, there is the concept of “champion

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:59.675
warfare”, where two opposing armies would each propose a single, strong soldier.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:05.775
These two soldiers would fight each other instead of the entire armies

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:10.545
fighting each other, and that would be a way to resolve a military dispute.

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:16.885
Think David and Goliath in the Bible, or if you need a more modern

00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:21.775
cultural reference, think of the start of the film Troy, where Brad

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:27.325
Pitt as Achilles runs up and kills a very big champion from Thessaly.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:36.165
If we fast forward a few thousand years, we see the concept of one to one fighting starting

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:43.055
to emerge as a way to settle disputes between two people, unfortunately usually men.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:49.935
The word “duel” didn’t enter the English language until the 17th century, but

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:56.505
in early Medieval Europe these “duels” had become quite prevalent in society.

00:03:57.255 --> 00:04:02.445
And, there was a very specific term for it, “Trial by combat”.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:07.605
See, duelling was a legally accepted way to resolve

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:13.205
arguments, it was an alternative to a legal process, a trial.

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.685
The logic goes something like this.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:21.425
It was pretty difficult to find evidence of a crime, so

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:25.335
it’s hard to say whether someone is innocent or guilty.

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:32.705
If one person has accused another of committing a crime and that person does not admit that it

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:39.975
was them, you can’t collect DNA or look at CCTV, we are talking about over a 1000 years ago.

00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:46.945
There wasn’t even street lighting so if the crime took place at night probably nobody saw it anyway!

00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:50.275
But there is someone who sees everything.

00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:57.045
God is all powerful and everything that happens in the world is because God wills it to happen.

00:04:57.715 --> 00:05:03.525
You can’t ask God to reveal the truth about a crime, but if the two men

00:05:03.525 --> 00:05:09.085
fight, God will determine the outcome of the fight and justice will be done.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:17.415
This practice was enshrined in Germanic legal codes - it meant that “justice”, or

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:23.495
at least theoretical justice, could be achieved more quickly than some complicated

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:29.035
legal process that was unlikely to ever result in any kind of resolution.

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:37.039
Medieval France, Germany, and even England saw duelling as an integral part of the legal system.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.739
It tended to be restricted only to free people, though, so in a feudal

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:48.689
system this limited it to knights and those at the top of society.

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.499
A peasant couldn’t challenge a knight, and there would be no need for a knight to challenge

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:01.279
a peasant, because the word of the knight would always be trusted above that of the peasant.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:08.839
How the duels actually worked in practice varied greatly, but contrary to what

00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:14.059
you might think the idea wasn’t always to kill the other person in the duel.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.299
One person just needed to surrender, or give up, meaning that they had lost.

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.639
The person who lost the duel would be punished according to the legal

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.069
system, which would often mean that they would be executed in any case.

00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:32.959
So, it worked something like this.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.209
There would be a situation in which one person had accused

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.519
the other of having committed some offence against them.

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:46.029
An agreement couldn’t be reached, and they would be ordered to fight a duel.

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:51.809
Alternatively, one knight could challenge another to a duel by throwing

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:56.719
down his glove, which is where we get the term “to throw down the gauntlet”.

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.679
To throw down the gauntlet means to challenge someone to something,

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.959
and similarly to “take up the gauntlet” means to accept the challenge.

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:16.099
No matter how the duel had been agreed and arranged, the duellists would be required to pay for the

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:23.049
organisation of the duel - the judge, the seating, all of the logistics to do with its organisation.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.209
It was, after all, a trial open to the public.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.509
Then the two men would fight each other, typically with swords and shields, and the

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:40.709
duel would be over when one person gave up, they surrendered, or when they were killed.

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:47.159
The person who gave up or was killed would be considered guilty, and the winner innocent.

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:52.789
By the 13th century, however, duelling as a way to settle

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:56.689
legal disputes had already started going out of fashion.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.539
For starters, the church didn’t like it.

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:06.019
It was like the duellists were challenging God to spring into action and

00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:11.489
sort out trivial problems on Earth, daring God to choose the right person.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:17.539
What’s more, important knights were being killed, and kings and queens

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:22.679
who needed their knights to, well, be knights, to fight in real battles

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:27.279
didn’t want them being injured or dying in small legal disputes.

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:32.879
It lasted for several centuries though, and this concept of Trial

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:38.259
by Combat had also been exported further north, to Scandinavia.

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:45.799
In Medieval Scandinavia it had been turned into a concept called “holmgang”, where one

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:52.229
person could challenge another to a fight, regardless of that person’s status in society.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:58.149
It was slightly different to the original, and it worked something like this.

00:08:59.469 --> 00:09:07.229
Firstly, these holmgang were fought in a specific location known as a holm, or a small island.

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:14.829
The word for this Scandinavian duel, this Viking duel is thought to have come from

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:22.349
the Old Norse word for a small island, holm, so “holmgang” means “going to the holm.”

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:30.209
The holms were a controlled space where both opponents would step into a small fenced off square.

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:36.619
They would then take turns to hit each other, normally with a sword or an axe.

00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:43.679
They were allowed shields, and each person had a ‘shield bearer’, a person who would

00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:48.909
give them a new shield when theirs got destroyed, up to a limit of three shields.

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:57.049
If all three of their shields were destroyed, the dualists had to use their weapons as a shield.

00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:01.409
If blood was drawn, if one person was killed, or if

00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:04.959
someone ran out of the arena, they lost the Holmgang.

00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:11.049
Like the “trial by combat” in mainland Europe, holmgangs also fell

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:15.029
out of favour, a bit earlier, in fact, in the early 11th century.

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:21.469
Duelling was, to state the obvious, not an effective way to actually

00:10:21.469 --> 00:10:26.149
solve legal disputes, because it didn’t tell you anything about who should

00:10:26.149 --> 00:10:30.219
actually have won the dispute, it just revealed who was better at fighting.

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:36.159
So, duelling for legal reasons went out of the window, it stopped, and

00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:41.777
duelling moved onto its second phase, duelling for the purposes of honour.

00:10:42.729 --> 00:10:47.569
Of course, honour was not a new concept, or one restricted to a

00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:51.859
particular period in history or indeed a particular part of the world.

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:58.299
Pretty much every society has some concept of honour, but it was during

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:03.269
the Renaissance in Europe that honour became the main reason to duel.

00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:07.579
“Trial by combat” was partly based on honour, of course.

00:11:07.719 --> 00:11:11.389
If I said that you had insulted my wife or killed my

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:15.799
brother, I would regain my honour by killing you in a duel.

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:21.689
But the difference was that in the “trial by combat” system, if I killed

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:27.029
you in the duel, this was a legal way of saying “yes, Alastair was right”.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:32.679
But if you killed me or I surrendered, legally I would be punished,

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:36.999
because my loss in the duel would mean that I had been lying.

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:40.099
Anyway, back to the Renaissance.

00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:44.189
There was an increasing concept of the importance of honour

00:11:44.189 --> 00:11:47.879
as something that needed to be preserved at all costs.

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:55.769
Any insult on a man’s honour needed to be dealt with, and an effective and popular way of

00:11:55.899 --> 00:12:01.839
restoring your honour would be by challenging the person who had offended you to a duel.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:08.909
The rules of the duel were similar to those of trial by combat, but because there

00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:15.849
was no legal rationale for the duel, they tended to be more private affairs.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:23.539
A time and a place would be set, a doctor would normally be requested to attend, and each

00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:29.779
duellist would choose a second, a man who would take his place if he wasn’t able to duel.

00:12:30.489 --> 00:12:34.889
That person was also responsible for things like carrying spare

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:39.149
weapons, and ensuring that the fight was honourable and true.

00:12:39.869 --> 00:12:44.489
But another responsibility of the second which is less well-known

00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:48.519
was to try to stop the duel from happening in the first place.

00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:52.209
See, it all comes back to the concept of honour.

00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:56.439
If two men accept to fight each other, that they are literally prepared

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:00.679
to die for their honour, then it shows that they are honourable men.

00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:07.449
They don’t actually need to fight each other, and many duels were called off, they were cancelled,

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:14.439
after the seconds had managed to arrange between each other, negotiating on behalf of the duellists,

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:21.349
for the argument to be settled in a way in which both men thought their honour could be restored.

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:27.839
Indeed, as a celebrated Italian master of fencing, of sword-fighting, used

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:33.679
to say “It is not the sword or the pistol that kills, but the seconds.”

00:13:34.819 --> 00:13:38.899
Of course, sometimes there was no way of settling a dispute,

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:43.339
and a duel would be the only way for honour to be restored.

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:48.019
The weapons needed to be agreed in advance, and both

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:52.249
duellists, both men needed to fight using the same weapon.

00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:57.799
Swords were considered to be more gentlemanly, but in the

00:13:57.829 --> 00:14:01.889
18th and 19th centuries pistols were increasingly used.

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:09.719
Swords tended to result in fewer fatal duels, fewer deaths, because after blood

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:14.849
had been drawn, after one person had been cut, they would typically surrender.

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:19.459
This was about honour after all, it wasn’t about chopping someone’s head

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:25.289
off - the duellists thought of themselves as civilised men not gladiators.

00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:30.629
And indeed there are records of men who would duel all the time.

00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:37.039
There were two French officers in Napoleon’s army, one named François

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:41.989
Fournier-Sarlovèze and the other named Pierre Dupont de l’Étang, who are

00:14:41.989 --> 00:14:47.789
reported to have duelled at least 30 times over the course of 19 years.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:54.919
They even drew up a contract to ensure that they kept on fighting whenever they could.

00:14:55.849 --> 00:15:01.919
This contract stated that, firstly, every time they were within a hundred miles

00:15:01.939 --> 00:15:08.309
from each other - about 160 km, that they needed to meet in the middle and fight.

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:12.839
Secondly, if one couldn’t meet in the middle because he

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:16.809
had army duties, the other needed to come and meet him.

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:23.489
Thirdly, the only reason to not accept to fight was if they had military duties.

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:29.729
And finally that there was no alteration, no changes possible, to this contract.

00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:33.419
And it certainly doesn’t sound like they were friends.

00:15:33.809 --> 00:15:38.189
In their last duel, Dupont, one of the officers, ran

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:42.109
his sword right through Fournier-Sarlovèze’s neck.

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:48.239
Duelling had also been exported to the United States of America, which

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:53.299
embraced this old European tradition, especially its army officers.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:58.989
So much so, in fact, that George Washington condemned it because

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:03.959
so many of his officers were being killed needlessly in duels.

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:08.069
And duelling went all the way to the White House.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:15.459
In 1806, the future 7th president of the United States, Andrew Jackson was accused

00:16:15.459 --> 00:16:21.749
by a fellow plantation owner of going back on his word about a bet on a horse race.

00:16:22.689 --> 00:16:29.179
This plantation owner, a man named Charles Dickinson, had also insulted Jackson’s wife.

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:35.359
It was too much, and on May 30th of 1806 the two men met

00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:39.659
in Kentucky, complete with pistols and their seconds.

00:16:41.109 --> 00:16:46.516
On the signal from the seconds to fire their guns, Dickinson pulled the trigger.

00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:53.496
The bullet from his gun went straight into Jackson’s chest, narrowly missing his heart.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:17:00.726
Jackson managed to not fall over, and instead pulled his hand to cover the wound

00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:07.716
and stop the bleeding, pulled his pistol up, took aim and shot Dickinson dead.

00:17:09.126 --> 00:17:13.736
And there was even a sitting vice-president, Aaron Burr, who killed

00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:18.156
his former Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, in a duel.

00:17:19.426 --> 00:17:25.506
The two men reportedly had disliked each other intensely for a long time, and this

00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:31.096
battle to the death was simply the culmination of a long-standing political rivalry.

00:17:32.376 --> 00:17:37.186
If this is ringing some distant bell for you, yes this Alexander

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:42.386
Hamilton is the one on which the popular musical “Hamilton” is based.

00:17:43.346 --> 00:17:45.046
But back to our story.

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:50.416
Society, both in the United States and Europe, was turning against duelling.

00:17:51.096 --> 00:17:57.686
In Britain, Queen Victoria declared in 1844 that any military officer found to

00:17:57.686 --> 00:18:02.616
have fought in a duel would lose their pension and be kicked out of the army.

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:08.186
And although there are some records of duels in Britain in the mid

00:18:08.216 --> 00:18:13.186
19th century, the practice had all but died out during the second half.

00:18:14.206 --> 00:18:20.396
In continental Europe it took slightly longer, but the events of the two World Wars in

00:18:20.396 --> 00:18:27.296
the early 20th century were enough, firstly to put some real perspective on the fragility

00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:34.006
of life and more practically to reduce the number of “honourable” male army officers

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:39.396
who had previously engaged in duelling because, well, they were killed in a real war.

00:18:40.476 --> 00:18:43.526
And the legacy of duelling is something that is alive

00:18:43.566 --> 00:18:47.946
and well, in poems, literature, and now films and TV.

00:18:48.726 --> 00:18:55.126
If you’ve read much Tolstoy, Chekhov, or Maupassant, you’ll find duels throughout the stories.

00:18:55.816 --> 00:19:01.246
You’ll also find duelling in the works of Alexander Pushkin, and if you’ve ever thought,

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:07.566
“I love Pushkin but I’ve read all of his books”, well perhaps if he hadn’t been killed

00:19:07.576 --> 00:19:13.106
in a duel at the age of 37 then there would be some more Pushkin for you to read.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:21.846
To you or me it might seem absurd that two normal adults would decide that literally the

00:19:21.906 --> 00:19:27.996
only way to solve an argument was to try to kill, or at least badly hurt, each other.

00:19:28.886 --> 00:19:33.246
But for a large part of history, this was how society worked.

00:19:34.336 --> 00:19:38.766
Whether it was for the purposes of legally resolving a dispute

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:42.646
or for regaining your honour, a duel was the way to do it.

00:19:43.596 --> 00:19:49.786
Fortunately, we’ve decided that lawyers might be expensive, and it isn’t much fun to be

00:19:49.936 --> 00:19:56.296
insulted in public, but hiring a lawyer or turning the other cheek when someone insults you

00:19:56.506 --> 00:20:02.076
is certainly preferable to being shot in the chest or stabbed in the neck with a large sword.

00:20:04.226 --> 00:20:08.876
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Duelling.

00:20:09.186 --> 00:20:12.786
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:16.666
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:20.766
I normally ask whether you have any personal experience with the

00:20:20.776 --> 00:20:24.726
subject of the episode, but I guess that isn’t so relevant now.

00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:30.656
Although if you have ever fought in a duel, I absolutely do want to know everything about it.

00:20:31.256 --> 00:20:35.406
For those of you who haven’t fought in a duel, and I have to confess that

00:20:35.606 --> 00:20:40.346
I am also in this category, I would love to know your thoughts on duelling.

00:20:40.356 --> 00:20:43.226
Why do you think it went on for as long as it did?

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:47.966
Why do intelligent people, and intelligent societies, do

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:52.216
things that we now look back on as completely, well, mad?

00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:54.116
I would love to know.

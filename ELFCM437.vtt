Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.389
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.919
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:22.889
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.240
perhaps the greatest fraud and deception in recent medical history.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.659
This is the story of the 1998 article in the medical journal The

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:38.050
Lancet, which made a link between a common vaccine and autism, and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.460
how its effects continue to be felt around the world to this very day.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.339
We have a lot to deal with in this story, so let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:55.800
Imesi-Ile is a small rural town in southern Nigeria.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.350
And in the middle of the 20th century, it was in trouble.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.330
Children were dropping like flies, with only one in two reaching their fifth birthday.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.949
There were all sorts of reasons for this, but the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.909
major one was a disease the villagers called “èèyi”.

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.040
In English, the name is “measles”, but you might know it

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.359
as “il morbillo”, “la rougeole”, “Masern”, or “sarampión”.

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.760
It’s a disease that causes red spots to form, which then spread all over the body.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.970
It affects children more than adults, and compared to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.013
some other diseases it's not always particularly deadly.

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:49.269
Now, the actual mortality rate from measles is both variable and debated, but it’s

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.009
estimated to be anywhere between 0.2% under normal conditions in countries with

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:00.459
good healthcare systems going up to 25% for children suffering from malnutrition.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.619
What is not debated, though, is that it is incredibly infectious, with the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.039
average person who has measles infecting somewhere between 12 and 18 other

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:17.579
people, so even if it might not be the most dangerous and deadly of diseases,

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.999
the fact that it is so contagious means that it spreads like wildfire.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.299
And in the town of Imesi-Ile, there seemed to be nothing

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.589
that could be done to rid the children of the disease.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.809
That was, until 1960, when a British doctor who had been posted there

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.809
suggested to trial a new and as of then untested type of vaccination.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:53.569
One small jab, a quick injection, and a child would be protected, with their

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.119
probability of getting measles drastically reduced, and the probability of dying

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:04.169
from it if they were unlucky enough to also get it also dramatically reduced.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.619
That was the theory at least.

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.499
The British doctor really believed that it would work, so much

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:16.239
so, in fact, that he included his own four children in the trial.

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.679
Fortunately, it worked, and measles was stopped in its tracks.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.549
Soon the red spots vanished, and the children stopped dying.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.579
In fact, the village started to have a very different problem to deal with.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:42.069
The population started growing at 9% per year, and before long the community health service switched

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.319
its focus from trying to stop children from dying to implementing a family planning programme, to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.559
encourage the families of Imesi-Ile to have fewer children to stop this explosion in the population.

00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.369
Shortly after this successful trial in Imesi-Ile, the vaccine

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.069
was approved and adopted by countries all over the world.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.240
All of a sudden, just like in this Nigerian village, children stopped getting this

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.610
disease, and measles deaths went off a cliff, the numbers reduced drastically.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:29.016
A disease that used to kill an estimated 2.6 million people every year now kills just over 100,000.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.960
And a decade after the introduction of the measles vaccine, an American

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.160
microbiologist called Maurice Hilleman developed a three-in-one vaccine, which

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.520
protects children not just against measles, but also against mumps and rubella.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.840
As you’ll know, mumps and rubella are different diseases, both

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.650
less serious, but both posing significant health risks to children.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.670
And this new three-in-one MMR vaccine, which became available in 1971,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.810
was incredibly effective at protecting children from all three diseases.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.180
It was cheap, safe, easy to administer, and most importantly, it was very good at saving lives.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.890
Given all of this, it became very popular, a cornerstone in

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.060
the public health policies of countries all over the world.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.630
And to put a number on it, since it was first released, it

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.340
has been administered to an estimated 575 million children.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.260
I got it, almost every British child of my generation got

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.260
it, and depending on how old you are, perhaps you got it too.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.404
But in February of 1998, the well-respected and going on 200-year-old

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.720
medical journal, The Lancet, published a bombshell piece of research.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.200
The lead author was a British researcher called Andrew Wakefield, and in

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.120
this paper he made the suggestion that there could be a link between this

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.050
vaccine, the MMR vaccine, and the neurodevelopmental disorder, autism.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.460
In other words, Wakefield’s research suggested that a child given this

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.670
MMR vaccine was more likely to develop autism than a child who wasn’t.

00:06:37.258 --> 00:06:41.108
As you might imagine, this was a huge revelation.

00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:47.468
The MMR vaccine had been in use since the early 1970s, and was given to practically

00:06:47.528 --> 00:06:52.548
every child in Britain to protect them against these three dangerous diseases.

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:55.528
And it had been working wonderfully.

00:06:56.348 --> 00:07:01.958
Deaths from these three diseases had plummeted; people simply didn’t get them any more.

00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:09.758
But out came Wakefield’s research paper, which made the suggestion of a connection between

00:07:09.768 --> 00:07:15.638
these marvellous vaccines that had stopped these three diseases in their tracks and autism.

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:23.388
Now, to briefly remind you of exactly what autism is, it is a complex developmental

00:07:23.388 --> 00:07:28.198
condition that affects how a person communicates and interacts with others.

00:07:29.058 --> 00:07:33.348
People with autism might find it harder to talk with other people, to

00:07:33.528 --> 00:07:38.668
understand social cues, and they might do the same things over and over.

00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:45.398
And before this paper, nobody really knew what caused autism.

00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:51.418
Was it genetic, was it environmental, was it something brought on during

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:57.548
pregnancy, was it linked to certain plastics, foods, smoking or alcohol?

00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:04.088
Or, according to Andrew Wakefield, could it be caused by the MMR vaccine?

00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:08.778
Did this miracle vaccine, a vaccine that was saving

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:13.758
millions of lives every year, did it turn children autistic?

00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:20.966
So, let’s take a look at exactly what Wakefield proposed, and how this connection was made.

00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:29.296
In the paper, Wakefield’s hypothesis was that the MMR vaccine caused inflammation

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:34.176
of the intestines and harmful proteins to enter into the bloodstream.

00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:43.906
These proteins, so Wakefield hypothesised, were harmful to the brain, and could bring on autism.

00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:49.906
So, where did this come from, Wakefield must have got this idea from somewhere?

00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:57.926
After all, it was a scientific study published in a well-respected medical journal, and Wakefield

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:05.516
was a trained and experienced doctor; this wasn’t some case of an eccentric amateur scientist doing

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:11.286
an experiment in his garden shed and calling up the local newspaper to report on his discovery.

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:19.546
Well, in the study, Wakefield focussed on a group of 12 children who all had some form of

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:25.296
“developmental delay” and who had been sent to a London hospital with stomach problems.

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:31.118
According to Wakefield, all of these children had developed stomach complaints

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:36.928
shortly after getting their MMR jab, and had subsequently developed autism.

00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:42.768
There was a large press conference when the story was first published, with

00:09:42.768 --> 00:09:47.218
journalists from major newspapers and TV stations coming along to report

00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:52.078
on these scandalous revelations, or at least, scandalous suggestions.

00:09:53.298 --> 00:09:58.048
It was major news, all over the TV and on the front pages

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.518
of major publications like The Guardian and The Independent.

00:10:03.048 --> 00:10:06.318
Clearly, it would be a huge revelation.

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:13.158
The problem was, the entire research was at best flawed, full of

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:19.238
mistakes and inconsistencies, and at worst, dishonest and fraudulent.

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:27.098
Firstly, almost every child in Britain got this MMR vaccine at the time, with the

00:10:27.098 --> 00:10:33.018
first jab at around 12 months of age and the second jab at 3 years and 4 months.

00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:37.821
Millions of children had been getting it, but there was

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:41.528
no evidence of an increase in autism in British children.

00:10:43.068 --> 00:10:47.578
Secondly, the causality in the paper was coincidental.

00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:55.487
The children in Wakefield’s paper were aged between 3 and 10, with an average age of 6.

00:10:56.708 --> 00:11:02.748
This is also the age range that children who have some form of autism tend to be diagnosed.

00:11:03.818 --> 00:11:08.758
So statistically speaking, it was very likely that a child who was diagnosed

00:11:08.758 --> 00:11:13.858
with autism would also have had the MMR vaccination, because everyone

00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:18.068
did, with their second jab coming shortly after their third birthday.

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:25.428
Thirdly, Wakefield had suggested that the vaccine caused inflammation of the

00:11:25.428 --> 00:11:30.208
intestines, which then released damaging proteins that brought on autism.

00:11:31.428 --> 00:11:35.788
But it was later shown that these children had been diagnosed with

00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:40.418
autism before they had reported problems with their intestines.

00:11:41.948 --> 00:11:45.588
Clearly, the timing here is of the utmost importance.

00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:50.988
It’s like someone who says that wearing sunglasses made them go blind, let’s say.

00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:56.718
If they were blind before they put on the sunglasses, then it wasn’t the sunglasses.

00:11:58.278 --> 00:12:03.088
What’s more, the paper was based on case reports, reports about the children’s

00:12:03.088 --> 00:12:09.488
medical history, rather than hard data, so the evidence was weak at best.

00:12:11.118 --> 00:12:15.618
Now, you might be listening to this and thinking “well, perhaps a few

00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:20.698
mistakes were made, but I can’t imagine this happened on purpose”, but it’s

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:26.998
here that we move more from the “flawed” analysis to the “fraudulent” one.

00:12:29.038 --> 00:12:34.508
In 2004, six years after the paper was published, it was revealed

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:39.728
that Dr Andrew Wakefield had many conflicts of interests.

00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:48.018
At the same time as he was putting himself forward as merely a researcher, it turned out that he

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:55.168
had been paid by a lawyer who was trying to launch a class action lawsuit against the MMR vaccine.

00:12:56.798 --> 00:13:02.938
And the 12 children had been cherry picked, they'd been specifically chosen, because Wakefield

00:13:02.938 --> 00:13:09.578
believed they were more likely to demonstrate a link between the vaccine and autism, they weren’t

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:15.878
randomly selected; they were chosen because Wakefield had specifically set out to prove a point.

00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:23.388
What’s more, Wakefield had patented a rival vaccine to the MMR vaccine.

00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:30.118
In other words, he had a vested financial interest in making the MMR vaccine

00:13:30.318 --> 00:13:35.638
look like it was dangerous, because if he could discredit the three-in-one,

00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:40.878
he stood to make millions of pounds a year with his alternative vaccine.

00:13:41.878 --> 00:13:47.888
This was a huge conflict of interest, and a violation of the ethical code.

00:13:49.398 --> 00:13:54.668
The Lancet, the medical journal in which the report was published, partially retracted the

00:13:54.668 --> 00:14:00.358
article shortly after this revelation and said that it had been deceived by the doctor.

00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:06.068
In fact, Dr Wakefield was not a doctor for much longer.

00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:13.448
In 2010 he was struck off the British medical register, meaning that he can no longer

00:14:13.488 --> 00:14:19.678
practise medicine or call himself a doctor, so now he is just Mr Andrew Wakefield.

00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:26.788
Despite all of this, and the fact that he has been outed as a fraud, Andrew

00:14:26.788 --> 00:14:31.988
Wakefield has done a huge amount of damage to the credibility of the MMR vaccine.

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:42.055
Trust in the MMR vaccine took a huge dip, dropping by 50%, as parents perfectly understandably

00:14:42.325 --> 00:14:47.135
were cautious about injecting their children with something that a paper in a reputable medical

00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:53.075
journal had once suggested could cause autism, even if that suggestion had now been retracted.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.180
For the absence of doubt, Wakefield’s claims have been completely debunked

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:05.130
and discredited, there is no proven link between this vaccine and autism.

00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:11.490
But for there to be no proven link was not enough for some parents;

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.140
there were calls for the British government to prove that the vaccine

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.960
didn’t cause autism, which is of course almost impossible to do.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:26.250
You can prove that there is a link between two things, a cause and an effect,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.320
but proving that there is absolutely no link between two things is harder.

00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:37.674
In other words, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

00:15:39.044 --> 00:15:42.734
And the fact that the seed of doubt had been placed

00:15:42.774 --> 00:15:45.884
was enough for the confidence in MMR vaccine to drop.

00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:52.974
People wanted certainty that it did not cause autism, but all that doctors were

00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:57.924
able to confidently say was that there was no evidence of any link between the two.

00:15:59.804 --> 00:16:01.894
The vaccination rate dropped.

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:09.674
89% of British children were fully vaccinated against measles in the year 2000, but this dropped

00:16:09.674 --> 00:16:17.704
to 81% in 2004, before climbing back gradually after Wakefield's paper was proved to be fraudulent.

00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:23.291
And despite the fact that Wakefield’s claims have been disproved by

00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:28.171
practically every major scientific journal since, he has continued to beat

00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:33.097
the drum of MMR scepticism, going from one anti-vax conference to another.

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:39.007
And he is still a powerful force, especially in certain communities that have inherent

00:16:39.057 --> 00:16:44.287
distrust of modern science and medicine, not just in Britain, but all over the world.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:50.667
After the US government declared measles to be eliminated from the country in the year

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:59.579
2000, the numbers of cases have kept creeping up, with a record 1,274 cases in 2019.

00:17:01.077 --> 00:17:06.727
And globally, both measles cases and measles deaths continue to

00:17:06.737 --> 00:17:14.947
increase, with deaths topping 200,000 in 2019, a 50% increase from 2016.

00:17:16.677 --> 00:17:23.993
The ironic but tragic fact is that the cause of this is exactly the same as in the Nigerian

00:17:23.993 --> 00:17:30.633
rural village of Imesi-Ile in the 1950s, but but it’s now for very different reasons.

00:17:31.913 --> 00:17:36.083
Back then, there was no vaccine, so the disease was

00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:39.953
spreading like wildfire, and killing children in their droves

00:17:41.003 --> 00:17:46.513
Now there is a vaccine, a vaccine that the scientific community at large has very

00:17:46.513 --> 00:17:51.523
high levels of trust in, and has been successfully used on a large proportion

00:17:51.533 --> 00:17:56.413
of the planet, but parents are opting not to give it to their children.

00:17:58.073 --> 00:18:05.223
So, to conclude, the story of Andrew Wakefield and his MMR deception tells us many things,

00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:11.823
but perhaps most importantly it is a stark reminder of how fragile public trust is.

00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:16.153
When it comes to our health, and especially the health of our

00:18:16.153 --> 00:18:20.463
children, we can all be particularly cautious, sceptical even.

00:18:21.863 --> 00:18:25.303
In the case of this paper, it had tragic consequences.

00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:31.293
A single fraudulent study not only jeopardised decades of public health progress

00:18:31.573 --> 00:18:36.633
but also reignited diseases in communities that had long been free of them.

00:18:38.123 --> 00:18:43.683
The American author HG Wells once wrote, “human history becomes

00:18:43.683 --> 00:18:47.413
more and more a race between education and catastrophe”.

00:18:48.953 --> 00:18:55.363
As this story shows, progress in this race is much more fragile than we might like to admit.

00:18:57.773 --> 00:19:02.403
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Great MMR Hoax.

00:19:02.903 --> 00:19:06.357
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and I

00:19:06.357 --> 00:19:10.284
hope not to be inundated with messages from supporters of Andrew Wakefield.

00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:14.034
But, as always, I would love to get this discussion started.

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:18.614
Is there a strong anti-MMR and anti-vax movement in your country?

00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:20.534
How has this changed over time?

00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:26.764
Let’s get the conversation started, so the place for that is community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:19:27.864 --> 00:19:32.424
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:19:33.064 --> 00:19:38.004
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

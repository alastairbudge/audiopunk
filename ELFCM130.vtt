Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.793 --> 00:00:16.413
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:20.613
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:28.843
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Rose Island, the time that an Italian

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:36.033
engineer built an island off the coast of Italy and declared it to be its own independent nation.

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:41.653
You might have seen that Netflix released a film about Rose Island in late 2020.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:46.653
But in today’s episode we are going to go a little deeper.

00:00:47.323 --> 00:00:51.793
We’ll start by telling the real story of Rose Island - how it all

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:56.513
got going, what happened, and where you can find Rose Island today.

00:00:57.213 --> 00:01:04.233
Then we’ll also talk about attempts since then to create new countries, about what it actually

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:10.443
means to be a country, and ask ourselves where the countries of the future might come from.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:17.153
Before we get right into that though, let me just quickly remind you that you can follow along to

00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:22.573

So if you haven’t yet checked that out, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:45.323
Ok then, Rose Island.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:53.103
Our story starts with a young engineer called Giorgio Rosa, from Bologna, in Northern Italy.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:57.973
Rosa, if you hadn’t guessed, means Rose in Italian.

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:05.663
Rosa was born in 1925, and graduated as a mechanical engineer in 1950.

00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:14.013
The post war years, as we all know, were a time of free thinking, of challenging the status quo.

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:20.893
Italy was no exception, and indeed Italy had one of the largest student movements in Europe.

00:02:21.823 --> 00:02:28.263
Bologna was, and still is, a university town, and was later to be a centre of student protests.

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:35.333
Rosa was, by all accounts, keen to experiment with new styles of buildings

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:40.683
and new engineering concepts, and was sick and tired of what he saw

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:45.073
as excessive government bureaucracy that stopped him from doing so.

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:53.803
In 1958, when he was 33 years old, he had the idea of creating a platform out

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:58.563
in the Adriatic Sea, off the coast of Italy opposite a city called Rimini.

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:04.913
Rimini, if you don’t know where it is, is a bit further south than

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:09.843
Bologna and just slightly north of Florence, on the eastern side of Italy.

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:17.583
It’s known as a summer, seaside spot, and is full of bars, restaurants, nightclubs and so on.

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:26.123
Rosa had this idea to build a small island off the coast of Rimini, but crucially, the island

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:33.663
would be more than 6 nautical miles, which is just under 10 kilometres, from the Italian coast.

00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:38.473
The reason why this is important will be familiar for those of you who

00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:42.683
remember one of the first episodes we ever recorded, on Who Owns The Sea.

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:47.473
It’s that, in 1958 at least, the territorial waters

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:52.263
of a country extended only 6 miles out from the coast.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:57.373
So, from the Italian coast until 6 miles out to sea was

00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:00.633
still part of Italy, it belonged to the Italian state.

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:05.973
But if you went out past 6 miles, it was no longer part of

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:10.123
Italy, it was international waters, it didn’t belong to anyone.

00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:16.973
So, going further than 6 miles out to sea meant that anyone technically had the right to do

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:24.383
anything - this territory didn’t belong to Italy any more than it belonged to Bhutan, or to Rosa.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:30.753
So, in 1958, Rosa started planning out his construction.

00:04:31.753 --> 00:04:36.623
He didn’t have external investors, he didn’t have any bank providing him

00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:41.873
with a big loan to build an island, he was on his own, financially at least.

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:47.563
The sea was about 40 metres deep, and it was 6 miles out to sea.

00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:52.863
The Adriatic is relatively calm, it's not like the middle of the

00:04:52.883 --> 00:04:56.803
Atlantic Ocean, but there were storms, large waves and so on.

00:04:57.283 --> 00:05:01.613
So, actually building an island in the middle of the sea that is

00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:06.543
structurally sound, that is safe, is no mean feat, it’s not easy.

00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:13.033
To build it, Rosa pioneered a concept that is very interesting, and

00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:18.403
allowed him to build a proper structure that was structurally safe.

00:05:19.563 --> 00:05:25.123
How he did this was by dragging large, wide, hollow pipes out to sea.

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:30.803
These were steel pipes, but when he was dragging them they didn’t sink to the

00:05:31.023 --> 00:05:36.563
bottom because they were sealed, they were closed, and they were filled with air.

00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:42.533
So, much like huge steel ships don’t sink to the bottom if they have enough

00:05:42.763 --> 00:05:48.713
buoyant material inside, material which keeps them afloat, nor did Rosa’s pipes.

00:05:49.943 --> 00:05:54.703
When he managed to bring the pipes to the site he had in mind, he dropped them to

00:05:54.703 --> 00:06:00.113
the bottom, so that they filled with water and stood up vertically on the seabed.

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:07.853
He then put steel poles inside the large pipes, and pushed them deep into the ocean floor.

00:06:09.043 --> 00:06:14.103
The final stage, at least from the point of view of creating the legs for

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:18.993
the island, was to fill the pillars with concrete, so that they didn’t move.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:23.723
Now it was just a case of putting the island on top.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:29.480
I say ‘just’ - evidently it wasn’t completely simple - but the most complicated

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.850
part of building the island was creating the legs for it to stand on.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:42.980
Rosa then added five floors to the island, and from afar it looked a little bit like an oil rig.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.610
He even drilled all the way down, 280 metres down, deep through the seabed,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.150
to a source of freshwater, so that the island had its own fresh water on tap.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:04.380
From the initial idea through to the final construction took almost 10 years, but by

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:12.680
1967 it was complete, and officially opened its doors to tourists on August 20, 1967.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.790
It was about 400 square metres, had a bar, a restaurant, a source

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.210
of freshwater, and of course, a nightclub and a souvenir shop.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:30.170
During its construction, it was considered a bit of an eccentricity, with Rosa being a mad

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.550
engineer that was doing something weird and strange, but that probably wouldn’t harm anyone.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.230
Tourists could come and visit from the mainland, and there were boats that

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.120
left every day from Rimini to take tourists to the concrete island in the sea.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.330
So far so good.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:54.740
But on the first of May, 1968, Rosa did something that caught the

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.630
attention of the authorities, not just in Rimini, but also in Rome.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:06.380
He declared his island to be an independent republic, with a President, a Finance

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.400
Minister, a Minister for Internal Affairs, and a Minister for Foreign Affairs.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:18.170
It had its own stamps, and it set out plans to develop its own money, called milla.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.025
It was to be called The Republic of Rose Island, or Respubliko de la Insulo de la

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:30.550
Rozoj in Esperanto, which was chosen to be the official language of the island.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.080
By the way, if you’re interested in learning more about

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.100
Esperanto, there’s an episode on that too, it’s number 69.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.350
As an independent republic, Rose Island wouldn’t be part of Italy.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.090
It wouldn’t need to respect Italian laws, it wouldn’t need to

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.290
use Italian money, and it wouldn’t need to pay taxes to Italy.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.320
On the mainland, politicians scrambled to try to

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.350
understand the legality, and the implications, of this.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.880
Could they actually do it?

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.800
Was The Republic of Rose Island actually independent of Italy?

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.550
If it was, it set a dangerous precedent, as theoretically anyone could

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.270
set up their own republic if they went more than 10 km out from the coast.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.000
This was all going on at a particularly sensitive time.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.820
Firstly, 1968 was a year of student protests throughout Europe, including in Italy.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:38.490
1968 was also the start of what’s now called The Years of Lead, Gli Anni Di

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:44.300
Piombo, in Italy, which was a period of around 20 years of political turmoil.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.280
It was also right in the middle of the Cold War, and on the other side of Rose

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:56.300
Island, across the Adriatic Sea, was Yugoslavia, led by the Communist leader Tito.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.460
And if you’re keen on learning more about Tito, you’ll want to listen to episode number 84.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.110
So, the late 60s was a very politically sensitive time,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.200
both internally in Italy and on a more global level.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.310
The existence of Rose Island was debated by politicians, and it was

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.980
almost universally criticised, both by those on the right and the left.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.430
The central state, as you might imagine, was opposed to it, as they

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.280
feared that this would result in a loss of tax revenues as well as

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.830
set a precedent that this was something that other people could do.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.870
This also scared the Communists, as if you have a reduction in taxes

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.040
and a reduction in the state, that’s not going to go down well with

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.640
a political belief that focuses on the state paying for everything.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.000
And for those on the right, they feared that this new island could be some kind of

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:04.650
hotbed of communism, a communist hotspot just a short distance from the Italian mainland.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:12.670
If it became a communist republic, not only was it uncomfortably close to Italy, but there was also

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:19.720
the accusation that Soviet nuclear submarines could hide under it, ready for an attack on Italy.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.390
And finally, there was the fear that it would be turned into some

00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:30.000
sort of Italian Las Vegas, a den of iniquity where there was gambling,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.090
prostitution, and all sorts of activities that were illegal on the mainland.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.100
Given all of this, and the almost universal negative feeling by the

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.530
authorities towards the island, the Italian government was quick to act.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.910
55 days after independence was first proclaimed, the

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.440
Italian police arrived and took control of the island.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:01.450
They put a blockade around it, a barrier around the island, meaning that nobody could get onto it.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.690
Rose Island was dead, the dream was over, but the island was still there.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.300
It wasn’t to last for long though.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.860
In February of the following year, February 1969, the Italian police strapped

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.800
two tonnes of explosives to the pillars of Rose Island and blew it up.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.670
The pillars were exceptionally strong, and they had to try twice to actually destroy the structure.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.390
Even after two attempts, the platform didn’t sink right away, and

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.950
it took a storm later on in the month for it to sink to the ground.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.460
If you watch the Netflix film there is a very dramatic scene with the

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.630
Italian navy bombing the island and Rosa and his colleagues standing

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.050
there holding hands as the bombs explode nearer and nearer to the island.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.430
But, I’m sorry to say, that just didn’t happen.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.460
The island sunk to the bottom of the sea, nobody was harmed in

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.460
the process, and that is where the island has remained ever since.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.210
And while you might think that this was a national, or perhaps even

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.790
international story at the time, there’s not that much evidence that it was

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.970
particularly well-known at all until Netflix made a film about it last year.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:27.280
Not of course that this is conclusive evidence, but I asked my Italian in-laws, who were

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:33.170
teenagers at the time, and several Italian friends, and nobody had any memory of it at all.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.600
Indeed, outside of Rimini the story was really not very well known at all.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:45.390
But, to those who knew about it, Rose Island represented possibility.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.550
Shortly after Rose Island was destroyed, and on the other side of the world, an American

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.900
millionaire who had made his money in Las Vegas real estate declared his own independent state.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.530
It was called the Republic of Minerva, and was built on an

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.640
artificial island off a reef in the Pacific Ocean, near Tonga.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:15.510
Independence was declared on the 19th of January, 1972, but just over a

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:21.620
month later, on the 24th of February, Tonga made a claim on the territory, it

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.220
was said that this wasn’t an independent state, but actually part of Tonga.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.440
And this claim was accepted by all of the other neighbouring nations.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.400
So that was the end of the Republic of Minerva.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:42.730
And while in the 1960s or 1970s the idea of building your own little state might have

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:48.050
been quite fun, and interesting from an ideological point of view, in recent years

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.400
the idea of building a new independent nation has gained more and more traction.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.590
Especially for people with libertarian beliefs and lots of money, creating your

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.400
own island offers you the ability to be completely independent from governments,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.810
which if you are libertarian you probably don’t have such a high opinion of.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:16.130
It also exempts you from paying taxes, and if you have a lot of money, which does often seem

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:21.460
to be the case with prominent libertarians, this is understandably an attractive proposition.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:28.669
Peter Thiel, the secretive Silicon Valley billionaire, has been a vocal proponent of the creation

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:34.909
of new, independent states, and has invested in companies that are trying to develop them.

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:40.169
None have been successfully developed so far, but the reasons

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:44.159
for this are mainly regulatory, rather than technological.

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:51.109
That’s to say that from an engineering standpoint, making your own structure isn’t too difficult.

00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:57.079
But actually making it work from a legal, regulatory point of view, is a lot harder.

00:15:58.369 --> 00:16:04.099
To the proponents of the idea of the creation of new, libertarian, independent states,

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:09.239
the argument goes that you can choose where you want to live, with people who share

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:15.349
your ideas, values, religions, customs and how you think a state should be run.

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:19.399
At the moment we don’t really get much choice in the matter.

00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:25.019
You are born in a country, it has a government, and yes you might have the

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:30.059
opportunity every few years to express your opinion on whom you would like

00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:35.449
to lead the country, just moving to another country isn’t always possible.

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:40.919
Plus, most countries have inefficient governments that waste your money, so the

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:46.879
argument goes, and in a world of thousands of independent small countries you could

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:51.919
choose to go to the most efficient one, and the one that provided the best value for

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:57.059
money and best suited your values, rather than whatever country you were born in.

00:16:57.751 --> 00:17:02.985
And in a world that is more and more populated, with cities and towns that are more and more

00:17:02.985 --> 00:17:08.835
crowded, and with technology that allows us to look further and further afield, not only into the

00:17:08.845 --> 00:17:15.375
oceans, but into space, this libertarian vision of the future could even be extended to allow you

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:21.655
to choose not just what city you wanted to live in, not just what country, but also what planet.

00:17:23.025 --> 00:17:29.135
Rosa’s concrete utopia was just a 400 square metre concrete platform off the

00:17:29.135 --> 00:17:34.755
Italian coast, but its story does raise some really thought-provoking questions.

00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:36.925
What is a country?

00:17:37.635 --> 00:17:41.465
Who should choose whether a country should or shouldn’t exist?

00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:48.535
When, and where and under what conditions should new countries be able to be created?

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:55.335
And on a personal choice level, assuming that you could live in any country, assuming

00:17:55.525 --> 00:17:59.785
that this country was built up from nothing, what would that country look like?

00:18:00.835 --> 00:18:04.875
To most of us, it might not be a 400 square metre concrete platform

00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:09.325
in the sea, but if you think of the country of your dreams, your own

00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:14.485
personal utopia, it’s probably not exactly the one you live in right now.

00:18:15.815 --> 00:18:21.305
And in a universe where new countries can be created, on the land, on the sea, and

00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:28.565
even in space, whether this is in 50, 100, or 500 years time, the possibility of being

00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:33.915
able to choose exactly the country you want to live in is understandably appealing.

00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:38.695
And if this universe of the future, of thousands of different

00:18:38.725 --> 00:18:43.735
micronations, proves to be true then history will surely look back at

00:18:43.735 --> 00:18:48.585
Giorgio Rosa as a visionary that was born 500 years before his time.

00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:54.675
OK then that is it for Rose Island.

00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:58.535
I hope that it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:04.285
Especially for the Italian members, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:04.842 --> 00:19:07.896
Had you heard about the story of Rose Island - do you

00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:11.126
remember it, or do you remember hearing about its story?

00:19:11.546 --> 00:19:12.306
I’d love to know.

00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:15.336

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.770
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.880
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Haiti.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.080
Specifically, we will be discussing the question of why Haiti wins the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.190
unfortunate prize of the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.279
I should say that this is a follow-up episode, a part two, of the last episode on

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:46.150
the Haitian Revolution, so if you haven’t listened to that one yet, I would strongly

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.649
recommend that you do so first, as there is a lot of background information there,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.680
and this episode will make a lot more sense if you’ve listened to that one first.

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.850
OK then, let’s get started and talk about Haiti.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.650
The search engine “Google” is a great way of getting an

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.450
insight into what people all over the world are curious about.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.539
Just start typing into the search bar, and Google will

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.299
present you with the most frequently asked queries.

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:22.490
If you start typing “best recipes for”, Google might

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.539
suggest “dinner”, or “healthy meals”, or “toddlers”.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.370
I’m in Sweden at the moment, and if I start typing “why is Sweden”, I’m

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.590
presented with options like “so good at music”, “so happy”, “so expensive”,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.340
and a question that I’ve been asking myself recently, “so cloudy”.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.709
All valid questions, and clearly a lot of people are looking for the answers.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.050
If you start typing “why is Haiti”, however, you are presented with a very different

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.109
set of suggestions, a set of questions that present not quite such a rosy picture.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.109
Why is Haiti so dangerous?

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.350
Why is Haiti so unstable?

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.190
Why is Haiti so violent?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.830
Why is Haiti so poor?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.110
These are all very valid questions.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.269
Haiti has been overrun by gangs, there is no government, the former US ambassador

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.739
to Haiti said it's not going to be a failed state, it is a failed state.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.360
So…why?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.120
Well, you will remember the story of the Haitian Revolution from the last episode.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.910
As a brief reminder, the second-largest island in the Caribbean is called Hispaniola.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.250
In 1492 it was “discovered” by Christopher Columbus, who claimed it for the Spanish.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.249
Spanish interest in the island waned, and in 1697 the western half was handed over to France.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.630
The French called it Saint-Domingue and turned it into a slave colony of grotesque proportions.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.700
It became the most profitable slave colony in the world,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.369
at one point producing half of all of the coffee in Europe.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.680
Fast forward to 1791, and the slaves of Saint-Domingue rose up.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.779
It was a long, complicated and extremely violent uprising–as we heard in the last episode–but in

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.030
January of 1804 they finally emerged victorious, and a new state was declared: the country of Haiti.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.300
Finally, there was peace, the nation could get on with the business of

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.430
nation-building, and its citizens would enjoy the wealth and prosperity

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.670
that the island’s natural resources had afforded its white residents.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.410
Unfortunately, this has never happened.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.150
Haiti is the only country in the Western Hemisphere

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.480
that is classified as a “Least developed country”.

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:19.690
Its GDP per capita is $1,700, and Haitians have a life expectancy at birth of a measly 64 years.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.650
And this pill is even more bitter to swallow when you consider the situation on the eastern

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.030
half of the island, the country previously called Santo Domingo, now the Dominican Republic.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.890
Now, to reiterate, Haiti and the Dominican Republic are on the same island.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.640
The climate is the same, the terrain is the same, the

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.960
two nations even have practically the same population.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.650
But everything else is very different.

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:57.080
The GDP per capita of The Dominican Republic today is six times larger

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.180
than that of Haiti, life expectancy is a full 10 years more, the average

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.240
person in Haiti is nearly 10 times poorer than their Dominican neighbour.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.299
There are plenty of reasons for this, stretching the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.930
entirety of Haiti’s history as an independent country.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.390
And in fact the first, very possibly the most important, goes right back to the start.

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:29.880
So it is January 1804 and Jean-Jacques Dessalines has

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.660
declared the nation of Haiti, with himself as an emperor.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.409
One of his first acts was what can only be described as the genocide of the

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.879
remaining white population, and the remaining 5,000 or so white plantation

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.190
owners and workers were slaughtered, often publicly and in truly terrible ways.

00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:59.080
Dessalines was, in his own words, avenging the century of mistreatment and cruelty by

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.709
the whites towards their slaves, and cleansing the country of the dangerous whites.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.229
You might well say that he had every right to do it, but it did

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.410
little to cement his power or put the country back on its feet.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.530
Its economy was in tatters after the primary means of production,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.409
the plantations, had been destroyed during the revolution.

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:31.469
And with the massacre of the remaining white population, this essentially eliminated most of

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.259
the people who had the expertise and understanding of how to manage and run the plantations.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:45.000
Dessalines tried to reintroduce the plantation system, even using forced labour not so

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.540
dissimilar to the slavery he had fought tooth and nail to abolish, but it was not enough.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.780
Within three years, he would be assassinated by political rivals, and Haiti would be split up

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:04.230
into separate parts, the Kingdom of Haiti in the north and the Republic of Haiti in the south.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.470
But the most important development would come in 1825, when the French king Charles X,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:21.070
Charles the Tenth of France, sent a fleet of 14 warships, complete with 528 cannons, to Haiti.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.653
This was not a declaration of war, or an attempt to

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:30.300
recolonise Haiti, but a request for compensation.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.380
Well, not really a request, it was a demand.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:42.200
The French presented an ordinance from the king, a series of demands to the nation of Haiti.

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:49.950
Specifically, France wanted 150 million francs to compensate for its loss.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.950
And by loss, this referred to the loss of the slave-powered colony.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:03.300
In exchange, France would not only leave Haiti in peace, but it would recognise Haiti

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.880
as an independent country and treat it as an equal, on diplomatic terms at least.

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:16.299
The then-ruler of Haiti, President Jean-Pierre Boyer, clearly felt

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.500
he had little option but to agree, and accepted the French demands.

00:08:22.929 --> 00:08:29.200
The problem was that 150 million francs was a vast amount of money, equivalent to

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:37.100
300% of Haiti’s GDP, 3 times the entire revenues generated by the country every year.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:43.650
Haiti simply didn’t have the money, and it was forced to borrow money from

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.550
French banks at high rates of interest in order to pay back the French state.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.399
This created a so-called “double debt” - the debt repayment to the French

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.529
state and the interest payments to the French banks who loaned Haiti the money.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.670
In the interest of balance, the debt was reduced to 90 million francs, but this

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.870
debt would be a yoke around the neck of every Haitian for over a hundred years.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:21.150
Haiti was already a poor country, and by the late 19th century 4 out of every

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.520
5 tax dollars its government was collecting were going to pay this debt.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.450
It was completely unsustainable, and meant that Haiti

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.610
was unable to do anything other than pay the debt.

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:40.630
Haiti defaulted on its debt multiple times, but each time was forced

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:45.750
to take on more debt, with more interest, to repay the original debt.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.140
And this debt was no longer just to France.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:58.489
Haiti had also taken loans from American banks to pay back the French, so you had this unusual

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.220
and deeply unfair situation where the country was crippled by foreign debt from the very start.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.290
What’s more, it wasn’t recognised as a country, at least by some key

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.260
countries from which it sought recognition: the United States and Britain.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.120
Both countries still allowed slavery, and were fearful of

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.370
acknowledging a country created after a slave rebellion.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.130
Just to the west of Haiti was the British colony

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.930
Jamaica, home to hundreds of thousands of black slaves.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.959
And just a thousand kilometres north of Haiti was the United States, a relatively

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.400
freshly independent country itself, but still home to millions of slaves.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.889
Recognising Haiti as a legitimate country might give slaves in the United

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:53.180
States and in British colonies the idea that they too could be free, and

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.300
that was not something the Americans or the British were too keen on.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:06.380
The UK and the United States did eventually recognise Haiti, in 1833 and 1862 respectively,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:13.099
but these years of non-recognition made it very hard for Haiti to trade, to seek diplomatic

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.280
relations, to do what it needed to do to grow itself out of the mountain of French debt.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.650
And domestically, as you might imagine, Haiti was not a stable place.

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:29.590
There were continuing disputes with neighbouring Saint-Domingo,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.420
which was annexed by Haiti and then gained independence in 1844.

00:11:34.853 --> 00:11:39.489
There were coups, assassinations and short-lived presidencies.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.180
And in 1915, faced with the prospect of an anti-American politician

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.079
seizing power, the United States invaded and occupied Haiti.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.442
It was an occupation that would last 19 years, only ending in 1934.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:05.379
Now, speaking in purely economic terms, and when compared to some of the other woeful

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:11.020
periods of Haitian history, the American occupation was not a terrible thing for the country.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.789
There were infrastructural improvements, the stabilisation of the country’s financial

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:22.919
system, and some improvements in the day-to-day life of the average Haitian.

00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:28.700
But these infrastructural developments were enabled by forced labour, by

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:34.350
Americans forcing Haitians from their homes to work building bridges or roads.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:41.130
And Haiti was occupied and controlled by another, more powerful country, Haitians

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.890
were taking orders from white masters, it was not so different from the colonial days.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.490
This, understandably led to resentment on the part of

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.456
the Haitian people towards their American occupiers.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.930
And it hampered the potential for Haiti to stand on its own

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:04.080
two feet, politically, institutionally and diplomatically.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.780
It also started a long tradition of the United States supporting political candidates that

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.980
would be sympathetic to American interests, and suppressing up-and-coming Haitians who weren’t.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:24.430
Now, the Americans left in 1934, and the people of Haiti discovered

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.049
that there was a more dangerous enemy even closer to home.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.970
On the eastern side of the island, the leader of the Dominican Republic,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.349
Rafael Trujillo, decided to seize the opportunity to commit what must be one

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.702
of the greatest atrocities to have taken place on the island of Hispaniola.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.330
And for that ugly prize, there is some competition…

00:13:48.849 --> 00:13:53.890
He had risen to power on the back of anti-Haitian sentiment, and had publicly stated

00:13:54.064 --> 00:13:58.670
that he was going to “solve” the problem of Haitians in the Dominican Republic.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.880
In October of 1937, he ordered Dominican soldiers to kill every

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.129
Haitian living in the border region of the Dominican Republic.

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:13.030
It was a slaughter of monumental proportions.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:20.089
Soldiers started to murder Haitian men, women and children with knives and machetes.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.140
As the Haitian population tried to flee, they were cut

00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:27.710
down in their tracks, turning the rivers red with blood.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.770
And those that fled towards the ocean were captured, their

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.180
hands tied, and thrown into the sea to be eaten by sharks.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:45.040
It was truly awful, and is estimated to have cost the lives of up to 35,000 Haitians.

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:51.510
So, more than 100 years after it declared its independence, Haiti was still

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.200
experiencing political turmoil, aggression and prejudice from its Dominican

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.339
neighbours, and it was still repaying its debt to Charles X, the king of France.

00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:10.420
And the 100 years after that, so the second half of the 20th century through to the

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.309
present day, have not been filled with much good news for the people of Haiti either.

00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:23.140
For a 14-year period from 1957 to 1971 the country was ruled

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.440
by the infamous Francois Duvalier, otherwise known as Papa Doc.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:34.179
His regime was autocratic and characterised by violence and intimidation towards his opponents.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.900
And after his death and the passing of the presidency to his son,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.080
Jean-Claude Duvalier, or Baby Doc, things did not get much better.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:54.089
Now, up until now, we've been talking about political and social events, problems caused by people.

00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:58.459
But we must now talk about problems caused by nature.

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:05.565
Haiti in an area of the Caribbean that experiences frequent hurricanes and tropical storms.

00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:12.115
Not much fun, and every year people would be killed, but this wasn’t unique

00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:16.135
to Haiti; it's something that most Caribbean islands have to deal with.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:23.285
But in 2010 Mother Nature enacted upon Haiti the most monumental

00:16:23.295 --> 00:16:27.285
stroke of bad luck, in the form of a devastating earthquake.

00:16:28.605 --> 00:16:33.105
Now, the earthquake itself wasn’t that incredibly strong.

00:16:33.645 --> 00:16:37.385
It was 7 on the Richter scale, so it wasn’t even in

00:16:37.385 --> 00:16:40.375
the top 10 biggest earthquakes measured that year.

00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:47.705
But it was the most devastating, by a long margin, costing anywhere from 100,000

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:54.135
to 300,000 lives, and causing billions of dollars worth of infrastructural damage.

00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:59.145
And ever since, Haiti has been trying to rebuild itself.

00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:05.025
It has received billions of dollars in aid, tens of thousands of aid workers have

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:10.545
flocked there in a bid to help the country and its citizens get back on their feet.

00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:13.195
But, has it worked?

00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:17.565
By pretty much any metric you could look at, it has not.

00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:24.905
As of the time of recording this episode, Haiti meets every criterion for a “failed state”.

00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:29.575
The president has fled, there is no government, the streets are

00:17:29.575 --> 00:17:34.225
ruled by a series of military leaders, crime rates are at an all-time

00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:39.855
high, many major NGOs have pulled out because it is too dangerous.

00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:43.495
So, what comes next for Haiti?

00:17:44.165 --> 00:17:49.135
There are calls for foreign troops to be sent into the country to maintain some stability,

00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:55.655
but perfectly understandably, there are just as many voices within Haiti who reject this.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:18:02.875
After all, the history of Haiti is full of foreigners coming to the country and promising peace

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:10.115
and prosperity, and well, none coming, and the country being left in a worse state afterwards.

00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:16.725
To wrap things up, Haiti must be one of the most unfortunate places in the world.

00:18:17.485 --> 00:18:24.041
Blessed by beautiful scenery, wonderful mountains, sandy beaches and crystal clear waters.

00:18:24.597 --> 00:18:27.715
And with a clear example of what life could have been

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:31.105
like to the east, in the form of the Dominican Republic.

00:18:32.185 --> 00:18:37.435
But cursed by years of foreign occupation, slavery, war,

00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:41.375
prejudice, extreme violence, and political instability.

00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:47.045
So, as to the question of Why Haiti Is So Poor, well,

00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:50.495
the answer is that there are some very good reasons.

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:56.545
OK then, that is it for today's episode on post-revolutionary

00:18:56.545 --> 00:19:00.405
Haiti, and the end of this two-part mini-series on Haiti.

00:19:00.945 --> 00:19:03.495
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt

00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:07.585
something new about this fascinating but perpetually unlucky country.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:11.525
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:11.965 --> 00:19:13.405
Have you been to Haiti?

00:19:13.595 --> 00:19:14.985
Do you have any Haitian friends?

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:18.385
If you do, have you talked much about the history of Haiti?

00:19:18.965 --> 00:19:22.115
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

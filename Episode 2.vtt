Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.531
English.

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:16.223
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about prison escapes and looking at some of

00:00:16.223 --> 00:00:19.503
the most amazing prison escapes in history.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.815
Prison is evidently not the kind of place where most people want to stay, and so it goes without

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:33.011
saying, for as long as prisons have existed, well, people have tried to escape from them.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:39.576
Some of our, I should probably not say heroes, but let's say protagonists, so some of our

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:48.283
protagonists in today's episode used all sorts of ingenious tricks, including wooden pistols,

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:53.263
dummies, yoga, and even hockey sticks to escape from prison.

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:57.194
And I'll reveal exactly how they did it shortly.

00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:05.130
Before we get right into it though, I want to remind those of you listening on Apple Podcasts,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.500
Spotify or wherever you might get your podcasts that you can get the transcript and key vocabulary

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.783
for this podcast on the website, so that's leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:21.213
There's also a load of information on how to use podcasts to learn English over on the blog.

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:24.253
So that's well worth a look if you haven't done so already.

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:26.922
Okay.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:33.222
Without further ado, let's take a look at five of the most amazing prison escapes in history.

00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:39.094
Firstly, John Herbert Dillinger, born in 1903.

00:01:39.094 --> 00:01:46.748
Okay if that name is ringing a bell for you, well, you may remember him from the 2009 film Public

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:48.218
Enemies with Johnny Depp.

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.591
Dillinger was a notorious bank robber in the Great Depression era.

00:01:54.495 --> 00:02:02.771
When he was caught in 1934, after having robbed a bank, naturally, he was held at the Lake County

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:03.951
jail in Indiana.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.580
Local police was so proud of this jail that they declared it to be escape proof.

00:02:11.628 --> 00:02:15.420
Well, it didn't prove to be quite as escape proof as they had hoped.

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:23.852
Shortly after being put in jail, he carved a fake pistol out of a shelf that was in his cell and

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.842
then proceeded to take 17 hostages.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:33.113
He lured the guards back to his cell block, and then he locked them in his own cell.

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.255
Only then was he able to force his way out.

00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:43.895
But if you remember the film, this freedom wasn't to last for long for Dillinger and he was killed

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:45.555
later on that year in a shootout.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.169
Our second escape comes from Korea, from a prisoner called Choi Gap Bok.

00:02:54.402 --> 00:03:01.582
Now one way you can get out of a prison cell is through brute force, so forcing open the bars and

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:02.212
breaking free.

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:10.172
Choi Gap Bok had another idea, which was to make himself so flexible that he could wriggle out.

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:18.534
He was an expert in yoga and spent countless hours making his body as flexible as possible.

00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:25.391
His aim was to squeeze himself out of the tiny hole at the bottom of the door that was used to give

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:26.121
prisoners food.

00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:31.751
If you can imagine what this looks like, it's one of those really small holes at the bottom of the

00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.361
door where they pass the food through.

00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:34.611
Tiny, right?

00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:40.451
This hole was only 15 centimetres tall and 45 centimetres wide.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:49.352
While the guards were sleeping, he managed to wriggle out and the entire escape took only 34 seconds

00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:50.812
and he was finally free.

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:58.005
It wasn't to last though, as he was arrested just six days later, and it goes without saying that

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.035
the next cell he was put in had a much smaller food hole.

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:10.051
Our third story of escape, I should point out, is still debated and we don't know whether the

00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:15.827
prisoners actually managed to escape and are now living in some far corner of the world with new

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:19.357
identities or whether they perished in the Bay of San Francisco.

00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:25.845
Okay, if you haven't guessed it, I'm talking about the escape from the maximum security prison two

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:27.765
kilometres offshore from San Francisco.

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:28.905
Alcatraz.

00:04:29.742 --> 00:04:33.702
If you've seen the cult film, The Rock, you'll know what I'm talking about.

00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:43.672
It's a maximum security prison on a rock in ice-cold, shark-infested waters with very fast tides, so

00:04:43.752 --> 00:04:46.162
certainly no easy feat to escape from.

00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:54.923
In any case, in June, 1962 three prisoners escaped and then mysteriously went missing.

00:04:56.481 --> 00:05:03.321
These prisoners, Frank Morris, John Anglin, and his brother Clarence spent two years digging a

00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:09.141
tunnel through the walls and building a raft made out of raincoats to sail to freedom.

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:16.589
On the night of the escape, they placed dummies, so fake bodies, fake copies of themselves they

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.899
placed them in their bed to trick the guards and it worked.

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.149
It wasn't until the next morning that the guards realized that they had gone.

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:33.055
Later on, parts of the raft, as well as some of the men's personal belongings were found in the Bay

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:38.385
of San Francisco leading investigators to conclude that the men had drowned in the escape.

00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:44.725
However, their bodies have never been found, and there are those that still believe that the men

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:46.870
made it out alive and are now in hiding.

00:05:48.592 --> 00:05:53.067
I don't really know what happened, and it's certainly more intriguing to think that they did manage

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:59.256
to get away and are now sipping margaritas on a beach somewhere rather than in a cold watery grave,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.670
Any list of great prison escapes wouldn't be complete without, well, The Great Escape.

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:14.843
Forever immortalized in the 1963 film, The Great Escape, the escape from Stalag Luft III during

00:06:14.843 --> 00:06:19.823
World War II must go down as one of history's most amazing prison escapes.

00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:27.602
In 1943 after having been captured by the Germans, Royal Air Force squadron leader, Roger Bushel

00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:33.547
thought up a plan for a mass escape from the prison where he was being held with other British and

00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:37.107
Commonwealth airmen, men who were fighting in the allied air force.

00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:43.751
It's a remarkable escape for many reasons, but mainly for the sheer amount of people involved.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:50.318
More than 600 prisoners were involved in the preparation, and 76 managed to escape.

00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:59.094
Now, the prisoners dug three long tunnels from their huts under the camp, past two sets of barbed

00:06:59.094 --> 00:07:01.054
wire and out to the treeline.

00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:08.256
The idea behind having three tunnels was that if one of them was discovered, well, there would be

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:13.026
another two and the prison guards would hardly guessed that the prisoners were working on more than

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:13.606
one tunnel.

00:07:14.714 --> 00:07:19.259
These tunnels were very deep down, around nine metres below the surface.

00:07:20.217 --> 00:07:26.443
They were supported with wood from the prisoners' beds with over half of all the wood from the beds

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:27.203
being removed.

00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:30.742
It's a miracle that the guards didn't discover this.

00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:38.227
These tunnels were over a hundred metres long, but only 60 centimetres wide.

00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:44.237
This meant that they had to create air pumps, which were built out of random items such as hockey

00:07:44.237 --> 00:07:45.767
sticks and food tins.

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:52.523
It was an ingenious plan, and despite numerous problems that they encountered along the way, 76 men

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:56.493
were able to escape on the night of the 24th of March, 1944.

00:07:57.424 --> 00:08:04.894
Even though it was an incredibly brave escape, it wasn't to last for long, and 73 of the 76 men who

00:08:04.894 --> 00:08:09.364
escaped were captured and 50 were executed by the Gestapo.

00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:13.406
If you haven't seen it, The Great Escape is a fantastic film.

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:14.226
Well worth a watch.

00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:19.766
Watch it with English subtitles, of course, and you'll probably see that the accents are a little

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.036
different to the kind of accents that you might hear today.

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:30.217
Last, but not least, we have a more recent escape from none other than Mexican drug lord Joaquin El

00:08:30.217 --> 00:08:30.777
Chapo Guzman.

00:08:31.807 --> 00:08:37.691
Now, El Chapo could probably appear in this list more than once as he has quite a record when it

00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:39.031
comes to prison escapes.

00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:46.845
In 2001, while in the maximum security prison Puente Grande, he managed to escape in a laundry

00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:49.305
basket pushed by a prison worker.

00:08:50.344 --> 00:08:56.944
After this first escape, a total of 78 people have been implicated in helping him, including the

00:08:56.944 --> 00:08:57.994
director of the prison.

00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.651
But escaping doesn't come cheap.

00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.881
It's estimated that this prison escape cost El Chapo around two and a half million dollars.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.300
However, is the second escape that I think is more impressive.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:16.778
While at Federal Social Readaptation center number one, another maximum security prison, El Chapo

00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:19.928
managed to evade the authorities and again, break out.

00:09:21.316 --> 00:09:22.156
How did he do it?

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:27.894
Well, his associates had dug a tunnel from inside a construction site about one and a half

00:09:27.894 --> 00:09:33.594
kilometres away, 10 metres underground, all the way up to the prison and into Guzman's cell.

00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:40.079
The tunnel appeared in Guzman's shower area, which was the only part of the cell that the security

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.499
cameras couldn't see.

00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:46.646
He was last seen at eight minutes to nine going into the shower area.

00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:52.704
When he didn't reappear for 25 minutes, the guards decided to go and look for him, and only then

00:09:52.704 --> 00:09:56.147
they found the entrance to the tunnel, but it was too late.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.130
They found a motorbike in the tunnel with which they expect he used to escape.

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:03.851
So where is El Chapo now?

00:10:04.631 --> 00:10:09.711
Well, if you weren't aware, he's back in prison and it looks like this time it might be for good.

00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:17.750
He was extradited to the United States in January of 2017 and is currently at ADX Florence, the most

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.187
secure supermax prison in America.

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:25.619
Despite the fact that he seems to be a bit of an expert at escaping from prison?

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:28.553
Well, I wouldn't fancy his chances right now.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:30.649
Okay.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:34.359
That's a quick look at the most amazing prison escapes in history.

00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:40.035
We've learnt that you can get out of prison with a fake pistol, if you're really good at yoga, if

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:45.905
you make some dummies of yourself, if you have 600 men and can deal large tunnel, and if you have

00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:48.585
two and a half million dollars to spare to bribe the guards.

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:55.061
But escaping from prison is certainly not easy, and if our examples are anything to go by, you don't

00:10:55.061 --> 00:10:58.016
manage to stay out for long, even if you do manage to escape.

00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:04.820
As always, if you have thoughts, questions, suggestions, or things you didn't quite understand, then

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.530
do let us know.

00:11:05.996 --> 00:11:11.034
You can send us a message on the website that's leonardoenglish.com or on Facebook or Instagram.

00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:17.686
If you've enjoyed the podcast, then do tell a friend, colleague, family member or random person in

00:11:17.686 --> 00:11:18.106
the street.

00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:23.096
The more people know about the podcast, the more listeners we'll have and the better it'll get.

00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:28.826
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English with me, Alastair

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:29.236
Budge.

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:31.316
I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:16.556
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:20.536
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:27.206
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are talking about a soldier who refused to surrender.

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.406
But this man was no normal soldier.

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:37.096
This was a man who spent three decades on high alert, a man who lived in the jungle,

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:43.226
in his mind still “fighting” The Second World War for a good 29 years after it ended.

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:49.346
The man’s name was Hiroo Onoda, and his story really is incredible.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:51.226
So let’s get right into it.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:59.106
It was the 9th of March, 1974, in the mountainous jungle on Lubang, an island in the

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:05.296
Philippines around 150 kilometres southwest of Manila, the East Asian archipelago's capital.

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:11.496
The heat and humidity were torturous, and the air was filled

00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:15.756
with the buzzing of mosquitoes, the ground covered in rats.

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:21.166
Slowly, a pair of boots shuffled forward in the undergrowth.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.196
A weathered man, who looked to be in his fifties or so,

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:30.126
peered nervously from behind a tree, a rifle in his hands.

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:35.636
His military uniform was tattered and worn, and he had

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:40.256
a wispy moustache, grey hairs sprouting from his chin.

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:46.206
He was listening carefully, trying not to make any noise or give himself away.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:50.026
It sounded as though a group of people were making

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.426
their way through the trees, approaching his position.

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:56.826
Probably another American patrol, he thought.

00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:02.576
But as they got closer, he realised they were speaking Japanese, his

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:07.536
mother tongue and something he hadn’t heard in a very, very long time.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:11.826
Paranoid, scared, the man stayed silent.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:14.256
This was war, after all.

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:19.776
It could be another trick to lure him out of his position and capture, even kill, him.

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:27.406
Then a voice called out, a voice he recognised, but one he hadn’t heard for a very long time.

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:30.456
“Hiroo Onoda?” it said.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.566
“Hiroo Onoda?”

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:35.556
This man was calling out his name.

00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:40.696
Carefully, quietly, the man stepped out from behind the tree.

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:48.746
Peering through the overgrowth, he saw who it was: his old major, his old military commander.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.736
The war is over, the major told him.

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.216
We have surrendered, you can go home.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:03.416
Breaking down, Onoda handed over his Samurai sword, his rifle, ammunition and a dagger

00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:08.466
his mother had given him in case he was captured and he needed to commit suicide.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:15.196
Weeping, he saluted the Japanese flag and officially surrendered,

00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:20.446
three decades after the war had ended for everyone else in the world.

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.596
So, who was Hiroo Onoda?

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:30.686
Why did he still believe that the war was going on, when the rest of the world had moved on?

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:36.216
The year was 1974, man had already travelled to the moon,

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:41.016
Beatlemania had come and gone, even The Cold War was cooling down.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.996
The Second World War was ancient history, but for this one man,

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:51.596
it had permeated every inch of his life for over thirty years.

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:59.966
As some brief background, Onoda had joined the Japanese army in 1942, at the age of twenty.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:05.696
He was selected for specialist training and sent to the Nakano school,

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:09.416
which was like a finishing school for intelligence officers, effectively.

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:14.376
He studied the arts of covert operations and guerilla

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:17.626
warfare, as well as martial arts and propaganda.

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:23.156
Keep this in mind, because these skills become crucial further down the line.

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:28.986
In December 1944, Onoda was sent to Lubang, a

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:32.556
strategically significant island southwest of Manila Bay.

00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:39.296
As a quick reminder of what was going on in the Western Pacific, Japan had invaded

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:44.946
the Philippines back in December 1941, just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbour.

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:51.146
The Philippines at the time was a semi-independent state under the control of the Americans.

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:57.456
The Japanese forces occupied the Philippines from 1942 to 1944,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.336
but they met fierce resistance from Filipino and American forces.

00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:06.726
The Philippines, as you may know, is a collection of more than

00:05:06.726 --> 00:05:11.056
7,000 islands, which makes life tricky for any unwelcome occupier.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:19.896
In October of 1944, American, Filipino, Mexican and Australian forces landed on

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:25.226
the Philippine island of Leyte, and started to push the Japanese out of the island.

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:30.826
The idea was to use the Philippines as a base, or at

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:34.626
least a stepping stone, for a further attack on Japan.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.586
Now, back to Hiroo Onoda.

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:44.946
He was sent to the Filipino island of Lubang in 1944 to resist the American invasion.

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:51.376
Onoda’s superiors had instructed him and his fellow soldiers to

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:55.736
destroy airstrips in the hope of disrupting the American forces.

00:05:57.316 --> 00:06:01.846
When the American forces landed on Lubang a couple of months later, on the

00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:07.736
28th of February, 1945, there was a brief battle but the small Japanese

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:12.256
forces were no match for the invaders, and they were quickly overpowered.

00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:16.996
The Japanese soldiers that weren’t killed began to

00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:20.991
surrender or evacuate the island, fearing for their lives.

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:28.827
But as Onoda planned his own escape, his superior, a Major named Yoshimi

00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:33.257
Taniguchi, said something that would change the course of Onoda’s life.

00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:39.537
He told Onoda that he shouldn’t evacuate, like the rest of the men,

00:06:39.847 --> 00:06:44.947
but hold his position and conduct guerrilla warfare, which was one

00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:48.347
of his specialties, it was something that he was trained to do.

00:06:49.437 --> 00:06:54.743
So, Onoda and three other Japanese soldiers stayed on Lubang.

00:06:55.977 --> 00:06:59.247
“It may take three years, it may take five,” the major

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:03.147
told them, “but whatever happens we’ll come back for you.”

00:07:04.747 --> 00:07:12.237
Little did Taniguchi realise, but this young, loyal soldier was to take this order very literally

00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:19.557
indeed, and that Taniguchi would have to personally return almost 30 years later to keep his word.

00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:26.827
Now, when Japan officially surrendered in September of 1945, there were thousands

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:32.187
of Japanese soldiers spread out across Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.

00:07:33.437 --> 00:07:39.491
Lots of them simply went home, others were captured or killed, but many of them went

00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:46.151
into hiding and continued fighting, preferring to die with honour than to be captured.

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:53.841
As you may know, dying with honour during battle is deeply entrenched in Japanese culture.

00:07:54.881 --> 00:08:01.241
Samurais would often kill themselves instead of being captured, a process called seppuku or

00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:07.271
hara-kiri, where they would thrust a sword into their stomach and then turn the blade upwards.

00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:15.201
And in the Second World War, this cultural idea of dying with honour manifested itself

00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:21.261
as Kamikaze, which was the act of Japanese pilots flying their planes into military

00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:26.761
targets, killing themselves in the process but inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:34.481
The point is that honour and integrity are of the utmost importance in Japanese culture.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:41.271
And for Hiroo Onoda, his word, his promise, was clearly unbreakable.

00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:46.111
His major had told him to stay, and that he would come back for him.

00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:48.751
An order was an order.

00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:54.921
So, he and his three colleagues withdrew to the high ground, into the

00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:59.511
thick jungle forest in the foothills of the mountains, in early 1945.

00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:04.101
Later that year, as you’ll know, the war ended.

00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:07.681
The Japanese emperor announced the country’s surrender on

00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:13.361
August 15th 1945, and it was officially signed on September 2nd.

00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:16.261
The war was over, finally.

00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:21.991
But not for Hiroo Onoda, who, let’s remember, had retreated into the thick

00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:27.081
jungle, away from any other signs of humanity, cut off from the world.

00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:31.051
But not completely cut off, in fact.

00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:36.451
In October 1945, the men found some leaflets that had been

00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:39.401
dropped into the jungle claiming that the war was over.

00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.791
But they thought that the leaflets were enemy

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:46.171
propaganda trying to trick them out of their positions.

00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:50.911
These men had studied propaganda techniques at the Nakano school, let's remember.

00:09:51.971 --> 00:09:57.581
Onoda would later talk about this, explaining that, and I’m quoting directly, "The leaflets

00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:02.871
they dropped were filled with mistakes so I judged it was a plot by the Americans.”

00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:11.601
Slowly time went on, but there was no sign of the reinforcements the major had promised.

00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:17.095
Weeks became months which slowly became years, and the men lived off

00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:22.015
the land, staying deep in the Lubang jungle and constantly on the move.

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:27.665
They built shacks from bamboo, basic houses made out of bamboo.

00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:33.595
They lived on bananas and coconuts and killed cows and other animals for food.

00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:38.105
They even stole rice and other food from local villages.

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:43.099
The tropical heat was suffocating, and the jungle filled with

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:47.999
mosquitoes and rats, but they maintained their discipline, taking

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:51.789
care of their rifles and uniforms as though they were active soldiers.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.289
In their minds, they were active soldiers.

00:10:56.309 --> 00:11:00.929
In an interview given many years later, Onoda described what he saw as his

00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:07.826
role: "Every Japanese soldier was prepared for death,” he said, “but as an

00:11:07.826 --> 00:11:13.676
intelligence officer I was ordered to conduct guerrilla warfare and not to die.”

00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:20.846
Incredibly, Onoda didn’t die and managed to live this way for almost

00:11:20.906 --> 00:11:26.406
30 years, holding his position and refusing to surrender until 1974.

00:11:27.546 --> 00:11:33.706
And I really must emphasise here that Onoda wasn’t just hanging out in the jungle on a camping trip.

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:40.006
He and his fellow soldiers regularly had to hide or even attack what they thought

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:45.426
to be American or Filipino soldiers searching for the last Japanese soldiers said to

00:11:45.426 --> 00:11:50.496
be holding out in the jungle, and they had several shootouts with Filipino police.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:58.559
They also attacked locals they mistook for enemies, and it is said that around 30 local villagers

00:11:58.626 --> 00:12:03.456
were killed by the Japanese soldiers who continued fighting the war in the Lubang jungle.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:08.486
After five years of this fairly miserable existence, however,

00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:13.124
one of Onoda’s fellow soldiers gave in and surrendered in 1950.

00:12:14.456 --> 00:12:18.396
When he finally returned to Japan, he told people about the three

00:12:18.396 --> 00:12:22.866
soldiers left in the jungle of Lubang, but there was no great plan

00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:26.366
or interest in going back to look for them, not at that point anyway.

00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:33.427
A couple of years later another of Onoda's colleagues was shot while attacking a fishing village.

00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:40.697
Onoda cared for him and helped him recover from his leg wound - no mean feat given

00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:45.057
that they were in the sweltering jungle without access to any kind of medical support.

00:12:46.324 --> 00:12:50.317
But in the end it proved futile, pointless, because

00:12:50.487 --> 00:12:54.717
the same man was shot dead in 1954 by a search party.

00:12:55.927 --> 00:13:00.677
Now they were down to two: Onoda and a man named Kozuka.

00:13:02.017 --> 00:13:06.687
In 1959 the pair were officially declared dead, the Japanese

00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:09.697
military simply assuming that they must have died by now.

00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:12.877
It would be impossible to survive that long, right?

00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:19.687
But the men continued to hide out, hunting and stealing food, cleaning their

00:13:19.687 --> 00:13:24.427
rifles and samurai swords, waiting for the promised reinforcements to arrive.

00:13:25.907 --> 00:13:31.077
In October 1972, Filipino police again set off into the jungle

00:13:31.197 --> 00:13:34.997
to look for the men, and stumbled across them stealing rice.

00:13:36.247 --> 00:13:39.797
In the gun battle that followed, Kozuka was shot and killed.

00:13:41.207 --> 00:13:45.697
Now they were down to one; Hiroo Onoda was alone.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:50.955
I think it’s safe to say that many people would give up in that

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:55.475
situation, but Onoda had his orders and intended to keep them.

00:13:57.035 --> 00:14:01.825
Though most people in Japan assumed Onoda had perished in the jungle, others

00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:06.855
were becoming intrigued by the legend of this last soldier refusing to surrender.

00:14:07.719 --> 00:14:12.808
After Kozuka’s body was flown back to Japan and it became clear that he had

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:17.928
indeed survived all that time, it became a pretty big deal in the Japanese media.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:25.458
Stories of a mysterious Japanese soldier hiding out in the jungle filled the media and

00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:32.928
fascinated the public, and in February of 1974, a Japanese explorer named Norio Suzuki

00:14:33.208 --> 00:14:39.478
arrived in Lubang determined to try and find this mystery man, this urban legend.

00:14:40.518 --> 00:14:45.385
After four days of trekking through the jungle, Suzuki eventually found Onoda.

00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:50.928
Of course, Suzuki told him that the war was over, and had

00:14:50.928 --> 00:14:55.878
ended decades ago, but still Onoda refused to leave his post.

00:14:56.298 --> 00:15:01.598
He wouldn’t go anywhere until he had received orders from a military superior, he said.

00:15:03.205 --> 00:15:06.975
When Suzuki went back to Japan, he showed the Japanese

00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:10.955
government photos of him and Onoda together in the jungle.

00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:15.205
Now, there was proof: Hiroo Onoda was alive.

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:18.025
Clearly, something had to be done.

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.875
His major, his superior, needed to be found.

00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:27.055
Fortunately, the government managed to find Major Taniguchi, the man

00:15:27.055 --> 00:15:30.265
who had told Onoda that he would come back for him all those years ago,

00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:35.185
who was by then long retired from the military and was now a bookseller.

00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:44.285
The following month, in March 1974, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, or rather, bookseller Yoshimi

00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:50.435
Taniguchi, travelled to Lubang and persuaded Onoda to finally give up his weapons and surrender.

00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:56.865
He travelled with one of Onoda’s brothers, as well as a delegation from the Japanese government.

00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:04.645
And after tracking him down in the jungle, Major Taniguchi was finally able to keep his word.

00:16:05.505 --> 00:16:07.765
Stand down, Lieutenant Onoda.

00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:12.225
But it hadn’t taken three years, or five, like he had

00:16:12.225 --> 00:16:16.455
promised on that day in 1945, it had taken 29 years.

00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:20.748
When he was asked what he thought about when spending all those years in

00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:25.935
the jungle, Onoda simply replied, “Nothing but accomplishing my duty.”

00:16:27.555 --> 00:16:32.045
So, with Onoda’s war finally now over, what did he do next?

00:16:32.215 --> 00:16:35.555
What would you do after spending almost 30 years in the jungle?

00:16:36.685 --> 00:16:39.525
To have missed such a huge period of time, and then be

00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:43.725
dropped into 1974, must have been quite the culture shock.

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:51.045
When Onoda left Japan in the 1940s, he left a relatively undeveloped country of wooden

00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:58.455
houses; when he returned in 1974 it was a place of television and skyscrapers and technology.

00:17:00.015 --> 00:17:05.225
Of these changes, Onoda said: “There are so many tall buildings and automobiles in

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:10.075
Tokyo… Television might be convenient, but it has no influence on my life here.”

00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:16.995
Clearly, adapting to modern Japan, to the modern world, was going to take some work.

00:17:18.255 --> 00:17:19.665
So, what did he do?

00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:24.465
Well, as you can imagine, people were keen to see and meet this mystery

00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:28.682
man; the soldier who had spent almost three decades  in the jungle.

00:17:30.252 --> 00:17:35.277
When he finally made it back to his homeland, Onoda was given a hero’s welcome and

00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:41.117
offered a generous military pension in thanks for his service, which he in fact refused.

00:17:42.137 --> 00:17:47.499
He wrote a memoir, called “No Surrender: My Thirty Year War, and was

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:51.909
the subject of countless films, documentaries, books and articles.

00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:57.409
But more than anything, Onoda wanted to live a quiet life.

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:01.499
After all, he had been pretty much alone for thirty years.

00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:07.579
He took driving lessons and travelled the length and breadth of the Japanese islands, making

00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:13.389
up for lost time, and even went dancing, trying to enjoy Japan’s bustling new nightlife scene.

00:18:14.982 --> 00:18:19.799
But he found it all a bit overwhelming, and he didn’t stay in Japan for long.

00:18:21.312 --> 00:18:26.472
Just a year after returning home, in 1975 Onoda moved to a

00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:30.602
Japanese colony in São Paulo, in Brazil, to raise animals.

00:18:31.552 --> 00:18:37.932
In 1976 he got married and the couple stayed in Brazil until 1984, when they

00:18:37.932 --> 00:18:43.852
returned to Japan and opened the Onoda Nature School, a survival-skills youth camp.

00:18:44.622 --> 00:18:48.932
Clearly, this was an area in which Onoda had more experience the most.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:57.422
In 1996, he returned to Lubang and donated $10,000 to a school, but he

00:18:57.422 --> 00:19:01.622
wasn’t welcomed by the locals who somewhat understandably never really

00:19:01.622 --> 00:19:05.952
forgave him for the 30 or so people he had killed there while hiding out.

00:19:06.982 --> 00:19:12.632
Indeed, there is a documentary being made about him at the moment that questions this idea of

00:19:12.842 --> 00:19:19.872
him being a war hero, and instead portrays him as a cold-hearted murderer of innocent Filipinos.

00:19:21.312 --> 00:19:26.612
He would eventually be pardoned by the Philippine government, although not forgiven by all of its

00:19:26.612 --> 00:19:33.842
citizens, and he would live to the ripe old age of 91, before dying in Tokyo in January of 2014.

00:19:34.992 --> 00:19:37.912
So, how did he do it, you might be asking yourself?

00:19:38.242 --> 00:19:43.782
How does one manage to survive practically alone in the jungle, trapped in a time warp?

00:19:44.772 --> 00:19:48.972
And how does it affect you to find that thirty years of your life

00:19:49.112 --> 00:19:53.452
were a lie, or at least, you believed something that wasn’t true?

00:19:54.602 --> 00:20:00.432
Did he go completely mad, was he insane, or was he simply a devoted soldier?

00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:06.622
Interestingly enough, when he did return to Japan and was examined by medical

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:11.422
professionals they didn’t find that he was suffering from any kind of mental condition.

00:20:12.497 --> 00:20:18.022
It seemed that he was just the epitome of the devoted, loyal soldier, a

00:20:18.022 --> 00:20:23.192
man who was, in his mind, simply doing his duty, following his orders.

00:20:24.492 --> 00:20:29.042
He was reported to have said later on in life, “men should never give up.

00:20:29.512 --> 00:20:30.352
I never do”.

00:20:31.612 --> 00:20:37.112
Now, you might agree with this, you might not, but you can’t deny it’s a motto that

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:43.102
Hiroo Onoda lived by, even if it resulted in spending three decades in the jungle.

00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:52.232
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on Hiroo Onoda, the soldier who refused to surrender.

00:20:52.842 --> 00:20:57.182
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about him or this was the first

00:20:57.192 --> 00:21:01.952
time you’d ever heard anything about his incredible story, well I hope you learned something new.

00:21:03.082 --> 00:21:06.292
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:06.702 --> 00:21:09.282
How long do you think you would last out in the jungle?

00:21:09.782 --> 00:21:15.302
Have you heard of any stories similar to Hiroo Onoda’s, whether in World War Two or in another war?

00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:19.282
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

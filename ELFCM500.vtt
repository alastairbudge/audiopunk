Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.069
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.040
I'm Alastair Budge, and this is a special episode.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.830
Yes, it is episode number 500, so to mark the occasion we are going

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.230
to deviate from our usual style of weird and wonderful stories.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.940
Instead, I am going to talk to you about this milestone, what

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.600
it means for me, for the business, and where we go from here.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:46.782
Ok then, let’s get right into it, shall we?

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:53.302
If you look through lists of things that you should and shouldn’t do after having

00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:58.822
a baby, especially your first child, most of it probably won’t surprise you.

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:03.842
You’d probably find recommendations about spending some quality time

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:07.192
with your partner before the baby comes, whether that’s going out

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.752
for coffee or dinner or just having a calm walk in a park together.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:16.372
Maybe someone would advise you to get some of those black-out

00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:20.352
blinds so that your baby can sleep more easily during the day.

00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:26.222
Someone else might suggest not organising anything for the first few weeks, as you’ll be

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:31.282
tired, you never know what might happen, you know, it’s best just to play things by ear.

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:36.612
One recommendation some people might give you is to not start anything

00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:40.342
new, as you will already have enough changes going on in your life.

00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:47.042
And especially not starting something that requires peace and quiet, and no background noise.

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:54.802
Most people probably have the good sense to realise this, but five years ago, I didn’t.

00:01:55.592 --> 00:02:00.412
Just a few weeks before my first son was born, I wrote and recorded

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:04.692
the first episode of this podcast: English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:12.492
Fast forward to today, almost five years later, and this is episode number 500.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:20.192
As we are now halfway to a thousand, I wanted to mark this milestone by sharing a little bit

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:26.512
about the behind-the-scenes of the podcast, about our listeners, and how the sausage is made.

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:31.042
But the first thing I want to say is thank you.

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:36.372
Whether you've been listening since episode one, the very first episode,

00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:40.372
or whether you have only just started listening, you’re amazing.

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:47.212
And if you've listened to every single episode, all 500, and especially if you are not my

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:54.092
parents, thank you very much, you've spent more than 150 hours listening to me blabbering on.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:57.622
I hope you’ve enjoyed it, and that you will continue

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:01.622
to enjoy it as we get to episode 1,000 and beyond.

00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:07.742
Now, thank yous out of the way, let me start by telling you a bit about how the

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:14.082
sausage gets made, how we go from a kernel of an idea through to the finished product.

00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:18.532
Well, we have quite an extensive research process.

00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:22.502
For a while, I used to work with a small team of

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.972
researchers, but in fact I now do almost all of this myself.

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:31.712
It normally involves reading books, academic papers,

00:03:31.822 --> 00:03:36.282
documentaries, articles online, and a fair bit of Wikipedia.

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:40.912
There is then the writing of the script, the reviewing,

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:45.182
the redrafting, reviewing again, and hopefully, that’s it.

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:51.252
It is a lot of fun to do, but it’s tough because the more I learn about any

00:03:51.252 --> 00:03:56.712
kind of topic, the harder it is to condense it into a 20-minute episode.

00:03:57.402 --> 00:04:02.272
There are always, and I mean always, large bits of really interesting

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:07.172
information that I need to cut out in order to make sure it doesn’t get too long.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:14.842
This leads to tonnes of emails from people saying “You should have mentioned x or y”, but

00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:20.542
hey, the objective with every episode is to tell the most interesting and relevant bits of

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:26.892
the story and if people feel inspired to go and research it themselves, then that’s great.

00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:32.262
They will no doubt find other interesting elements that didn’t make it into the final script.

00:04:33.352 --> 00:04:39.242
A few people have asked me how much I use tools like ChatGPT in the research and

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:44.842
writing process, and the answer is that I don’t really use it at all during the

00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:51.242
writing process because I find the output to sound quite unlike my style, but it

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:55.922
is pretty useful when it comes to reviewing and suggesting areas for improvement.

00:04:57.342 --> 00:05:01.672
Then, when the script is ready, there’s the recording of the episode.

00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:07.642
On one level, this is the easy bit because it involves reading out a

00:05:07.652 --> 00:05:13.602
pre-written script, but it might surprise you that even after 500 episodes I

00:05:13.602 --> 00:05:18.042
still make loads of mistakes and often have to re-record large parts of it.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:23.872
Then there’s the audio editing, cleaning the sound, removing

00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:27.592
any background noise, and fixing any errors or re-takes.

00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:34.882
At the beginning I did all of this by myself, I think I did the first 100

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:40.412
episodes or so, but my wonderful editor, Ezequiel, has been doing this ever since.

00:05:41.102 --> 00:05:45.042
So if you think that the audio sounds good, which I

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:48.532
certainly do, well it is he that you need to thank.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:54.552
When that’s all done I go through the finished audio, I select all of the

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:58.712
more advanced words and expressions that will be defined in our study packs.

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:06.002
There are normally around 100 of these more advanced words, which we create custom definitions for.

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:12.322
After that the transcript is passed over to our in-house teacher, Fokion, who

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:17.802
meticulously prepares each of the study packs, creates custom definitions for each word

00:06:17.802 --> 00:06:23.482
or expression, makes the quizzes and turns them into top-quality learning materials.

00:06:24.352 --> 00:06:28.772
And then there's the finding the right image, writing descriptions, publishing

00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:33.102
it on our website, creating a version for YouTube, and all of that sort of stuff.

00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:41.732
Each episode is around 20 minutes long, but behind the scenes, all in all, it

00:06:41.732 --> 00:06:47.792
takes something like 20 or 30 hours to go from an idea for an episode through

00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:52.632
to the final, published audio version, complete with all the learning materials.

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:57.492
Sometimes it is quicker, if it’s a subject I know a lot about already,

00:06:57.972 --> 00:07:02.072
sometimes it’s a lot longer if it requires a much more extensive

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:06.092
research process, like the bumper one we just did on Haiti, for example.

00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:11.202
Now, what else can I tell you about “behind the scenes”?

00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:16.362
Well, you listen to this show, but how about I tell you about

00:07:16.632 --> 00:07:19.702
where some of your other fellow curious minds come from?

00:07:21.252 --> 00:07:27.032
Podcasts are funny because you put one out into the world and if you don’t have

00:07:27.032 --> 00:07:32.232
a large budget to promote it like I didn’t, you just sort of hope that people

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:36.432
will find it, recommend it to their friends, and continue listening to it.

00:07:37.502 --> 00:07:42.362
And this has happened beyond my wildest dreams and expectations.

00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:47.452
We have listeners from all over the world, and by the time you listen to

00:07:47.452 --> 00:07:52.702
this, the show will probably have been downloaded more than 8 million times.

00:07:53.602 --> 00:07:59.782
It sounds like a lot, maybe it is a lot, but it still seems small when you think about

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:05.492
how many people around the world are learning English, either officially or unofficially.

00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:10.322
We definitely have a lot more room to grow, and perhaps when

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:15.262
we get to episode number 1,000 that number will be 80 million.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:15.972
Who knows.

00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:24.132
In terms of where most of your other, fellow listeners are, it really is split all over the world.

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:33.232
Europe is responsible for around 45% of our listeners, another 33% are in Asia, there

00:08:33.232 --> 00:08:41.102
are around 10% in both North and South America, 3% in Africa and 1.5% in Australia.

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:48.972
Breaking it down even further, for reasons I have never been completely sure of, Spain has

00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:54.932
always been the most popular country for this podcast, making up around 14% of all listeners.

00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:59.932
It’s followed by Germany, Turkey, Brazil, Iran and Italy,

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:04.362
which all account for between 4 and 5% of listeners.

00:09:05.832 --> 00:09:10.572
Now, as you may know, this little business started with this

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:15.042
podcast, but we’ve since expanded to do quite a lot of other stuff.

00:09:15.612 --> 00:09:20.672
We made a business English course, we’ve done a live Academy, our new story-based courses

00:09:20.672 --> 00:09:25.672
have been particularly popular, and we also have our membership, which gives people access

00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:31.822
to stuff like our interactive transcripts, instant translations, study packs, and even live

00:09:31.852 --> 00:09:37.392
challenges, like the one that’s going on as I’m making this episode,  on the theme of Roald Dahl.

00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:44.502
There is a lot going on, but the core and the heart of the business, where

00:09:44.782 --> 00:09:49.862
everything emanates from, is this podcast, English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:55.192
Fortunately, the podcast is made possible by thousands of paying

00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:59.682
members from over 100 countries now, which is a wonderful thing.

00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:06.452
It means we don’t have to rely on adding annoying adverts for Coca-Cola or dishwasher tablets

00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:13.392
or Hyundai cars, and the few times that we have accepted sponsors, these have been for products

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:18.672
that I truly believe align with our mission of helping people like you improve their English.

00:10:19.482 --> 00:10:24.102
Without the thousands of members who support our work, this podcast wouldn’t

00:10:24.112 --> 00:10:28.912
be possible, so if you are a member, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

00:10:29.932 --> 00:10:34.702
As you may know, if you've been following this podcast’s journey from the start, we've

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:40.312
been making two episodes a week of English Learning for Curious Minds: a bonus one

00:10:40.342 --> 00:10:45.672
on a Tuesday that you need to be a member to listen to, and one on a Friday that’s

00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:50.532
made available for free to listen on all podcast apps, and now also on YouTube.

00:10:51.522 --> 00:10:56.972
This has been the case almost from the start, so a total of 500 episodes.

00:10:57.472 --> 00:11:01.992
But, going forward, we are going to make a change to our production schedule.

00:11:03.192 --> 00:11:08.022
Instead of releasing two new episodes a week, the member-only bonus one on

00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:12.752
Tuesday and the free one on a Friday, we are going to release one per week.

00:11:13.842 --> 00:11:19.362
Members will, of course, continue to get all episodes, but if you are listening on the

00:11:19.372 --> 00:11:25.502
free feed, you’ll get new episodes once every two weeks instead of once every week.

00:11:26.862 --> 00:11:30.002
The old episodes are going nowhere, you can still continue

00:11:30.002 --> 00:11:32.522
to catch up on those if you haven’t listened to them already.

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:39.942
But from now on we’ll publish a new one on the free feed every two weeks instead of every week.

00:11:40.752 --> 00:11:43.612
Now, why are we doing this, you might be wondering?

00:11:44.082 --> 00:11:48.932
Well, there are two main reasons, that come from different directions.

00:11:49.722 --> 00:11:52.922
Firstly, thousands of English learners have joined

00:11:52.922 --> 00:11:55.662
as members and started to learn with our resources.

00:11:56.232 --> 00:12:02.192
It’s been just fantastic to see, but there is a recurring theme.

00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:07.512
We now make so much, and we have so many episodes for people

00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:11.162
to choose from, that many people don’t know where to start.

00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:16.232
I get questions all the time from new members asking about how to

00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:19.672
choose episodes, how to use our study packs and vocabulary lists,

00:12:20.022 --> 00:12:24.582
essentially how to use everything we provide to learn most efficiently.

00:12:25.582 --> 00:12:32.582
And I get it, there are now 500 episodes, that’s more than 150 hours worth of

00:12:32.582 --> 00:12:38.432
listening, and study packs containing something like 20,000 unique words and phrases,

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:43.562
pieces of advanced vocabulary, thousands of comprehension questions and so on.

00:12:44.252 --> 00:12:50.362
It is a huge amount to process, and I’ve heard from lots of people that they feel like

00:12:50.382 --> 00:12:55.372
they can never catch up, we make new episodes faster than they can listen to them.

00:12:56.862 --> 00:13:00.842
For a new member, it would take almost a week of listening

00:13:00.852 --> 00:13:05.382
non-stop, 24 hours a day, to catch up on everything we’ve made.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:10.912
And that’s before you take into account the two new episodes every week.

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:14.879
It would be an insane amount of listening to do, and I’m

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:17.949
not surprised that it can be confusing and overwhelming.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:22.289
And there is another reason that comes from a different direction.

00:13:23.229 --> 00:13:28.259
To put it bluntly, keeping up with making two episodes per week in addition to

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:33.839
everything else we are doing is really hard work for our small team, and gives us

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:39.640
almost no time to develop the new learning-focused content that people want and need.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:47.444
Ultimately, what you want to do is to improve your English, and it is my job, my duty even to

00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:52.974
our members, to make sure that my team and I are helping you do that as effectively as possible.

00:13:53.694 --> 00:13:58.194
So, making slightly fewer episodes will give us a bit more breathing

00:13:58.194 --> 00:14:01.964
room and mean that we can continue to make the membership better and

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:06.004
better, which is exciting for me, and hopefully exciting for you.

00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:12.094
Now, I understand that if you’ve been listening loyally for 5 years, and

00:14:12.364 --> 00:14:17.364
patiently looking forward to every new episode, this news might be disappointing.

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.874
We are making slightly fewer episodes, there’s no getting around that.

00:14:22.644 --> 00:14:27.424
But I hope that this explains the rationale behind why we are making this decision.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:32.734
Our mission of building the most interesting place to improve your English hasn’t

00:14:32.734 --> 00:14:38.394
changed, and my hope is that this next stage will allow us to make this podcast

00:14:38.434 --> 00:14:43.194
better and better, and help you improve your English in a more interesting way.

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:50.214
Thank you for being part of this journey, and I really hope you’ll stick around for the next stage.

00:14:51.634 --> 00:14:56.194
OK then, that is it for this unusual episode, a celebration of a

00:14:56.194 --> 00:15:00.394
milestone that’s just a number, but an important one nevertheless.

00:15:01.024 --> 00:15:03.719
As always, I’d love to hear from you.

00:15:03.764 --> 00:15:05.534
How long have you been listening to this show?

00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:08.814
Do you remember what the first episode you listened to was?

00:15:09.264 --> 00:15:12.034
What can we do to make it better for you?

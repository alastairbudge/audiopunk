Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:17.328
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:21.568
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:29.088
I'm Alastair Budge, and this is our first episode of 2022, so firstly, Happy New Year.

00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:33.808
I hope that 2022 will be filled with good news, curious

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:36.808
learning, and some fun progress with your English.

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:41.326
We are going to start off this year by talking about

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:44.566
Bellingcat and The Rise of The Citizen Detective.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:51.356
It’s a story of mystery, of decentralisation, of Russian spies, of a

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:56.446
democratisation of intelligence, of what happens when you put a lot of

00:00:56.446 --> 00:01:01.236
problem-solvers together, and of the magic of technological progress.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:05.766
We have a lot to talk about, so let’s not waste a minute.

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:13.156
When you think of what a detective, an investigative reporter or someone working

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:18.386
for the intelligence services does, you might think of different types of people.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:27.166
Perhaps you might think of the spies of the Cold War, using fake passports and speaking perfect

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:33.946
unaccented foreign languages, seducing people with their charm to get information, or sitting

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:39.796
in their cars with a pair of binoculars waiting to spot someone coming out of a building.

00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:47.936
Or perhaps you are imagining a more high-tech world, you might be imagining a large room with lots

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:54.596
of people wearing security badges sitting in front of computers, perhaps there is a huge screen

00:01:54.596 --> 00:02:01.216
on the wall with satellite imagery that is zooming in on a remote piece of desert or woodland.

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:08.326
Something you probably aren’t imagining is someone who looks just like me or you, sitting

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:14.036
on their sofa in their pyjamas with their laptop, a cup of tea and a biscuit next to them

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:20.006
while the TV is on in the background and their children are running around the kitchen table.

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:26.656
But the reality is that this third category of detective, the citizen

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:31.496
detective or citizen journalist, is one that has been enabled by

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:36.366
recent technology, and is taking the intelligence world by storm.

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:45.243
One such person who falls perfectly into this third category is a man called Eliot Higgins.

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:52.253
He had tried his hand at a career in traditional journalism, but never quite made it.

00:02:53.383 --> 00:03:00.993
He had been working a series of administrative jobs, and it was during the civil war in Libya,

00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:09.463
in 2011, that he started to develop an interest in solving news-related problems on the internet.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:15.113
In 2011, the iPhone had been out for 4 years.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:19.263
Mobile phone ownership was growing fast all over the world,

00:03:19.493 --> 00:03:23.223
as was mobile internet, and with it, social networks.

00:03:23.873 --> 00:03:29.643
Anyone could take a picture or video, upload it to the internet, and create news.

00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:34.423
Of course, there were still plenty of traditional journalists

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:39.673
covering the conflict in Libya, but it was hard for them to keep up.

00:03:40.843 --> 00:03:45.513
Anyone could upload a picture to Twitter with a caption of what

00:03:45.513 --> 00:03:50.933
it was, and suddenly that became “information”, it became “news”.

00:03:52.053 --> 00:04:00.053
With this came the power for misinformation, both from governments and individual actors.

00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:05.005
A picture could be uploaded with a caption, some text

00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:08.343
claiming that this was what the picture represented.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:15.723
This could be used to confuse the enemy or to make people abroad believe something that wasn’t true.

00:04:16.713 --> 00:04:23.683
Higgins was a competitive person by nature, and he became super interested in trying to discover

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:30.313
the truth behind pictures that had been uploaded by soldiers fighting in the Libyan civil war.

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:37.663
When a rebel soldier uploaded a video of a town that he said had recently been

00:04:37.663 --> 00:04:43.283
captured from government forces, how could Higgins check whether this was true?

00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:49.663
Well, by 2011 there was plenty of freely available technology that

00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:53.933
allowed anyone to investigate this from the comfort of their own home.

00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:57.933
And this is exactly what Higgins started to do.

00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:03.323
He used satellite software such as Google Earth, he would look for

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:08.693
information hidden within the photo to try to understand more about it,

00:05:08.693 --> 00:05:14.133
he would use any publicly available information to try to find the truth.

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:21.693
He started out by engaging with people on the comment section of the British Guardian newspaper,

00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:29.183
but before long he started a blog, and then his own company, a non-profit called Bellingcat.

00:05:30.223 --> 00:05:37.763
It started out as a niche, small hobby project, but within a few years Bellingcat

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:43.983
became a household name in the intelligence community, and is an organisation that has

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:49.803
been referenced by the CIA, by the British Intelligence Services, and has even been

00:05:49.813 --> 00:05:55.663
labelled a “foreign agent” by Russia, for reasons that will become clear in a minute.

00:05:57.233 --> 00:06:03.613
Along the way Bellingcat has transformed the way in which intelligence is gathered, allowing

00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:11.013
and encouraging anyone, anywhere, yes even me and you, to get involved in finding the truth.

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:18.893
Higgins’ and Bellingcat’s first major success was in relation to the Malaysian Airlines Flight

00:06:18.903 --> 00:06:26.473
17, the aeroplane which was shot down over Ukraine on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:35.223
To briefly remind you of what happened, on 17th July 2014, which was actually only

00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:41.083
two days after the Bellingcat website went live, this passenger aeroplane was shot

00:06:41.113 --> 00:06:48.503
down over Eastern Ukraine, killing all 283 passengers and 15 members of the crew.

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:54.573
The finger was quickly pointed at Russian-backed rebels in Eastern Ukraine.

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:59.013
It’s believed that they thought they had shot a Ukrainian

00:06:59.023 --> 00:07:03.153
military plane, but accidentally shot a Malaysian plane.

00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:08.103
Although it was strongly suspected that this attack was made possible

00:07:08.273 --> 00:07:13.693
with Russian state support, it was hard to prove, and it was also hard to

00:07:13.693 --> 00:07:19.073
prove exactly who had shot the plane down and with what type of missile.

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:26.316
Higgins got to work, and through a series of images he managed to track down on social media

00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:33.476
he found a video of a missile launcher travelling through Russia in a military convoy, then

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:40.456
he found another video of it in Ukraine returning to Russia with one missile missing from it.

00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:42.236
Bingo.

00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:49.935
Higgins had managed, from the comfort of his home in England and completely on his own, what none

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:56.285
of the multi-million dollar intelligence agencies in Europe and the United States had managed.

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:59.105
And the successes continued.

00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:03.775
Bellingcat exposed the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons

00:08:04.015 --> 00:08:08.445
during the Syrian war, and the use of drones to kill civilians.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:16.075
And Higgins was not afraid to shine a light on the actions of Western governments as well.

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:23.995
On March 16, 2017, a bomb was dropped on a mosque in Aleppo, Syria,

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:28.235
killing over 50 people who were there for the evening prayer.

00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:35.935
Most posts on social media and news stories blamed the Syrian government or Russia,

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:43.995
but after trawling through images and videos of the event, of satellite imagery and of

00:08:44.005 --> 00:08:50.635
thousands of other images of similar attacks, Bellingcat provided very compelling evidence

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:56.885
that it was actually the Pentagon, the US military that was responsible for the attack.

00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:04.045
The biggest scoop to date, the biggest success story for Bellingcat, was still to come.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:12.385
On 4th March 2018, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian secret service agent,

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:17.325
and his daughter Yulia, were poisoned with the nerve-agent Novichock,

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:22.585
while living in the otherwise very sleepy English town of Salisbury.

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:28.175
Skripal had been a double-agent for the British, he had been passing information

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:34.175
to the British secret service in the 1990s, and had spent six years in Russian

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:40.525
prison before being allowed to move to the UK, where he lived a very quiet life.

00:09:41.575 --> 00:09:45.915
When Skripal and his daughter were poisoned, the finger was immediately

00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:50.675
pointed at Russia, and really, to the man at the top, Vladimir Putin.

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:58.055
The poison was quickly identified as Novichok, a poison developed in Russia in the

00:09:58.225 --> 00:10:05.185
1980s, and one that was known to be used by the GRU, the Russian secret service agency.

00:10:06.025 --> 00:10:10.995
It’s almost as if Putin wanted to make this very clear that this was

00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:15.975
a state-sponsored murder and it wouldn’t have been the first time.

00:10:16.735 --> 00:10:20.005
Another Russian ex-secret service agent, Alexander

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:24.985
Litvinenko, had been poisoned with polonium in 2006.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:33.655
Litvinenko had become an enemy of the Russian state, and had fled to London in a bid to stay alive.

00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:39.205
But, he was murdered, poisoned, and in fact died in the hospital

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:42.685
next to my former university, University College London.

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:48.795
With the poisoning of Litvinenko and of Skripal it’s believed that Putin wanted to

00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:54.275
send a message to any other Russian secret service agent that was thinking of betraying

00:10:54.275 --> 00:11:00.095
their country that you couldn’t hide - eventually you would be found and murdered.

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:07.842
Skripal and his daughter were rushed to hospital, but unlike Litvinenko, they recovered.

00:11:08.642 --> 00:11:12.552
Of course, this was a major diplomatic incident.

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:16.242
There was an attempted double murder on British soil,

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:19.712
and a foreign state was thought to be responsible.

00:11:20.802 --> 00:11:27.692
In August of that year, after all diplomatic avenues had been exhausted, the then British Prime

00:11:27.692 --> 00:11:34.422
Minister, Theresa May, published the faces and names of the two men that British Intelligence

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:42.802
forces believed had carried out the attack: Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov, but saying

00:11:42.812 --> 00:11:48.112
that it was believed that these names were pseudonyms, that they weren’t their real names.

00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:55.522
With the photos and names of these two men now publicly available, Bellingcat got to work.

00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:01.892
The Bellingcat team had by then expanded dramatically, and consisted

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:06.862
of both full-time employees and volunteers, people like me or you

00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:11.282
armed only with an internet connection and desire to seek the truth.

00:12:12.092 --> 00:12:16.932
They had the images of the two men, so they had a broad age range.

00:12:17.472 --> 00:12:21.402
This meant they must have attended military school during a

00:12:21.402 --> 00:12:25.572
particular period, and would likely have trained in Siberia.

00:12:26.482 --> 00:12:31.712
Bellingcat went through databases of graduates of military schools, looked

00:12:31.722 --> 00:12:37.232
through photos, yearbooks, and called up other students to ask for information.

00:12:38.002 --> 00:12:43.702
They also managed to buy a black-market database of Russian passport

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:49.272
information - copies of which are reportedly pretty easy and cheap to find online.

00:12:50.322 --> 00:12:56.342
They managed to find a match - they found a man named Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga,

00:12:56.892 --> 00:13:01.572
whose photo directly matched the photo of the man spotted in Salisbury.

00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:06.002
Shortly after they managed to track down the other man

00:13:06.233 --> 00:13:10.123
from sources as varied as a car insurance database.

00:13:10.643 --> 00:13:12.773
They identified him as Dr.

00:13:12.823 --> 00:13:18.553
Alexander Yevgeniyevich Mishkin, and they knew they were onto something when they

00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:23.783
called up ex-classmates of Mishkin’s who revealed that they had been contacted

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:29.423
by Russian authorities and instructed not to reveal any information about him.

00:13:30.073 --> 00:13:37.833
Both Mishkin and Chepiga were GRU agents, and they were a perfect match for the attempted murderers.

00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:43.903
Again, Bellingcat and its team of amateurs and volunteers had managed

00:13:43.913 --> 00:13:48.863
to do what the multi-million pound British intelligence services hadn’t.

00:13:49.753 --> 00:13:57.133
A slightly comic turn in this story is that, despite being caught red handed, Mishkin and Chepiga,

00:13:57.553 --> 00:14:04.323
still using their pseudonyms of Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov, were interviewed by Russian

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:10.703
state TV, where they claimed that they were friends in the fitness industry who had travelled

00:14:10.713 --> 00:14:18.043
directly to Salisbury from Moscow to in order to visit the cathedral and its famous 123 metre spire.

00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:22.913
They weren’t very good assassins, but they were even worse actors.

00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:30.233
The Skripal saga was a real turning point for Bellingcat, and for the citizen journalism movement.

00:14:30.993 --> 00:14:37.063
When Bellingcat first started it was looked down on as a group of eccentric

00:14:37.073 --> 00:14:42.093
hobbyists, people who liked problem-solving and were harmless, but weren’t

00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:46.723
really going to have any impact on the way information gathering was done.

00:14:47.323 --> 00:14:52.763
After the successes with the Malaysian airline, the Syrian civil war, multiple

00:14:52.813 --> 00:14:58.473
other smaller successes and now catching the Russian state engaging in attempted

00:14:58.473 --> 00:15:04.273
murder on foreign soil, the power of the citizen detective was clear for all to see.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:11.513
And since 2011, since Eliot Higgins decided to take an interest in the Civil War,

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:17.773
numerous technological advances have made the life of the citizen detective much easier.

00:15:18.663 --> 00:15:23.953
For starters, every single day, more and more information is shared online.

00:15:24.503 --> 00:15:30.503
From photos, videos, hacked databases, social media posts, the more information

00:15:30.503 --> 00:15:35.593
that’s available online, the more evidence that is for the citizen detective.

00:15:36.063 --> 00:15:40.663
Bellingcat actually publicly releases a step-by-step account

00:15:40.863 --> 00:15:45.953
of exactly how it goes through evidence, and it’s fascinating.

00:15:46.373 --> 00:15:50.753
I’d definitely recommend you reading it - it’s all available on their

00:15:50.773 --> 00:15:56.343
website, bellingcat.com, and there are some excellent resources for how you

00:15:56.343 --> 00:16:00.413
can take part, if that's the sort of thing that sounds interesting to you.

00:16:01.343 --> 00:16:06.543
For example, if an original image file is available, there is lots of

00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:11.523
information that can come attached with it, such as the date and time

00:16:11.523 --> 00:16:15.763
the image was taken, the location, and the device it was taken on.

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:21.023
Google Maps and Google Street View are both excellent resources, of course,

00:16:21.153 --> 00:16:26.573
and when combined with Google Earth and other satellite imagery this allows

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:31.293
citizen detectives to accurately locate where events have taken place.

00:16:32.023 --> 00:16:37.993
Social media posts will also be timestamped, and some will also have location

00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:42.933
data, meaning it’s easy to find out where and when an event happened.

00:16:43.743 --> 00:16:48.713
Bellingcat also uses more complicated techniques, large datasets and

00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:53.693
algorithms to trawl through public data and try to seek the truth.

00:16:54.353 --> 00:17:01.293
And as a result, it is now one of the first resources that intelligence services turn to, it

00:17:01.303 --> 00:17:08.463
has received multiple awards, and as of the time of recording it had a full-time team of 18

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:15.193
full-time employees and more than 30 contributors in over 20 different countries, and thousands

00:17:15.193 --> 00:17:21.963
more volunteers who help comb through publicly available information and try to expose the truth.

00:17:22.723 --> 00:17:27.603
While it might be popular in the West, there’s one country in particular, or at

00:17:27.603 --> 00:17:32.323
least the government of one country, where Bellingcat does not have many friends.

00:17:32.923 --> 00:17:34.383
And that’s Russia.

00:17:34.883 --> 00:17:41.743
Indeed, in October of 2021 Bellingcat was labelled a “foreign agent” by the Russian government.

00:17:42.503 --> 00:17:47.903
The Russian government believes, or at least has publicly accused, Bellingcat

00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:54.303
of being the information warfare department of MI6, of the British Intelligence

00:17:54.303 --> 00:18:00.633
Services, and said that it is a way for the West to publicly distance itself from

00:18:00.633 --> 00:18:06.793
its information-gathering activities while exposing dirt on and embarrassing Russia.

00:18:07.423 --> 00:18:13.393
Now, of course would be an explosive theory, but there seems to be little truth to it.

00:18:14.353 --> 00:18:20.813
Bellingcat continues to expose crimes and injustices committed by countries all over the world,

00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:28.083
including the US and its allies, and Russia is certainly not the only target of its investigations.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.353
It’s certainly convenient, though.

00:18:30.913 --> 00:18:37.823
While UK or US intelligence services are often cautious about revealing what they know,

00:18:38.273 --> 00:18:43.843
because their enemies will be able to investigate how they found out, if Bellingcat

00:18:43.893 --> 00:18:49.053
comes out and says something, and explains how it discovered this through public

00:18:49.063 --> 00:18:55.093
information, then that’s hugely advantageous for the “official” secret service divisions.

00:18:56.293 --> 00:19:00.263
What’s more, Bellingcat has shown that it’s prepared to use

00:19:00.263 --> 00:19:04.813
techniques that government departments, at least officially, are not.

00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:12.923
As part of the Skripal investigation Bellingcat bought black-market passport data, and it

00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:18.173
isn’t afraid to do things that would get a government in a lot of trouble if it were caught.

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:22.983
The example of the citizen detective is a one that is

00:19:23.003 --> 00:19:26.393
only poised to become more common in the coming years.

00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:32.403
Much like it doesn’t take a huge film studio and equipment to make a video that’s put

00:19:32.403 --> 00:19:38.263
on YouTube and seen by hundreds of millions of people, or like anyone can start a blog

00:19:38.473 --> 00:19:44.413
or a podcast that reaches people all over the world, similarly the power of a group of

00:19:44.763 --> 00:19:51.283
decentralised curious researchers, all armed with a curious mind, a laptop, and some

00:19:51.283 --> 00:19:57.533
time on their hands can be just as effective, and in some cases more effective, than the

00:19:57.533 --> 00:20:03.453
highest paid, most qualified and most experienced intelligence officers in the world.

00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:12.093
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Bellingcat and The Rise of The Citizen Detective.

00:20:12.603 --> 00:20:15.693
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:20.513
and that perhaps this episode might have inspired you to take up the

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:24.443
challenge and try to crack some of these internet puzzles yourself.

00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:30.673
If you are the kind of person who enjoys problem solving, then there are some great resources

00:20:30.683 --> 00:20:37.983
on the Bellingcat website - fun games like where you are given a photo, just a photo, with no

00:20:37.983 --> 00:20:43.223
more information and you have to try to figure out where exactly in the world it was taken.

00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:46.013
Give it a go and let me know how you get on.

00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:50.303
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:50.623 --> 00:20:54.043
What do you think about the rise of the citizen journalist?

00:20:54.243 --> 00:20:56.693
What does it mean for the intelligence services?

00:20:56.983 --> 00:21:00.813
And is it something that you think would be fun to get involved in?

00:21:01.203 --> 00:21:04.483
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:10.663
The place for that is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:16.183
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:21.163

Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.099
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.219
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.209
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.749
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.069
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:20.309
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.459
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.329
going to be talking about Karl Lagerfeld

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.529
- one of the most influential fashion

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.999
designers of the 20th and 21st centuries.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.479
His story is one of incredible

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:37.089
creativity, eccentricity, and

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:38.899
a talent for seeing the future.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.239
He enjoyed one of the longest and

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.609
most successful careers in fashion

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:45.789
history, working with some of the most

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:47.979
iconic fashion houses in the world,

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:51.009
yet it’s also the story of a man who

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.209
didn’t quite live up to his potential

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.399
when it came to his own fashion house.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:58.262
So, let’s get right into it, and

00:00:58.262 --> 00:00:59.882
talk about the life and times of

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.642
Karl Lagerfeld, the man sometimes

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.222
called “Kaiser Karl” or simply Karl.

00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:08.652
If you’re interested in fashion, the name

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:11.132
Karl Lagerfeld probably rings a bell.

00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:14.242
You might be familiar with his signature

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:17.402
look - powdered white hair, tied back in

00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:20.762
a ponytail, dark sunglasses, high white

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:23.492
collared shirts, fingerless gloves, and

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:26.042
multiple silver rings on both hands.

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:29.302
You may also know that he was considered

00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:32.252
responsible for revitalising Chanel,

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.932
transforming it from a dusty and

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.762
outdated fashion house to a cultural

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:40.652
icon worth over 10 billion dollars.

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:43.712
But how did this man come to

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:45.382
dominate the world of fashion?

00:01:45.702 --> 00:01:47.992
Why was he so influential?

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:49.922
More importantly, what

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.552
legacy did he leave us with?

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.682
Well, let’s find out.

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:57.962
Karl Lagerfeld was born into a wealthy

00:01:57.982 --> 00:02:01.459
family in Hamburg in Germany, in 1933.

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:03.942
Interestingly enough, though, he

00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:06.092
would always claim to have been born

00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:08.502
later, to try to make people believe

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:10.592
that he was younger than he was.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.762
From a young age, he was a

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:16.672
talented artist, and moved to Paris

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:18.562
when he was only 14 years old.

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:21.212
It didn’t take long for his

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:23.122
fashion career to take off.

00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:26.412
When he was just 21, he

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.572
submitted a coat design to an

00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:30.222
international design competition.

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:33.802
His design won, and the coat was

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:35.572
produced by Pierre Balmain, the

00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:38.222
Parisian designer who founded what would

00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:40.872
become the now-iconic label, Balmain.

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:44.372
Afterwards, Balmain offered him

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.252
a job as his assistant - and

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:48.952
so began his apprenticeship in

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:50.382
the world of luxury fashion.

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:53.852
Lagerfeld, however, wouldn’t be

00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:56.072
the only fashion designer to come

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.002
out of this 1954 competition.

00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:01.137
A Frenchman two years younger than

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:03.137
Lagerfeld would win the cocktail

00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:05.787
dress category, and this man would

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:07.697
go on to have a lifelong friendship

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:09.677
and rivalry with the German.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:11.627
The Frenchman’s name

00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:13.197
was Yves Saint Laurent.

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:15.627
But while Yves Saint Laurent’s

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:18.247
career first went in a haute couture

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:21.027
direction, Lagerfeld was more interested

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.237
in a different sort of designing:

00:03:23.797 --> 00:03:25.837
he wanted to be a ready-to-wear

00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:27.807
designer of high-end clothes.

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:31.087
To briefly explain the difference,

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:33.597
haute couture, or “high fashion”, if

00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:35.217
you directly translate it from the

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:37.927
French, involves creating specially

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:40.457
tailored clothing for each individual.

00:03:41.127 --> 00:03:42.857
For each piece of clothing, there

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:45.477
is a great deal of time, attention,

00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:47.317
and skill that goes into it.

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:50.767
Everything is custom-made, and is

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.717
traditionally constructed by hand,

00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:54.627
from the beginning to the end.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.857
The clothes are typically constructed from

00:03:58.017 --> 00:04:01.887
high quality and often unusual fabric, and

00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:04.280
the result of this is a beautiful piece of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.100
clothing with a suitably large price tag.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.120
Ready-to-wear-clothing, which is what

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960
Karl Lagerfeld wanted to design, is the

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.060
opposite, at least in some respects.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.320
The design is created, different

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.040
sizes are designed, small, medium and

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.830
large, and then it’s mass produced,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.160
or at least multiple versions of

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.020
the same piece of clothing are made.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.890
It’s how almost all clothes are now

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.330
made and sold, and allows normal

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.030
people with normal sized wallets to

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.690
buy and wear the clothes they want.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.560
Sure, Lagerfeld’s dream wasn’t to design

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.190
plain white t-shirts to be sold for a few

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.110
Euros, but he wanted to design clothes

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.160
that were ready-to-wear, or “off the peg”.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.690
As a high-end fashion designer,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.400
Lagerfeld’s decision to move from haute

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.270
couture to ready-to-wear clothes was seen

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.640
as unusual, bold, and maybe even foolish.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.920
It simply wasn’t what was done - the

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.910
clothes weren’t as exclusive, and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.050
it was believed that you were less

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.090
likely to win critical acclaim.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.400
Some designers also thought

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.830
that ready-to-wear clothing

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.140
gave them less creative freedom.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.400
Lagerfeld, however, felt differently.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.690
He chose to move from haute couture to

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.550
ready-to-wear precisely because he thought

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.340
it would give him more creative freedom.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.157
Now, this might seem counterintuitive.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.760
You would think that designing for

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.636
just one person, as you do with haute

00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:46.690
couture, might allow for more creative

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.450
freedom, more self expression, as you

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.360
don’t need to worry about things like

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.240
people of slightly different sizes

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.770
wearing the same clothes, or about more

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.140
practical aspects of fashion design.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.030
But Lagerfeld believed that

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.018
culturally and stylistically,

00:06:03.378 --> 00:06:06.028
haute couture was more restrictive.

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:09.585
He said that haute couture was stuck

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:11.678
in the past, it was too traditional.

00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:13.818
He wanted more room to

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:15.538
play, to experiment.

00:06:16.258 --> 00:06:19.448
So, in 1962, when he was not yet

00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:23.018
even 30, Lagerfeld moved away from

00:06:23.018 --> 00:06:25.498
working exclusively in couture houses.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:28.508
By doing so, he freed himself

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:30.548
up to experiment more with his

00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:33.448
designs - and as we’ll see, it was

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:36.458
this risk-taking, innovative approach

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:38.188
to fashion that would make him so

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:40.278
influential later on in his career.

00:06:41.538 --> 00:06:45.038
In 1964, he moved from Paris to Rome

00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:48.313
to study art history, to pursue what

00:06:48.313 --> 00:06:50.868
would become a lifelong preoccupation

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:52.978
with the romance of the old world

00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:55.628
- especially of 18th century France.

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:58.188
And while he was studying in Rome,

00:06:58.328 --> 00:07:00.488
he worked on a freelance basis

00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:02.218
for some of the biggest names in

00:07:02.218 --> 00:07:04.718
fashion - a few you might know, like

00:07:04.948 --> 00:07:07.565
Chloé, Valentino and Charles Jourdan.

00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:11.198
This work started to get him noticed,

00:07:11.488 --> 00:07:14.448
and in 1965 he would embark on his

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:16.498
longest ever collaboration with

00:07:16.498 --> 00:07:18.558
the Italian fashion house, Fendi.

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:21.678
This was a collaboration that would

00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:24.798
last 54 years, and would be called

00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:27.078
“fashion’s greatest love story”.

00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:30.158
In fact, if you have heard of Fendi,

00:07:30.378 --> 00:07:33.048
it’s likely in no small part due

00:07:33.058 --> 00:07:34.728
to the work of Karl Lagerfeld.

00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:37.508
His designs for Fendi were often

00:07:37.778 --> 00:07:40.488
very unconventional, very risky.

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.948
He pioneered the use of rabbit and

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.548
squirrel fur in his designs - and this

00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:48.988
had never been done in fashion before.

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:51.428
He also started to use

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.858
fur in everyday garments.

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:55.838
Before that, fur was only

00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:57.988
typically worn on formal occasions.

00:07:58.998 --> 00:08:01.308
But these risks paid off.

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:03.418
With his creative direction,

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:06.268
Lagerfeld helped bring Fendi from

00:08:06.418 --> 00:08:08.808
a small, family run business into

00:08:08.808 --> 00:08:10.968
the premier name in luxury furs.

00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:13.228
It would be only the first

00:08:13.228 --> 00:08:15.568
of many successes, all very

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:16.948
different stylistically.

00:08:17.608 --> 00:08:20.488
See, unlike many of his contemporaries,

00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:23.508
Lagerfeld didn’t really have a signature

00:08:23.518 --> 00:08:26.078
style as a designer, and he wasn’t

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:28.798
known for any one kind of design.

00:08:29.658 --> 00:08:32.018
Instead, he was celebrated for being a

00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:35.168
visionary creator - someone who could see

00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:37.418
the direction fashion was going in, and

00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:41.208
was able to adapt, and invent, to keep up.

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.255
Nowhere was this more needed

00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:45.655
than in the case of Chanel.

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:48.605
The house of Chanel had been in

00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:50.945
slow decline after the death of its

00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:53.815
legendary founder, Coco, in 1971.

00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:57.065
It was criticised as becoming

00:08:57.385 --> 00:08:59.875
irrelevant, unable to stay culturally

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:01.725
important in the modern world.

00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:06.885
So, in 1982, Lagerfeld, then about to turn

00:09:06.885 --> 00:09:10.285
50, was asked to help modernise the label.

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.095
In an interview, he said that

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.875
everyone told him not to take the job.

00:09:16.365 --> 00:09:18.115
They told him that the house of Chanel

00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:20.564
was “dead, it will never come back”.

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:23.454
But he was a man who liked a

00:09:23.454 --> 00:09:25.144
challenge, and he took the job.

00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:28.584
He elevated classic Chanel looks,

00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:30.064
and made them look something that

00:09:30.074 --> 00:09:32.314
was more relevant to the times.

00:09:33.124 --> 00:09:35.654
Now, when you think of Chanel, you might

00:09:35.654 --> 00:09:38.314
be thinking of its iconic branding - the

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:41.434
letter C, interlocked, back to back.

00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:44.354
That was Lagerfeld’s invention.

00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:47.684
He monogrammed this logo onto everything

00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:50.294
- on bags, on belts, on jewellery.

00:09:50.994 --> 00:09:53.754
And in so doing, he made the interlocked

00:09:53.924 --> 00:09:56.074
Cs one of the most recognisable

00:09:56.084 --> 00:09:58.074
designs in the world of high fashion.

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.804
What’s more, he revamped all of the

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.024
classic Chanel designs - the little

00:10:04.024 --> 00:10:06.614
black dress, the skirts and jackets.

00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:09.954
He injected something new into them, and

00:10:10.054 --> 00:10:12.734
was instrumental in bringing Chanel back

00:10:12.844 --> 00:10:14.664
to relevance, turning it into one of

00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:17.251
the largest luxury brands in the world.

00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.481
And in terms of where he got his

00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:22.931
inspiration from, his answer would

00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:25.311
have been “anywhere and everywhere”.

00:10:25.961 --> 00:10:28.401
It could be the French aristocracy of

00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.921
the 18th century, but it could equally be

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:33.321
from a child he saw playing on the street.

00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:36.211
He was one of the very first designers

00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:38.441
to understand that fashion didn’t

00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:41.131
always come from above, that the latest

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.661
trends didn’t come from exclusive,

00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:46.211
high fashion ateliers, and could

00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:48.861
instead come from unexpected places.

00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:51.791
For example, he recognized the

00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:53.841
increasing popularity of hip-hop

00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:55.511
as an important influence in

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:58.051
couture - and so he introduced

00:10:58.281 --> 00:11:00.551
athleisure to the designs at Chanel.

00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:04.121
So, in this way, he blurred

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:05.671
the lines between what was

00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:08.311
considered high and low fashion.

00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:11.021
He was also the first luxury

00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:12.831
fashion designer to collaborate

00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:14.341
with fast fashion retailers.

00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:17.631
In 2004, he collaborated with the

00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:20.821
Swedish high-street brand H&M on a hugely

00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:22.611
successful ready-to-wear collection.

00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:26.231
Nowadays, these kinds of collaborations

00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:29.171
tend to be extremely popular and typically

00:11:29.181 --> 00:11:32.161
sell out in hours, and Lagerfeld was the

00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:34.741
first to do this kind of collaboration.

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.871
Now, another important factor in

00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:40.081
Lagerfeld’s creative philosophy

00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:42.721
and success was that he was early

00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.461
to  understand the importance of

00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:46.615
technology and social media when it

00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:48.895
comes to fashion and the latest trends.

00:11:49.845 --> 00:11:51.525
He designed his sets for fashion

00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:53.595
shows with an awareness of how

00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:56.005
Instagrammable they might be, so

00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:57.565
they were specially designed to

00:11:57.575 --> 00:11:59.945
look amazing in a photo or a video.

00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:01.995
When you walked into one of

00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:04.095
Lagerfeld’s runway shows, you

00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:05.745
would never know what to expect.

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:08.815
You might see models on roller

00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:10.805
skates, or carrying surfboards.

00:12:11.035 --> 00:12:12.825
You might see a set that looks like a

00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:15.325
supermarket, with fully stocked shelves.

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:18.005
You might see a fake beach, complete

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:20.565
with waves that lap across the sand.

00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:23.075
Lagerfeld knew that people were taking

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.505
photos of the sets and posting them on

00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:28.235
social media, so he made the backdrops

00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:30.505
as visually stunning as he could.

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.145
Now, when it comes to his personal

00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:34.885
life,  it's certainly fair to

00:12:34.885 --> 00:12:37.015
say that he was an eccentric.

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:40.465
Famously, he was a big fan of the iPod

00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:43.205
- but he didn’t have just one or two.

00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.885
He had literally hundreds of iPods in

00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:48.285
his personal collection, all loaded

00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:50.515
with different kinds of music, so he

00:12:50.515 --> 00:12:52.835
would pick one up and press play, with

00:12:52.925 --> 00:12:55.125
his favourite playlists pre-loaded.

00:12:56.245 --> 00:12:57.955
And his own design work

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.865
was not limited to fashion.

00:13:00.265 --> 00:13:03.231
He designed everything - from pianos to

00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:05.741
a hotel with his name on it, in Macau.

00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:09.391
He owned a bookshop in Paris, and had his

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:12.511
own personal library, which is estimated

00:13:12.811 --> 00:13:16.331
to contain more than 300,000 volumes.

00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:19.231
He was also an avid photographer,

00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:21.461
and filmed advertising campaigns

00:13:21.471 --> 00:13:23.491
for Chanel and Fendi as well

00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:25.721
as for his own Lagerfeld label.

00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.741
As you might expect for such a

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.151
high-end fashion designer, he also

00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:33.481
lived a life of considerable luxury.

00:13:34.621 --> 00:13:36.261
He didn’t really drink alcohol,

00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:38.251
because he said it made him sleepy.

00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:42.121
But he did have another vice, one that

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.271
no doubt his dentist didn’t approve of.

00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:47.161
From the minute he woke up until

00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:48.941
the minute he went to sleep, he

00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:51.431
would constantly drink Diet Coke.

00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:55.081
Not out of a can or a bottle, of course.

00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:55.461
No.

00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:55.981
No way.

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:58.451
His assistant said that Lagerfeld

00:13:58.651 --> 00:14:01.251
drank Coke only out of crystal

00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:04.011
Baccarat glasses, and that his Coke

00:14:04.101 --> 00:14:06.861
had to be refilled every 30 minutes.

00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:10.051
The eccentricities didn’t stop there.

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:13.231
Lagerfeld had always said that his

00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:16.349
closest companion was his cat, Choupette.

00:14:17.263 --> 00:14:20.143
Choupette had, and still has, in fact

00:14:20.453 --> 00:14:22.693
over 100,000 followers on Instagram

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:25.333
- and in interviews, he said that if

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:27.313
he could marry his cat, he would.

00:14:28.413 --> 00:14:30.133
Choupette was said to have two

00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:32.680
personal maids to tend to her needs,

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:35.503
and most shockingly, Lagerfeld said

00:14:35.523 --> 00:14:37.753
in an interview that Choupette earned

00:14:37.763 --> 00:14:40.363
3 million euros for participating

00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:42.903
in two commercial projects in 2014.

00:14:44.193 --> 00:14:47.083
He never married, and had an 18-year

00:14:47.093 --> 00:14:49.493
relationship with a man, a French

00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:51.473
aristocrat called Jacques de Bascher.

00:14:52.073 --> 00:14:55.013
But despite being gay himself, Lagerfeld

00:14:55.043 --> 00:14:57.493
spoke out against same-sex marriage,

00:14:57.703 --> 00:14:59.413
saying he thought it was wrong.

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:02.793
Clearly, this confused many and

00:15:02.973 --> 00:15:04.633
rubbed people up the wrong way.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.633
But Lagerfeld was never afraid

00:15:07.703 --> 00:15:09.743
to speak his mind, even when he

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.343
had controversial viewpoints.

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:13.683
He offended people when he spoke

00:15:13.723 --> 00:15:15.753
out against the #MeToo movement,

00:15:15.893 --> 00:15:17.613
when he said that he thought the

00:15:17.613 --> 00:15:20.663
singer Adele was too fat, and when he

00:15:20.663 --> 00:15:22.583
suggested that it was a mistake for

00:15:22.593 --> 00:15:24.993
Germany to accept Syrian immigrants.

00:15:26.373 --> 00:15:28.523
While he might not have cared much about

00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:31.203
speaking his mind and rubbing someone up

00:15:31.203 --> 00:15:34.463
the wrong way, Lagerfeld took extreme care

00:15:34.713 --> 00:15:37.393
to never be seen publicly looking anything

00:15:37.393 --> 00:15:40.043
less than perfect, than immaculate.

00:15:41.123 --> 00:15:42.653
If you’ve seen pictures of him,

00:15:42.663 --> 00:15:44.693
you’ll remember him with perfect

00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:47.173
white hair in a ponytail, normally

00:15:47.173 --> 00:15:49.833
with black sunglasses, high white

00:15:49.863 --> 00:15:52.073
collared shirts, and fingerless gloves.

00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:55.883
According to his assistant, his skincare

00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:58.253
regime included covering himself

00:15:58.263 --> 00:16:01.216
from head to toe, twice a day, in La

00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:03.093
Prairie - which is one of the most

00:16:03.093 --> 00:16:05.173
expensive creams in the world, and

00:16:05.383 --> 00:16:08.283
contains caviar, platinum and gold.

00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:12.723
In the year 2000, shortly before his 70th

00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:15.233
birthday, he went on a famous diet that

00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:18.743
caused him to lose 42 kilos in 13 months

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:23.003
During this diet, he ate only 1200

00:16:23.033 --> 00:16:25.413
calories a day… and washed it all

00:16:25.413 --> 00:16:28.353
down with lots and lots of, well you

00:16:28.353 --> 00:16:30.053
might have guessed it, Diet Coke.

00:16:31.043 --> 00:16:33.143
And his motivation for losing all

00:16:33.143 --> 00:16:35.203
of this weight wasn’t for health

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.043
reasons or anything like that.

00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:39.633
It was, as with everything to do

00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:41.973
with Lagerfeld, related to fashion.

00:16:42.703 --> 00:16:45.073
He said that one of the reasons he wanted

00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:46.953
to lose weight was so that he could

00:16:46.953 --> 00:16:49.523
wear certain clothes - specifically

00:16:49.773 --> 00:16:51.646
suits by the Dior Homme line.

00:16:52.726 --> 00:16:55.193
And this brings us on to, perhaps,

00:16:55.193 --> 00:16:57.103
one of the most interesting and

00:16:57.363 --> 00:16:59.613
unexpected things about Karl Lagerfeld.

00:17:00.553 --> 00:17:03.463
He had created his own “Karl Lagerfeld”

00:17:03.663 --> 00:17:06.763
ready-to-wear fashion label in 1984.

00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:10.153
It did do ok, and  was eventually

00:17:10.153 --> 00:17:11.373
sold to Tommy Hilfinger.

00:17:12.693 --> 00:17:15.523
But he was much more famous for working

00:17:15.523 --> 00:17:18.153
for other labels, and indeed, the reason

00:17:18.153 --> 00:17:20.343
he wanted to lose so much weight wasn’t

00:17:20.393 --> 00:17:22.713
because he wanted to wear suits from the

00:17:22.713 --> 00:17:25.763
House of Karl Lagerfeld, but from Dior.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.213
All this being said, while the

00:17:29.363 --> 00:17:31.963
House of Karl Lagerfeld was not his

00:17:31.963 --> 00:17:34.303
defining legacy, the name of Karl

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.573
Lagerfeld has left an astounding

00:17:36.743 --> 00:17:38.473
legacy on the world of fashion.

00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:41.093
He spent 54 years at

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:43.633
Fendi, and 36 at Chanel.

00:17:44.223 --> 00:17:47.693
He died in February of 2019, aged

00:17:47.793 --> 00:17:51.203
85, and tributes poured in from some

00:17:51.223 --> 00:17:52.923
of the biggest names in fashion.

00:17:53.893 --> 00:17:55.913
His designs were revolutionary,

00:17:56.223 --> 00:17:58.233
his character larger than life,

00:17:58.553 --> 00:18:00.573
his sense of the future unmatched.

00:18:01.603 --> 00:18:02.843
He was a man whose motto

00:18:02.903 --> 00:18:06.063
was, very aptly, “embrace the

00:18:06.063 --> 00:18:08.513
present and invent the future”.

00:18:11.302 --> 00:18:14.112
OK then, that is it for today’s episode,

00:18:14.282 --> 00:18:17.482
on the life and legacy of Karl Lagerfeld.

00:18:17.751 --> 00:18:19.532
As always, I would love to know

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:21.092
what you thought about this episode.

00:18:21.422 --> 00:18:22.878
If you would consider yourself a

00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:25.122
fashionista, what do you think of the

00:18:25.122 --> 00:18:27.372
designs and work of Karl Lagerfeld?

00:18:27.872 --> 00:18:29.532

some of the other great designers

00:18:31.182 --> 00:18:33.317

00:18:35.352 --> 00:18:36.782

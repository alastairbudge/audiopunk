Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.259
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.810
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.960
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about multi-level Marketing.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.030
To its proponents, it is about freedom, personal liberty, and the opportunity to be your own boss.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.379
To others, it is the worst kind of pyramid scheme, a modern scam

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.230
that tricks and traps people and serves to enrich only a tiny few.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:54.160
So, let’s get right into it and talk about the weird but massive world of multi-level marketing.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.479
What if I told you that I had an opportunity for you.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.059
You would never have to go to work in an office again.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.519
You could work from home, set your own hours, be your own boss, spend

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.740
more quality time with friends and family, and control your destiny.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:20.090
And, even better, your salary would no longer be dictated by the whims of your boss,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.640
no longer would you have to be content with a small pay rise at the end of the year.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.709
Oh no.

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:34.570
Not only would you be finally free from the shackles and monotony of office life, but

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.970
you would enter a world of untapped earnings, practically limitless amounts of money.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.520
How would $10,000 a month sound to you?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.960
How about $50,000 a month?

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.009
What about making a million dollars a year?

00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:55.080
What about a new car, a Mercedes even, five star all

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.190
expenses paid holidays, perhaps even your own yacht.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.120
There is a small upfront investment, I’ll warn you, but you will recoup this in no time at all.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.800
After all, you gotta spend money to make money, that’s what they say isn’t it?

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.859
I imagine this would sound pretty good.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.060
After all, who wouldn’t like to work less and earn more?

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.660
Perhaps you are nodding your head, thinking “yes, please”, how can I get started?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.350
No problem, I’d say, and I’d pass you a form to sign.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.380
You’d add your personal details.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.689
Perhaps you’d see that the terms and conditions seemed quite

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.890
long, but I’d probably tell you to not worry about that.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.520
Don’t worry, it’s all standard stuff, work hard and unleash your entrepreneurial

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.010
spirit and you’ll be earning lots of money in no time, I’d tell you.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.129
If you spent the time to look through the terms and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.660
conditions, however, you might see some worrying numbers.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.890
If you are signing up for Herbalife, a large health supplements company that operates like

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.660
this, you might look through and see that only 50% of people earned more than $240 a month.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.940
And that was before costs.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.609
That doesn’t sound particularly promising, that’s 4% of the median monthly salary in the USA.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.060
So you keep on reading.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.510
You read that there is no guarantee that you will make any money, and that only

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.469
those in the top 1%, the most successful people, make more than $7,880 per month.

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:46.809
And you keep on reading, “As with all business, success requires hard work, skill, and dedication.”

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.100
Fair enough, you think, you know that all business requires hard work, skill and dedication.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.029
but you are going to work hard, are you not?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.090
Perhaps there are some doubts running through your mind, but I’ll put my hand on your shoulder

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.940
and say “don’t worry, this is all standard stuff, their legal department makes them say it”.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.049
I’m not going to encourage you to do any more research into it,

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:18.440
but if you do, you might see some even more worrying numbers.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:24.630
You might find out that, according to one US government report, approximately

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.389
0.4% of people who have ever joined a similar scheme have made any money at all.

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:39.799
Everyone else has lost money, so statistically speaking you are 7 times more likely to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.259
make money gambling on roulette at Caesar’s Palace than joining one of these schemes.

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:52.080
I’ve never been to Las Vegas, but if I had to choose a way to lose money, I think I’d

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.290
choose doing it in Las Vegas rather than going door to door and selling health supplements.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.110
Perhaps after hearing all of this you’d think “well, thank you Alastair, I think

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.799
I’ll stick with my day job after all, I’m going to pass on this opportunity”.

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:16.849
But every year tens of millions of people enter into this world, the weird and mysterious world

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.380
of multi-level marketing, so in this episode we are going to talk about how it works in theory

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.540
and how it works in reality, and why it continues to hold such an allure to this very day.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.590
So, what is “multi-level marketing”?

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.730
In short, it is a system in which individual people

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.929
act as agents and sell products to other individuals.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.590
This might be nutrition shakes, it might be vitamins,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.170
it could be clothes, cosmetics, it could be anything.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.020
You join a multi-level company, like that wonderful offer I just made you

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.230
a few minutes ago, and then you become a partner, an agent, an affiliate,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.150
they all have slightly different names for what really is the same thing.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.299
Just like a shop, you order products from the company at a wholesale,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.850
discounted price, and then you can sell them to other people for a higher price.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.700
Just like a shop, the more product you buy, the lower the price per unit you will get, and

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.490
therefore the more profit you can make on each item, providing that you can sell it, that is.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.499
All good so far.

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:41.299
But where it gets interesting, creepy even, is that you are incentivised not only to

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.166
sell the end product to other people: friends, family, people in your neighbourhood.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.219
But you are also incentivised to recruit other people to become salespeople like you.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.350
You make money by selling the products, but you also make money by

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.370
signing up other people and by making a commission not only on the

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.630
products they buy, but on the products that the people they sign up buy.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:17.370
So, the more people you sign up, and the more people they sign up, the more money you make.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.289
Perhaps this all still sounds ok so far.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.309
After all, you can probably sign up five friends, as who wouldn’t like

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:31.409
the idea of being their own boss and earning money at the same time?

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.020
And they can probably each sign up five of their friends, because

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.440
they all work in different companies and have different families.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.500
Easy.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.179
And you’ll be at the top, making money from everyone you have recruited and from their recruits.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.010
If you’re doing the numbers here, there is you at the top, that’s one person,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.390
then your five recruits, so five on the level below you, and they each have five

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:07.380
below them, so that's twenty five on that level, a total of thirty one people.

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:16.280
It all sounds very doable, but as you move down the levels, the numbers quickly start to add up.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:25.280
On the fourth level there are 125, the fifth level 625, all well and good.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:31.760
But by the time you’re at level 10 you have hit almost 2 million people.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.660
And if you are drawing this out, you might have seen

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:40.490
that it looks like a big triangle, a pyramid even.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.670
And as you can see, the base of this pyramid gets very large very quickly.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.470
I’m recording this from Sweden, a country with just over 10 million people.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.560
If one person started this scheme and was required to sign up 5 people,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.540
and they needed to sign up 5 people, and so on, by the time it got to only

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.470
11 levels deep there literally wouldn’t be enough people in the country.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.280
What happens is that you have the suckers at the bottom, the last people to be signed

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.890
up, who wouldn’t be able to sign up anyone else, so they have no way of making the

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:29.350
money that they had been promised, because the country had run out of available people.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.110
This is one of the major criticisms of multi-level marketing schemes.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:41.050
Their pyramid-like nature, and the requirement for people to continue to recruit more

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:48.550
sellers downstream from them, means that it is mathematically determined to collapse, because

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:54.000
when you run the numbers, when you do the calculations, it doesn’t take very long at all

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:01.670
for a town, a city, a country or even the entire world, to run out of available people.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.930
Now, you will perhaps have noted that I said pyramid-like

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.900
nature, rather than simply called them a pyramid scheme.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:19.770
Multi-level marketing companies are insistent that they are not pyramid schemes, and they spend

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:26.100
millions of dollars every year on lawyers and lobbyists to make sure that nobody is allowed to

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.343
call them a pyramid scheme, and there is one major difference that they are quick to point out.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.330
A pyramid scheme relies purely on recruiting new people.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:45.610
I find five people and tell them to each give me €10, and then they need to find five

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.700
people to give them €10, and people make money only by recruiting people below them.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.700
Multi-level marketing schemes are different in that you can make money

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.580
by selling the product, be it vitamins, beauty products or clothes.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.290
It's technically possible to make money without recruiting anyone, but

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.680
it is very hard, as all of the company marketing materials will tell you.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.130
And why is it so hard to make money purely by selling the product?

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.590
Well, according to almost every critic of almost every multi-level marketing

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:28.820
company, it’s because the products they are selling are expensive and poor quality.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:35.370
And you, as essentially a travelling door-to-door salesman, are competing

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:41.530
with Walmart, Amazon, huge retail and online stores, which will always be able

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.930
to provide a better selection and lower prices, so what chance do you stand?

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.240
As a result your best chance of making money is by selling the dream, not the physical product.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.920
In other words, you make money by signing up other people and making

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.150
a commission on the product that they buy, just as the people above

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.290
you make money from commission on the product that you have bought.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:14.900
Or to put it another way, even more plainly, the real customers for these multi-level marketing

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:21.070
companies are not random people on the street, but the people who have been duped into becoming

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.240
sellers of the product, and been forced to buy large amounts of the product as an “investment”..

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.550
Now, multi-level marketing companies tend to have all sorts of different

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.180
ways to encourage their sellers to buy large quantities of stock.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:45.660
Firstly, sellers are encouraged to “invest” in their business, being told

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.600
that they need to spend money to make money, and that buying stock isn’t a

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.690
cost, it’s an investment in themselves and an investment in their future.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.170
What’s more, as you might expect, sellers get

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.460
discounts for bulk buying, for buying large quantities.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.040
Fair enough, you probably think, this is how any business works.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.070
But there are many other convoluted, complicated, structures too.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:19.380
Sellers might need to buy a certain amount of stock every month to keep a particular “tier” level,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:24.570
they might need to hit a certain amount of purchases every month in order to qualify for another

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:33.780
bonus, and one company even required its top sellers to keep $20,000 worth of stock at all times.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.540
Most multi-level marketing companies have a large range of different levels that

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.560
their sellers can progress through, and the commission structures and details

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.280
of how you go from one level to the next can be very difficult to follow.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.990
A cynic might even say that they are deliberately opaque and confusing

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.230
so that sellers don’t fully understand how much money they might make,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.621
and hopefully, optimistically, overestimate their future earnings.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:13.291
Now, according to one recent report, 8% of all Americans have been part

00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:18.481
of an MLM, with 20 million Americans saying that they either are or

00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:22.471
have been actively involved in a multi-level marketing organisation.

00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:26.581
Statistically speaking, people involved in multi-level

00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.731
marketing tend to share certain characteristics.

00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:35.511
Women are more likely than men to participate in multi-level marketing, as are

00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:40.121
more recent immigrants to a country, and people from lower income communities.

00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:44.289
This is, on one level, unsurprising.

00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:50.001
The sales pitch of multi-level marketing is that it will allow you to achieve wealth

00:14:50.031 --> 00:14:54.601
and freedom that you would not be able to achieve through “traditional” means.

00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:59.701
A quarter of American mothers are stay at home moms, and therefore

00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:03.391
have limited opportunities to participate in the workforce.

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:08.591
New immigrants are less likely to have gone to university and have been

00:15:08.591 --> 00:15:13.691
able to get a good high-paying “traditional” job, so it is perfectly

00:15:13.691 --> 00:15:17.881
understandable to be attracted by the promise of riches and freedom.

00:15:19.111 --> 00:15:22.221
And there is also the social element to it.

00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:29.261
Joining a multi-level marketing organisation, or MLM, allows you to feel like you are part of

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:35.421
something, like you are part of a group of entrepreneurs all in it together, chasing your own dream.

00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:42.011
Unfortunately, the reality is that almost everyone who joins an MLM will not

00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:47.421
make more than a minimum wage job and probably end up working longer hours.

00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:54.161
And many will find that they actually lose money, that financially they would have been

00:15:54.181 --> 00:15:59.871
better off sitting on their sofa doing nothing rather than starting to “work” for an MLM.

00:16:01.301 --> 00:16:04.721
And this gets to the crux of the issue.

00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:11.051
According to their greatest critics, many MLMs have no real customers.

00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:16.671
The customer is the next sucker to be recruited, the next person who thinks that

00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:21.831
they will be selling the supplement or vitamin or whatever it is, but in fact

00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:27.171
ends up stockpiling product in their garage and spending their days attempting

00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:31.751
to recruit friends, long-lost highschool classmates, and distant relatives.

00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:40.151
There was even a famous case from 2012 when one large Wall Street investor called Bill

00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:47.351
Ackman put his money where his mouth was, declared that the MLM Herbalife was a pyramid

00:16:47.351 --> 00:16:53.351
scheme, and that he was “shorting” the company to the tune of $1 billion dollars.

00:16:54.361 --> 00:17:02.011
Essentially, he was betting that the stock price was too high, and that the company was a fraud.

00:17:03.571 --> 00:17:08.911
To outside observers however, Herbalife looked like a reputable company.

00:17:09.631 --> 00:17:13.321
It was worth billions of dollars, it sponsored football teams

00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:19.146
like LA Galaxy and had brand ambassadors like Cristiano Ronaldo.

00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:26.081
It looked and seemed like a real company, but there was a Wall Street investor

00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.981
saying that this huge company was essentially a fraud with no business model

00:17:32.281 --> 00:17:36.651
other than duping unwitting people into becoming unpaid salespeople for it.

00:17:37.751 --> 00:17:44.171
Now, this turned out to be an ugly battle between Ackman and another rival from the world

00:17:44.171 --> 00:17:50.541
of finance, and indeed he never managed to prove that Herbalife was a fraud, or at least,

00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:55.611
he never managed to push the share price down to the value he believed it deserved to be at.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:18:03.211
The share price has since crashed to a certain degree, but as of the time of recording

00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:08.851
this episode at least, Herbalife is still a billion dollar company, like several other

00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:14.501
multi-level marketing companies, and it shows no sign of going to zero any time soon.

00:18:15.281 --> 00:18:19.181
Now, clearly there are some people who get into multi-level

00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:23.331
marketing and manage to achieve great success, wealth, and freedom.

00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:29.301
Primarily these are the owners and shareholders of the multilevel marketing companies

00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:34.911
themselves, but there are some stories of some individuals who have done it.

00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:43.031
Unfortunately they are a tiny minority, who typically have got in incredibly early and have

00:18:43.031 --> 00:18:48.961
recruited masses of people below them, whose “investments” flow up the pyramid towards them.

00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:55.151
And it’s these people’s stories that you’ll see on the multilevel marketing websites

00:18:55.151 --> 00:19:00.321
and hear about at conferences, not of the recent immigrant who was told about this

00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:05.751
great opportunity and then spent $5,000 on stock, only to find that she wasn’t

00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:10.111
able to make a penny selling it, and she was now struggling to make the rent.

00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:18.491
According to one report, multi-level marketing is an almost $200 billion dollar

00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:28.561
industry, and is projected to grow to $330 billion by 2030, a growth of more than 65%.

00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:34.721
Globally, more than 100 million people are involved with multi-level

00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:38.231
marketing, with 8 million of those in the United States alone.

00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:45.571
To be fair, for many it is some harmless fun, a way to meet new people, work

00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:50.051
on a new project, and potentially make a little bit of money on the side.

00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:55.711
If you are going into it on this basis, sure, be my guest.

00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:00.761
However if you are going into it believing that it really is the money-making

00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:06.881
opportunity of a lifetime, all I’d suggest is thinking about why someone is pushing you

00:20:06.891 --> 00:20:12.961
so hard into becoming a salesperson for the supplement or vitamin or whatever it is.

00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:18.141
Perhaps, you’re not the entrepreneur or business owner or

00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:22.501
whatever they are telling you you’ll become; you are the customer.

00:20:24.051 --> 00:20:28.591
OK then, that is it for today's episode on multi-level marketing.

00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:32.171
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:40.051
The obvious question is are you in multi-level marketing, have

00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:43.361
you ever been involved in it, or do you know someone who has?

00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:46.211
What has your experience been of it?

00:20:46.631 --> 00:20:49.891
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.569
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:20.589
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:26.320
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Doomsday

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.620
Cults, times when a charismatic person has managed to convince large groups

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.600
of people that the world is about to end, or at least plunge into chaos.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.959
And as a result, tragic things have happened.

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:45.750
I have to warn you, this episode will have plenty of slightly unpleasant stories.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.620
There will be sex, drugs, suicide and murder, and plenty

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.860
of people claiming that the world is about to end.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.369
OK, you’ve had your warning.

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.000
If you’re ready for it, let’s get started.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.160
Let’s first start with a quick definition.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.210
What is a cult?

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:12.329
If you look it up in a dictionary you will find definitions such as “a small

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.140
religious group that is not part of a larger and more accepted religion

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.990
and that has beliefs regarded by many people as extreme or dangerous”.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.919
For a cult to be a cult, and not simply a “belief”, it really needs to have three things:

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.949
Firstly, it needs to be relatively small.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.049
Once a cult becomes too large, well, it becomes mainstream, it

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:43.820
becomes normalised, and it isn’t really a cult at all any more.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.259
There are plenty of religions that started out being viewed as dangerous

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.449
cults, and as they grew they stopped being referred to as cults.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.469
And secondly, for a group to be considered to be a cult the beliefs they

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.739
hold need to be considered dangerous or extreme by mainstream society.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.170
A cult needs to pose a danger, either to normal society or to itself, to its members.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.800
And in every example we’ll learn about today, there was plenty of danger,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.929
and in the next twenty minutes we will step over plenty of dead bodies.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.659
Now, there’s one more thing that almost every cult has, and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.840
without which it’s hard for a cult to really get started.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.990
A charismatic leader.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.380
If you’ve listened to our episodes on Scientology and Mormonism,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.550
you will remember the stories of how Joseph Smith and L.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.360
Ron Hubbard were incredibly charismatic men and managed to encourage others to follow them.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.690
The doomsday cults we’ll learn about today have similarly charismatic leaders,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.940
men who may well have been insane and in some cases horrendously evil, but

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.950
certainly men with the ability to persuade others to follow them, to do what they

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.050
said, which meant killing on their behalf, and even killing themselves for them.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.790
And when you add in the doomsday element, the idea that the end of the world is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.820
imminent, people can clearly be persuaded to do all sorts of slightly unusual things.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.680
So, let’s just get right into it and kick off with our first doomsday cult, the Branch Davidians.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:44.670
This cult had been active since the 1930s, and was based in a large

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.340
compound called New Mount Carmel in Texas, in the United States.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.740
The hundred or so members of the cult lived in that compound where they were waiting for the Second

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.560
Coming, they believed that Jesus Christ would come to Earth and they needed to get ready for it.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.480
For the first fifty years or so of its existence, nobody

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.680
knew much about it, but one day in 1993 that all changed.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.620
The cult had been taken over by a 28-year-old man named Vernon Wayne Howell.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.729
Howell changed his name to David Koresh, to suggest that he was a

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.650
descendant of both King David of Israel and the Persian king Cyrus

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.380
the Great, and he most certainly suffered from delusions of grandeur.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.180
He declared that he was the messiah, and that all

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.700
women living in the compound were his spiritual wives.

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.039
If you think this sounds harmless and innocent, think again.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.810
Koresh forced young girls to bear his children, and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.460
essentially turned the entire cult into his own private hareem.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.619
It wasn’t to be the sex abuse that brought the Branch Davidians to the public eye though.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.460
Instead, the American authorities suspected Koresh of stockpiling

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.210
illegal weapons in the compound, of buying guns illegally, in

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.070
preparation for the Second Coming and all of the chaos that would ensue.

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:29.800
The police certainly had reason to believe that the Branch Davidians were stockpiling

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:36.150
weapons because, well, Koresh had publicly stated that God had told him to do so.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.659
In 1989, shortly after taking control of the cult, he released a piece of audio

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:48.969
in which he revealed firstly that God had told him to sleep with all of the

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:54.140
women in the cult, and that all of the other men in the cult should be celibate.

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.109
And, importantly, that God had also told him to start building

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.420
an army to prepare for the Second Coming and the Apocalypse.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.390
There was also plenty of evidence that Koresh and his followers were stockpiling

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.849
and modifying weapons - neighbours had heard machine guns going off, delivery

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.320
people had seen guards with weapons, it seemed pretty clear what was going on.

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:26.990
So, the US authorities, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.810
to be precise, decided to go and have a look for themselves.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.750
But they weren’t prepared for what was to come.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:43.834
When the authorities raided the compound on February 28th of 1993, the Branch Davidians fought back.

00:06:44.782 --> 00:06:48.929
4 government agents were shot and killed, and 6 Branch

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.520
Davidians lost their lives in the ensuing firefight.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.900
That wasn’t it though.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.230
There was a standoff, and the entire compound was under siege for the next 51 days.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.400
It all ended when the FBI launched a tear gas attack on the compound, there was a

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.979
huge fire, and 76 members of the cult, including its leader, David Koresh, perished.

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.490
Strangely enough, the Branch Davidians are still active today, they still have a

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:30.290
compound in the same area of Texas, but they are keeping a low profile, certainly not

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.989
publicly claiming that they are building an army and preparing for the Second Coming.

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:40.229
Our second doomsday cult is The People’s Temple.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:47.850
It might have a fairly innocent-sounding name, but it has gone down in history as one of the most

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:54.680
destructive cults ever, and resulted in the needless loss of life of almost a thousand people.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.960
It all started with a young, charismatic American, a man named Jim Jones.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:08.710
In 1955 he founded “The People’s Temple”, which was a Christian-socialist

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.310
organisation, meaning a group whose beliefs came in part from

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.310
Christianity, and in part from communist and socialist thought.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.070
That was the theory at least.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.930
In practice, what being part of The People’s Temple meant was that all followers of The

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:33.500
People’s Temple had to give all of their property, income and possessions to Jones and the cult.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.774
Much like the other stories we’ll hear today, Jones also required female members of the cult

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:47.319
to be willing to turn over not just their material possessions but also their bodies to him.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:55.310
For the first 15 years or so of the cult’s existence, it had bases in California, but

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:03.220
after a growing backlash against it, Jones relocated the entire cult to a remote settlement

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.710
in the jungle of Guyana, the small South American country to the east of Venezuela.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:16.300
Approximately 1,000 followers came with him, moving their entire lives from the United States to

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:23.610
the Guyana jungle, which gives you some idea of quite how much power he held over his followers.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.760
This settlement was to be a jungle utopia, a communist

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:34.499
Christian heaven where believers could live a true, honest life.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.319
So, what happened next?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.849
Well, it didn’t last for long.

00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:47.400
A US Congressman named Leo Ryan came to investigate in 1978, after

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.990
receiving pleas from concerned relatives of members of the cult.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.930
There were now almost a thousand people living in this compound in

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.569
the Guyana jungle, people who had cut off all contact with the outside

00:10:01.569 --> 00:10:06.580
world, and this congressman came down to see what was actually going on.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:14.420
The congressman arrived in the Guyanan jungle, checked out the compound, and as he was on

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.490
the plane about to leave back to the United States he was murdered with five of his party.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.370
Meanwhile, back at the compound Jones had convinced all of his followers that

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.330
they were about to be taken from the compound and converted to fascism, a fate

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:39.630
worse than death for anyone subscribing to this Communist Christian ideology.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:48.459
So, Jones convinced his followers to line up, one by one, and drink poison, to kill themselves.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.459
Men, women, children.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.370
918 people in total died at Jonestown after drinking a soft

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:02.020
drink called “Flavor Aid” which had been laced with cyanide.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.429
This was, until the September 11th attacks, the single event

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:12.680
that caused the largest loss of American lives in history.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.310
Mad, right?

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:22.110
It also gave rise to an expression in English that you may have heard of, to “drink the Kool-aid”.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.909
If you “drink the Kool-aid”, it means you believe everything

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.870
someone says, no matter whether it is right or not.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.930
This expression comes from the Jonestown Massacre, as this event has come to

00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:41.499
be known, even though it’s not technically correct - the cult members didn’t

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:46.469
actually drink “Kool-aid”, they drank something very similar called “Flavor Aid”.

00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:55.174
For our next doomsday cult we actually move away from America and cross the Pacific to Japan.

00:11:56.214 --> 00:12:02.884
Although this is a decidedly non-American cult, we will encounter many familiar themes.

00:12:03.544 --> 00:12:04.684
A charismatic leader.

00:12:05.164 --> 00:12:07.984
A belief that the end of the world is imminent.

00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:09.324
Violence.

00:12:09.504 --> 00:12:13.794
And followers prepared to do anything the cult leader says.

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:20.364
The protagonist of this particular story is a man named Shoko Asahara.

00:12:21.544 --> 00:12:28.694
He was born in 1955, and when he was in his twenties he became interested in a wide variety

00:12:28.694 --> 00:12:36.194
of religions, everything from Buddhism to Christianity as well as Astrology, Taoism and yoga.

00:12:37.484 --> 00:12:43.420
Out of this he created his own belief system, which he called Aum Shinrikyo.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:49.329
Surprise surprise, he was the head and most important figure in Aum Shinrikyo.

00:12:49.564 --> 00:12:55.804
He said he was Jesus Christ and was the first truly enlightened being since Buddha.

00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:58.184
Some big claims, right?

00:12:59.204 --> 00:13:04.744
In any case, Aum Shinrikyo was recognised as a real religion in Japan,

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:10.054
and it soon started amassing a relatively large following, with tens of

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:15.054
thousands of members around the world, most of them in Japan and Russia.

00:13:16.294 --> 00:13:22.454
Part of Asahara’s teaching was that the world was ending, that Armageddon was imminent.

00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:28.954
He believed that conflict between America and Japan was inevitable, it

00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:33.534
would result in a Third World War and the subsequent end of the world.

00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:39.454
The only way to avoid this, and to achieve salvation would

00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:43.354
be for people to give up everything and join Aum Shinrikyo.

00:13:44.474 --> 00:13:48.624
Anyone who didn’t join the cult would be doomed to eternal

00:13:48.634 --> 00:13:52.114
hell unless they were killed by members of the cult.

00:13:53.254 --> 00:13:59.294
The cult became increasingly violent in the early 1990s, and then on March

00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:06.484
20th, 1995, members of the cult went on to commit what would become, and still

00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:11.504
is for that matter, the most deadly terrorist attack in Japanese history.

00:14:12.704 --> 00:14:17.034
Members of the cult boarded the Tokyo metro, the underground

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:21.514
train network, and released the deadly chemical agent sarin.

00:14:22.204 --> 00:14:25.774
14 people were killed and over a thousand injured.

00:14:27.164 --> 00:14:30.664
It’s still not completely clear why they did it.

00:14:31.084 --> 00:14:34.504
One theory is that members thought that they were actually

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:38.114
saving the souls of members of the public by killing them.

00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:43.714
Another theory is that they were trying to distract attention away from

00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:48.284
investigations into other crimes that had been committed by members of the cult.

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:54.844
And another theory is that they thought that this might be a way of triggering the

00:14:54.854 --> 00:15:01.584
apocalypse and kick-starting the Armageddon that they so fervently believed was inevitable.

00:15:02.074 --> 00:15:08.054
In any case, the world didn’t end, and launching a deadly terrorist attack

00:15:08.054 --> 00:15:12.384
might be a good way of distracting attention away from something else

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:17.134
but it certainly isn’t a good way of deflecting attention away from you.

00:15:18.174 --> 00:15:24.174
In the aftermath of the attack Shoko Asahara and other senior cult leaders were tracked

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:30.954
down, arrested, and all either sentenced to lengthy prison sentences or executed.

00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:39.094
Now, doomsday cult number four, our last doomsday cult, is probably the most famous cult in the

00:15:39.094 --> 00:15:45.454
world, although at least in terms of the number of people who died, it’s far from the most deadly.

00:15:46.374 --> 00:15:50.424
Charles Manson and the so-called “Manson Family”.

00:15:51.254 --> 00:15:58.884
Indeed, there is probably no name more associated with the term cult leader than “Charles Manson”.

00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:06.674
Manson was a failed musician, who started his own cult in the late 1960s in California.

00:16:07.714 --> 00:16:13.814
Like the other characters we’ve come across in today’s episode, he believed that he was the Messiah.

00:16:14.654 --> 00:16:20.934
His cult started simply as a group of friends engaging in a hippie life of drugs

00:16:21.154 --> 00:16:27.394
and open relationships, but by the late 1960s his views became more and more

00:16:27.394 --> 00:16:34.124
extreme, and his delusions of his own grandeur had continued to grow and grow.

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:40.594
His followers numbered around 100, most of whom were middle-class women.

00:16:41.174 --> 00:16:45.354
Hallucinogenic drugs and sex were a common feature.

00:16:46.094 --> 00:16:48.334
There was a much darker side though.

00:16:48.914 --> 00:16:55.644
He had become obsessed with the idea that America was on the cusp of a race war between

00:16:55.644 --> 00:17:01.744
the black and the white community, and that this was going to cause the end of the world.

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:08.974
He believed that the black community was going to win this race war, and that when the war was

00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:15.694
won, the black community would need a white person to lead them, and Manson would be that man.

00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:19.564
At the same time, Manson had been trying to break into

00:17:19.564 --> 00:17:22.904
Hollywood, he had been trying to make it as a singer.

00:17:23.624 --> 00:17:28.504
The problem was, he just really wasn’t very good, and although he had

00:17:28.504 --> 00:17:33.264
managed to make friends with some famous musicians, such as Dennis

00:17:33.264 --> 00:17:38.694
Wilson, the drummer from the Beach Boys, Manson was continually rejected.

00:17:39.884 --> 00:17:44.134
As a result, Charles Manson wanted revenge on Hollywood,

00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:47.734
revenge on the people he believed had rejected him.

00:17:48.604 --> 00:17:53.834
He instructed his followers to go to the house that Roman Polanski and his

00:17:53.854 --> 00:17:59.502
actress wife, Sharon Tate, were renting, and to kill everyone they found there.

00:18:00.354 --> 00:18:05.944
Polanski wasn’t there at the time, but Manson’s followers brutally murdered the five

00:18:05.974 --> 00:18:11.224
people they found there, including the eight-and-a-half-month-pregnant Sharon Tate.

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:17.154
The murderers weren’t immediately caught, allowing them to kill again the

00:18:17.164 --> 00:18:22.024
following night, when they went out and murdered two more celebrities.

00:18:22.864 --> 00:18:25.444
These crimes shocked the nation.

00:18:25.664 --> 00:18:30.714
They were brutal, unprovoked, and committed in the heart of Hollywood.

00:18:31.564 --> 00:18:35.774
Charles Manson, it turns out, did not personally murder

00:18:35.794 --> 00:18:39.734
anyone, but the murders were all carried out on his orders.

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:44.304
He forced his followers into committing these heinous acts.

00:18:45.244 --> 00:18:50.524
And, of course, he paid the price, or at least he was sentenced to death.

00:18:51.244 --> 00:18:56.054
But he was never actually executed - his sentence was changed to

00:18:56.054 --> 00:19:01.944
life imprisonment, and he died in prison in 2017 at the age of 83.

00:19:03.094 --> 00:19:06.594
Now, we have evidently just skimmed the surface of these

00:19:06.594 --> 00:19:10.354
stories, there is so much more to them than we’ve covered today.

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:13.264
We could certainly have done an episode on each of

00:19:13.274 --> 00:19:17.034
these four barbaric but fascinating doomsday cults.

00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:18.914
Maybe we’ll do just that.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:25.154
In any case, the stories of these four cults show quite what people will

00:19:25.154 --> 00:19:30.327
believe, and what people can be forced to believe, and therefore forced to do.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:38.297
Equally interesting, and perhaps even more shocking, is to think about the manipulative, insane

00:19:38.317 --> 00:19:44.697
and barbaric behaviour of the leaders of these doomsday cults, to think about the men who sought

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:52.277
power, sex, and adoration from their followers, only to force them to do horrible things either to

00:19:52.277 --> 00:19:57.917
themselves, to each other, or to innocent people who had nothing to do with the cult whatsoever.

00:19:58.717 --> 00:20:03.697
The four characters in our story certainly aren’t the only doomsday cult

00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:08.007
leaders, they weren’t the first and unfortunately they won’t be the last.

00:20:08.347 --> 00:20:13.367
Perhaps if there’s one thing we can take away from all this, it’s that if

00:20:13.387 --> 00:20:18.767
a strange man claiming to be the Messiah offers you a glass of Kool-Aid,

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:23.397
or should I say “Flavor Aid”, it’s probably time to make a run for it.

00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:32.315
OK then, that is it for this little look into our four creepy Doomsday Cults.

00:20:32.545 --> 00:20:37.105
I hope you enjoyed it, and that it wasn’t too difficult to listen to - in fact

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:42.285
I left out a lot of the bloodiest parts, but if you are the sort of person who

00:20:42.295 --> 00:20:47.125
enjoys that kind of detail, well you can go and read up on it for yourself.

00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:51.305
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:51.595 --> 00:20:57.735
Do you know anyone, either directly or indirectly, who has ever been caught up in a cult?

00:20:58.195 --> 00:21:02.555
I imagine you might not know anyone who was part of any of these four cults,

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:06.725
but perhaps you might have a weird cult story that you would like to share.

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:11.255
Or are there other chilling stories of cults from your country?

00:21:11.555 --> 00:21:15.145
Are there similar situations where someone has predicted the

00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:19.295
end of the world and used that as cover to do terrible things?

00:21:19.765 --> 00:21:20.895
I would love to know.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:26.445

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:16.434
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:20.724
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:27.544
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Chess and the Cold War.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:34.574
Chess is often called the ultimate game of strategy, a game where two players have exactly

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:40.144
the same pieces, and they need to use all of their mental abilities to outsmart the other.

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:46.594
And although chess may be a game, during the Cold War it was used as a way

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:52.724
to play out a very real world conflict, the conflict between East and West.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:59.114
So, in this episode we will tell this amazing story, of how the chess board became

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:05.524
the battleground for the Cold War, and how one country, the USSR came to dominate the

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:11.104
international game in a way that no other country has done, either before or since.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.344
OK then, Chess and The Cold War.

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:20.624
Before we go back in time, let’s take a moment and stay

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:23.797
in the present day, or at least in the 21st century.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:28.073
2022 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:32.503
There are few areas of life that the conflict has not touched.

00:01:33.043 --> 00:01:38.973
Energy sanctions, rising food prices, the fastest growing refugee crisis since the end

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:45.483
of World War II, and thousands of civilians dead: these are just some of the consequences

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:50.123
of Europe’s first military conflict between states since the Second World War.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:55.613
You might be surprised to learn that, on a far less significant level

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:59.693
of course, even the international chess scene has been affected.

00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:05.523
Almost as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022,

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:10.523
the world of professional chess became a flashpoint in the war.

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:16.033
Within a week of the invasion, the International Chess Federation had

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:21.283
pulled, it had cancelled, major tournaments from Russia and Belarus.

00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:28.483
For Russia too, chess quickly became a factor in its propaganda calculations.

00:02:29.373 --> 00:02:36.293
In April of 2022, the Russian state media regulator blocked the online chess website

00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:41.803
chess.com for publishing interviews with Ukrainian players about the invasion.

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:49.053
Russia also faced pushback from its own chess champions – the pride and joy of

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:54.393
a nation that won all but one World Chess Championship between 1948 and 1990.

00:02:55.223 --> 00:02:58.883
Many grandmasters left the country in protest.

00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:04.543
A grandmaster, by the way, is a prestigious title awarded by the International

00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:08.753
Chess Federation, and it’s second only to the World Champion title

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:13.533
. 
So, some grandmasters left, other grandmasters who

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:17.273
were abroad at the time chose not to return to Russia.

00:03:17.993 --> 00:03:23.533
Some who remained wrote an open letter to Putin criticising the government’s actions.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:31.533
Yet this isn’t the first, nor the most dramatic, time that the game entered the geopolitical stage.

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:39.423
In the six decades after the end of World War Two, chess was caught up in the global stand-off

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:45.693
between the communist USSR and the capitalist United States, otherwise known as the Cold War.

00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:52.323
Back then, the game’s international profile grew like never before.

00:03:53.043 --> 00:03:57.903
Chess’ global popularity during this time owed to the fact that it became an

00:03:57.913 --> 00:04:03.723
arena of ideological and cultural competition between the two dominant powers.

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:10.083
Because of the game’s importance in showcasing national brilliance, many

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:14.923
players became celebrities and heroes both in their own nations and abroad.

00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:22.013
One of them was the Soviet player, Anatoly Karpov, who was born in 1951.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:29.723
Being born right at the start of this global conflict, you could say Karpov was a Cold War baby.

00:04:30.693 --> 00:04:33.583
He would go on to become a Cold War star.

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:39.013
He came from a poor family but by the age of 15 he had

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:42.633
become the world’s youngest international chess master.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:48.013
Now, he is regarded as one of the best chess players in history.

00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:53.963
Although he clearly had a brilliant mind, Karpov also enjoyed

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:57.333
the full support of the Soviet state throughout his career.

00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:02.223
From the 1970s onwards, he actively collaborated with

00:05:02.223 --> 00:05:06.173
the KGB, the intelligence agency of the Soviet Union.

00:05:07.013 --> 00:05:12.823
And in return, the regime showered him, they covered him with privileges.

00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:19.313
So how did a humble board game become so important that its players

00:05:19.313 --> 00:05:23.273
were seen as valuable intelligence assets in a global conflict?

00:05:24.513 --> 00:05:29.043
To answer this question, it’s important to remind ourselves of what was

00:05:29.383 --> 00:05:34.333
actually happening during the Cold War, and why the 64 black and white

00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:38.873
squares of a board game became one of the places where the war was fought.

00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:45.813
In 1947, just two years after the end of history’s deadliest war,

00:05:46.173 --> 00:05:51.193
the world was plunged into a new and altogether stranger conflict.

00:05:52.573 --> 00:05:56.403
Capitalist America and the communist USSR emerged as the

00:05:56.433 --> 00:06:00.103
sole unchallenged superpowers at the end of World War II.

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:06.473
For the next four decades, these irreconcilable economic and

00:06:06.473 --> 00:06:10.553
political systems would fight for supremacy in the postwar world.

00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:15.283
With military and economic resources that dwarfed their nearest

00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:18.733
rivals, they quickly carved the world up between themselves.

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:24.673
On the one side, America led the Western bloc of capitalist countries

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:28.233
that stretched across Western Europe and much of the Middle East.

00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:33.053
On the other stood the USSR, which drew Eastern Europe,

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:36.733
Cuba, and parts of Latin America into its orbit.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:41.713
International affairs suddenly became a black and white game.

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:49.523
Smaller world players faced a stark choice: ally with either the capitalists or the

00:06:49.523 --> 00:06:54.583
communists, or else leave themselves exposed to the political ambitions of both.

00:06:55.883 --> 00:07:01.953
The two superpowers stockpiled ever-more advanced weapons at a manic intensity.

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:08.333
However, as we know, fortunately they never engaged directly in battle.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:15.583
Because the slightest provocation risked a nuclear war to end all wars, mutually

00:07:15.593 --> 00:07:20.273
assured destruction as it was called, tensions held out without an end in sight.

00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:26.053
Across the ideological divide, the superpowers watched each other’s

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:31.173
every move with hawk-eyed intent, each watched the other very closely.

00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:36.723
This was a war of nerves where tensions bubbled away beneath the surface.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.423
Because they could not be resolved in the heat of

00:07:40.463 --> 00:07:43.973
battle, they resurfaced in the most unlikely of arenas.

00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:46.023
Chess was one of them.

00:07:46.783 --> 00:07:52.503
In this rule bound world, the most rule-governed of games reigned supreme.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:58.533
Now, you may know that chess has long been associated with statesmanship.

00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:05.503
Just like diplomats and kings and queens are constrained by the rules of the international

00:08:05.503 --> 00:08:11.053
system, the pieces on the board are governed by a simple set of allowable moves.

00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:15.803
The history of the game of chess reveals this relationship well.

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:22.163
The earliest written account of the game comes in the Persian Chatrang-namak, which explains

00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:28.103
that it was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm, a great ruler of India' in the 6th century.

00:08:29.103 --> 00:08:34.323
In the 17th century, King Charles I of England, a king who would go on to

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:39.093
lose his head after a rebellion, He owned a chessboard inscribed with a

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:45.023
Latin phrase: “With these, subject and ruler strive without bloodshed’.

00:08:46.523 --> 00:08:52.373
Fast forward to 1947 and chess had transformed from a symbol

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:56.283
of governance to an actual blueprint for foreign policy.

00:08:57.113 --> 00:09:00.723
In this year, the US diplomat George Kennan gave a

00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:03.813
lecture at the US Army War College in Pennsylvania.

00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:12.275
Here, he formulated a grand vision for America’s international strategy based on the game of chess.

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:19.145
To achieve security in this newly divided world, Kennan said that America had to

00:09:19.675 --> 00:09:24.845
quote "´marshal all the forces’ at their ‘disposal on the world chessboard…in such

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:30.555
a way that the Russian sees it is…in his interests to do what you want him to do”.

00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:38.415
Kennan would become famous for being the mastermind behind what's called ‘containment strategy’.

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.695
This was a foreign policy approach that really shaped

00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:46.021
international relations during the 1950s and 1960s.

00:09:46.565 --> 00:09:50.655
It proposed maintaining two fixed spheres of influence.

00:09:51.285 --> 00:09:57.345
One would be presided over, controlled by America, the other by the Soviets.

00:09:58.061 --> 00:10:03.815
Crucially, neither side could encroach on, could go into, the others’ sphere.

00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:06.235
Neither could they resort to violence.

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:10.735
Instead, opponents would have to be cornered into, forced to

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:15.445
make, weaker moves by canny, strategic decisions and movements.

00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:22.415
And, just like in chess, tactical sacrifices would be needed to win the wider war.

00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:27.005
Chess only grew in significance as the conflict developed.

00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:32.725
As nuclear weapons made direct military engagement a suicidal prospect,

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:38.195
culture replaced armed combat as a way of attracting prestige and allies.

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:42.305
The game was not just a strategic metaphor anymore.

00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:47.305
It also became a way for communists and capitalists alike to prove their

00:10:47.305 --> 00:10:52.725
cultural superiority on the world stage, and thereby appeal no only to their

00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:58.475
own people but also to attract countries that had to date not chosen a side.

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:03.275
Karpov would express this well in his autobiography

00:11:03.525 --> 00:11:07.087
called ‘Chess is My Life’, which he published in 1980.

00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:15.565
In it, he sneered at, he laughed at, a 1972 international tournament in Texas that

00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:20.015
was sponsored by a businessman who had made his money through selling fried chicken.

00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:26.655
To him, the so-called ‘Fried Chicken Tournament’ symbolised the vulgar

00:11:26.695 --> 00:11:31.788
character of capitalist society where individual wealth and cheap

00:11:31.968 --> 00:11:36.598
gratification were more important than a collective effort to pursue greatness.

00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:42.448
So, although international sports like football and ice hockey were also

00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:46.898
ways of projecting national superiority during the Cold War, nothing

00:11:47.028 --> 00:11:50.968
compared to chess for showcasing moral and intellectual strength.

00:11:52.028 --> 00:11:56.008
And in this field, by the start of the Cold War, the Soviets

00:11:56.038 --> 00:12:00.338
already had a strong edge, a strong advantage, over the Americans.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:06.618
This was because chess was already popular in 19th century Tsarist Russia, but

00:12:06.808 --> 00:12:12.158
it was after the communist revolution of 1917 that the game really exploded.

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.278
Chess-playing institutions became developed and supported by the state.

00:12:17.982 --> 00:12:22.309
Josef Stalin, the communist leader who came to power in 1922,

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:26.058
was an enthusiastic supporter of these chess initiatives.

00:12:27.128 --> 00:12:33.898
To Stalin, skill in chess could prove the intellectual acumen, the brainpower, of the Soviet

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:40.178
people, and particularly their talents for problem solving – the sort of cognitive skills that he

00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:45.388
thought would help his country overtake the West in its economic and technological development.

00:12:46.928 --> 00:12:53.698
One of the earliest people who lobbied the Communist regime to back chess, to support chess, was

00:12:53.698 --> 00:13:00.518
a man called Nikolai Krylenko, a 1917 revolutionary who became a high-ranking Soviet politician.

00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:07.348
He sold the game to the party as an ideologically useful form of relaxation.

00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:11.352
It would encourage logic and reason among the masses, he said.

00:13:11.782 --> 00:13:16.602
This would discourage them from the religious ideas that were so hated by the communists.

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:19.642
His appeals were successful.

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:24.732
The government set up the All-Union Chess Section, a state body

00:13:24.732 --> 00:13:28.892
that organised mass chess events in workers clubs and factories.

00:13:29.862 --> 00:13:34.182
The grandest of these was the All-Union Workers competition, which

00:13:34.352 --> 00:13:38.302
attracted tens of thousands of players from all across Soviet society.

00:13:38.932 --> 00:13:44.102
It began in 1924 and happened every year for the next five decades.

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:50.412
1925, however, was the real turning point for the game in the USSR.

00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:55.282
The government awarded a prize of 30,000 rubles for the world’s

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:58.342
first state-sponsored chess tournament, which was held in Moscow.

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:05.922
The new tournament attracted the best Russian players and fuelled the game’s meteoric rise.

00:14:06.632 --> 00:14:11.192
“Chess fever” broke out and the 1920s became a period where

00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:14.862
many later grandmasters first became hooked on the game.

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:21.502
What is perhaps striking looking back on the Moscow tournament today is how open it was.

00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:26.512
Back then, international champions were invited to compete.

00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:31.832
This all changed after World War II when relations between

00:14:31.842 --> 00:14:36.402
the West and East grew more and more strained, more difficult.

00:14:37.422 --> 00:14:43.202
By the 1950s, the containment theory of international relations was in full force.

00:14:43.792 --> 00:14:48.602
The border between the communist east and the capitalist west became fixed.

00:14:49.052 --> 00:14:53.222
Suspicion reigned on both sides, and there was little opportunity for

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:56.632
Soviet chess players to compete against their Western counterparts.

00:14:57.932 --> 00:15:04.062
Then, in the 1960s, both sides began to push for a more aggressive foreign policy.

00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:10.552
Containment was out and a new strategy, known as rollback, was in.

00:15:11.482 --> 00:15:16.752
The USSR and America began actively trying to bring more countries in their orbit of

00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:23.252
influence, often by arming groups in small foreign nations to fight proxy wars on their behalf.

00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:30.592
Under these new conditions, chess became charged with political significance for the Soviet Regime.

00:15:31.572 --> 00:15:37.600
And in the early 1960s, just when passive containment was abandoned in favour of

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:43.870
active rollback, a new young contender emerged as Russia’s next top chess player.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.500
Yes, you’ve already heard his name.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.900
It was our Cold War baby, Anatoly Karpov.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.010
After showing early promise, his rise as a chess player and public figure

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.812
was carefully cultivated by the state intelligence services, the KGB.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:08.140
The KGB’s influence ran right across Soviet society, and the chess scene was no exception.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:15.020
From the 1950s onwards, the KGB accompanied every major chess player to international tournaments.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.000
The US similarly saw chess tournaments as potential battlegrounds.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.700
Because foreign chess tournaments were one of the rare moments that people

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.570
from the capitalist and communist blocs would meet and mix relatively

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:37.110
freely, it was a prime opportunity for both sides to recruit spies.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:43.270
The KGB nurtured communist loyalists within the chess world in several ways.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:49.110
They gave a comfortable state stipend, a state salary, for top players.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.250
For the best, they went even further.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:58.040
Boris Spassky, one of the greats of chess history and a world champion

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.580
in the 1970s, was given access to luxurious resorts all around the USSR.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:11.460
Yet Spassky had the sort of temperament that made the regime wary, that made it nervous.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.290
He was critical, outspoken, and temperamental – signs that he could never be completely

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:24.620
trusted, and as we’ll find out shortly, the Soviet authorities had reason to be wary.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.691
Another player who was a thorn in the side of the regime was Viktor Korchnoi.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.820
Like Spassky, Korchnoi was brilliant but non-conformist in character.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.830
As a result, he was closely watched for any sign that he may defect to the West.

00:17:44.289 --> 00:17:47.160
Anatoly Karpov, however, was a different story.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.530
First, he was a chess prodigy.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:58.360
In 1969 aged only 18, he was named as an international master - a rank just below

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.370
world champion that is awarded for life by the International Chess Federation.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.560
Second, he was the perfect party representative.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:13.000
Karpov respected the regime hierarchy and was a true believer in the USSR’s project.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.710
Unlike the unpredictable Spassky or Korchnoi, Karpov’s deferential character

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:25.160
marked him out as a reliable regime asset, as someone who could be trusted.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:31.620
Sometime in the late 1960s or early 70s, when he was perhaps still a

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:37.673
teenager, Karpov was recruited as a KGB agent under the code name Raul.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.800
From then on, Karpov would be accompanied by KGB agents

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.650
to all the tournaments he attended outside the USSR.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.420
His relationship with the KGB culminated in 1978, before

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.770
the World Chess Championship in Manilla, in the Philippines.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.190
The previous year, Karpov had won the world title for the first time.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.910
In Manilla, he would have to defend it.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.260
In the lead up to this crucial tournament, the KGB and the party had decided

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.500
that the 26-year-old star would receive all their help to retain his title.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.560
This was because his challenger would be the troublesome individualist, Korchnoi.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.350
Two years earlier, both Korchnoi and Spassky had done what

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:31.000
the KGB had always feared: they had betrayed their country.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.680
In 1976, Spassky had set a wedding date to marry a lady

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.260
called Marina, a French embassy employee in Moscow.

00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:44.471
Ever since the Soviet authorities had heard of their

00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:47.191
romance, they had been trying to break the couple apart.

00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:51.831
The KGB went to hideous lengths to achieve this.

00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:56.271
In the lead up to Spassky’s departure, they broke into Marina’s

00:19:56.271 --> 00:20:00.741
apartment in order to infect her underwear with venereal disease.

00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:04.641
The attempt was thankfully unsuccessful.

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:09.651
The final straw came when the Soviet government forced

00:20:09.671 --> 00:20:12.331
Marina to leave the country before their wedding day.

00:20:13.511 --> 00:20:16.571
Spassky immediately joined her to live in Paris because

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:19.341
he believed that she would never be allowed to return.

00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:24.517
In spite of the fact that Spassky was allowed to keep his Soviet

00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:27.867
citizenship, this was a real blow for the Communist party.

00:20:28.997 --> 00:20:30.337
Worse was to come.

00:20:31.127 --> 00:20:34.707
1976 was also the year when Korchnoi fled.

00:20:35.657 --> 00:20:39.757
The final push for him came after his loss to regime

00:20:39.757 --> 00:20:43.427
favourite Karpov in a 1974 Moscow chess tournament.

00:20:44.407 --> 00:20:50.177
The press had been criticising him harshly and his state salary had been reduced.

00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:57.407
Ever since 1974, Korchnoi had been looking for any opportunity to defect.

00:20:58.157 --> 00:21:03.017
This came when he played at a chess tournament in Amsterdam in 1976.

00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:08.447
After the match, he simply didn’t turn up to the airport for his return flight.

00:21:09.177 --> 00:21:13.447
Instead, he went to the nearest police station to ask for political asylum.

00:21:14.847 --> 00:21:21.047
By 1978, before the Manilla world tournament, he was a stateless resident in Switzerland.

00:21:21.957 --> 00:21:27.447
This was why it was paramount, it was extremely important, for the USSR that

00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:33.197
their party loyalist Karpov should stay on top at the 1978 world championship.

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:38.527
For him to be beaten by a stateless defector and critic of

00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:42.657
the regime would be a huge propaganda blow for the country.

00:21:43.657 --> 00:21:48.677
Orders to support a Karpov victory at all costs originated from the leader

00:21:48.797 --> 00:21:53.817
of the USSR himself, Leonid Brezhnev, filtering down to the head of the

00:21:53.817 --> 00:21:59.127
KGB, and then to the head of KGB’s shadowy agency, the ‘Fifth Directorate’.

00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:07.757
To boost his chances, Karpov was sent to Manilla with an entourage of 12 KGB personnel.

00:22:09.057 --> 00:22:12.967
Back in the USSR, the KGB had already imprisoned Korchnoi’s

00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:17.997
son on spurious charges to put off his father before the match.

00:22:18.967 --> 00:22:24.917
The British grandmaster Michael Stean would later say that the 1978 Manilla tournament

00:22:24.977 --> 00:22:30.077
was the ‘most bewildering and dirty’ championship match in the history of chess.

00:22:31.677 --> 00:22:36.227
Both sides resorted to outlandish measures, ridiculous and

00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:39.497
unbelievable lengths, to give their players an advantage.

00:22:40.497 --> 00:22:45.587
The second game already gave indications that this would be no ordinary match.

00:22:46.647 --> 00:22:53.327
When Karpov was given a pot of yoghurt by his handlers, the Korchnoi team was up in arms,

00:22:53.397 --> 00:22:59.487
saying that the pot was a coded instruction to Karpov, a secret message, about game strategy.

00:23:00.707 --> 00:23:05.937
In perhaps the strangest tactic ever used in the game, the KGB used

00:23:05.937 --> 00:23:11.317
a parapsychologist named Zoukhar to destabilise Korchnoi mentally.

00:23:12.437 --> 00:23:16.577
Korchnoi claimed that this famous Soviet hypnotist was there to

00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:21.287
hypnotise him from the audience stand by staring intently at him.

00:23:22.707 --> 00:23:29.287
By the eighth game, the jury, the people controlling the game, decided to move Zoukhar

00:23:29.297 --> 00:23:33.977
to a row further back to prevent him from disrupting the player’s concentration.

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:40.157
By the nineteenth game, Korchnoi’s team brought out its own group of

00:23:40.157 --> 00:23:45.097
parapsychologists, in addition to two cult leaders from a sect called

00:23:45.277 --> 00:23:50.757
Ananda Marga, who came dressed in saffron robes, bright red cloaks.

00:23:51.637 --> 00:23:56.467
These cult leaders sat down near the game in a lotus position.

00:23:57.707 --> 00:24:02.407
The Soviet delegation, who referred to the cult leaders as ‘terrorists’,

00:24:02.577 --> 00:24:06.947
said that they must not be allowed any contact with Karpov’s own team.

00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:13.337
Throughout the tournament, these cult leaders would train Korchnoi in mental techniques.

00:24:13.947 --> 00:24:21.047
One exercise they got him to do was to pierce an orange that symbolised his opponent Karpov’s head.

00:24:21.992 --> 00:24:26.196
It has also been claimed that, had it looked like Korchnoi was going to win,

00:24:26.496 --> 00:24:31.936
the KGB agents would have found a way to stop the game and poison Korchnoi's

00:24:31.956 --> 00:24:36.301
food, so that he would be killed instead of beating the Soviet champion.

00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:43.151
After 32 gruelling games, including 21 draws, Karpov

00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:46.331
finally won the match and held onto his world title.

00:24:47.741 --> 00:24:50.991
Upon his return to Russia, he was congratulated by

00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:54.761
Brezhnev and awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.

00:24:55.981 --> 00:24:59.161
Soviet Russia had won, but only just.

00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:03.631
In 1981, Karpov won once more time against his

00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:07.961
dissident rival Korchnoi, but his supremacy wasn't last.

00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:14.161
Soon, he would face a much more formidable challenger in the form of Garry Kasparov.

00:25:15.709 --> 00:25:21.709
When Karpov first played Kasparov in 1975, he beat the young contender easily.

00:25:22.569 --> 00:25:29.489
But in 1984, when they met again to compete for the world title, the balance of power had shifted.

00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:35.869
After losing the first nine games, Kasparov recovered in spectacular style.

00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:39.889
He won for the very first time against Karpov, the

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:43.509
former world champion and darling of the Soviet State.

00:25:44.989 --> 00:25:51.109
Like Korchnoi before him, the rebellious Kasparov was never fully trusted by the regime.

00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:55.631
Even as a teenager, Kasparov was very critical of Communism.

00:25:56.281 --> 00:26:01.521
Yet despite efforts by the party to hinder his career, to stop his career,

00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:05.661
Kasparov would become perhaps the greatest chess player of all time.

00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:12.381
Once the Communist regime fell in 1989, he left the party and in

00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:17.141
2013, he left Russia altogether to escape political persecution.

00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:22.401
Since then, he has been a vocal champion of Western liberal democracy.

00:26:22.854 --> 00:26:27.914
And today, he is one of the most famous and outspoken critics of Vladimir Putin.

00:26:29.384 --> 00:26:34.014
On the surface, chess provided huge propaganda victories for the Soviets.

00:26:34.514 --> 00:26:39.574
The country won all but one World Championships from 1948 to 1990.

00:26:40.444 --> 00:26:43.794
However, this could not disguise the fact that the regime

00:26:43.804 --> 00:26:48.644
had created a society hostile to creatives and intellectuals.

00:26:49.384 --> 00:26:53.024
Many of the chess players who left did so because they felt

00:26:53.234 --> 00:26:57.304
managed by their government in a way that suffocated their talents.

00:26:58.044 --> 00:27:01.424
And what about the politics of chess in the present day?

00:27:02.404 --> 00:27:09.154
Since 2017, many foreign policy experts have argued that a new Cold War is beginning.

00:27:10.024 --> 00:27:13.964
This time, the Eastern powerhouses of China and Russia

00:27:14.164 --> 00:27:17.414
are challenging the Western might of America and Europe.

00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:22.815
And chess is still a powerful metaphor for conflict, a point

00:27:22.835 --> 00:27:26.735
of comparison used by commentators and chess players alike.

00:27:27.585 --> 00:27:33.905
In an eerily familiar echo of Cold War thinking, the anti-Putin chess grandmaster, Garry

00:27:33.905 --> 00:27:41.138
Kasparov tweeted in April of 2022: “Putin’s war on Ukraine is not chess, it’s true.

00:27:41.808 --> 00:27:45.768
But it is black and white, good vs evil.”

00:27:47.568 --> 00:27:52.448
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Chess and the Cold War.

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:56.209
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:28:00.219 --> 00:28:01.459
Are you a chess player?

00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:05.719
What do you think causes this game, above almost every

00:28:05.719 --> 00:28:08.929
other, to be used as a metaphor for military conflict?

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:14.859
For the Russian listeners out there, how are these chess players remembered in your country?

00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:18.499
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:15.327
The show where you can learn fascinating things about the world and

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:20.007
listen to interesting stories at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:26.632
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the boss of an

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:32.932
American company who did something pretty radical, and that was to set the minimum

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:39.412
salary at his company to $70,000, more than double the normal minimum wage.

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:50.227
When he first did this in 2015 it was widely mocked, made fun of, as an act that would never work.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.097
Paying people more for doing the same job would make them

00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:58.477
lazy and inefficient, and people said it made no sense.

00:00:59.188 --> 00:01:06.118
But others thought it was an enlightened move, a welcome deviation from the winner takes all

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:12.778
form of capitalism that runs through American culture and dictates that companies should pay

00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:19.288
people as little as possible while bosses and shareholders grow fat on the company profits.

00:01:20.398 --> 00:01:23.998
Today we are going to find out what really happened

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:28.708
five years after this radical new idea was introduced.

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:35.522
We'll tell the story of why this man made the change, what happened to the company,

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:42.182
how it affected people, and what he is doing now in the time of coronavirus.

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:45.032
It's going to be quite an interesting one.

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:48.372
So let's get started.

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:55.302
Our story starts in 2015 in Seattle, in the west of the

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:59.192
United States, there was a company called Gravity Payments.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.667
It had been set up by a young man called Dan Price and had grown into a big company,

00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:14.027
processing billions of dollars of card payments for small businesses and employing 120 people.

00:02:15.077 --> 00:02:19.967
Dan Price was, in many ways, a classic American success story.

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:24.287
He had started this company in his teenage years and

00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:28.217
was now on a salary of over a million dollars a year.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:35.192
He was living the high life, living in a beautiful house, drinking champagne,

00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:39.872
with all of the trappings, all the signs of a successful businessman.

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:43.262
Yet something wasn't quite right.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:47.822
After speaking to his employees, he realised that

00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:51.452
lots of them were still struggling to pay the bills.

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:58.262
Although he paid them what was considered a fair market rate, for lots

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:03.257
of them, this wasn't enough, and they were still struggling financially.

00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:10.577
Some were even doing two jobs, working for Gravity Payments and

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:15.587
working part time outside of their main job in order to make ends meet.

00:03:17.212 --> 00:03:23.607
Dan thought long and hard about this and decided that he wanted to do something about it.

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:31.607
The easiest thing for him to do as an employer would be to increase the salary of

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:38.357
his employees, but he soon realised that this wasn't just a simple calculation.

00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:43.907
Do you increase everyone's salary by a certain percentage?

00:03:44.087 --> 00:03:47.477
Do you only increase it for the people who need it the most?

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:51.947
And if that's the case, how do you calculate the need?

00:03:53.357 --> 00:04:00.327
He did a lot of research into this and found a 2010 study by a Princeton behavioural

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:06.587
economist called Daniel Kahneman that suggested that there was a correlation, a connection,

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:13.427
between income and happiness, where you get increasingly happy with a higher income

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:24.050
until $75,000 but above $75,000 there is no correlation between income and happiness.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.920
People don't get any happier when they are paid above $75,000.

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:36.159
Price crunched the numbers, he did his calculations, and figured

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:42.519
out that he could afford to pay every employee a minimum of $70,000.

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.799
This would mean that he, as CEO, needed to take a big pay cut

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:57.804
from $1.1 million to the minimum of $70,000, but it was possible.

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:07.074
This was in 2015 and when he announced it, it was all over the major news networks.

00:05:08.394 --> 00:05:12.954
Some people praised him saying that this was a fantastic development

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:17.274
and a great example to all bosses and owners of companies.

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:23.874
Others thought it was ridiculous and predicted that his company would go out

00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:29.694
of business as employees became lazy because they were being paid too much.

00:05:30.924 --> 00:05:38.097
The right wing radio presenter, Rush Limbaugh called Price a communist and said, 'I hope this

00:05:38.097 --> 00:05:45.117
company is a case study in MBA programs on how socialism does not work because it's going to fail'.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:51.137
So what actually happened to the company, to Gravity Payments?

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:58.547
Immediately after the $70,000 minimum wage was introduced, a few things happened.

00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:05.247
Firstly, a couple of senior employees resigned, they handed in their notice,

00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:10.047
saying that they weren't happy that their junior employees' salaries had

00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:15.357
been raised so much as it would make them lazy and the company uncompetitive.

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:21.207
Secondly, there was a big influx of job applications.

00:06:21.687 --> 00:06:28.967
This minimum wage was significantly above the average for the area, and, understandably,

00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:34.427
it made the company a place that a lot of people suddenly wanted to work for.

00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:40.741
After the dust had settled, the initial results suggested that this

00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:44.731
had actually been a clever move by Price, and Gravity Payments.

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:51.701
According to Price, employees were more motivated and focused on their jobs.

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:59.356
He thinks this was because they didn't have to always worry about money and were happier at work.

00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:06.926
Employees were able to spend more money on their own health, exercising more and

00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:12.176
eating more healthily, which of course made them happier and more productive at work.

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:19.436
It has also allowed people to do things like start a family without the same financial concerns.

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:27.376
Before the increase in minimum wage, the company had between zero and two babies born

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:33.406
every year, and since the change they have averaged about 10 babies born per year.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:39.658
And it's not just about employees being happy; all of this

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:43.228
seems to have translated into business success as well.

00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:49.708
The company now employs twice the number of people and has almost tripled

00:07:49.738 --> 00:07:53.995
the amount of payments that it processes, so the amount of money that it

00:07:53.995 --> 00:08:00.373
processes for its clients has gone from $3.8 billion to $10.2 billion.

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:07.663
You might think, well, it obviously seems to be working happier employees, bigger

00:08:07.663 --> 00:08:13.333
business, more clients, I guess lots of companies are now copying this example.

00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:23.043
Actually, despite the media coverage and favourable press that Price got, very few companies have

00:08:23.043 --> 00:08:29.373
followed his lead, have copied his example of raising their minimum wage to such a large extent.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:36.903
And indeed the most famous business based in Seattle, Amazon, is one

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:42.393
that has famously fought against wage rises for its staff, and only

00:08:42.393 --> 00:08:48.183
relatively recently agreed to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour.

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:57.183
Of course not every business can afford to do this, and Gravity Payments was in the fortunate

00:08:57.183 --> 00:09:04.413
position of already having quite a large cushion, it had a large customer base, was making a

00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:10.353
lot of money, which makes it easier to do things like guarantee everyone a high minimum wage.

00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:16.578
For lots of small businesses, this is just a luxury that they simply don't have.

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:24.083
But even for Gravity Payments, the company run by the man once

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:28.938
dubbed 'America's best boss', it is not always plain sailing.

00:09:30.318 --> 00:09:35.718
Like hundreds of thousands of other businesses, the Corona Virus has hit it hard.

00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:42.042
Gravity Payments makes its money by processing card transactions for

00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:47.559
small businesses like restaurants, shops, and clinics, so the money

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:52.419
it makes is directly linked to how much money its customers make.

00:09:53.102 --> 00:09:58.678
And when businesses suddenly all had to close, revenue nosedived, it

00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:04.838
dropped dramatically and Gravity Payments started losing $30,000 a day.

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:07.778
The company was in trouble.

00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:13.598
Price didn't know what to do, and asked his employees for help.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:21.034
Fortunately, 98% of them agreed to take a pay cut, a reduction in

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:27.604
salary, volunteering to give up between 10% and 100% of their salary.

00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:34.189
They said that they were able to do this because they had enjoyed this higher minimum

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:40.609
wage and were able to pay off some of their debts and set aside some money as savings.

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:44.759
So they had money to spare and they were able to take this pay

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:49.039
cut because of the fact that they had a higher minimum wage.

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:55.809
Price, in solidarity with his team, cut his salary to zero.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.958
And he has become an even greater advocate for fairness in pay.

00:11:03.548 --> 00:11:09.438
While CEOs in corporate America are still paid hundreds of times more than their

00:11:09.488 --> 00:11:14.625
employees and the value of their stocks has been going up significantly while lots

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:19.995
of their employees are suffering, Price is a voice on the side of the employee.

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:25.495
And although he does seem to be a pretty lonely voice,

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:28.635
he raises some very valid points, in my opinion.

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:35.850
In Seattle, the city where both Gravity Payments and Amazon are based, he questions

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:43.170
why Amazon is spending millions of dollars on adverts thanking their employees while at

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:50.280
the same time ending the $2 an hour hazard pay for people working on the frontline at

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:58.480
the time of coronavirus, which would work out as only 0.02% of Jeff Bezos's net worth.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:06.370
And on a personal level, he says that taking this lower pay has made him happier; his

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.260
employees are doing better, which makes him feel better about the job that he is doing.

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:19.496
And he is pushing this moral angle to the people he views as greedy CEOs,

00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:25.576
saying that having so much money while their employees suffer isn't making

00:12:25.576 --> 00:12:30.076
them happy, and the sooner they realise this, the happier they will be.

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:36.556
So it's certainly an interesting idea, and what started out as an

00:12:36.676 --> 00:12:42.076
admirable experiment has turned into what seems to be a successful strategy

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:47.416
for happier, more productive, not just employees, but happier people.

00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:51.811
And to me at least, that seems like a pretty big success.

00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:58.021
Okay then, that is it for today's episode on America's best

00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:03.121
boss, the man who raised everyone's minimum salary to $70,000.

00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:08.161
Let's see how Gravity Payments manages to weather the rest of the Corona

00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:13.471
Virus, but it seems at least that Price has bought himself enough goodwill

00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:18.166
with his employees that it should be in a position to do better than most.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:22.501
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.549
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:21.219
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.049
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part three, the final

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:29.329
part, of our three-part our mini-series on Disney.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.339
In Part One we learned about the history of Disney, how it all got

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:38.039
started, and how it turned into the juggernaut that it is today.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.809
In Part Two, which you can find on the website, leonardoenglish.com,

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.399
we learned about the business of Disney, how it all works commercially,

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.529
and some of the weird and wonderful ways in which Disney makes money.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:57.699
And in this episode, Part Three, we are going to talk about the magic

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.339
of Disney, some of the reasons that Disney films, and Disney characters

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:06.239
have become some of the most loved by people all over the world.

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.099
Without these magical characters, Disney would be

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.529
nothing, they are the glue that holds everything together.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.089
So, buckle up, enjoy the episode, I think it’s going to be a fun one.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:24.559
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can follow along to

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:29.709

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:52.304
So if you haven’t checked that out yet, the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:54.354 --> 00:02:00.984
OK then, Disney, and specifically, the magic of Disney, why it all works so well.

00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:07.014
Now, perhaps the most fervent, the most passionate of Disney fans

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:10.904
might say that there is no way to explain the magic of Disney.

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:17.404
Magic can’t be taught, nobody can explain why something is magical, it just is.

00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:23.394
But, there are lots of aspects of the Disney magic that can be quite nicely explained,

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:30.684
and the fact that the original Disney, Walt Disney, died in 1966, and since then

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:35.464
his company has done a pretty good job at creating magic without him, I think it’s

00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:40.704
fair to say that there is a tried and tested formula for creating the Disney magic.

00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:46.414
Or perhaps I should say that there are formulas, multiple formulas, because

00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:51.264
as you have now learned, there is much more than one style of Disney film.

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:57.394
So in this episode we are going to reveal what some of the key themes

00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:02.254
are of Disney films, and some of the reasons why they work so well.

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:06.754
There are 5 core themes that we’re going to cover.

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:12.584
Firstly, the stories of Disney, how the stories are actually structured.

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:17.384
Secondly, and on a related point, the characters in the movie.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.844
Thirdly, the morals and theme of the movie.

00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:25.684
Fourth, the humour, the jokes, what makes us laugh.

00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:28.834
And finally, of course, the music.

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:34.414
So, the first theme is the story, the actual narrative of the movie.

00:03:35.234 --> 00:03:39.074
Every movie is a little different, but they almost always

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:43.264
use a formula that has been nicknamed The Hero’s Journey.

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:46.154
And it goes something like this.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:51.094
It starts by setting out the scene, the normal situation.

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:55.274
Then, the problem with the situation is presented - note,

00:03:55.504 --> 00:03:58.844
it’s here that the bad character is normally introduced.

00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:04.154
Then, our hero is presented with a choice, does he or

00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:07.744
she go on this journey, do they take up the challenge?

00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:14.154
Inevitably, after weighing up the options, after deliberating, they depart.

00:04:15.304 --> 00:04:19.804
They come across challenges on their journey, and meet people who can help them.

00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:25.504
Then, there is one disaster, and it looks like all hope is gone.

00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:32.944
But magically, something happens, an opportunity presents itself, often the hero is

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:39.484
reunited with a long-lost friend, our hero gets up again, and continues on their quest.

00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:46.034
There is some kind of battle, the hero emerges victorious, and everyone is happy.

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:50.974
Now, this might sound simplistic, but you can put

00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:54.464
this formula onto almost everything that Disney does.

00:04:55.444 --> 00:05:02.654
Whether it’s Alladin trying to win over the princess, Ariel trying to become a human, or Pinocchio

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:09.254
trying to become a real boy, there is always this hero’s journey that is the backbone of the film.

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:12.042
And it works incredibly well.

00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:17.593
After you finish watching a Disney movie, you aren’t left thinking, “well, that didn’t make

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:23.613
sense”, or “I wonder what happened to him or her”, there is a logical conclusion that you sort

00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:30.773
of expect but is pleasantly surprising, and you leave feeling that everything is as it should be.

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:36.803
So, from a storytelling perspective, the stories themselves, even though they might

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:42.953
not be original, are full of just the right amount of drama to make everyone feel good.

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:47.273
You leave thinking that the ending is correct, the hero has

00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:52.353
achieved his or her goal, and there aren’t any unanswered questions.

00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:58.703
There’s a principle that is attributed to Chekhov, the Russian playwright, that

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:03.853
if there is a gun introduced in a story, something needs to happen to that gun.

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:09.923
Good storytelling means anything that is introduced to the narrative is

00:06:10.063 --> 00:06:14.943
either used or explained, and Disney certainly doesn’t fail in this regard.

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:20.823
Our second ingredient in the magic of Disney is the characters.

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:28.333
Now, as any storyteller knows, a story is nothing without its characters, and Disney

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:34.753
does a fantastic job at creating characters with just the right amount of complexity.

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:41.263
Not too complicated so that a child can’t understand why the character is doing

00:06:41.263 --> 00:06:46.306
something, and not so simple that they are completely boring and predictable.

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:53.726
Despite the fact that a large proportion of the characters in Disney movies aren’t human, and don’t

00:06:53.776 --> 00:07:00.516
live in human worlds, they are humans in their character, which makes them far easier to relate to.

00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:09.916
To give a real example, Ariel, the mermaid in the Little Mermaid is not the quintessential princess.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:15.406
Instead, she is independent, headstrong, not afraid to push barriers.

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:23.236
In Toy Story, you have the characters Buzz Lightyear, the spaceman and Woody, the cowboy.

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:28.436
They are both complex characters, they have human characteristics, they

00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:32.956
are proud, they are jealous, they get sad, they have hopes and dreams.

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:38.646
And it’s not just the main good characters, the bad characters, the villains

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:43.716
are also unique, they are their own characters with their own hopes and dreams.

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:48.206
Disney also makes sure that you can normally understand

00:07:48.226 --> 00:07:51.456
why the villains are evil, what their motivations are.

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:58.576
Walt Disney believed from early on that young children could cope with evil characters,

00:07:58.756 --> 00:08:04.886
they could manage the baddies in the movies, as long as at the end of the movie

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:11.406
good triumphed over evil, that it was clear that evil wasn’t the route to success.

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:18.086
But it’s also important in Disney films that you can understand why an evil character is evil.

00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:25.816
If a character was doing something evil and you couldn’t understand why, well that was scary.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:31.846
But if you know why the character is behaving in a particular way, even if

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:36.386
what they are doing is evil, a child can manage it if they understand it.

00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:41.806
Again, to give you some examples, in The Little Mermaid, Ursula, the

00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:46.726
sea witch, has been thrown out of Atlantica by her rival, King Triton.

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:53.936
In Peter Pan, Captain Hook wants revenge on Peter Pan for feeding his hand to a crocodile.

00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:59.746
In Cinderella and Snow White, the villains are jealous of the main character.

00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:05.207
Yes, they’re nasty, but you can normally understand why they are doing what they are doing.

00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:10.627
There are, of course, exceptions - I still can’t see why Cruella De Vil needs

00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:15.707
to wear the fur of Dalmatian puppies - but the rule does generally work.

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:21.977
And on a final point related to the characters, it’s not just the main characters

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:27.477
or the villains, even the adjacent characters, the characters who help the heroes

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:32.287
on their journey end up being often just as popular as the main characters.

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:36.347
Timon and Pumba in the Lion King, for example, Baloo the

00:09:36.347 --> 00:09:40.067
bear in The Jungle Book, or Thumper the rabbit in Bambi.

00:09:40.557 --> 00:09:43.727
These are all characters with their own complex

00:09:43.727 --> 00:09:47.527
personalities, characters that are popular in their own right.

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:52.957
Because of their popularity, Disney can do more with these characters.

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:57.377
They can sell merchandise, of course, but they can even do things

00:09:57.377 --> 00:10:02.107
that create entirely different films based on these characters - for

00:10:02.107 --> 00:10:07.257
example The Return of Jafar, which was about the bad guy in Aladdin.

00:10:08.257 --> 00:10:13.217
So, Disney has great characters, characters that stand the test of time

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:17.997
and are as popular now as when they first were introduced to the world.

00:10:19.377 --> 00:10:24.427
Our third theme of every Disney film, which is intrinsically linked both to the

00:10:24.427 --> 00:10:30.107
story and the characters is the moral, the life lesson that the film teaches you.

00:10:31.237 --> 00:10:36.697
Whether that’s the importance of friends or family, the problems that arise with greed,

00:10:36.857 --> 00:10:43.127
or the importance of being true to yourself, Disney films all try to teach us something.

00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:49.747
And given that it’s almost always the parents that pull out their wallets and pay, either for

00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:55.687
cinema tickets, for Disney Plus, or for anything else that is being bought, a parent is going to be

00:10:55.697 --> 00:11:02.717
happier to do so if they think that their child is learning, being taught a valuable life lesson.

00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:09.387
Our fourth ingredient, our penultimate ingredient in the Disney special sauce, is humour.

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:14.017
Now, Disney films operate on different levels of humour.

00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:20.057
Young kids might find it funny when a character falls over on a banana, slightly older

00:11:20.057 --> 00:11:25.447
kids might find it funny when there is a misunderstanding in the film, or a play on words.

00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:31.297
And adults might see hidden funny parts in the film that kids miss altogether.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:37.377
For example, the characters in Disney films often have amazing, slightly

00:11:37.377 --> 00:11:42.147
discreet facial expressions that most kids wouldn’t completely understand.

00:11:42.977 --> 00:11:48.347
Disney has this special mix of humour that works on so many different levels, but the

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:54.587
important thing is that you don’t need to understand every single joke to understand the story.

00:11:55.237 --> 00:12:00.807
So a younger kid can watch a Disney movie and understand more or less everything, and

00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:05.187
they can have a lot of fun watching it, they don’t feel like they’ve missed out on jokes.

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:12.327
And an adult might not laugh so much at a bear tripping up on a banana, but they might laugh at

00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:18.057
some of the more complicated jokes or facial expressions made by the adult characters in the movie.

00:12:19.097 --> 00:12:25.637
Of course, it’s hard to have success as a kids film without humour, but with Disney films the humour

00:12:25.887 --> 00:12:32.797
isn’t the main part, it just helps move the story forward, and lighten often complicated scenes.

00:12:33.697 --> 00:12:36.687
Fighting scenes, for example, are often funny.

00:12:36.927 --> 00:12:42.397
There’s a fight scene in Robin Hood where the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to catch

00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:49.467
and kill Robin Hood, but the entire scene is hilarious, and nobody actually gets hurt.

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:54.817
So, humour isn’t just there to make you laugh, it helps the storyline.

00:12:56.007 --> 00:12:58.987
And our final ingredient is the music.

00:12:59.537 --> 00:13:02.677
When you think of a Disney movie, one of the first things that

00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:06.487
probably comes to mind is the music, the songs in the film.

00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:10.357
The songs aren’t only fun and enjoyable to listen

00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:14.087
to, much like the humour they have an important role.

00:13:14.987 --> 00:13:19.697
And that’s to help explain often difficult concepts to younger

00:13:19.697 --> 00:13:23.557
viewers, to help them understand how the characters are feeling.

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:28.627
In Pocahontas, for example, “Colors of the Wind” is used to

00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:32.967
discuss the pretty serious message of colonialism and race.

00:13:33.937 --> 00:13:39.567
In Toy Story’s “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” there’s the message of the importance of friendship.

00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:46.127
And in a more recent example, in Frozen’s “Let it go” there is the very important

00:13:46.137 --> 00:13:50.977
message of being true to yourself, of not trying to hide your true self.

00:13:51.977 --> 00:13:56.947
So, they serve a very important message, gluing a lot of the narrative together.

00:13:58.007 --> 00:14:01.957
And even if you might not be the sort of person who spends their life

00:14:01.997 --> 00:14:06.357
listening to Disney songs, you can't deny that they are incredibly popular.

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:14.087
The last song I mentioned, Let It Go, has been listened to 2.4 billion times on YouTube.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:20.367
The songs don’t only work to support the film, they are hugely popular in their own right.

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:26.817
So, these are five of the most important ingredients in the magic of a Disney film,

00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:32.347
and without any one of them, it’s hard to imagine a Disney film being quite the same.

00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:37.517
If there were no music, if it weren't funny, if there wasn’t some

00:14:38.227 --> 00:14:42.267
overarching moral, if there were no big characters, or if they didn’t

00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:46.937
go on this hero’s journey, a Disney film would be very different.

00:14:48.217 --> 00:14:51.577
There are, of course, several other factors that we could include.

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:57.917
The films are stunning, they are beautiful, going right back to Snow White in 1937.

00:14:58.267 --> 00:15:01.667
You can see that the artists creating the animations are

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:06.617
fantastically talented, and visually they are very appealing films.

00:15:07.417 --> 00:15:12.457
The fact that they are cartoons means that it’s a lot easier to dub them

00:15:12.587 --> 00:15:16.687
into different languages, and sell them to an international audience.

00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:20.817
With live action films, the quality of the film

00:15:20.817 --> 00:15:23.687
reduces, because anyone can see that they are dubbed.

00:15:24.437 --> 00:15:29.437
But with a cartoon, which is the majority of what Disney makes, it’s a lot easier.

00:15:30.817 --> 00:15:38.067
And finally the themes in Disney, the deeply human themes are universal, they are applicable

00:15:38.067 --> 00:15:43.557
no matter your age, your nationality, your belief systems, or even when you watch them.

00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:51.357
They are often set in imaginary worlds, where toys are alive, animals can talk or carpets can fly.

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:57.477
This makes them even more universal, because they aren’t like a world that any of us lives in.

00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:03.506
If you watch Snow White, that was made over 80 years ago, but a kid

00:16:03.506 --> 00:16:07.856
could watch it and have just as much fun as someone watching it in 1937.

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:13.466
They also don’t include cultural references, things that someone would only

00:16:13.466 --> 00:16:17.416
understand if they had grown up in a particular place at a particular time,

00:16:17.756 --> 00:16:22.736
so you can watch one now or in 100 years and it won’t be harder to understand.

00:16:24.006 --> 00:16:32.536
Love, jealousy, anger, bravery, friendship, family, fear, these are all universal themes,

00:16:32.696 --> 00:16:37.226
and there’s a reason that they feature so prominently in all of the Disney movies.

00:16:38.386 --> 00:16:44.966
And our final, final extra ingredient is nostalgia, the feeling of wanting to relive the past.

00:16:45.586 --> 00:16:50.796
Given that Disney is almost 100 years old, most people at least in the Western

00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:56.456
world will be able to remember watching, and presumably enjoying, Disney as a kid.

00:16:57.536 --> 00:17:01.976
When they grow up, and have children of their own, the universality

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:06.013
of Disney movies means that they can in turn recreate that same

00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:09.663
experience that they shared with their parents with their own children.

00:17:10.803 --> 00:17:16.593
Although the recipe for magic might be there for all of us to see, this isn’t to say that anyone,

00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:22.033
with the right ingredients and deep enough pockets, with enough money, can create a hit movie.

00:17:22.963 --> 00:17:26.793
There certainly is something else, a special sauce, some

00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:30.363
magic that is hard to pin down, that brings it all together.

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:35.883
And whatever that is, that is surely the true magic of Disney.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:43.033
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Magic of Disney,

00:17:43.283 --> 00:17:46.823
and with that comes the end of our mini-series on Disney.

00:17:47.393 --> 00:17:51.803
As a reminder, in part one we learned about the history, in part two

00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:55.793
we learned about the business, and in part three it was the magic.

00:17:56.523 --> 00:17:58.823
I hope you enjoyed it, that it was a little bit

00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:01.823
magical, and at least that you've learnt something new.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:07.853
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, what you think of Disney,

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:16.567
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:20.767
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:27.207
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Air Conditioning.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:33.237
Now, for many of you air conditioning might not seem like anything special.

00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:39.067
For billions of people around the world it is an effective way to regulate the

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:44.117
temperature, keeping us cool and comfortable when we would otherwise be too hot.

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:49.197
Indeed, for a large proportion of the developed world air conditioning

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:54.937
has gone from a luxury to a necessity, and an American household is

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:59.527
more likely to have air conditioning than a dishwasher or a dining room.

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:03.607
But it most certainly hasn’t always been this way.

00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:11.037
So, in today’s episode we are going to go on a tour of the rise of air conditioning, from how

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:18.507
humans used to regulate the temperature to Dutch magicians playing tricks on British kings, from

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:24.697
one of the founding fathers of the United States through to how the air conditioning unit became an

00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:31.677
integral part of our lives, changing our cities, countries, planet, and even reproductive habits.

00:01:32.317 --> 00:01:36.337
It is a fascinating story, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:42.777
The desire to stay cool is, of course, nothing new.

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:47.727
The ancient Egyptians and Romans employed various techniques

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:51.517
to cool down their buildings from the outside heat.

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:58.767
Some people have even claimed that the first air conditioning unit was invented in ancient Egypt.

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:06.517
The ancient Egyptians would hang wet reeds, wet plants, outside their windows, and

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:12.267
when the air came into the house it would be cooled by the moisture on the plants.

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:19.977
The Romans understood that if they could bring cold water via aqueducts under

00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:25.657
their houses, then the temperature inside would fall, it would get colder.

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:31.077
And if we really stretch the meaning of the phrase “air

00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:36.317
conditioning”, then hand fans have been used since the dawn of time.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.617
People realised that they could move air by waving

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:43.897
something and it would temporarily cool them down.

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:52.767
The Chinese inventor Ding Huan went a step further in the second century and invented a rotating

00:02:52.777 --> 00:03:00.727
fan, similar to fans we might see today, although it was manually powered by unfortunate prisoners.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:07.987
But there is a limit for quite how much the temperature can be reduced by natural

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:14.447
means, either by bringing cold water to a hot place or by fanning oneself.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:23.927
There was also, in much of the western world at least, a fear of trying to create artificial cold.

00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:28.997
Cold was something that people didn’t really understand,

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:33.187
and was thought to be something that only God could create.

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:39.977
People had no problems with artificially heating a room, by creating a fire,

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:46.437
for example, but there was a fear about creating cold in an unnatural way.

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:54.007
The author Tom Shachtman, in his 1999 book “Absolute Zero and the Conquest of

00:03:54.017 --> 00:04:00.247
Cold” suggests that this was because it was obvious how to create heat - you

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:05.797
would simply start a fire, add wood to it, and ta-da, you could heat a room.

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:09.517
But cold was more mysterious.

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:17.887
It was thought to have come from a mysterious place far to the north of Britain called Thule, and

00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:26.067
interfering with the creation of cold, at least in an artificial way, would be interfering with God.

00:04:27.247 --> 00:04:34.517
Some noblemen in Britain might have kept ice in ice cellars deep underground, and you

00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:39.907
might quite rightly joke that Britain was not exactly the country with the greatest need

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:46.207
to lower the temperature, but even in warmer, equally developed countries there was a

00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:52.707
lack of understanding about, and even interest in, how temperatures could be lowered.

00:04:54.087 --> 00:05:01.217
One of the first records of an inside temperature being lowered by artificial methods

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:08.977
actually comes in 1620, and involves a mysterious Dutch man called Cornelis Drebbel, who

00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:16.061
was a sort of magician, and the first King of a united England and Scotland, King James I.

00:05:16.802 --> 00:05:21.367
The Dutchman Drebbel had claimed that he was able to reduce the

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:25.817
air temperature, and the king decided to put him to the test.

00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:33.467
He challenged him to do it in the Great Hall of Westminster Abbey, a room which would have been

00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:39.567
one of the largest in the country at the time and still is very large even by today’s standards.

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:45.477
It was a hot summer’s day, and when King James entered the

00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:50.087
room he was surprised to find that it was indeed very cold.

00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:55.897
So cold, in fact, that he had to quickly leave because it was too cold for him.

00:05:57.087 --> 00:06:03.737
No records exist of exactly how Drebbel did it, but historians are fairly sure that

00:06:03.737 --> 00:06:09.337
he would have placed long trays where he knew the King would enter the room, filled

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:16.097
them with cold water from the river Thames and ice, and then mixed it with salt

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:22.777
and something called nitre or saltpeter, the mineral form of potassium nitrate.

00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:30.057
The addition of the nitre would have created a chemical reaction that reduced the

00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:37.147
temperature below freezing point, below zero, and cooled the air above the trays.

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:45.207
Drebbel knew that cold air displaced hot air, it moved hot air, so the hot air would rise up,

00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:52.157
meaning that the cold air would stay relatively low, directly where he thought the king would pass.

00:06:53.287 --> 00:07:00.027
Just as Drebbel thought, the king entered the room and walked through the patch of cool air.

00:07:00.697 --> 00:07:05.807
The king would have assumed that the entire room had been cooled, whereas

00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:10.117
the reality was that just a small proportion of it would have been.

00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:15.787
Although this would have been a pretty cool trick, it wasn’t a sustainable

00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:20.317
long-term solution to reducing the temperature inside buildings.

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:25.937
Scientists continued to experiment with chemical methods of reducing the

00:07:25.947 --> 00:07:31.587
temperature, and it was even a subject of great interest for one of the founding

00:07:31.607 --> 00:07:38.117
fathers of the United States, the polymath Benjamin Franklin, in the 1750s.

00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:45.127
His interest in the subject, reportedly, came from an experience that you may well have had.

00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:49.937
One hot July day in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin,

00:07:50.127 --> 00:07:54.027
so the legend goes, was sitting at his desk writing.

00:07:54.577 --> 00:08:00.027
He was sweating a lot, and got up to change his sweaty, wet shirt.

00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:08.927
When he put on his fresh, dry shirt it felt hotter than the wet one he had taken off.

00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:13.027
He thought that perhaps this had something to do with the

00:08:13.247 --> 00:08:18.467
liquid evaporating, so he conducted a series of experiments.

00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:26.177
He put various different materials on a thermometer and observed what happened when they evaporated.

00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:34.984
Sure enough, evaporation caused the temperature to reduce, and Franklin even observed that, "From

00:08:34.984 --> 00:08:41.039
this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.067
The 19th century saw the arrival of more cooling

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:50.095
technologies, including the creation of an ice making machine.

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:58.138
Primitive versions of “air conditioning” could be created by pumping air over ice, but

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:04.188
there wasn’t really a mass-market use case for this, and it was very expensive to do.

00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:10.817
Strange enough as it might seem to us now, there is simply not much

00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:16.007
evidence that people were shouting out for cooler temperatures inside.

00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:22.687
It was just accepted that on warm summer days you would be hot and slightly uncomfortable.

00:09:23.737 --> 00:09:28.687
Houses would be cooled through natural means, by not allowing

00:09:28.697 --> 00:09:33.247
hot air to come in in the first place, and by using ventilation.

00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:39.117
The first air conditioning unit as we would know it only came

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:44.657
in 1903, and was developed by an American man called Willis H.

00:09:44.887 --> 00:09:45.387
Carrier.

00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:53.227
He was asked by a printing company to create a machine that would regulate humidity in the building.

00:09:54.597 --> 00:09:58.537
In the summer months the air inside the building was so

00:09:58.577 --> 00:10:03.307
humid that the paper would shrink, it would reduce in size.

00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:09.387
Of course, this was hugely disruptive to the operations of the printing business.

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:16.507
Carrier created a machine that used a system of fans to blow over

00:10:16.687 --> 00:10:22.217
coils, small tubes in a ring, which would be filled with cold water.

00:10:23.307 --> 00:10:30.357
As the humid air moved over the cold coils, water would be removed from the air and the

00:10:30.357 --> 00:10:37.117
air temperature would fall, so when this air was blown out it was colder than before.

00:10:38.057 --> 00:10:41.077
What’s more, it also reduced the humidity.

00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:46.797
Bingo, Carrier had just invented the air conditioning system.

00:10:47.407 --> 00:10:53.607
Indeed, the majority of the 2 billion air conditioning units that exist globally

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:59.757
today still work on a very similar principle - pushing air over something cold.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:05.497
The publishing company was very happy with Carrier, and he quickly

00:11:05.537 --> 00:11:11.037
patented his invention and created a company, a company that actually still

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:18.167
exists today, is worth $50 billion and employs 56,000 people worldwide.

00:11:18.867 --> 00:11:23.187
But while you might think it was an immediate success, and

00:11:23.327 --> 00:11:27.997
Carrier was off to the races with his new invention, he wasn’t.

00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:34.637
The public took a lot of convincing that this was something that would actually benefit them.

00:11:35.497 --> 00:11:40.277
The initial uses of air conditioning units were primarily in

00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:44.947
places like hospitals, and there was very limited personal use.

00:11:45.827 --> 00:11:49.527
The first contact that most Americans would have had

00:11:49.547 --> 00:11:53.877
with air conditioning was in movie theatres, in cinemas.

00:11:54.847 --> 00:12:00.277
As you might imagine, small closed rooms with lots of sweaty people

00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:06.377
smoking for extended periods of time had pretty horrible, sticky air.

00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:14.367
Starting in the 1920s American cinemas started to use air conditioning systems to cool

00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:20.537
down their cinemas in the summer, making them significantly more pleasant places to be and

00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:26.987
attracting consumers who would have been put off going by how hot and sticky they were.

00:12:28.017 --> 00:12:33.797
The Great Depression and the Second World War put a dent in the adoption of

00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:39.467
air conditioners, but the post-war period in the United States was boom time

00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:45.227
for all sorts of consumer electronics, and air conditioners were no exception.

00:12:46.287 --> 00:12:50.097
This was helped by the price reducing dramatically.

00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:55.897
In 1932, when the first personal air conditioning units came on sale,

00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:03.867
they cost today’s equivalent of anywhere from $120,000 to $600,000.

00:13:04.777 --> 00:13:12.087
Obviously that put them out of the reach of everyone but the very richest - it was the equivalent

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:18.437
of employing your own group of servants simply to follow you everywhere with a large fan.

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:24.467
When Carrier first went on tour with his air conditioner units, it took a

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:30.247
while for the American public to believe that they actually worked, and there

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:36.647
are photos of him doing stunts like going to a fair and creating an igloo

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:41.477
full of ice, which was cooled down of course by his air conditioning units.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:46.257
The marketing tricks worked, and more and more Americans

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:51.167
decided to buy this latest must-have modern convenience.

00:13:51.887 --> 00:13:54.997
By 1960, 12 percent of U.S.

00:13:54.997 --> 00:13:56.867
households had air conditioning.

00:13:57.427 --> 00:14:04.107
20 years later, in 1980, it was 55 percent; now it’s 90 percent,

00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:10.007
only just behind Japan where 91% of houses have air conditioning.

00:14:10.777 --> 00:14:13.137
The rest of the world is following suit.

00:14:13.137 --> 00:14:21.427
60% of households in China now have AC, up from less than 8% in 1994.

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:28.757
But the reality is that most households in hot countries, the households where

00:14:28.757 --> 00:14:33.677
the need to be cool is the greatest, don’t yet have an air conditioning unit.

00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:40.237
Fewer than 5% of households in India have air conditioning, 9% of

00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:45.267
households in Indonesia and 16% of households in Brazil have it.

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:52.417
And by 2050 around 2/3 of the world’s households could have an air

00:14:52.417 --> 00:14:57.367
conditioner, according to the reports by The International Energy Agency.

00:14:58.047 --> 00:15:05.957
Now, let’s take a moment to think about the impact of this, the good, the bad, and the unexpected.

00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:07.877
So, the good.

00:15:08.297 --> 00:15:12.427
Purely on a personal human comfort level, it makes

00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:15.417
indoor life more manageable when it’s hot outside.

00:15:16.087 --> 00:15:20.397
It is also hugely important in places like hospitals, where

00:15:20.617 --> 00:15:24.587
having a constant temperature is important for patient health.

00:15:25.597 --> 00:15:32.307
Being able to easily, quickly and cheaply reduce the temperature literally saves lives.

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:38.447
Every year during heat waves people, normally older people, unnecessarily

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:43.047
die at home, and air conditioning reduces the risk of this happening.

00:15:43.747 --> 00:15:45.077
So far so good.

00:15:45.907 --> 00:15:50.347
Before we get to “the bad”, let’s look at the unexpected,

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:55.037
or perhaps indirect and not so immediately obvious.

00:15:55.927 --> 00:16:01.477
To understand this, it’s most helpful to look at the situation in the United States,

00:16:01.567 --> 00:16:06.487
since that is the country with the longest history of air conditioning usage.

00:16:07.477 --> 00:16:13.767
So, firstly, the population of hotter states, further south, has increased.

00:16:14.427 --> 00:16:20.837
Having air conditioning means the heat isn’t such an obstacle, and means that living in a hot

00:16:20.837 --> 00:16:27.097
place suddenly becomes more attractive, so long as you can control the indoor temperature, that is.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:35.017
The area of the US called The Sun Belt now has 30% of the US population vs.

00:16:35.477 --> 00:16:37.727
only 24% 100 years ago.

00:16:38.727 --> 00:16:43.287
Another unexpected consequence is an evening out, a

00:16:43.497 --> 00:16:47.147
flattening out of birth rates throughout the year.

00:16:48.457 --> 00:16:55.967
In the United States, until the 1970s fewer babies were born in spring because the summer months

00:16:55.967 --> 00:17:03.057
were hot and sticky, and this meant that fewer babies were conceived when it was too hot inside.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:09.437
As soon as Americans were able to regulate the indoor temperature, well, this

00:17:09.437 --> 00:17:15.277
changed, and the number of babies born in spring was similar to the rest of the year.

00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:21.967
Now, on to the ugly or negative consequences of air conditioning.

00:17:23.107 --> 00:17:26.617
It simply uses a colossal amount of electricity.

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:34.367
20% of all electricity used within buildings globally is used to power air conditioners.

00:17:35.047 --> 00:17:41.907
And especially in countries with heavy fossil fuel usage, such as China, this electricity

00:17:42.087 --> 00:17:47.707
comes from burning fossil fuels, which in turn causes global temperatures to increase,

00:17:47.777 --> 00:17:53.537
causing an increased usage of electricity for air conditioning, and it’s a vicious cycle.

00:17:54.377 --> 00:18:00.047
What’s more, some of the chemicals that were used as coolants in air conditioners,

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:05.347
one called Freon for example, have done terrible damage to the ozone layer.

00:18:06.407 --> 00:18:12.277
Although production of Freon is now banned in the United States, it’s still in use by

00:18:12.277 --> 00:18:17.357
a majority of the air conditioner units, they don't actually have to get rid of it.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:23.837
Air conditioners are getting more environmentally friendly, or rather less environmentally

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:30.137
unfriendly, by using less damaging refrigerants and by being more energy efficient.

00:18:31.087 --> 00:18:38.197
But, although the most efficient air conditioners end up costing less in the long term because they

00:18:38.197 --> 00:18:45.527
use less electricity, they are normally more expensive upfront, you have to pay more to buy one.

00:18:46.437 --> 00:18:52.277
Especially in less wealthy countries, people are reluctant or unable

00:18:52.337 --> 00:18:58.097
to spend more money upfront, and also are not fully aware of the cost

00:18:58.157 --> 00:19:02.607
savings that can be had by buying more efficient air conditioners.

00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:08.107
Therefore, even though the technology exists to make air conditioning

00:19:08.107 --> 00:19:12.447
units significantly more efficient, globally there are still a

00:19:12.457 --> 00:19:17.427
vast number of inefficient machines that are installed every year.

00:19:18.447 --> 00:19:21.817
What’s more, in the countries where the average temperature

00:19:21.997 --> 00:19:27.697
is above 25C, only 10% of people live with air conditioning.

00:19:28.317 --> 00:19:32.827
As these countries develop, more and more air conditioners will be sold,

00:19:33.007 --> 00:19:40.117
with the IEA, the International Energy Agency, predicting that up to 75%

00:19:40.117 --> 00:19:43.867
of people in the world’s hottest countries will have air conditioning.

00:19:44.827 --> 00:19:49.787
And the result of this will be huge pressure on the energy networks.

00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:55.067
Now, is it all doom and gloom, is it all tragic?

00:19:55.247 --> 00:20:02.057
And what are some possible solutions to what some people have called a crisis in plain sight?

00:20:03.017 --> 00:20:08.447
Well, there are plenty of proposed solutions, both low and high tech.

00:20:09.377 --> 00:20:15.027
If you remember right at the start of the episode, when we talked about how the Egyptians

00:20:15.207 --> 00:20:21.347
and Romans cooled their houses, many energy experts have said that by making changes to

00:20:21.347 --> 00:20:26.897
how we design buildings in the first place we can reduce the demand for air conditioning.

00:20:27.957 --> 00:20:32.707
There’s an idea called “passive cooling”, which really encompasses

00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:37.197
everything that uses non-electrical means to cool down air.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:44.057
It could mean planting trees, painting houses white to reflect the sun, more

00:20:44.057 --> 00:20:50.727
efficient shutters, and curtains and even air ducts, pipes that go through

00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:55.807
buildings allowing air to naturally circulate and cool buildings down.

00:20:56.737 --> 00:21:02.677
On a higher tech side, there are some interesting companies working on solutions that might

00:21:02.727 --> 00:21:09.353
remind you of the trick that the Dutch magician, Cornelius Drebbel, played on King James I.

00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:14.657
Remember that Drebbel only cooled a specific small piece

00:21:14.697 --> 00:21:17.567
of the room that he knew the king would walk through.

00:21:18.427 --> 00:21:23.587
So, there are companies that are working on personal air conditioning units,

00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:29.187
which aim to cool down small patches of air around an individual rather than

00:21:29.417 --> 00:21:34.937
entire rooms, and are thus significantly more efficient for certain use cases.

00:21:36.177 --> 00:21:42.807
In the future, it’s not unthinkable that access to cool air, or a “reasonable”

00:21:43.007 --> 00:21:48.027
indoor temperature, might be considered as an inalienable human right.

00:21:49.067 --> 00:21:55.197
Whether this is delivered through lower tech “passive cooling” building design or higher

00:21:55.197 --> 00:22:00.517
tech products, it is certainly going to be an even greater concern in the years to come.

00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:06.497
In the meantime, sales of air conditioning units, based on the same principles

00:22:06.527 --> 00:22:11.757
and technology that was developed by Carrier back in 1903, continue to

00:22:11.757 --> 00:22:16.857
rise every single year, and are not predicted to slow down any time soon.

00:22:17.727 --> 00:22:21.597
Time will only tell the true cost of staying cool.

00:22:25.214 --> 00:22:30.624
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The History of Air Conditioning.

00:22:31.014 --> 00:22:35.934
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that the next time you

00:22:35.934 --> 00:22:41.644
switch on your air conditioning, if indeed you are one of the billions of people who live in a house

00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:47.664
with air conditioning, then you’ll know a little bit more about the history of that marvellous box.

00:22:48.494 --> 00:22:51.684
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

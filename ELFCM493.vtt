Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.540
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.660
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.700
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Meiji Restoration.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.620
It is the most amazing period of history when Japan completed an

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.270
unbelievable transformation from feudal state to industrialised superpower.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.700
This is also a longstanding request from an amazing member, Taiki

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.790
from Japan, so Taiki, this one is for you, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.570
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk about The Meiji Restoration.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.680
Historians love to look back at a particular point in history as a defining

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.070
moment, a period that changed everything, a year or decade or century

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.949
even that fundamentally shifted the destiny of a country or region.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.289
The American Civil War in the United States or the French Revolution for France.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.790
You could even say that for Greece and Italy, it is the “glory days” of Ancient Greece and Rome.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.119
When it comes to the fascinating history of Japan, there is one period that changed everything,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.880
a period that undeniably changed the trajectory not only of Japan, but the entire East

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.740
Asian region, and that’s the period we’ll be talking about today, the Meiji Restoration.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.070
So, to understand its importance, we need to first remind ourselves of some Japanese history.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:01.050
From the 12th to the 19th century, really, Japan could be best described as a feudal

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.800
society, not so dissimilar from the feudalism that existed in much of medieval Europe.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.600
Peasants toiled the land and paid taxes to a small

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.385
collection of powerful feudal leaders, called daimyos.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.080
Japan had an emperor, but he was really a symbolic leader; real power rested in the hands

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:32.459
of the shogun, essentially a military dictator who ruled the country with a rod of iron.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.829
And there were also the samurai, the warrior class.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.440
They were highly skilled warriors, and in fact they were the only

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.099
members of Japanese society that were allowed to carry weapons.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.570
The samurai were particularly useful in periods of conflict,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.040
which were frequent from the 12th to 16th centuries.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:02.619
But in the year 1600, Japan entered a period of peace and relative stability,  the Edo period.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.049
And the samurai suddenly found themselves at a bit of a loss for things to do.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.119
With no wars to wage and no battles to fight, being a

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.299
skilled and dangerous warrior was a little pointless.

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.309
Their role started to change, and they transitioned into becoming

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.089
bureaucrats - managing estates, collecting taxes, and enforcing law and order.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.259
During this period, so the 17th, 18th and first half of the 19th

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:41.099
centuries, this period of peace brought increased prosperity to Japan.

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.149
The population doubled, there was significant development in art

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:49.039
and culture, you know, life was good, for some people at least.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.619
There were still famines, Japanese society was still stratified,

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.769
with very clear social classes and no way to move between them.

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:03.769
It was medieval Europe, essentially, but with a distinctly Japanese flavour.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:11.499
And this all happened in almost complete isolation from the rest of the world.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.259
Foreigners were, for all extents and purposes, banned from entering the

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.659
country, and Japanese people who left the country weren’t allowed back in.

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:27.329
It’s hard to think of a more isolationist state than this.

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:35.579
But while this was possible in a world in which feudalism reigned supreme, a world of

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:42.409
farming, wooden ships and hand-to-hand combat, outside Japan the world was changing.

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:48.289
And across the ocean, far away from the Japanese coast, in

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.069
some pockets of the world, remarkable progress was being made.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.849
The Industrial Revolution had started in northern England, and by the

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:04.019
mid-19th century, steamships were chugging across oceans, railroads had

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:08.289
been laid up and down England and were being laid across the United States.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:15.469
Gunpowder might have been invented 1,000 years earlier, in 9th century China, but

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:21.119
Western industrial powers had mastered the art of manufacturing modern weapons,

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:27.019
weapons against which even the most accomplished of samurai would not stand a chance.

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:33.684
In Japan, military technology had barely moved on for 500 years.

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:39.589
The samurai were skilled and dangerous warriors, but their weapons were bows

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:45.259
and arrows, and swords; they were no match for rifles, cannons and warships.

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.499
The Japanese had witnessed this firsthand, or at least had a real-life example of this,

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:59.139
with the Opium Wars, when British warships steamrollered over the Chinese and China

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:04.359
was forced to make major concessions to Britain, including handing over Hong Kong.

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:10.359
The winds of change were blowing, and it seemed like it

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:13.709
would not be long before they reached the shores of Japan.

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:18.149
And arrive they did in 1853.

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:25.559
On the 8th of July, 1853, four black ships steamed into Tokyo Bay.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:32.379
They were commanded by Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry, an American naval officer.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.529
He said that he came in peace, with the intention of opening up trade and diplomatic relations

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:46.739
between Japan and the United States, but if that was not possible, he was prepared to use force.

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:55.096
The ships were equipped with high-powered American cannons as a show of American industrial might.

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:59.109
These cannons had specially designed shells that would

00:06:59.109 --> 00:07:02.699
explode on impact, setting fire to everything around them.

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:10.089
And the city of Tokyo, or Edo as it was then called, was made of small wooden houses.

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:16.339
The city would burn to ashes without the Americans even having to set foot in Japan.

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:24.029
Eventually, Perry was allowed ashore, and he delivered a letter signed by the American

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.649
president in which he stated that the United States did not have any religious purpose–the

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:34.559
US had no intention of sending Christian missionaries or interfering in Japanese

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:40.989
society–it only wanted to formally open up trade relations between the two countries.

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.109
This wasn’t specifically because Japan was such an attractive market; the primary reason

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:54.469
was that the US wanted Japan to sell its coal to American ships en route to China.

00:07:55.869 --> 00:08:00.849
To state the obvious, it is a long way across the Pacific Ocean, and

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:05.590
if Japan could be a stopping point where American ships could refuel,

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:11.019
this would open up the huge Chinese market to American merchants.

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:19.449
He wasn’t expecting an answer there and then; he would be back in a year, and he expected a yes.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:26.919
If not, well, he had clearly demonstrated the kind of weaponry America possessed, and Japan

00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:32.509
had the example of what happened to China when it tried to stand up against British gunships.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:37.009
Should Japan open up its economy to the outside?

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:41.349
If yes, what would this mean for Japanese sovereignty?

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:47.789
Would this be a Trojan horse, would it be the end of Japan, of the emperor, of the shogun?

00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:54.979
If not, well how would they stand a chance against American shells and rifles?

00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:59.679
It would be a big decision for the shogun, who let’s

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:02.439
remember was the military dictator of the country.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:08.909
But just three days after Perry and the Americans left, the ruling

00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:14.679
shogun died and was replaced by his ineffective and sickly son.

00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:22.789
Now, the shogun was meant to be strong and powerful, and this young man was in no way up

00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:30.039
to the task, he was physically weak and clearly incapable of making such a big decision.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:35.629
And his first big mistake was to show his weakness.

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:41.349
He decided to put it to a vote, he asked the daimyos, a

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:45.019
committee of regional leaders, what they thought should be done.

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:51.459
And the result was indecisive…some said yes, others

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:55.529
no, others gave long-winded and indecisive answers.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:10:01.159
It was the first time that the shogun had ever put a decision to his

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:06.109
subordinates, and to many, it was seen as a sign of great weakness.

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:12.099
What was the point of a shogun, what was the point of a leader, if he wasn’t able to lead?

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:19.349
Eventually, the decision was taken to accept the American request, and after

00:10:19.349 --> 00:10:26.749
some tense negotiations, on the 31st of March, 1854, the Convention of Kanagawa

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:31.119
was signed, which made trade relations between the two countries official.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.369
Treaties with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Russia followed shortly

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:43.939
after, and almost overnight Japan had gone from complete isolation to having

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:49.139
diplomatic and trade relations with the most industrialised nations on the planet.

00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:57.709
However these treaties were not done on an equal footing; Japan wasn’t able to set its own

00:10:57.709 --> 00:11:03.979
tariffs, foreigners didn’t have to obey Japanese laws, the treaties were deeply unequal.

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:09.429
Indeed, they are now known by historians as “The Unequal Treaties”.

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:14.739
And this was a key turning point for Japan.

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:19.559
The arrival of Western powers, with their demands and advanced

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:22.949
technology, had exposed the weaknesses of the shogunate.

00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:28.859
The treaties Japan was forced to sign weren’t just agreements—they were symbols of Japan’s

00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:34.629
compromised sovereignty and they created a ripple of dissatisfaction across the country.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:42.619
A group of powerful samurai got together to challenge the shogunate’s authority and push for a

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:49.279
new political order centred around someone who had been sidelined for 500 years: the emperor.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:55.779
Long story short, they managed to topple the shogunate and restore the emperor to power.

00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:04.049
By 1868 the shogunate was no more, and the Japanese emperor Mutsuhito, who was

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:09.169
only 14 years old at the time, was proclaimed supreme ruler of the country.

00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:14.929
Now, the emperor was surrounded by a group of advisors who made decisions for him,

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:20.369
and it seems that his strength was to get out of the way and trust these people.

00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:27.619
They were in agreement that Japan needed to do one thing and do it quickly: modernise.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:32.109
The reason for the success of the Western industrial powers

00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:36.719
was, they believed, because of their technology and industry.

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:44.419
So to have a chance in the modern world, or perhaps we should say modernising world, Japan

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:49.619
needed to copy whatever it was that had enabled its adversaries to develop so quickly.

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:53.519
The longer Japan waited, the weaker its position would be.

00:12:53.869 --> 00:12:58.289
It could not fight the future; it had to catch up and catch up fast.

00:12:59.749 --> 00:13:03.579
What happened next was perhaps the fastest, most

00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:07.029
successful industrial development in modern history.

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:11.699
Japanese merchants studied Western industrial designs of everything

00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:16.399
from trains to factories and built Japanese versions in Japan.

00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:20.209
Japanese scientists studied Western crop-growing

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:23.629
techniques in order to extract more value from the land.

00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:28.709
There was huge educational reform, with a modern public education system

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:33.229
based on Western models that transformed literacy levels in the country.

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:38.619
On a bureaucratic level, Japan even copied Western systems of government,

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:42.759
creating a central Japanese government with its own Prime Minister.

00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:49.889
And there was serious reform to the military and the creation of a modern army and navy.

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:55.699
The samurai had served their purpose, but swords, arrows and

00:13:55.699 --> 00:13:59.869
horses weren’t as useful in an era of gunships and cannons.

00:14:00.619 --> 00:14:04.919
In 1873 the emperor announced the abolition of the samurai

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:08.769
class and the introduction of conscription in Japan.

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:15.689
It might sound like a small thing, a formality, but to emphasise quite how much

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:20.919
of a change it was, previously the samurai were the only people who were allowed

00:14:20.969 --> 00:14:26.899
to carry weapons; now everybody of military age was forced to serve in the army.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:33.529
And all of these changes didn’t happen in a vacuum, it wasn’t some secret plan

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:38.679
where Japanese officials snuck into British or German or American factories

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:42.349
or businesses or governments and tried to figure out what was going on.

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:49.279
This was enabled, or at least majorly facilitated, by Western advisors who had

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:54.639
been brought in specifically to train and share knowledge with the people of Japan.

00:14:55.789 --> 00:15:00.379
It’s believed that there were somewhere between two and three thousand foreigners who

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:05.209
were shipped into Japan during this period to do everything from teaching Japanese

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:10.389
engineers to sharing Western farming techniques to training the Japanese military.

00:15:11.819 --> 00:15:17.409
And this was underpinned by a complete overhaul of the Japanese social system that

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:22.749
had still been medieval, essentially, until the arrival of Perry and his black ships.

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:28.469
Japanese society had previously been highly stratified, organised into

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:33.069
different classes, with no real possibility of movement between each other.

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:40.919
This class system was abolished in 1869, and replaced with a more merit-based

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:46.429
system, meaning who your parents were no longer defined the trajectory of your life.

00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:52.286
And as to the results, well, it was the foundations of

00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:56.796
20th-century Japan, it was a masterclass in economic development.

00:15:57.606 --> 00:16:06.686
Japan went from producing 600,000 tonnes of coal a year in 1875 to 21 million by 1913.

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:18.426
It had built 26 steamships by 1873, but by 1913 that number had shot to over 1,500.

00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:22.801
The country had gone from having its first 29 kilometres

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:28.586
of railroad in 1872 through to 11,000 by 1914.

00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:36.206
Japan managed to do in a generation what had taken European powers centuries.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:43.056
Yes, it had the blueprint of how to do things like build factories or administer a large

00:16:43.056 --> 00:16:49.646
public education system, but the speed at which the transformation took place was astounding.

00:16:51.246 --> 00:16:56.476
And to say that it had simply copied everything is an overstatement.

00:16:57.036 --> 00:17:01.566
Yes, Japan took inspiration from industrial powers and copied

00:17:01.566 --> 00:17:06.046
a lot, but there was a uniquely Japanese twist to everything.

00:17:07.136 --> 00:17:12.776
From the blending of Japanese and Western architectural styles to the mixing

00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:17.736
of Western and traditional clothing, Japan clearly didn’t become a mere Western

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:24.286
industrial power in Asia, but an Asian country with Western-style industrial power.

00:17:25.726 --> 00:17:31.056
And by the end of the 19th century, Japan had caught up, pretty much,

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:35.736
with the USA and Britain, and had become a serious regional power.

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:40.536
And what do regional powers do, in the late 19th century at least?

00:17:40.996 --> 00:17:45.936
Well they invade their neighbours, and the newly industrialised nation couldn’t

00:17:45.936 --> 00:17:52.536
resist following suit, first invading China in 1894 and then Russia 10 years later.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:56.606
As you may know, they won in both cases.

00:17:57.136 --> 00:18:03.646
The victory against China wasn’t such a surprise, as China was still a pre-industrial country and

00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:09.126
weakened by the Opium Wars and the unequal treaties it had been forced to sign with Western powers.

00:18:09.746 --> 00:18:15.476
But the victory against Russia was a big surprise; this island that had

00:18:15.536 --> 00:18:21.166
previously been essentially a medieval fiefdom 50 years prior had managed to

00:18:21.206 --> 00:18:25.946
overpower the country that had defeated Napoleon less than 100 years before.

00:18:26.866 --> 00:18:32.306
And this set the tone for the Japanese imperial ambitions that would follow, and then

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:38.086
Japan’s behaviour in the early 20th century, but that's a story for another episode.

00:18:39.196 --> 00:18:44.606
In 1912 Emperor Mutsuhito, the so-called Meiji Emperor died.

00:18:45.246 --> 00:18:49.356
He was only 59, but in his lifetime he had overseen the

00:18:49.356 --> 00:18:52.406
most spectacular development in his country’s history.

00:18:53.436 --> 00:18:56.686
To this day it remains an example to other countries

00:18:56.876 --> 00:18:59.566
of what is possible when you set your mind to it.

00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:05.356
As the New York Times put it when reporting on his funeral, "The contrast between

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:10.616
that which preceded the funeral car and that which followed was striking indeed.

00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:16.066
Before it went old Japan; after it came new Japan."

00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:24.236
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Meiji Restoration, this fascinating period

00:19:24.236 --> 00:19:29.436
of Japanese history that helps you understand why Japan is in the position it is today.

00:19:30.226 --> 00:19:33.066
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:33.436 --> 00:19:37.736
We have loads of members from Japan, so, to my Japanese friends in particular,

00:19:37.986 --> 00:19:42.476
what other nuances do you think people should know about The Meiji Restoration?

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:45.936
What are some visible influences in Japan today?

00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:49.616
And how would Japanese history have been different if

00:19:49.616 --> 00:19:53.366
the shogun had refused the advances of those black ships?

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:56.856
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

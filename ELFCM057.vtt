Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:14.792
by Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to weird and wonderful stories and

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:20.402
learn fascinating things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:28.327
I'm Alastar Budge and today we are going to be talking about Margaret Thatcher, The Iron Lady.

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.614
She was the first and so far only female leader of the UK, Europe's first female

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:44.564
prime minister, and someone who was either a fantastic modernising leader that laid the foundations

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:52.004
for decades of prosperity for Britain, or the worst leader in British history who stole milk

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:58.724
from children, destroyed hardworking jobs, and changed the fabric of Britain for the worse.

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.024
It all depends on who you ask of course.

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:05.654
I am pretty excited about today's episode.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:11.886
So what we will do today is first talk about who she was and what she did.

00:01:12.816 --> 00:01:20.016
We'll talk about why she was and still is loved by some and hated by others,

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:25.986
and by the end of the episode, you should at least be able to make up your

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:30.276
own mind about what side of the fence you want to be on.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.077
Okay then let's get started.

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:39.372
Margaret Thatcher was born in 1925 in England.

00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:47.372
After studying at Oxford and a brief stint, a brief period, as a chemist and lawyer,

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:54.692
she became an MP, a member of parliament at the age of 33 for the Conservatives.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:02.522
She rose through the party and was elected its leader in 1975.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.640
And then led the Conservatives to victory

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.750
in three general elections in 1979, 1983, and 1987.

00:02:13.942 --> 00:02:22.192
So she was Prime Minister of the UK from 1979 to 1989 and was frequently

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:28.436
referred to as the most powerful woman in the world throughout the 1980s.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.299
When she came to power in 1979 the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.199
UK was a very different country to what it is today.

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:43.599
Inflation was very high at 23% in the late 1970s.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:51.599
The trade unions in the UK were much stronger than they are now, with around

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:00.379
one in four people forming part of a trade union in 1979 versus about one in eight now.

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.870
And taxes were much higher, the highest

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.700
rate of personal tax in the UK was 83% and now the highest rate is 45%

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.352
so taxes were almost twice as high for the highest earners.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.060
Thatcher subscribed to a neoliberal view of the world and believed

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.860
that the UK's reliance on government, and the state to provide for you was not only

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.490
the root cause of the lack of economic growth, but just not how people should live.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:45.172
She thought that people had become dependent on the state, and if this

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:51.173
could be reduced, if private enterprise could be encouraged and inefficient

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:55.810
enterprises could be shut down, then this would open a brand

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.020
new chapter in the UK's development, leading to better outcomes for everyone.

00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:10.591
At the time she was in power, remember, the USSR was in decline and it seemed

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:18.571
clear that Russia's experiment with communism was not resulting in prosperity for its people.

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:26.481
And in the US, across the pond, Ronald Reagan was in power in the White House.

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:34.406
He was also pushing a similar neoliberal agenda, one where privatisation was

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:39.344
encouraged and the philosophy was around reducing the size of

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:45.014
the state with the view that the private sector was the best way to drive growth.

00:04:46.904 --> 00:04:53.774
So in several countries across the world, there was this neoliberal experiment, with

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:59.834
the view that this was the way to grow the economy, to raise living standards for

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:05.377
people and just generally how society should be, how people should live.

00:05:06.217 --> 00:05:13.777
It was almost the parallel opposite to communism and in many ways it was a reaction to it.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:20.763
Thatcher was a firm believer in this view of the world, saying

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:26.463
"the state has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.493
There is no such thing as public money.

00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:32.103
There is only taxpayers' money."

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:38.142
She had already actually implemented several policies while

00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:45.012
she was just an MP, as Education Secretary, policies that hinted at what she

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:52.392
would do if she got the PM job, and displayed her views towards public spending.

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:59.233
The most famous of these relates to milk in schools for children.

00:06:01.068 --> 00:06:08.298
Since 1944, children in schools in Britain had been given free milk in order to make

00:06:08.298 --> 00:06:15.708
sure that every child was at least given the basic nutrients at school by the state.

00:06:16.783 --> 00:06:21.763
As part of the plan to reduce people's reliance on the state

00:06:22.123 --> 00:06:28.038
and reduce public spending, Thatcher stopped this free milk, Alastair Budge:

00:06:28.038 --> 00:06:33.346
only allowing it to be given to younger children for nutritional purposes.

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:40.306
Obviously there was a big backlash, a big negative reaction, and

00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:45.677
Thatcher earned the nickname "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher."

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:51.227
So to snatch is to take something away quickly from someone.

00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:56.117
So it's not a great nickname to have really, but it

00:06:56.117 --> 00:07:00.197
did not stop her ascent to power, her rise to power.

00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:11.567
When she won the general election in 1979 she had a mandate to continue her mission to reduce

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:19.487
people's reliance on the state and, in her mind at least, to build a more independent society.

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:25.012
She made some enormous changes to British society in her

00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:30.112
10 years in power, and we don't have time to cover all of them today.

00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:37.222
So we will talk about coal mines, privatisation, and housing,

00:07:37.702 --> 00:07:42.112
and look at three of the legacies that she left behind.

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:52.292
Firstly, in the 1980s there were still lots of coal mines in the UK, mines that

00:07:52.292 --> 00:08:00.542
supported hundreds of thousands of jobs and provided economic opportunities for families

00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:04.952
often in more rural areas without other job opportunities.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:13.712
Without the mines, these jobs would be lost and it would lead to economic hardship for

00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:19.532
hundreds of thousands of people in these areas, particularly in the North of England.

00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:27.559
However, Thatcher saw that a lot of these mines were actually unprofitable.

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:32.739
They were owned by the state, but actually cost more money to

00:08:32.739 --> 00:08:37.629
operate than they brought in in revenue, so they were losing money.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.620
Thatcher proposed to close the mines, which of course would result

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.800
in thousands of people losing their jobs and thousands more families being affected.

00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:56.538
The trade unions, as I said earlier on, were

00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:01.278
very strong at this time, and the miners went on strike.

00:09:02.901 --> 00:09:08.832
In 1979 alone, 29 million working days were lost, Alastair Budge:

00:09:08.832 --> 00:09:16.332
and it's estimated that this cost Britain about one and a half billion pounds.

00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:22.237
Thatcher wouldn't budge, she wouldn't negotiate with the miners.

00:09:23.577 --> 00:09:30.957
The result, as you may know, was the closing of dozens of British mines, the loss of hundreds of

00:09:30.957 --> 00:09:38.997
thousands of jobs, and of course communities being hugely affected by the sudden removal of this

00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:46.592
industry that had provided employment and support for a large proportion of the local residents.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:52.959
And even now, if you go to areas where there used to be a strong

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:59.589
mining community, Margaret Thatcher is still, generally speaking of course, despised.

00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:00.639
She is hated.

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:09.849
She has never been forgiven and is viewed as someone who needlessly destroyed communities and lives.

00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:17.202
Her view, however, was that she was modernising Britain and it made no

00:10:17.202 --> 00:10:23.742
sense to just keep industries open if they made no financial sense,no business sense.

00:10:24.822 --> 00:10:30.462
She was a neoliberal and propping up, supporting a failing

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:34.992
industry was completely against everything she believed in.

00:10:36.593 --> 00:10:41.933
One of her other great beliefs was in privatisation, that the state

00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:48.773
shouldn't own things and that it should sell off, it should privatise as much as it could.

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:51.699
So that's exactly what she did.

00:10:52.409 --> 00:11:00.599
First came the big industries, gas, water, and electricity, which had previously been state owned.

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:06.509
These were sold and turned into private companies, in effect.

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:13.619
The view was that they would be better run, better managed if they were privately

00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:20.009
run, and this would result in a better service and lower prices for people.

00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:28.444
The results of this privatisation 30 years later are still mixed.

00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:31.714
It's clear that privatisation has caused

00:11:31.894 --> 00:11:36.604
improvements in performance within some industries, but not all.

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:44.423
And indeed, there are still some calls for the state to renationalise some

00:11:44.423 --> 00:11:51.173
of the industries that had been privatised under Thatcher, such as the train networks.

00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:56.669
The other big privatisation that happened under Margaret Thatcher

00:11:57.089 --> 00:12:02.619
was the privatisation of council housing, of state housing.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.760
In 1979, 42% of people in the UK lived in something

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.530
called a council house, a house owned by the local government.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:22.180
They were a tenant in that house, so they paid rent ultimately to the government.

00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:29.196
Margaret Thatcher believed that everyone should at least have the right

00:12:29.256 --> 00:12:36.846
to own their own home, and so she embarked on a campaign to encourage tenants in council

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:43.926
houses to buy their own houses, to become owners of property as opposed to tenants.

00:12:44.641 --> 00:12:48.031
Of course, even though houses were a lot cheaper back

00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:53.551
then, people didn't have the cash sitting around to just buy a house.

00:12:54.196 --> 00:13:03.406
So the prices were reduced dramatically from the market price, often up to 50% lower, and

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:10.906
people were also given a hundred percent mortgages so they could effectively buy the house

00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:17.236
completely with borrowed money from the bank for a lot less than the price should really be.

00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:24.137
And 1.6 million council houses in Britain were sold like this, Alastair Budge:

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:28.727
sold off initially to the people who lived in them, but later on there

00:13:28.727 --> 00:13:35.087
was nothing stopping them from being resold to anyone, including private investors.

00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:45.842
So now, 40 years later, a large proportion of these council flats are owned by buy-to-let

00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:51.262
landlords, people who buy properties just to rent them out afterwards to others.

00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:57.112
And it's hard to deny that this policy of Thatcher's has

00:13:57.112 --> 00:14:02.152
contributed greatly to the increase in house prices in the UK.

00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:07.568
Indeed, house prices under Margaret Thatcher increased by

00:14:07.568 --> 00:14:14.888
251% which is more than under any other prime minister in British history.

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:22.509
Talking more about her legacy, there isn't really anyone in recent

00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:30.219
British political history who has been quite so divisive, who has divided opinion so much.

00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:35.919
Of course, prime ministers and leaders since then have varied in

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:41.469
popularity and the man in the job right now, Boris Johnson has his

00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:47.079
fair share, both of diehard fans and people who think he's a disaster.

00:14:48.249 --> 00:14:54.969
But the changes that took place under Thatcher on British society, things that have

00:14:54.969 --> 00:15:00.864
really left a mark, are like nothing that came after, or even that came before.

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:07.545
I was actually not even three years old when Margaret Thatcher lost power, so

00:15:07.695 --> 00:15:12.645
I won't try to tell you about this from my own personal experience of being there at the time.

00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:21.135
But even if you were too young to have lived under her, you did know about her.

00:15:22.215 --> 00:15:27.480
Memories run deep and the name Thatcher and the implications

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:32.340
of her policies are continuously felt by future generations.

00:15:33.568 --> 00:15:37.618
I used to have a girlfriend from a town called Wakefield,

00:15:37.948 --> 00:15:41.511
which is just outside Leeds in the North of England, Alastair Budge:

00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:46.790
and an area where several mines were closed by Thatcher.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:56.410
And I remember when I first went there, to Wakefield, this would have been in 2010, so 20

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:04.000
years after Thatcher lost power, the conversation seemed to naturally arrive at Margaret

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.846
Thatcher, and I could see her dad just getting angrier and angrier just at

00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:16.626
the thought, just getting angry at things that had happened 30 years before.

00:16:18.126 --> 00:16:25.116
And when Margaret Thatcher died in 2013 you could tell a lot about the

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:31.086
political leanings of newspapers in Britain, of whether a newspaper was right

00:16:31.086 --> 00:16:37.356
wing or left wing by the headline on the front page the day after she died.

00:16:38.971 --> 00:16:46.341
The Daily Mail had the headline, "The Woman Who Saved Britain", The Daily Express,

00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:55.011
another fairly right wing newspaper, had "Farewell Iron Lady", The Socialist

00:16:55.011 --> 00:17:00.711
Worker paper had the headline, "Rejoice, Thatcher's Dead Special Pullout".

00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:09.226
And when she died, people scrambled to unpack her legacy,

00:17:09.346 --> 00:17:13.966
to truly understand the impact of what she had done.

00:17:15.796 --> 00:17:21.496
Yes, she had been responsible for the losses of hundreds of thousands of

00:17:21.766 --> 00:17:28.726
industrial jobs and fundamentally changed the fabric of British society.

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:39.856
But did this privatisation drag Britain out of an economic funk, of a period of very slow growth?

00:17:40.306 --> 00:17:48.646
And did it set the stage for the economic growth that Britain has enjoyed since she left office?

00:17:50.476 --> 00:17:54.856
Whatever you believe, and whatever you think of Margaret Thatcher, it's

00:17:54.856 --> 00:18:00.646
hard to deny that she was a political phenomenon, a pretty amazing woman,

00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:04.726
and a very important figure in British political history.

00:18:06.436 --> 00:18:10.257
I just want to end this episode with a quote from Alastair Budge:

00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:16.107
a man called Richard Longworth, who is the former foreign correspondent for the

00:18:16.107 --> 00:18:21.597
American newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, who sums it up pretty well, I think.

00:18:22.407 --> 00:18:29.037
He said "she was perhaps the most admired, hated, fascinating,

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:33.387
boring, radical and conservative leader in the Western world."

00:18:34.331 --> 00:18:39.453
The only thing that I think we can all agree on is that she is pretty divisive.

00:18:41.023 --> 00:18:47.683
So if you ever want a way to start up a conversation with someone in Britain and know that they

00:18:47.713 --> 00:18:53.413
probably will have a lot to say, you can just ask them what they think of Margaret Thatcher.

00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:56.788
You'll probably be listening for a while.

00:18:58.845 --> 00:19:04.725
Okay then, that is it for this episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:19:05.025 --> 00:19:06.585
I hope it's been an interesting one.

00:19:07.635 --> 00:19:13.455
There is obviously a lot more to say about Margaret Thatcher, and I didn't mention

00:19:13.605 --> 00:19:19.485
Northern Ireland, the Falklands war, Poll tax, Hong Kong or hundreds of other things

00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:25.900
that she has a huge impact on, otherwise, this podcast would have been hours long.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.790
But I do hope that it has given you a bit of background and we've

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.380
covered a few interesting ideas that give you the measure of the woman.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.850
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

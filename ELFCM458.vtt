Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.260
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.060
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.141
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about OnlyFans.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.350
To some, it is a tool for emancipation, allowing people

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.510
to launch their own businesses and control their destiny.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.199
To others, it taps into the worst of human nature, forcing young

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.350
people to wreck their future in the hope of making a quick buck today.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.980
Now, I should probably add a little disclaimer that we are going to be talking

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.620
about an adult website today, so if you hadn’t realised that by now and you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.339
would prefer not to listen to this, then now is your time to press pause.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.932
Ok then, let’s talk about OnlyFans.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.610
If you have never heard of OnlyFans, and you are wondering what it is,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.110
your first port of call might be to go to the website www.onlyfans.com.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.230
On the homepage, you would see the text “Sign up to support your favourite creators”.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.389
Hmm, I’m still not so clear on what this is, you might be thinking.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.280
So, you might click around a bit more.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.929
Perhaps you’d go to the “About” page, where you’d find the text “OnlyFans is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.860
the 18+ subscription platform empowering creators to own their full potential,

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.050
monetize their content, and develop authentic connections with their fans.”

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.000
End quote.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.670
OK, 18+, so you probably realise that there is an adult, most likely sexual

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.590
nature to this, but “empowering creators to own their full potential, monetize

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.090
their content, and develop authentic connections with their fans”, well this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.690
sounds quite a lot like corporate jargon, it doesn’t exactly give away that much.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.350
You might scroll down and read that “As a creator first

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.779
platform - our creator community is at the heart of everything we do.”

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.369
More corporate jargon, so you keep reading.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.290
“We are committed to building the safest social media platform in the world.”,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.010
“We are an inclusive platform, home to a diverse range of content creators.”

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.720
Still, it might not be particularly clear, but you wouldn’t have to click very

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.740
far from the homepage before you will be confronted by suggestive content.

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.440
And then it will hit you.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.149
It is a website where you can pay to see pictures and videos of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.520
people, mainly women, and mostly women not wearing many if any clothes.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.879
Now, there might not be anything extraordinary about this.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.390
The internet is full of pornography, with estimates of exactly how much

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.280
ranging from 4% to 30% of the entire internet being sexually explicit content.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.399
In other words, porn.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.920
There is nothing in itself remarkable about a website where people can watch

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.209
naked videos of other people, but there is something remarkable about OnlyFans.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.039
In our last episode, one of our member-only ones, we

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.539
learned about the life of Hugh Hefner, the Playboy magnate.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.599
Hefner built a large and successful business on sex,

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.089
and the sexualisation of women, but he was a gatekeeper.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.860
He chose who to put in the magazine, and on the front cover.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.909
It wasn’t like anyone could just turn up at the Playboy offices, declare

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.980
that they were ready to take off their clothes and be put on the front cover.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:52.649
For better or for worse, they had to look a certain way, and had to play by Playboy’s rules.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.719
OnlyFans is a very different proposition.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.149
Anyone can, if they so desire, create their own page on OnlyFans; there is no gatekeeper.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.409
These become the “content creators” you heard about

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.010
in the corporate jargon spiel I read you at the start.

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.539
And anyone can “subscribe” to them, which might unlock extra

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.059
photos or videos, or allow them to message the creator directly.

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:24.020
They can be tipped, like a bartender.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.729
Or, dare I say, like a stripper.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.679
The amounts are generally relatively small, a few dollars.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.150
But they add up.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.929
And some of the most successful “creators” on OnlyFans make a vast amount

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.100
of money, we are talking about millions of dollars a month in some cases.

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:50.019
It has made some people fabulously wealthy, and the media is full of stories about young

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.319
people, typically young women, who have in many cases given up promising careers to focus

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:01.439
on an OnlyFans, where they have managed to attract a dedicated following and earn an

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:06.869
enviable living, making far more money than they would have done in their previous 9-5 job.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.349
It is, in many ways, an attractive proposition.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.780
You can be your own boss, decide how much to work and when to work.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.780
There is no commuting, no sitting in your car or waiting

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.769
for the bus to go to a boring 9-5 in a dull office.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.020
All you need is a mobile phone and access to the internet,

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.590
and you can make a living from anywhere in the world.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.679
Well, that’s not quite all of course.

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:40.679
You also need to upload content that people are prepared to pay

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:44.999
for, and this is where things take something of a darker turn.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.299
The content that people are prepared to pay the most

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:52.130
for is, surprise surprise, sexually explicit content.

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.890
Naked pictures, sexual videos, and so on.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.299
Sure, there are some exceptions, but as the “18+ reference” in

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:06.830
the corporate jargon at the start hinted at, OnlyFans is first and

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.370
foremost a site that allows women to sell sexually explicit content.

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:17.059
Or to put it another way, it is a site that allows men to pay

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.409
random women on the internet for sexually explicit content.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.559
It was founded in 2016, one year before Hugh Hefner’s death, by a British

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:32.029
entrepreneur with a background in softcore pornography, creating cam sites

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:36.409
and websites where people could request personalised videos from adult models.

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.829
The entrepreneur saw what might seem obvious to anyone now.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.839
People will happily pay other people directly for their sexually explicit videos,

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:52.379
they don’t need to go through a gatekeeper like Hugh Hefner or a porn studio.

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.239
OnlyFans was happy to facilitate the transaction, for a fee, of course.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:04.658
It takes a 20% cut of every transaction,  so for every $10 a

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:10.238
creator is paid by one of their subscribers, they get $8 and the

00:07:10.238 --> 00:07:15.728
remaining $2 goes to OnlyFans as a cost of facilitating the service.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.508
It is a simple business model, but it is devilishly effective.

00:07:22.788 --> 00:07:27.018
After it was launched, the website got off to a relatively slow start,

00:07:27.348 --> 00:07:32.488
but it was handed a gift in the form of the COVID pandemic, where a

00:07:32.488 --> 00:07:37.918
reported 200,000 new people were signing up to it every single day.

00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:42.798
Suddenly, lockdowns forced people into their homes.

00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:47.098
Clearly, this was problematic for all manner of occupations,

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.928
but the adult industry was particularly widely hit.

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:56.688
Strippers, porn stars, glamour models and so on, they were all unable to work.

00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.858
With limited means of earning a living, these kinds of people turned to OnlyFans.

00:08:04.228 --> 00:08:07.868
After all, it was not much different from what they were doing before.

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:10.618
In fact, it was easier.

00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:16.318
You just needed to take a few photos or videos, and people from all over the

00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:21.738
world could subscribe to your content, send you money, become your “fans”.

00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:27.978
And even though 20% might seem like a lot, it was a lot less than

00:08:27.978 --> 00:08:32.618
might be taken in other places, like in strip clubs, which often force

00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:37.708
the stripper to pay to work there, and can take 50% of her earnings.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:42.818
What’s more, it scaled indefinitely, so there was

00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:45.638
no limit to the amount of money someone could earn.

00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:54.538
For a stripper to earn $10,000 let’s say, that person would have to do $10,000 worth of dances.

00:08:55.228 --> 00:08:58.628
I am not a stripper, but that sounds like a lot of work to me.

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:04.708
For a stripper to earn $10,000 on OnlyFans, they could find that they could earn that

00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:12.299
in a week or even a day, and it would be no more work than earning $1,000 or even $10.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:16.489
They didn’t need to strip more, they uploaded the same amount

00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:19.659
of content, they just needed more people to subscribe to it.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:26.339
And as you heard, with 200,000 people signing up every single day, often people bored

00:09:26.349 --> 00:09:31.209
at home with money burning a hole in their pocket, there was more than enough demand.

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:38.339
Understandably, for the content creators, it was an attractive proposition, and the

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:42.643
stories about the eye-watering amounts of money earned by some people on OnlyFans

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:47.159
attracted people who had never previously done anything like this to the platform.

00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:52.289
This previously unknown British website became part of

00:09:52.309 --> 00:09:56.299
mainstream culture, referenced even in a song by Beyoncé.

00:09:57.429 --> 00:10:04.449
Now, for the record, I should add that OnlyFans isn’t only sexually explicit content of naked women.

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:11.609
There is also sexually explicit content provided by men, although men only make up 30% of

00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:17.669
the “content creators”, but, as you might imagine, 70% of the people paying for content.

00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:25.209
There is also content that isn’t exactly sexually explicit, but is still content of a sexual nature.

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:31.599
For example, there was a story back in 2021 of a Canadian plumber who

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:36.669
packed it all in, he quit his day job, to go on OnlyFans, where he has

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:41.009
made over a million dollars primarily selling pictures of his feet.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:45.598
There is even content that isn’t sexually explicit at all.

00:10:46.343 --> 00:10:52.869
There are food influencers, travel reviewers, all sorts of people who use OnlyFans as a way

00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:59.509
to connect directly with their fans, and be rewarded for the content they create, but they

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:05.569
tend to be much less popular and much worse paid than the people who are prepared to bare all.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.160
After all, sex sells.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.210
But in August of 2021, OnlyFans shocked its users by

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.880
announcing that it was going to ban all sexual content.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.660
There was a huge uproar from its community, and after much toing

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.400
and froing, the decision was reversed a mere six days later.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.150
In fact, there is an interesting backstory as to why this happened, it’s too long to

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:38.710
go into here, but if you are interested in it you can listen to episode number 376,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.400
where we talk about the relationship between the world of finance and the world of porn.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.900
Now, back to our story.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.940
It would be remiss of me perhaps to not make any kind of link between OnlyFans

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.200
and the membership we have for this podcast, and for Leonardo English.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.720
In case you hadn’t realised, we have a membership that allows people to subscribe for a

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:07.310
mixture of bonus content and learning materials, like interactive transcripts and advanced

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:13.090
vocabulary, as well as support the work that my small team and I do, exactly like an OnlyFans.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.460
Of course, there are no nudes or suggestive pictures involved, and it is my

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.520
understanding that people become members for slightly different reasons to

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.000
the reason someone might subscribe to an OnlyFans account, but there are some

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.027
parallels between what I am doing and what is done by the good ladies of OnlyFans.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.557
And although some critics might say, “well, the “content creators” of OnlyFans

00:12:39.557 --> 00:12:43.750
are just taking off their clothes off, it’s hardly work”, in the interviews I

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:48.200
went through when researching this episode, for the most successful people on

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.560
the platform, it does seem like a demanding and most certainly full-time job.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.570
There is the preparing for the photoshoots, choosing the

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.100
pictures, messaging fans, creating images and videos.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.420
Many are putting in 12 hour days, and then waking up to dozens

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.510
of messages from fans, requests for new videos, and so on.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:16.830
Like many things, perhaps it sounds glamorous and wonderful to be sought after by so many

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:22.240
strangers all over the world, but the reality is that it can be hard and serious work.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.090
Or perhaps it doesn’t sound glamorous at all.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.100
For most of the creators on OnlyFans, despite the fact that they are called

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.560
“creators” or “entrepreneurs”, it is, at the end of the day, sex work,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.240
and comes with many of the same difficulties as “traditional” sex work.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.440
According to one recent survey, 50% of adult content creators on OnlyFans

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.930
admitted that it has negatively impacted their personal life, ruining

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.450
relationships and meaning that they have trouble finding a partner.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.220
Now, perhaps you are hearing this and thinking, “well, obviously, I wouldn’t want to be in a

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.340
relationship with someone who was selling naked pictures of themself to strangers on the internet”.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.620
Or perhaps you’re listening and thinking, “people are so closed minded, OnlyFans

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:16.120
is a powerful way for women who might otherwise be exploited to be their own boss”.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.840
Whatever side you fall down on, clearly having an OnlyFans is becoming a more and more

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.930
acceptable thing for a person to do, and a more acceptable thing for people to subscribe to.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.550
To be precise, according to the OnlyFans financial accounts from 2022, the

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:41.850
platform now has over 3 million “creators” and going on 250 million “fans”.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.210
And it makes bucketloads of money.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:51.740
$5.5 billion was spent on the site in 2022, meaning

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.397
the 20% cut the company takes was worth $1.1 billion.

00:14:57.024 --> 00:15:01.370
It is a huge business, and it’s one that is changing society.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.480
These are 3 million people selling predominantly explicit content on the

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.630
internet, many of whom would never have done it before, but have been

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.430
lured in by the promise of making tens of thousands of dollars a month.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:24.300
Yes, an OnlyFans account, and its associated content can be deleted at any time, but there are ways

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:30.450
that people can take screenshots and make copies of the content, which will exist…well, forever.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:37.360
According to some of the greatest critics of the platform, millions of people, predominantly

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:44.000
young people and predominantly young women, are simply unaware or in denial about what

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:48.920
damage they may be doing to their future prospects in exchange for a quick buck today.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.155
And for most, they really aren’t making that much money at all.

00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:59.640
For all of the stories of people making millions of dollars a year by sharing

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.940
some intimate pictures and engaging with fans, according to one report

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.780
there are only 300 creators who earn more than a million dollars a year.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.780
The average creator on OnlyFans, according to the same

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:20.020
report, only has 21 paying subscribers and earns $180 a month.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:26.420
Of course, $180 is still $180, and especially in

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.820
countries with weaker currencies that can go a long way.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.310
But in places like the United States or the United Kingdom, where $180 a month

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.010
really isn’t all that much, it begs the question of whether it really is worth it.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:48.580
Is it worth a future boss, colleague, partner or family member finding out about your OnlyFans

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.690
account and seeing your intimate photos only to make enough money to cover your electricity bill?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.150
Maybe it is, and for some creators it is about more than

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.890
just making money; it’s about what the money brings.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.200
For the most successful creators on OnlyFans, it has changed their lives, allowing them

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.390
to become spectacularly wealthy and more importantly, in control of their own destiny.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.790
You could say that they get trapped on a hamster wheel of content creation,

00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:22.872
constantly having to share new pictures and videos in order to retain

00:17:22.872 --> 00:17:27.802
their fans and reel in new ones, but they are free to quit at any time.

00:17:29.322 --> 00:17:34.332
For the women who switched from traditional sex work to OnlyFans, women who were

00:17:34.402 --> 00:17:38.642
strippers or porn stars, it has allowed them to take what they were doing anyway

00:17:38.852 --> 00:17:44.822
and monetise it in a much more effective and safer way, without manipulative male

00:17:44.822 --> 00:17:49.302
bosses or producers getting between them and the people who want to consume their

00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:54.862
content, and without being harassed by seedy men in nightclubs or hotel rooms.

00:17:55.931 --> 00:17:59.692
But for everyone else, the impact is less clear.

00:18:00.952 --> 00:18:05.962
And we’ve been talking primarily about the content creator side of things so far, the

00:18:06.132 --> 00:18:10.962
principally female content creators sharing their explicit content with their fans.

00:18:11.972 --> 00:18:15.732
We haven’t really talked about the people paying for it, the predominantly

00:18:15.742 --> 00:18:22.252
male audience that spent over $5 billion paying for nude content in 2022.

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:29.904
Of course, men being able to pay to access some sort of sexual content is nothing new, whether

00:18:29.904 --> 00:18:35.884
we’re talking about prostitution in Pompeii or someone in the 1960s reading Playboy magazine.

00:18:36.924 --> 00:18:41.314
But the scale and the ease with which someone can access personalised

00:18:41.324 --> 00:18:45.274
sexual content on OnlyFans is something new and unparalleled.

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:50.084
You can sign up in minutes, subscribe to unlock explicit content of

00:18:50.084 --> 00:18:54.414
a stranger on the internet, send them messages, and video requests.

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:56.754
And all for just a few dollars.

00:18:57.874 --> 00:19:00.984
So, how does this affect the men who use it?

00:19:02.004 --> 00:19:06.894
Well, there are fears about how this might damage a man’s ability to be intimate with

00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:12.334
someone in real life, and how it will alter expectations about how a partner should behave.

00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:19.004
If a young man grows up being able to request personalised sexual content at the tap

00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:24.694
of a button, having his choice of 3 million different people of all shapes, sizes, and

00:19:24.694 --> 00:19:30.914
personalities, and being able to chat with any of them anonymously, for a fee of course,

00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:36.174
how will this affect his ability to exist in the real world, how will it affect his

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:41.684
ability to have a relationship with a real woman, or with a real man for that matter?

00:19:42.924 --> 00:19:50.454
It is a big unknown, and to its biggest critics OnlyFans is doing huge damage to society, it’s

00:19:50.464 --> 00:19:57.034
just happening slowly, so like a frog in boiling water, we won’t realise until it’s too late.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:03.304
OK then, that is it for today's episode on OnlyFans.

00:20:03.574 --> 00:20:06.504
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:07.264 --> 00:20:10.034
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:10.514 --> 00:20:14.404
Do you think OnlyFans is a harmless platform enabling people to earn

00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:18.074
a decent living, or is it much more dangerous than people realise?

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:23.284
Do you know anyone who has joined OnlyFans, and how has it impacted them?

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:26.754
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

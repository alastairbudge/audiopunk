Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.529
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.869
wonderful things about the world, at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:28.739
I’m Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Cornish Smugglers.

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:35.919
Today’s story is one of my favourites, and involves crime, taxes, regional

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:41.759
rivalries in the UK, pirates, the King of Prussia, and even murder.

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:46.922
OK, then Cornish Smugglers.

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:55.402
These two words, Cornish, and Smuggler, might be unfamiliar to you, so if you are

00:00:55.402 --> 00:01:00.602
wondering what this episode is going to be about, let me quickly enlighten you.

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:07.872
Cornish means from the English county of Cornwall, the area to the very south

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:13.902
west of the country, directly across from Brittany, in northwestern France.

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:21.462
And a smuggler, if you didn’t know the word, is someone who brings in something to a

00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:28.542
country without declaring it to the authorities, typically because it is illegal, in

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:34.802
the case of something like drugs, or because they simply don’t want to pay taxes on it.

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:42.652
So, today we are going to be talking about the fascinating history of smuggling in Cornwall.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:50.182
First off we’ll talk about the reasons why this area of the country was

00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:56.952
such a hotbed for it, then how it actually worked, when it all happened, and

00:01:57.082 --> 00:02:01.692
we’ll have the chance to meet some of the colourful characters behind it all.

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:08.252
Let’s start with a quick reminder about the place we’re talking about, Cornwall.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:18.232
Cornwall today is a large, rural, county famous for its beautiful beaches and even its surfing.

00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:26.602
It's known for its idyllic villages, beautiful countryside, and delicious seafood, and it’s

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:34.112
consistently one of the top tourist destinations in the country, especially for people planning

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:41.802
a “staycation” - a slightly silly word for having a vacation while staying in the country.

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:48.592
And if you were to go to Cornwall from London, from the capital, you

00:02:48.592 --> 00:02:54.492
would realise that it’s a very long way away, by UK standards at least.

00:02:55.232 --> 00:03:01.962
It’s about 500km away, and would take you about 6 hours to drive there.

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:07.042
It’s almost as far away from London as Scotland is.

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:12.892
And this distance from the country’s capital has always meant

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:17.982
that Cornwall has retained a lot of its sense of independence.

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:24.042
It has its own language, Cornish, which is similar to

00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:29.012
Breton, the Celtic language of Brittany, in northern France.

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:38.292
It has its own flag, and the Cornish people have a real sense of their own, Cornish, identity.

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:44.862
And, understandably, people in a region with a strong sense of its own

00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:51.452
identity are not always so keen on taking orders from the central government.

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:56.752
This is, of course, not a uniquely British phenomenon.

00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:04.542
There’s a saying in Mandarin Chinese which is “Tiān gāo, huángdì yuǎn”, which you

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:11.802
would translate as “Heaven is high and the emperor is far away”, and there’s another in

00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:19.232
Russian that translates as something like "God is on high and the tsar is very far away".

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:27.972
Both of these phrases have similar meanings - the further a place is away from the

00:04:27.982 --> 00:04:34.952
central seat of government and power, the less likely that place is to abide by the law.

00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:40.562
Although we have no such saying in English, Cornwall

00:04:40.962 --> 00:04:44.612
would be a place where such a saying would be appropriate.

00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:52.982
And if you were to travel back in time, to the 18th century, such a saying would have practically

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:59.832
been the official motto of Cornwall, due to the levels of smuggling going on in the region.

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:02.392
Why, you might ask?

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:09.492
Well, for smuggling to be attractive, there needs to be a big advantage to importing

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:14.612
something to a country illegally instead of declaring it to the authorities.

00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:22.692
It just so happened that in Britain of the 18th century, there was a large advantage.

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:28.002
Britain had spent much of the 18th century in military

00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:32.702
conflicts with its old foe, its old enemy, France.

00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:39.582
Wars are expensive, and to pay for them, governments need to generate money.

00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.372
How do governments raise money?

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:43.822
Taxes, of course.

00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:50.932
And at this time the main source of tax revenue was on goods being brought into

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:59.222
the country - an income tax, a tax on money you make, wasn’t introduced until 1789.

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:06.882
Given the national reliance on import taxes, these taxes were pretty high.

00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:16.602
The tax on imported tea was as high as 110%, meaning that tea that cost, let’s

00:06:16.602 --> 00:06:25.082
say €1, would have another €1.10 added in tax, more than doubling the cost.

00:06:26.632 --> 00:06:30.202
Imported alcohol was even more highly taxed.

00:06:31.102 --> 00:06:37.151
There were 18 different taxes on brandy and gin, which would mean a €10

00:06:37.202 --> 00:06:46.092
bottle would have €25 of tax added to it, taking the final cost to €35.

00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:54.472
So, it will not surprise you to find out that people did everything they could to avoid paying

00:06:54.472 --> 00:07:00.972
these taxes, by smuggling goods into the country without declaring them to the authorities.

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:07.482
And Cornwall was the epicentre, the absolute center, of this activity.

00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:11.852
We already know that Cornwall is far from London.

00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:18.472
It’s almost 6 hours driving on modern roads, and in the 18th century there were

00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:23.912
very limited roads, meaning it would have taken weeks to get there on a horse.

00:07:25.322 --> 00:07:32.072
Cornwall also has a lot of coastline, and a lot of small, hidden bays, which

00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:37.202
can come in useful for bringing goods onto land without anyone noticing.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:45.922
The Cornish people also felt no real loyalty to the King, a man who was

00:07:45.992 --> 00:07:51.702
asking them to pay for wars against France, a country that many Cornish

00:07:51.702 --> 00:07:56.382
people would have felt more in common with than they did with Londoners.

00:07:57.462 --> 00:08:05.482
The result was a boom in smuggling, and at its peak the central British government, when asked

00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:14.232
to estimate the extent of smuggling in Cornwall, estimated that no less than the entire adult

00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:21.852
population was involved in smuggling, either as an importer of smuggled goods or as a consumer.

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:25.732
So, how did it actually work in practice?

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:30.332
There were gangs of smugglers, who would either work in

00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:33.992
collaboration with the traders, or who would steal from them.

00:08:34.845 --> 00:08:40.815
For those working in collaboration with the traders, in the dead of night the smugglers

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:46.855
would go out silently on their boats, they would go up to the side of a ship full of

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:53.725
rum or brandy, and the ship would offload a large part of its cargo to the smugglers.

00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:59.675
They would then return to the shore, and the goods would enter the local

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:05.325
market, undeclared of course, meaning that they could be sold for significantly

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:10.185
less than what the cost would have been if tax had been paid on them.

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:19.295
Alternatively, the smugglers would simply sail to mainland Europe, normally northern France, buy

00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:25.415
goods there, and return to Cornwall, and then import them without declaring it to the authorities.

00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:32.555
By all reports, this type of smuggling was so tolerated by the Cornish

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:38.405
people that it wasn’t really considered to be illegal or immoral at all.

00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:45.905
The tax was unjust, it was wrong, and the smugglers were simply providing a service.

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:51.155
The smugglers played an important part in the local economy, and they

00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:55.755
were able to pay large amounts of money to anyone who was involved.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:10:01.655
Indeed, it’s said that a normal farm labourer was able to earn more

00:10:01.655 --> 00:10:07.035
money in one night carrying a smuggled barrel of brandy up a cliff

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:11.785
than he could earn during an entire month labouring in the fields.

00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:17.555
So, it’s no surprise that so many people were happy to be involved.

00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:24.545
There was a slightly darker side to smuggling, though, and this is where the line

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:30.955
between an honest smuggler and a not-so-honest pirate becomes a little blurred.

00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:36.985
Smugglers would normally pay for the goods that they would import illegally.

00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:42.935
They would make their money by selling on these goods for more than they paid for them.

00:10:43.565 --> 00:10:47.155
But what if they didn’t need to pay for them at all?

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:53.215
There are reports of smugglers actually going out and attacking

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:57.595
trade ships, killing the people on board and taking their goods.

00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:05.015
Of course, it goes without saying that these stolen goods were also not declared to the authorities.

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:10.695
And there are other tales of things that the local population would do

00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:15.395
to get their hands on the goods that were being carried on these ships.

00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:21.515
Sometimes a ship would crash into the dangerous rocks in shallow water,

00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:27.605
its crew would drown, they would die, and the ship would be washed ashore.

00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:34.785
When this happened word would get out, people would find out, and would rush

00:11:34.915 --> 00:11:39.015
to the site of the shipwreck to see what they could take for themselves.

00:11:40.115 --> 00:11:47.495
There are also reports of groups of Cornish people attaching a lantern, a light, to a

00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:54.465
horse and walking along a piece of coastline that was dangerous for boats, in order to

00:11:54.515 --> 00:12:01.145
trick the boat into thinking that the light was a lighthouse, so that the boat would

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:07.025
come close, crash on the rocks, and the smugglers could take this precious cargo.

00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:14.075
And taking these goods was actually legal in some circumstances.

00:12:15.275 --> 00:12:21.605
There was a quirk, a slightly strange element, to the English law about

00:12:21.605 --> 00:12:26.095
what you could and couldn’t do if you found a shipwreck on a beach.

00:12:27.035 --> 00:12:34.295
It was illegal, it was not allowed, to take the goods of a shipwreck if there were any survivors,

00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:41.395
because those survivors still legally owned the goods, or at least were in charge of them.

00:12:42.005 --> 00:12:48.325
But if there were no survivors, then it was actually allowed by law

00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:53.555
for anyone who found the shipwreck to take the goods they found.

00:12:54.445 --> 00:13:02.995
So, surprise surprise, when a ship full of French brandy or Chinese tea was washed ashore, it

00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:10.335
was very rare for the people who found the ship to declare that they had found any survivors.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:14.465
Or let me put it another way, you wouldn’t want to be the

00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:18.475
only survivor on a ship that was full of expensive brandy.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:25.355
And there was very little that the government authorities could do to stop smuggling.

00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:31.695
The punishment for smuggling was death, it was a capital offence.

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:37.385
But this was only a deterrent if you were likely to get caught.

00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:44.705
There were customs officers sent down from London, men whose role it was

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:50.405
to ensure that imported goods were correctly taxed, but they were very

00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:55.825
unpopular, they were paid very little, and there weren’t very many of them.

00:13:56.745 --> 00:14:02.915
They were completely outnumbered by the smugglers, and many would turn a blind eye,

00:14:03.165 --> 00:14:09.835
they would pretend not to notice, often in exchange for a bribe, in exchange for money.

00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:15.285
The smugglers, too, were popular with the local population.

00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:19.415
They paid well, they were providing cheaper goods,

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:24.775
and they cultivated a reputation as honest, fair men.

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:30.815
One particular smuggler who has gone down in Cornish history is a

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:36.955
man named John Carter, who had the nickname of The King of Prussia.

00:14:38.435 --> 00:14:41.645
He liked to be called the King of Prussia when he was

00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:46.485
a boy, and as he grew into a man, well, the name stuck.

00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:52.325
Today, there is a “Prussia Cove” in Cornwall, which is the

00:14:52.335 --> 00:14:56.865
small, secret bay where he would unload his smuggled goods.

00:14:57.705 --> 00:15:04.305
He was known as a highly moral man, fighting against an immoral tax.

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:11.585
There’s a famous story of what happened when some of his smuggled goods were found

00:15:11.755 --> 00:15:17.745
by a customs official, and were taken into custody, essentially taken away from him.

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:22.995
In the dead of night he broke into Customs House, the

00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:26.715
building in which all the captured goods had been stored.

00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:32.975
He and his men looked through all of the goods, but they only

00:15:32.975 --> 00:15:37.675
took what had been taken from him, leaving the rest of the goods.

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:45.105
One of the customs officers was reported as saying “John Carter has been here.

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:50.655
We know it because he has taken nothing away that was not his own.”

00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:59.875
John Carter, this King of Prussia, was no thief - he was simply taking back what was rightfully his.

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:06.575
There is even a pub in the town of Fowey in Cornwall called “The King of Prussia”.

00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:13.865
Visitors who don’t know the story of Cornwall’s smuggling past might think “how

00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:19.625
strange - why are they celebrating the King of Prussia here?” but it is, in fact,

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:25.495
the celebration of the unofficial King of Prussia, the smuggler John Carter.

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:30.835
Now, back to our story, smuggling continued pretty

00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:34.475
uninterrupted for the majority of the 18th century.

00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:40.765
Import taxes remained high, which created the incentive to smuggle.

00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:48.525
There were far too few customs officers, far too few government officials in the area to stop

00:16:48.525 --> 00:16:55.098
it, which meant there was  very little disincentive, there was no great reason to not do it.

00:16:56.188 --> 00:17:00.198
And for almost a hundred years, the going was good.

00:17:00.488 --> 00:17:05.898
Many smugglers became very wealthy, and the industry, if indeed

00:17:05.948 --> 00:17:09.708
we can call it an industry, was vital to the Cornish people.

00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:14.168
There’s one quote I particularly liked about this that

00:17:14.438 --> 00:17:18.628
illustrates the extent of the riches that came from smuggling.

00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:22.658
The quote is, and I'm quoting directly:

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:31.808
“When smuggling was in full swing, money became so plentiful that neighbours lent guineas to each

00:17:31.808 --> 00:17:39.588
other by the handful, not stopping to count, or being so particular as to reckon by ones and twos'.”

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:46.138
To explain that, a guinea was quite a valuable coin - it’s like saying

00:17:46.138 --> 00:17:51.838
today that neighbours would lend each other piles of 50 Euro notes

00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:56.098
without bothering to count how many notes there were in the pile.

00:17:57.168 --> 00:18:01.428
But smuggling was costing the British taxpayer dearly.

00:18:01.788 --> 00:18:08.738
It’s estimated that up to 25% of the entire British import trade during the

00:18:08.938 --> 00:18:15.038
18th century consisted of smuggled goods, goods on which tax had not been paid.

00:18:15.748 --> 00:18:19.918
And for certain goods, the percentage was much higher.

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:30.698
Up to 500,000 gallons of brandy, which is 2.3 million litres, were smuggled into Britain every year.

00:18:31.258 --> 00:18:39.428
And some estimates have as much as 80% of tea drunk in Britain being smuggled into the country.

00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:43.868
But the good times weren’t to last forever.

00:18:44.488 --> 00:18:49.398
In the late 18th century import taxes were lowered, and the number

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:54.618
of customs officers employed to stop the smugglers increased.

00:18:55.488 --> 00:19:00.148
It was a double punch, a double whammy, a pincer movement.

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:04.838
Now there was less of an incentive, less of a reason, to

00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:08.778
smuggle, because the taxes weren’t nearly as high as before.

00:19:09.418 --> 00:19:12.138
And you were much more likely to get caught.

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:18.288
The glory days of the Cornish smuggler were over, and by the mid

00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:22.778
19th century the amount of smuggling had drastically reduced.

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:27.628
Smuggling does live on in Cornish legends, though.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:34.745
You can find it in pub names, like the King of Prussia or even the Bucket of Blood,

00:19:35.121 --> 00:19:41.818
a pub named after a landlord who went into his well one morning and pulled out the

00:19:41.818 --> 00:19:47.638
head of a customs officer who had presumably been getting too close to the smugglers.

00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:53.568
And if you go to Cornwall today, and I would certainly recommend a visit,

00:19:53.898 --> 00:19:58.848
you can visit the coastline, you can see the rocks where the ships might

00:19:58.848 --> 00:20:04.088
have got stuck, you can see the sandy beaches where the smugglers would have

00:20:04.118 --> 00:20:08.978
unloaded their cargo, and visit the caves where it would have been stored.

00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:15.318
It might have been illegal, it might have been punishable by death, and it might

00:20:15.638 --> 00:20:21.338
have technically been stealing money from the British taxpayer, but it’s hard to

00:20:21.338 --> 00:20:26.988
deny that there is something quite magical about the legend of the Cornish Smuggler.

00:20:29.058 --> 00:20:34.308
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cornish Smugglers.

00:20:34.618 --> 00:20:38.548
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:20:38.708 --> 00:20:43.598
that you now know a little bit about this curious element of British history.

00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:48.138
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:49.858
Have you been to Cornwall?

00:20:50.178 --> 00:20:52.718
What do you think about Cornish Smugglers?

00:20:53.488 --> 00:20:58.858
Were they real criminals, or simply people doing whatever they could to get by?

00:20:59.308 --> 00:21:03.698
And are there interesting stories of smugglers from your country?

00:21:04.258 --> 00:21:05.718
I would love to know.

00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:09.068

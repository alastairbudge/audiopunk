Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:16.417
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:20.647
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:26.087
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Sigmund

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:31.637
Freud; the pioneer of psychoanalysis, the study of the unconscious mind.

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:38.347
To some, he is the man who created a vitally important way of understanding the human mind.

00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:42.477
To others, he was a sex-obsessed pseudoscienst.

00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:47.657
Whatever you think of Sigmund Freud, he transformed, and in many ways

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:52.067
shaped, how we think about ourselves; and, well, think about thinking!

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:58.317
Freud’s theories on consciousness led him to new treatments for mental illness, some

00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:03.997
questionable and some still very much in use today – and turned him into a household name.

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:08.547
But it was not an easy path to success; Freud faced

00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:12.017
discrimination, controversy, and tragedy along the way.

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:15.157
OK then, Sigmund Freud.

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:20.907
Freud was born on the 6th of May of 1856 in Freiberg,

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.797
in Moravia, which is now part of the Czech Republic.

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:29.777
His family were Jewish and lived in the predominantly Catholic city until

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:35.307
they moved in 1860, to the Jewish neighbourhood of Leopoldstadt in Vienna.

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:43.367
Freud’s family were likely attracted to the new liberating policies of the Austro-Hungarian

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:48.717
empire, which ensured equal rights for Jews and the abolishment of ghettos.

00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:53.487
And although Freud was a non-practising Jew his whole

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:57.547
life, his heritage would lead to much hardship and pain.

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:03.877
Freud’s early life was a time of strict societal expectations.

00:02:04.347 --> 00:02:11.547
People were expected to follow gender roles; personal matters were to be kept private; sexual

00:02:11.557 --> 00:02:17.967
expression was completely taboo, completely forbidden; and mental health issues were not

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:25.897
understood, instead of therapy there were dangerous drugs, asylums or even deadly brain surgeries.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:30.717
However, some things in the world were beginning to change.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:36.539
In 1871, two years before Freud began studying Medicine at the

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:41.039
University of Vienna, Charles Darwin published The Descent of Man.

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.789
The book proposed humans descended from apes and, as

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:50.439
such, were subject to natural instincts and urges.

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:57.389
Freud would go on to admit in his autobiography that Darwin’s theories ‘strongly attracted

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.879
me, for they held out hopes of extraordinary advance in our understanding of the world’.

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.039
The changes in the understanding of the world from Darwin and many

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:13.109
others, had a profound impact upon Freud’s own theories of the mind.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.089
After Freud got his doctorate degree in medicine, in 1882, he began

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.299
working as a clinical assistant at the General Hospital in Vienna.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.519
During this time, he met the woman who would become the love of his life,

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.759
Martha Bernays, the daughter of an important Jewish family from Vienna.

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.159
But Freud was not yet in a position to marry Martha, as he did not have

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.179
enough money or the reputation to marry a woman of such high social status.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.839
So, he really began to concentrate on advancing professionally, and to make a name

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:57.999
for himself, so that Martha’s parents would agree to let him marry their daughter.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.609
This would take some time.

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:06.869
Freud began to research what he believed was a valuable and effective medical

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:13.334
treatment … and it was, cocaine, which I should add was not  illegal at the time.

00:04:14.564 --> 00:04:18.804
Throughout the early 1880s, Freud studied how cocaine could

00:04:18.814 --> 00:04:23.024
be used as a local anaesthetic and a treatment for depression.

00:04:23.844 --> 00:04:27.714
He was also, undeniably, a big fan of the drug himself.

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:33.964
He wrote positively of the effects it had on him, claiming it helped him in social

00:04:33.964 --> 00:04:39.664
situations and made him feel energised, all without the negative effects of alcohol.

00:04:40.504 --> 00:04:45.434
He believed in cocaine so much that in 1884, he published a paper

00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:50.644
which he described as ‘a song of praise to this magical substance’.

00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:57.414
However, Freud would soon come to regret these, somewhat, hasty judgements,

00:04:57.444 --> 00:05:02.084
when the negative and addictive effects of the drug became more widely known.

00:05:03.164 --> 00:05:09.754
Even Freud’s own friend, a man named Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, who Freud had introduced

00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:16.615
to cocaine to combat his own morphine addiction, would go on to die of an overdose in 1891.

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:22.864
Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Freud’s studies on cocaine

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:26.194
did not have the effect on his career that he had hoped for.

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:32.404
In fact, they only weakened his standing, his reputation, in the scientific community.

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:39.964
This was not to be the big discovery Freud had hoped for, nor his path to marrying Martha.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:45.634
In the second half of the 1880s, though, his prospects began to improve.

00:05:46.254 --> 00:05:55.424
In 1885, Freud went to Paris to work with the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, to study hypnosis and

00:05:55.424 --> 00:06:02.984
what was called, ‘hysteria’ – an outdated and generalised term for a variety of mental illnesses.

00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:11.274
The time spent with Charcot was deeply influential, as Freud saw how patients under hypnosis

00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:19.004
would explain desires, fears and memories that were not apparent in their conscious mind.

00:06:19.894 --> 00:06:25.254
It introduced Freud to the idea of an unconscious mind lying within us.

00:06:26.404 --> 00:06:31.424
When Freud returned from Paris the following year, he opened his own practice

00:06:31.604 --> 00:06:36.184
to treat mental illness and began working with a man called Josef Breuer.

00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:43.374
Breuer had also studied how hypnosis and talking could treat mental illness.

00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:50.544
He told Freud about a past patient of his named Anna O, whose symptoms

00:06:50.704 --> 00:06:55.564
had reportedly improved after talking openly about her experiences.

00:06:56.694 --> 00:07:03.174
Anna O was actually the one to coin the term, ‘talking cure’; and such a cure was

00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:10.244
ground-breaking in a world where sharing private thoughts was deemed inappropriate and impolite.

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:18.734
Freud was captivated by this focus on talking, and it certainly influenced his own practice.

00:07:19.354 --> 00:07:23.464
He stopped using hypnosis and focused purely on listening

00:07:23.464 --> 00:07:26.844
to patients who would talk to him while lying on a couch.

00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:33.174
And while Freud was not yet a household name, he had finally made enough money

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:38.204
to marry Martha, and they would go on to have six children over the next decade.

00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:45.994
Eventually, Breuer and Freud would go on to publish their book Studies on Hysteria in 1895.

00:07:46.384 --> 00:07:51.324
But as Freud continued to develop his own ideas around mental

00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:55.994
illness, a rift, a division, emerged with his collaborator.

00:07:57.482 --> 00:08:02.180
Breuer soon ended their work together, as he did not agree with Freud’s

00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:07.767
fixation on sex and its role in the formation of mental disorders.

00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:15.277
In Breuer’s own words: ‘the plunging of sexuality in theory and practice is not to my taste’.

00:08:16.347 --> 00:08:19.617
Indeed, it was not to the taste of most at this time,

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:23.357
which made Freud’s theories all the more controversial.

00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:28.787
As we’ll come to discuss, to this day Freud’s fiercest

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:32.607
critics claim he has a singular obsession with sex.

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:39.141
It would be a year later in 1896 when the 40-year-old Freud would first

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:44.056
coined the term ‘psychoanalysis’ to describe his own talking therapy.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.160
The premise was that patients could recall experiences or emotions

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.650
from their past that had been hidden in their unconscious; and by

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.480
talking openly about these, a patient could confront and overcome them.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.180
Freud would continue to refine this practice over the next few years

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.510
and used himself as a test subject following the death of his father.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.850
Freud believed the emotions he felt following this loss were a result

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.260
of repressed feelings surrounding experiences in his own childhood.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.350
To further his analysis, Freud turned to his dreams,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.370
and this was certainly controversial at the time.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:35.620
Dreams were not considered serious material worthy of scientific analysis – they

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:42.090
were nonsense, fairy tales, and the product of a sleeping, barely functioning, mind.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.490
Characteristically undeterred though, not put off, by contemporary

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.840
opinions, Freud went on to publish his findings in 1899, in what would

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.650
become one of his most famous works: The Interpretation of Dreams.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:06.350
Of course, people trying to interpret their dreams is nothing new, but Freud’s innovation was

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:12.560
to approach this from a clinical perspective, from a scientific and medical point of view.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.430
The book was profound and of lasting influence, and it argued

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.400
that dreams were an important element to the human psyche.

00:10:23.566 --> 00:10:29.370
Not only was Freud’s discussion of dreams so shocking, but his insistence that his theories

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:36.730
were applicable to everyone, not just those suffering from mental illness, was hard to believe.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.030
The Interpretation of Dreams holds many complex concepts but its key

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.530
point is that dreams make evident things that are happening in the

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:53.080
unconscious, specifically, repressed fears and desires from childhood.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.620
It's in this book that Freud also introduced the provocative ‘Oedipus Complex’.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.107
The name stems from the myth of Oedipus in Greek mythology, where the

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.780
eponymous protagonist kills his father, in order to marry his mother.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:16.490
If you’re familiar with Greek mythology, you’ll know this sort of thing is not too unusual.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:23.760
Nonetheless, Freud’s concept is named after the story of Oedipius because it theorised how a

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:29.290
child feels in competition with their parent of the same sex, for possession of their parent of

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:35.490
the opposite sex, how a son feels towards his father, or a daughter feels towards her mother.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:42.390
Despite all the ground-breaking and controversial discussions in the book though, it was

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:48.150
not an immediate success, and it sold less than a hundred copies in its initial release.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:55.110
And, unsurprisingly, it drew much criticism from the scientific and medical communities.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:02.940
But, once again, Freud would continue in spite of his critics, and in 1901 he published

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.110
The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, which discusses what are now called Freudian slips.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:16.920
A Freudian slip is also known as a ‘slip of the tongue’, it’s when we say something by accident.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.225
But for Freud they are not just accidents or mistakes, they are

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.390
the unconscious mind purposefully making its way to the surface.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.510
One example of this is that moment we all dreaded, we

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.720
feared in school, accidentally calling a teacher mum or dad.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.770
A Freudian analysis might see this as a child associating their

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.900
teacher with their parent because they miss them and want to go home.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:52.170
Although many disagreed with Freud’s theories, as the years went on he continued to publish

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.690
many papers and was appointed Professor of Neuropathology, at the University of Vienna.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.020
Increasing numbers of people would come and listen

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.040
to him lecture and he began to gain more followers.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.210
Even with the controversy surrounding his work, things were finally looking

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.770
up for Freud, and he was getting the recognition that he believed he deserved.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.390
By 1908, the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society was established, and Freud’s

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.600
reputation began to spread across Europe and all the way to America.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.910
One friendship in particular helped Freud’s notoriety; it helped him become better known–

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.200
that of Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist 19 years his junior, 19 years younger than him.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.450
Freud had hoped that Jung would help bring psychoanalysis into the mainstream.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.520
Jung was younger, he was a fresh face, and most importantly, he was not Jewish.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:14:01.950
Freud was fully aware of the prejudice he faced as a Jew and the effect this had on his reputation.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.490
Jung was free from such prejudice, and he would ensure that psychoanalysis would not

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.000
become associated with Judaism and that it would be considered a science in its own right.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:21.930
For a time, Jung was a great supporter and friend of Freud, they would engage in

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:28.770
discussions lasting hours on end and Jung would defend his friend in the face of detractors.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:35.784
Jung even became the president of the International Psychoanalytic Association, and accompanied

00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:42.212
Freud on important trips across the globe – trips that secured Freud’s growing fame and reputation.

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:46.832
However, the relationship between the pair would not last.

00:14:48.052 --> 00:14:53.972
Some people speculate, in a Freudian way, that Jung had a problem with Freud,

00:14:54.272 --> 00:15:00.142
viewing him as a kind of father figure, while Freud had sexual feelings towards Jung.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:06.120
Whatever the reasons, by 1913, the pair broke off all

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.590
contact and they would never see each other again.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:15.670
1913 not only saw the end of this friendship but the end of the world as

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.830
it was known, for a year later would see the start of the First World War.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.360
Freud was too old to serve in the war - he was 58 - but, as

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.200
you might expect, the war had a major impact on his work.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.620
Patients stopped attending, international activities halted, and the

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.430
trauma of the war came very close to Freud’s home as his three sons

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.730
were drafted into military service – luckily, though, they all survived.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:52.330
While Freud was not seeing as many patients, he concentrated on his research and wrote prolifically.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.850
By 1920, Freud produced another of his most famous papers, called Beyond the Pleasure Principle.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.320
Here, Freud introduces the concept of the three elements that

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.680
comprise, that make up the human psyche: the Id, the Ego and Super-ego.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.730
He would go on to develop the discussion on this theory in 1923.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:25.680
In a simplified way, the Id harbours our unconscious desires and pushes us to gain pleasure

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:32.840
in life; the Ego is governed by reality and pragmatism, and functions as a regulator

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:38.820
for the Id and Super-ego, the latter being concerned with morals, ideals and guilt.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.530
So, we can think of the Id like a little devil on our

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.790
shoulder, and the Super-ego an angel on the other.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.490
Beyond the Pleasure Principle also introduces the concept of the ‘Death

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.430
Drive’, the notion or idea that all humans are driven towards death.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.010
Freud had, after all, declared that ‘the aim of all life is death’.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.130
Freud had just lived through the horrors of the First World War, so this

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:13.340
morbid cynicism does make some sense when you realise what he had seen.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:21.710
Now, 1923 was a significant year for Freud not only because of this theory, but also because, at the

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:29.160
age of 67, he was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw, likely due to his lifelong addiction to cigars.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.700
During the following ten years, Freud endured many painful surgeries and even

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.290
had part of his jaw removed, although he never managed to quit the cigars.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.290
But this was not the only tragedy that would afflict Freud towards the end of his life, for

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:52.220
the catastrophic tensions that would eventually lead to the Second World War soon intensified.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:18:00.570
In 1933, the Nazis took over Germany and given that Freud was Jewish, they burnt his books.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:07.560
This led to his famous quip, his well-known saying, that: ‘What progress we are making.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.180
In the Middle Ages they would have burnt me; nowadays they are content with burning my books.’

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.990
Despite the evident danger, Freud was determined to remain

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.890
in Vienna and he largely underestimated the Nazi threat.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.310
That was until 1938, when the Nazis raided his

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.510
apartment and the Gestapo arrested his daughter, Anna.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.280
This was a true wake up call for Freud and following this

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.480
horrifying event, he and his wife and daughter fled to London.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:45.420
Tragically, four of Freud’s sisters could not get the right documents to leave with them, and

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.980
they had to remain in Vienna, eventually being sent to concentration camps where they were killed.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:57.490
Shortly after arriving in London in 1939, war was officially declared.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.270
Freud was beginning to lose his own battle, however.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.080
He had grown weak and frail and was suffering greatly due to his cancer.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.220
He sought help from his friend and doctor Max Schur, a fellow refugee.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.870
Freud reminded his friend of a promise that he would not ‘leave

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.270
[him] in the lurch’, leave him without support or assistance.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.170
He insisted it was now time for his friend’s support and he urged Schur

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.396
to discuss with Anna, his daughter, ending his pain and suffering.

00:19:31.406 --> 00:19:36.771
While the exact details of the event are not known, many biographers report that

00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:42.630
Schur administered doses of morphine between the 21st and 22nd of September.

00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:50.234
As a result, Freud fell into a coma and he was pronounced dead on the 23rd of September of 1939.

00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:56.316
After his death, Freud continued to have a profound influence on

00:19:56.606 --> 00:20:01.466
psychology and culture, due to his focus on the unconscious and his

00:20:01.486 --> 00:20:06.206
indication that much of what happens in our mind is hidden or buried.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:11.936
Anna, his daughter, also furthered her father’s work on psychoanalysis,

00:20:11.976 --> 00:20:15.916
and she became a notable child psychologist in her own right.

00:20:17.159 --> 00:20:23.666
Freud’s concepts provided a basis for future philosophers and artists, with ideas around

00:20:23.676 --> 00:20:29.006
the unconscious shaping the way we analyse works of literature and art still to this day.

00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:36.016
However, many details within Freud’s theories have largely been rejected over the years.

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:40.556
In the 1970s, there was a full-scale academic debate over

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:45.146
Freud’s legitimacy, appropriately named the ‘Freud-wars’.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:50.716
Some figures proposed that Freud simply took concepts known for

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:55.346
thousands of years and repurposed, recycled, them in the name of

00:20:55.346 --> 00:21:00.386
science, completely minimising any real scientific discovery from Freud.

00:21:01.966 --> 00:21:05.996
Many argued that his ideas were sexist and that he did

00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:09.276
not treat issues of sexual abuse with enough severity.

00:21:09.986 --> 00:21:14.276
His concepts that placed abuse in the context of hidden

00:21:14.276 --> 00:21:18.196
desires were completely unacceptable and highly damaging.

00:21:19.189 --> 00:21:23.129
Even his daughter, Anna, faced her own fair share of scandal.

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:28.469
An American author called Jeffrey Masson, who was acting as Director of the

00:21:28.469 --> 00:21:33.579
Sigmund Freud Archives, discovered that Anna, Freud’s daughter, had been hiding

00:21:33.579 --> 00:21:38.129
many of Freud’s letters that dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children.

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:42.539
When Masson questioned Anna about this she fired him.

00:21:43.934 --> 00:21:49.809
Masson explained to The Atlantic magazine in 1984 that after speaking

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:53.229
with others who were close to the Freud family: "I was given to

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:57.029
understand that I had stumbled upon something that was better left alone".

00:21:58.499 --> 00:22:03.439
Ultimately, Masson came to argue that Freud had ignored and hidden many

00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:07.739
details in his own studies to strengthen his theory of psychoanalysis.

00:22:08.949 --> 00:22:13.369
Now, for better or worse, Freud has left a lasting legacy.

00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:18.339
In death as in life, he is as controversial as ever, analysed

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:21.719
and pored over as much as his own subjects ever were.

00:22:22.749 --> 00:22:26.379
For some, he is a complete fraud who did more harm than

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:30.039
good and only dealt in pseudoscience, fake science.

00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:36.079
For others, he provided a way to think about understanding our subconscious, a way

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:41.629
to try to understand who we really are, a way to explain our thoughts and feelings.

00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:47.749
Whatever side of the argument you come down on, it’s undeniable that he has left a

00:22:47.829 --> 00:22:53.809
huge mark on how we think about thought, how we think at how all of our minds work.

00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:58.909
He might not have been right about everything, and he certainly made mistakes,

00:22:58.989 --> 00:23:05.529
but as he famously said, “from error to error, one discovers the entire truth.”

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:13.099
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on Sigmund Freud.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:18.489
I imagine that you knew something about Freud already, but whether you are a Freudian expert

00:23:18.619 --> 00:23:22.692
or whether you only knew a little bit about the man, I hope this was an interesting one.

00:23:23.912 --> 00:23:27.442
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:27.932 --> 00:23:31.192
Here’s an open question - what do you think about Sigmund Freud?

00:23:31.752 --> 00:23:35.642
Was he a deeply insightful man who helps us understand

00:23:35.642 --> 00:23:39.572
our subconscious or a conman peddling in pseudoscience?

00:23:39.892 --> 00:23:42.032
What do you think we can learn from our dreams?

00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:45.332
Do they hold clues to our deepest darkest feelings,

00:23:45.472 --> 00:23:48.272
or are they simply passing thoughts in the night?

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:52.152
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

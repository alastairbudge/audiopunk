Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:16.754
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:20.954
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:26.774
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Alaska.

00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:34.554
As you probably know, Alaska is a state of the United States, but it is a state unlike any other.

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:40.724
Not only is it the coldest and least densely populated state, it is also the

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:46.214
largest and is thousands of kilometres away from the mainland United States.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:52.594
Indeed, if you were to drive from Alaska’s biggest city, Anchorage, to the capital

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:59.914
of the nearest US state, Seattle in Washington, it would be a 3,600 km trip and

00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:07.054
take you about 42 hours, it’s a similar distance as Barcelona is away from Moscow.

00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:12.994
Which begs the question, and the subject of today’s episode, how and

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:17.444
why did Alaska become part of the United States, and what does this

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:21.954
mean for this piece of North America nicknamed “The Last Frontier”?

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:28.424
Okay then, let’s get started and look at the unusual history of Alaska.

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:34.594
Today, Alaska and Russia are separated by the Bering Strait,

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.745
the 90km of water that separates North America and Asia.

00:01:39.293 --> 00:01:43.083
But in prehistoric times, there was no such separation.

00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:50.103
During the last ice age, sea levels were lower than they are today, and the first human

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:56.253
settlers of the region were able to cross the area that separates Russia and Alaska, on foot.

00:01:57.413 --> 00:02:01.673
These prehistoric settlers, who migrated from Asia to Alaska,

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:06.483
are the ancestors of the Inuits and other native Alaskan tribes.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:11.153
Over time, sea levels rose and about 10,000 years

00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:15.373
ago North America and Asia became separated by water.

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:22.833
As you might imagine, Alaska’s now native tribes were originally nomadic - they

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:28.533
moved from one camp to another depending on food availability and the seasons.

00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:32.993
With time, different tribes developed in different regions

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:36.083
each with their own distinct culture and way of life.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:43.163
Spear hunting and salmon fishing were important for tribes living in Alaska’s interior,

00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:48.643
who would build up food stocks before moving south to survive the harsh winters.

00:02:49.453 --> 00:02:55.043
Societies on the coast, on the other hand, became specialised in hunting whales,

00:02:55.233 --> 00:03:00.463
developing a special type of small boat, very similar to modern day kayaks,

00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:06.063
that could stay afloat even in dangerous seas in pursuit of large sea mammals.

00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:10.613
Alaska’s native tribes had their own traditions and

00:03:10.743 --> 00:03:14.203
mostly lived in harmony, with respect for nature.

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:20.873
However, their way of life would begin to change with the European “discovery” of Alaska.

00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:28.623
In 1741, Vitus Bering, a Danish cartographer, a mapmaker, who worked for

00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:33.143
the Russian navy first caught sight of Alaska, claiming it for Russia.

00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:37.853
As you might have guessed, The Bering Strait is named after him.

00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:44.243
In 1784, Russia started to set up bases in Alaska,

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:48.663
mainly to hunt sea otters for their thick fur coats.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:53.396
And for the first 100 years or so after its discovery

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:57.076
by Vitus Bering, it remained a Russian outpost.

00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:02.176
Although the centre of Russian power was thousands of kilometres away to the

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:07.866
west, Siberian fur hunters from the Russian Far East knew about living and

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:13.006
working in extremely cold conditions, and could easily adapt to life in Alaska.

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:17.276
After all, Alaska wasn’t all that different from Siberia.

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:23.116
England and Spain also explored the area and set up fur hunting

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:27.336
outposts, but Russia remained the dominant presence in the area.

00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:32.214
At this time, in the 18th century that is, the future

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:35.734
geopolitical importance of Alaska wasn’t obvious.

00:04:36.354 --> 00:04:41.454
As a large, icy area that was difficult to access, never mind live in,

00:04:41.674 --> 00:04:46.074
Alaska was simply not considered to have much strategic importance.

00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:52.944
Though, if you’ve ever played the game Risk, you’ll know just how important having Alaska can be.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:57.844
Alaska’s position allows access to both Asia and North America.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:03.634
What’s more, if you control this area, you also have easy access to the Arctic.

00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:09.364
And although the Russian mainland is 90km away from the North American

00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:13.474
mainland, in the Bering Strait there are actually two islands.

00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:20.424
The western one is part of Russia, the eastern one is part of Alaska, and is therefore American.

00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:27.944
They are just 4km apart, and in winter the water between them freezes, making

00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:32.324
it actually possible to walk over from Russia to The United States of America.

00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:38.462
As you might expect, now Alaska is of vital strategic importance

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:42.054
to the United States in its geopolitical struggle with Russia.

00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:47.174
But in the 18th century Russia’s great enemy wasn’t the US.

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:48.294
It was Britain.

00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:54.614
By the 18th and 19th centuries, Russia and Britain were already rivals in many

00:05:54.614 --> 00:05:59.434
domains and both countries were trying to increase their presence in the Pacific.

00:06:00.404 --> 00:06:03.864
Britain had established numerous colonies in modern-day

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:08.044
Canada, which wouldn’t become its own country until 1867.

00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:15.234
In 1854, Britain and Russia were on opposite sides in the Crimean War back in Europe.

00:06:15.814 --> 00:06:20.374
The war weakened the Russian army and drained Russia’s finances.

00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:27.534
Meanwhile, fur trading had become less lucrative, there was less money to be made, plus

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:33.324
the sea otters, those cuddly little creatures, had been hunted almost to extinction.

00:06:34.634 --> 00:06:39.934
Russia did not have the financial means to continue to set up military bases

00:06:39.944 --> 00:06:44.664
in Alaska but above all, it didn’t want the British to get their hands on it.

00:06:45.824 --> 00:06:51.374
If it could only sell Alaska to another country that wasn’t Britain, it would serve two

00:06:51.414 --> 00:06:58.404
purposes: a welcome injection of money and it would keep it out of the hands of the British.

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:05.154
As strange as it may now sound, before eventually selling Alaska to the USA,

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:10.144
the Russian Empire is said to have offered the territory of Alaska to one of the

00:07:10.144 --> 00:07:15.467
world’s smallest countries, the landlocked European microstate of Liechtenstein.

00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:22.837
This tiny country between Switzerland and Austria was on good terms with the Russian Empire

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:28.787
at the time and was well known for its large gold reserves - just what the Russians needed.

00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:34.373
Liechtenstein decided not to go ahead with the offer, worried about taking on such a

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:41.393
large chunk of land, a territory that was over 10,000 times its size, and was so far away.

00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:48.463
Plus at the time, the only resource Alaska was known for was its dwindling fur trade.

00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:52.833
So, Russia then offered the less than hundred years

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:56.153
old United States of America the chance to buy Alaska.

00:07:57.563 --> 00:08:01.730
The sale was completed on the 1st August 1867.

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:09.353
The US paid $7.2 million, which works out at around $120 million in

00:08:09.353 --> 00:08:15.653
today’s money, approximately €110 million or €64 per square kilometre.

00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:21.253
And what I need to reiterate is quite how big Alaska is.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.963
It’s 1.7 million square kilometres.

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:32.183
To put it another way, if Alaska was a country, it would be the 17th largest in the world.

00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:37.663
You could fit all of France, all of Spain, all of Germany AND all of

00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:41.713
Italy inside Alaska and still have a little bit of room left over.

00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:47.701
Today, it might seem pretty incredible that such a huge amount of land could just

00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:53.245
be signed over and sold for such little money, especially those of us who are keen

00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:58.665
Risk players and have experienced firsthand the strategic importance of Alaska.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:03.335
However, this was the era of vast land purchase.

00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:08.135
Louisiana was purchased from France in 1804, Florida

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:13.055
from Spain in 1819 and California from Mexico in 1848.

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:17.795
But, even to a young country that had plenty of experience

00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:21.835
making territorial acquisitions, Alaska was something else.

00:09:22.415 --> 00:09:27.715
Its sheer size alone, means that Alaska makes up 15% of the entire country.

00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:34.225
For comparison, Texas, the second largest state in terms of area, is

00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:39.115
under half the size of Alaska, at just under 700,000 kilometres squared.

00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:45.499
The American public were, perhaps understandably, not too keen on Alaska’s purchase.

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:52.229
Alaska was seen as being an icy, barren land, devoid of, without, resources.

00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:55.499
The fact that it doesn’t share a border with any

00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:58.779
American state made the purchase even more unpopular.

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:06.579
It was criticised as being a waste of money, And it was nicknamed “Seward's Folly” - Seward

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:11.159
was the Secretary of State at the time, and the chief supporter of the purchase.

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:14.709
A “folly”, by the way, is something that shows a

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:18.549
lack of common sense, it’s a foolish idea or action.

00:10:19.182 --> 00:10:23.232
Foolish as it may have seemed, Seward’s purchase of Alaska was

00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:28.342
vindicated, was proved to be right, in part at least, when gold was

00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:33.802
discovered in the Klondike River just over the Canadian border in 1896.

00:10:34.922 --> 00:10:41.372
Thousands of Americans travelled via sea, and then overland across Alaska, with towns

00:10:41.372 --> 00:10:47.212
on the trail growing significantly as businesses sprung up to provide essentials,

00:10:47.262 --> 00:10:52.022
as well as gambling halls to relieve any successful gold miners of their money.

00:10:53.222 --> 00:10:59.042
In 1899 gold was found in Alaska at a coastal town called Nome.

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:03.402
Copper mining, fishing and canning industries began to take

00:11:03.402 --> 00:11:07.540
off and construction started on Alaska’s railway in 1902.

00:11:08.662 --> 00:11:11.692
Things were starting to look a little rosier, a little more

00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:15.202
positive, with population growth and improved finances.

00:11:15.682 --> 00:11:21.982
In 1912, Alaska became a territory of the USA, a bit like Puerto Rico today.

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:26.580
However, the Great Depression put a hold on Alaska’s

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.530
progression towards becoming a fully fledged state.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.880
The price of fish and copper plummeted, causing workers to be laid

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.860
off and wages reduced for those lucky enough to still have a job.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.670
It would take World War II to really drive home the strategic importance of Alaska to

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:51.472
the rest of the USA, when two islands in Alaska were occupied by the Japanese forces.

00:11:52.782 --> 00:11:56.992
These two Alaskan islands, Attu and Kiska, were the only

00:11:56.992 --> 00:12:01.218
parts of continental USA to be occupied during the entire war.

00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:07.288
It took two weeks of fierce fighting and almost 4,000 American

00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:13.862
casualties, including 1,200 caused by severe cold, to liberate only Attu.

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:20.448
The second island, Kiska, was bombed extensively rather than risking even more lives.

00:12:21.948 --> 00:12:26.908
After World War II, with Alaska’s geopolitical importance now clear

00:12:26.948 --> 00:12:31.398
to see, large numbers of military personnel were sent to the state.

00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:37.318
Building the first military bases helped to boost the population, while

00:12:37.318 --> 00:12:41.588
the completion of the Alaskan Highway finally linked Alaska to the

00:12:41.588 --> 00:12:45.898
lower 48 states by road for the first time, passing through Canada.

00:12:47.398 --> 00:12:52.778
However, while it was evident that Alaska was strategically important, it would take

00:12:52.778 --> 00:12:58.508
a huge financial turnaround to prove its economic stability enough for Alaska to be

00:12:58.518 --> 00:13:03.668
seriously considered for statehood, for becoming a fully-fledged state of the USA.

00:13:04.858 --> 00:13:09.789
The Swanson River Oil Discovery in 1957 did just that.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:16.089
While oil had been found before in Alaska, this was the first time that oil

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:20.929
was discovered in large enough amounts to be economically viable to exploit.

00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:28.589
And sure enough, Alaska officially became an American state on 3 January 1959.

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:33.639
With the completion of the Alaska Highway and increased troop

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:38.089
numbers stationed in the state, Alaska became more open to visitors.

00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:43.929
Soldiers returning home helped to spread the word about the state’s stunning wilderness.

00:13:44.687 --> 00:13:50.267
Tourism quickly became a major source of revenue for the state, with more than 2 million

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:56.307
tourists visiting the state every year for its pristine landscape and unspoiled nature.

00:13:57.527 --> 00:14:01.837
Alaska’s other main source of income was and still is oil.

00:14:02.497 --> 00:14:08.597
The problem is that the oil extraction and tourism industries don’t always go hand in hand.

00:14:09.347 --> 00:14:16.247
If you are coming to see wonderful unspoiled beaches, glaciers, rivers and mountains, you will

00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:22.047
be disappointed if you find large factories, pipelines, or beaches covered in nasty black oil.

00:14:23.257 --> 00:14:29.497
But this was exactly what tourists found in 1989, after the Exxon Valdez

00:14:29.547 --> 00:14:35.417
oil tanker ran aground on the Alaskan coastline, polluting 1,800km of

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:40.977
shoreline with 50 million litres of oil and killing thousands of animals.

00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:48.397
And there is still this tension today between the oil industry, which claims to create jobs

00:14:48.507 --> 00:14:54.737
for 10% of the Alaskan population and be responsible for billions of dollars of income to the

00:14:54.737 --> 00:15:00.294
state each year, and the tourist industry, which wants to keep the oil industry out of view.

00:15:01.684 --> 00:15:07.014
The other tension, which of course shows no signs of going away, comes from

00:15:07.014 --> 00:15:10.944
the fact that Alaska is the closest part of the United States to Russia.

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:18.574
As you might expect, the United States continues to see Alaska as an important strategic outpost.

00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:24.104
Today there are over 22,000 American soldiers stationed in Alaska.

00:15:24.944 --> 00:15:30.504
On the other side of the Bering Strait, Russia is also developing numerous military bases.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:36.294
And while Alaska’s geopolitical importance may have been severely

00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:41.984
underestimated before WWII, with increasing tensions between Russia and the

00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:47.054
United States, and with the Arctic Ocean becoming increasingly accessible as

00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:51.474
a sea route, the geopolitical importance of Alaska has never been clearer.

00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:56.474
So, now that we’ve learned a bit about the history of Alaska

00:15:56.744 --> 00:16:00.744
we have time for a few curiosities about this unusual place.

00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:04.854
Have you ever wondered why Alaska is called Alaska?

00:16:05.384 --> 00:16:06.154
What does it mean?

00:16:06.814 --> 00:16:12.294
Well, the word Alaska means the “Great Land” in one of the state’s native tribal

00:16:12.294 --> 00:16:17.226
languages, a language I imagine you might not have heard of called “Aleut”.

00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:23.114
Another equally fitting name often given to Alaska is the “Land of the Midnight Sun”.

00:16:23.824 --> 00:16:29.754
For over two months in summertime, like in northern Europe and northern Russia, the sun

00:16:29.784 --> 00:16:35.474
does not set in the northernmost part of Alaska, meaning it is light for 24 hours a day.

00:16:36.434 --> 00:16:40.524
Alaska is also famous for its remarkable geographical features.

00:16:40.944 --> 00:16:45.084
You might have heard of the Rocky Mountains, but did you know that Alaska,

00:16:45.314 --> 00:16:50.724
not Colorado, is home to 17 of the 20 highest mountains in America?

00:16:51.934 --> 00:16:55.414
Mount Denali, also known as Mount McKinley, is the

00:16:55.424 --> 00:16:58.204
highest point of elevation in the whole of North America.

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:04.444
Alaska also holds the record for the lowest point in America, the deep-sea

00:17:04.624 --> 00:17:09.314
Aleutian Trench, as well as the continent’s largest glacier, the Bering Glacier,

00:17:09.854 --> 00:17:16.914
which measures 3,261 km2 - almost one and a half times the size of Luxembourg.

00:17:18.084 --> 00:17:23.894
And our final interesting detail that sets Alaska apart is its state flag.

00:17:24.654 --> 00:17:29.884
The flag is deep blue, with eight gold stars in the shape of Ursa Major,

00:17:29.974 --> 00:17:34.374
or the Great Bear constellation, representing strength and the North Star.

00:17:35.074 --> 00:17:39.524
It’s a nice looking flag, but one interesting bit of trivia was

00:17:39.654 --> 00:17:43.904
that it was designed by a 13-year old boy living in an orphanage.

00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:49.897
Alaska certainly is an unusual place, and its story is unlikely.

00:17:50.387 --> 00:17:56.259
A huge mass of freezing land on the edge of North America, one trying to

00:17:56.259 --> 00:18:00.232
figure out the balance between preserving nature for future generations and

00:18:00.232 --> 00:18:05.965
extracting oil from nature to provide an income for people living today.

00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:10.452
It’s also a place with an unlikely geopolitical significance, a place

00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:14.142
where the United States and the Russian Federation meet, and where,

00:18:14.532 --> 00:18:17.822
when it’s cold enough, you can literally walk between the two countries.

00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:23.742
There are perhaps no better places deserving of the name “the Last Frontier”

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:31.358
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the weird history of Alaska.

00:18:31.938 --> 00:18:36.428
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned a bit about how Alaska got to

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:41.638
be the place it is today, as well some extra details about what makes Alaska special.

00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:46.108
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:46.488 --> 00:18:50.438
How would the world have been different had Russia not sold Alaska?

00:18:50.998 --> 00:18:53.918
How would it have been different had it sold it to Britain?

00:18:54.388 --> 00:18:57.768
How do you think we should think about the balance between

00:18:57.768 --> 00:19:01.138
preserving natural habitats and fossil fuel extraction?

00:19:01.718 --> 00:19:06.618
Have you ever visited Alaska or it is on your list of top potential destinations?

00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:10.518
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

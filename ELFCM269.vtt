Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:17.089
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.239
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.999
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part one of a three-part series on great Victorian authors.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.389
In this episode, part one, we’ll talk about Jane Austen, the

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:39.039
author of works such as Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Emma.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.469
Next up, in part two, we’ll look at Charles Dickens,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.369
the author of books such as Oliver Twist and Hard Times.

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:54.809
And in part three, our final part, we’ll actually look at three authors, the Bronte sisters,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.489
Emily, Charlotte, and Anne, who between them wrote greats such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.619
They all, in their own right, were fascinating people with fascinating lives, and

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:13.959
their works are still as relevant and brilliant today as the day they were published.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.899
So I hope you’ll enjoy them.

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:21.899
OK then, let’s get straight into it and learn about the woman

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:25.849
sometimes called the queen of English literature, Jane Austen.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.439
My great grandmother, who lived to the age of 99 and died when I

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.959
was three years old, would read one particular book every year.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.199
In the final years of her life, when she was in her mid 90s and, with her eyesight

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:51.169
failing, she could no longer read, she would insist on having this same battered

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:55.609
little blue book on the table in front of the chair where she sat all day.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.079
Often she would simply put her hand on the book - it clearly

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.209
meant as much to her as anything - perhaps apart from her family.

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:10.632
Maybe you are thinking that this book was The Bible, or another religious text.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:11.942
It was not.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:18.232
This sacred, much-loved book, which became increasingly shiny from my

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:23.509
great-grandmother’s hand, was in fact written by a very young woman right at the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:28.302
start of the same century in which my great grandmother was born, the 19th century.

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:29.562
Her name?

00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:31.062
Jane Austen.

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:34.922
The title of the blue book was Pride and Prejudice.

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:39.692
So, let me tell you a little bit about the life of this amazing

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:43.322
woman, starting with her family and her early education.

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:52.892
Jane Austen was born in 1775 into a social class which is best described as gentry.

00:02:53.682 --> 00:03:00.172
This means the class below the aristocracy but above the professional middle class.

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:06.052
In today's terms, gentry would translate to something like upper middle class.

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:12.542
Her father was a clergyman in the Anglican Church or the Church of England, which meant

00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:18.472
that the family were provided with a spacious house, called a rectory, and some land.

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:25.862
However, relative to the social class that the Austens belonged to, they were not wealthy.

00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:31.422
To ensure that they could live well, that they had enough money to provide them with a

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:37.757
good life, Mr Austen ran a small boarding school in the rectory and did some farming.

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:45.157
The Austen family was, as was typical of many wealthy families of this class, a large one.

00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:51.592
Jane Austen  had six brothers and one, particularly beloved sister, Cassandra.

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:56.682
It was an immensely privileged family in terms of the education

00:03:56.692 --> 00:04:01.162
and stimulation provided by both parents and all the siblings.

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:08.382
Jane's father was, unusually for the time, very keen on novels, on fiction books.

00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:17.042
This may sound a strange thing to point out, but, as the name suggests, this form of writing – i.e.

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:23.602
prose fiction - was relatively new and regarded with much suspicion, at least in English.

00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:28.282
Novels were seen as suitable material only for women.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:33.852
Compared to poetry, prose was easy to read and write, and therefore

00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:38.602
even uneducated and uncultured women would be able to enjoy it.

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:44.132
It sounds terrible to say now, but this was the predominant view at the time.

00:04:45.172 --> 00:04:49.052
The Austen household was clearly a stimulating place

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:53.552
where poetry, storytelling, writing and acting was common.

00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:59.242
And Jane's main influence and education undoubtedly came through

00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:03.852
this stimulating, cultured, highly literary family background.

00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:09.582
But what about the wider context and the era in which she grew up?

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:15.102
Of the three subjects of this mini-series, she was the oldest.

00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:21.832
Jane Austen was born in 1775, Charles Dickens was born in 1812, and

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:27.339
the oldest of the famous Brontë sisters, Charlotte, was born in 1816.

00:05:28.402 --> 00:05:34.352
And in terms of what was going on in England and in Europe during Jane Austen’s lifetime,

00:05:34.652 --> 00:05:40.802
she was 14 when the French Revolution started and 17 when the Napoleonic Wars began.

00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:48.002
In fact, these wars, which pitted Britain and its allies against Napoleon

00:05:48.012 --> 00:05:53.956
Bonaparte’s armies, would last for almost the entirety of Jane Austen's adult life.

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:59.506
The war brought with it the very real fear of French invasion and

00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:04.336
occupation, and with it the collapse of the small-but-growing British empire.

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:11.626
However, one of the curiosities of her novels is that massive world events, such as the

00:06:11.836 --> 00:06:17.156
American War of Independence, the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars

00:06:17.306 --> 00:06:24.126
have such a minor or insignificant influence on the self-contained world of her novels.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:30.356
In this respect she is the complete opposite of a writer like Tolstoy who

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:35.966
seized on the huge and sensational scale of an event like Napoleon's march

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:41.746
on Russia in order to provide the backdrop to his epic novel, War and Peace.

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:46.496
This is, actually, kind of the point - the characters in Jane

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:52.116
Austen’s works lived such isolated lives, focussed on marriage and

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:56.886
family, that the events of the wider world were partially irrelevant.

00:06:57.716 --> 00:07:02.236
Now, let's move on and discuss her works, which really means

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:05.926
her six novels that she published over the course of six years.

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:10.636
Three of these - Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility and

00:07:10.736 --> 00:07:14.666
Pride and Prejudice - were written when she was still in her 20s.

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:22.356
Let’s remind ourselves that at this time, not only was the novel a very new and barely

00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:27.856
recognised form of literature in the English-speaking world, but also that writers were

00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:34.266
expected to be male and that being a female novelist was breaking relatively new ground.

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:42.006
For a woman, the family was meant to be the main occupation, and someone who was known to spend

00:07:42.136 --> 00:07:48.886
lots of time writing was often considered to be neglecting her duties to her husband and children.

00:07:50.296 --> 00:07:54.266
In Jane Austen’s case, she didn’t have a husband or children, but

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:58.606
there was a certain stigma that was attached to the writing of novels.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:05.156
It is perhaps not surprising therefore that Jane chose to publish initially anonymously.

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:09.066
Her first novel was titled simply “by a Lady”.

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:17.236
Her most famous novel, Pride and Prejudice, was initially rejected in 1797 and

00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:23.656
was only eventually published in 1813, when it was an immediate hit, earning her

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:29.796
the sum of £140, which was enough to cover her living expenses for three years.

00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:35.966
Her growing reputation amongst the reading public and also the help of one of her

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:43.146
most prosperous brothers, Henry, who started and part-owned a private bank, meant that

00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:48.206
the real identity of the author became known amongst well-connected social circles.

00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:56.656
One of her most mature and thought-provoking novels, Emma, was published in 1814 by one of the

00:08:56.656 --> 00:09:04.036
country’s top publishers and was dedicated to the Prince Regent–the King's son–who incidentally

00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:11.576
was are a pleasure-loving, disreputable and deeply unattractive man whom Jane despised, she hated.

00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:17.952
But the Prince's librarian had invited Jane Austen to meet, had hinted that the

00:09:17.952 --> 00:09:23.552
Prince would like her next novel to be dedicated to him, and she could hardly refuse.

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:30.112
Now, if you are encountering Jane Austen and her works for the first time and know

00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:35.752
nothing about the world of her novels, let me try and give you a brief introduction.

00:09:37.172 --> 00:09:42.792
In general, her novels are about the challenges of making the right choices

00:09:42.902 --> 00:09:48.762
in life, especially the choices that a young person of her social status might

00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:54.052
make when it comes to choosing a life partner and proceeding towards marriage.

00:09:54.882 --> 00:10:00.532
Perhaps this might sound petty, small, or not such interesting material for

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:05.612
a novel, but it’s hard to adequately stress the importance of these questions

00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:10.732
for a young lady growing up in this position of English society at this time.

00:10:11.732 --> 00:10:18.182
The expectation was that a young woman of this gentry class should find a suitable man who

00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:24.692
could provide her with the necessary economic status for her to maintain her position in life.

00:10:25.052 --> 00:10:28.392
That was the main goal, so it’s quite unsurprising

00:10:28.402 --> 00:10:32.092
that this is a recurrent theme in Jane Austen's work.

00:10:33.652 --> 00:10:38.402
What is surprising, perhaps, is that Jane Austen herself never married.

00:10:39.332 --> 00:10:43.762
She had, it appears, every opportunity to marry and

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:48.242
indeed accepted a proposal of marriage from a man in 1802.

00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:54.382
However, overnight she changed her mind, as she realised she didn't love him.

00:10:55.552 --> 00:11:01.282
Now, back to her work, her true genius was to create believable human beings who

00:11:01.502 --> 00:11:08.402
live in a beautifully structured fictional world into which we as readers are drawn.

00:11:09.432 --> 00:11:13.562
You follow the characters in her novels and they grapple with

00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:17.952
fundamental questions like what makes for a good education, both

00:11:18.132 --> 00:11:23.082
intellectually and emotionally, and what does it take to be a good parent?

00:11:24.112 --> 00:11:31.372
To state the obvious, these are questions that are so universal, so fundamentally human, that the

00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:37.122
books are as enjoyable and interesting now as they would have been when they were first published.

00:11:38.136 --> 00:11:40.762
Stylistically, she was revolutionary.

00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:47.562
Now, “revolutionary” isn’t a word often used to describe Jane Austen, and indeed

00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:53.542
the stories in her novels aren’t about wars, revolutions, or epic battles.

00:11:54.322 --> 00:11:58.572
But she did create a completely new style of writing.

00:11:59.512 --> 00:12:04.363
Up to this point not many novels had been written, as poetry

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:08.863
or theatre were the dominant genres, certainly in English.

00:12:09.923 --> 00:12:16.833
These novels would often rely very heavily on the use of exchange of letters – in other

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:22.263
words the novel was more or less a collection of letters from different characters.

00:12:23.143 --> 00:12:27.050
For literary geeks, for people who are keen on literature,

00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:30.373
the term for this in English is the epistolary style.

00:12:31.683 --> 00:12:36.493
The other form that these early novels took was by way of either someone

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:41.647
telling a story in the form of a journal or diary or through having a

00:12:41.647 --> 00:12:47.243
narrator telling a story such as might happen, for example, in a fairytale.

00:12:48.493 --> 00:12:52.813
In this case, the narrator “knows everything” – the

00:12:52.903 --> 00:12:56.523
technical term for this, again, is an omniscient narrator.

00:12:57.923 --> 00:13:04.363
What Jane Austen did - and what was so revolutionary - was that she combined the use of

00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:10.373
a main character or protagonist, through whose eyes the story was told, with a flow of

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:17.563
thoughts which reflected or dramatised the ideas going through that central character’s mind.

00:13:18.651 --> 00:13:24.146
It's a style written both in the first person and third person, and allows

00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:30.386
the reader to see, for example, when the narrator is wrong or makes mistakes.

00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:35.476
This style of writing, known as free, indirect style,

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:39.506
has become the standard style for so many modern novels.

00:13:40.136 --> 00:13:44.036
It enables the writer to convey subtleties of human thinking

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:48.366
to a degree not really possible before Austen’s innovation.

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:54.936
Indeed these are subtleties that can only really be conveyed through books, through

00:13:55.096 --> 00:14:01.936
writing, this style doesn’t really work as well through other forms of media, like film.

00:14:02.956 --> 00:14:09.506
And perhaps the most amazing aspect of this innovation was that Jane Austen didn’t take part

00:14:09.606 --> 00:14:16.256
in fancy literary circles, where aspiring writers would discuss experimental techniques.

00:14:17.036 --> 00:14:21.986
She came up with this completely herself, likely when she was still a teenager.

00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:27.368
Another revolutionary aspect to her work that is, to a certain extent,

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:32.708
anti-revolutionary, was that she showed that you didn’t need huge

00:14:32.888 --> 00:14:37.778
epic external events to provide a backdrop to a compelling story.

00:14:38.468 --> 00:14:43.898
She showed that these small, self-contained worlds were more than enough, and in

00:14:43.898 --> 00:14:49.528
her own words all she needed was "three or four families" in a country setting.

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:55.928
Now this might seem obvious to us, and so many great books and films have

00:14:55.928 --> 00:15:01.168
been created using only very few characters and very small, self-contained

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:06.358
worlds, but Jane Austen was one of the first English writers to do this.

00:15:07.828 --> 00:15:12.358
She would, however, never know the true impact that her works would have.

00:15:12.998 --> 00:15:18.618
She died in 1817, at the age of 41, and it was only after her

00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:22.718
death that her novels started being published under her own name.

00:15:23.668 --> 00:15:28.658
Now, in the interest of balance, Jane Austen isn’t without her critics.

00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:33.818
The themes of her novels might be universal, but the world in which

00:15:33.818 --> 00:15:39.468
they are set is very small, and forms only a tiny, tiny part of society.

00:15:40.428 --> 00:15:44.498
Charlotte Brontë, who you’ll hear more about in part three of this

00:15:44.498 --> 00:15:49.437
mini-series, remarked that “the Passions are perfectly unknown to her”.

00:15:50.218 --> 00:15:56.248
She thought Jane Austen was superficial, and accused Pride and Prejudice of being “a

00:15:56.558 --> 00:16:02.228
carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden with neat borders and delicate flowers”.

00:16:03.018 --> 00:16:06.298
The writer Joseph Conrad wrote to H.G.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:10.108
Wells, asking “What is all this about Jane Austen?”

00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:11.908
He simply couldn’t get it.

00:16:13.103 --> 00:16:20.013
Mark Twain wrote “I often want to criticise Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I

00:16:20.053 --> 00:16:25.643
can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore I have to stop every time I begin.

00:16:26.073 --> 00:16:29.673
Every time I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig her

00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:33.413
up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.”

00:16:34.383 --> 00:16:36.393
But there’s a clue in that quote there.

00:16:36.713 --> 00:16:40.153
He writes that “every time” he reads Pride and Prejudice.

00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:46.433
He might find it frustrating, but he can’t stop himself picking it up over and over again.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:51.313
And this is a theme throughout criticism of Jane Austen.

00:16:51.763 --> 00:16:57.313
She can justifiably be accused of writing about small worlds that are completely

00:16:57.403 --> 00:17:02.753
detached from the lives of most people, where the main concern seems to be

00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:08.363
about finding a suitably rich partner and behaving the correct way in society.

00:17:09.063 --> 00:17:13.983
She doesn’t hide from that, indeed this is a theme throughout her books.

00:17:14.723 --> 00:17:19.263
But this is the world she knew, and it’s the life that she lived.

00:17:19.693 --> 00:17:26.703
Her life was spent trying to find a suitable marriage partner, trying to fit in to Victorian

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:33.463
societal norms, trying to do the right thing, which certainly wasn’t easy as a woman.

00:17:34.723 --> 00:17:39.473
Now, no discussion on Jane Austen would be complete without referring to the

00:17:39.483 --> 00:17:44.793
amazing range of popular adaptations that have been inspired by her novels.

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:50.743
For those critics who say that Jane Austen is irrelevant, given the tiny

00:17:50.743 --> 00:17:55.813
slither of society in which the stories take place, the amount of spin-offs

00:17:55.873 --> 00:18:01.013
and adaptations certainly suggests that the themes are more widely applicable.

00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:07.553
Perhaps the most famous of the adaptations is a 1995 BBC version of Pride

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:12.353
and Prejudice, most famous for the scene when a character called Mr Darcy,

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:17.543
played by Colin Firth, walks through a lake and comes out dripping wet.

00:18:18.803 --> 00:18:23.383
But there are some more frivolous versions, such as Pride and

00:18:23.383 --> 00:18:28.253
Prejudice and Zombies and an Indian version, Bride and Prejudice.

00:18:29.143 --> 00:18:34.871
In some cases, the adaptations imagine a world after a particular novel has finished.

00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:40.091
The crime writer PD James wrote a thriller based on the married

00:18:40.091 --> 00:18:44.471
life of Mr Darcy and Lizzie Bennet, called Death Comes to Pemberley.

00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:50.211
In another film, an Austen enthusiast literally steps into the

00:18:50.211 --> 00:18:53.701
world of Pride and Prejudice – that’s called Lost in Austen.

00:18:54.291 --> 00:19:00.361
There’s even a film which sets the novel Emma in 1990s America, called Clueless.

00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:05.461
Now, from the English learner’s point of view, these films can be a very

00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:10.761
good way to engage with Jane Austen, and I’d definitely recommend watching

00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:14.871
some of them if you’d like an easier route than starting with the novels.

00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:22.771
If you would like some safe recommendations of high quality films, I would go for the 1995

00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:29.701
Sense and Sensibility, the 2005 Pride and Prejudice, and the recent adaptation of Emma.

00:19:30.831 --> 00:19:35.351
The final thing to say is that one of the great things about Jane Austen is

00:19:35.351 --> 00:19:41.081
that she is interpreted afresh, she is reinterpreted, by each new generation.

00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:44.741
On that note, let me leave you with this image.

00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:50.711
The heroine of Pride and Prejudice, Lizzie, is described by an awful

00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:56.391
character called Lady Catherine de Burgh as an “obstinate, headstrong girl”.

00:19:57.381 --> 00:20:02.581
Obstinate means unwilling to change your mind or opinion, and headstrong

00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:07.911
means a similar thing, but is more like determined and impatient.

00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:13.881
For Victorian traditionalists, this might have been seen as a fitting

00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:19.211
insult, as women in Victorian times were expected to be submissive

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:23.251
and accepting of their father’s and then their husband’s wishes.

00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:29.791
Now, of course, being determined and independent are qualities to be admired,

00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:35.831
and it is fitting that this insult, this slur, has now been embraced.

00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:40.551
You can see girls t-shirts and jumpers with the slogan

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:44.601
“obstinate, headstrong girl” emblazoned across the front.

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:52.071
She might have died over 200 years ago, but if Jane Austen could see young women just like

00:20:52.071 --> 00:20:58.611
her wearing t-shirts with these words on, I’m sure it would bring a quiet smile to her face.

00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:07.421
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Jane Austen, the queen of English literature.

00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:13.631
As a reminder, this is going to be part one of a mini-series on great Victorian authors.

00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:17.691
Next up it’ll be Charles Dickens, then part three will

00:21:17.691 --> 00:21:21.111
be on the Bronte sisters, Emily, Charlotte and Anne.

00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:25.181
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:29.511
Have you read any Jane Austen, either in translation or in the original?

00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:31.471
Have you seen any of the films?

00:21:32.031 --> 00:21:33.981
If so, what did you think about them?

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:37.631
Are there any writers in your language that Jane Austen reminds you of?

00:21:38.179 --> 00:21:41.379
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

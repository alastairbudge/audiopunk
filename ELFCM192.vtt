Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:17.192
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:21.442
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:27.192
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Wikipedia.

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:34.412
It’s a website I imagine you know already, and one that you probably turn to as a source of

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:40.672
information, whether that’s finding out someone’s date of birth, settling a bet with a friend on

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:47.692
what the population of the United Kingdom really is, or whether a tomato is a vegetable or a fruit.

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:55.132
Indeed, every month pages on Wikipedia are viewed 18 billion times,

00:00:55.412 --> 00:00:59.462
that’s more than two times for every human being on the planet.

00:01:00.972 --> 00:01:04.542
Despite it being one of the most popular websites ever

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:08.292
created, many people don’t know all that much about it.

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:15.032
So, in today’s episode we are going to tell the story of Wikipedia, how the

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:21.232
idea came about, its early days and when it really started to take off, how it

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:27.152
actually works, some of the criticisms of the website, and what the future might

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:32.872
hold for a website with the ambition of containing the sum of human knowledge.

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:38.182
Before we get right into today’s episode though, I want to remind you that you

00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:43.112
can become a member of Leonardo English and follow along with the subtitles, the

00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:48.612
transcript and its key vocabulary over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:55.152
Membership of Leonardo English gives you access to all of our learning materials, all of our bonus

00:01:55.152 --> 00:02:02.542
episodes, so that’s almost 200 different episodes now, as well as two new ones every week, plus

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:09.062
access to our awesome private community where we do live events, challenges, and much, much more.

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:15.462
Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:20.822
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:25.882
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:30.412
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:34.472
OK then, Wikipedia.

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:42.442
Let’s start with a few statistics, just so we truly understand the scale of Wikipedia.

00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:48.042
It’s almost always in the top 10 most visited websites in

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:52.292
the world, with around 18 billion page views per month.

00:02:53.232 --> 00:02:57.112
It exists in 323 different languages.

00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:01.222
English is the largest one, with over 6 million

00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:04.893
different articles available on the English Wikipedia.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:13.612
And, as you probably know, it is constantly evolving, it is constantly being edited, updated,

00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:20.402
with new information added, new pages added, and new knowledge being added to the website.

00:03:21.182 --> 00:03:25.522
The speed of this is astounding, it’s amazing.

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:31.162
There are an average of 1.7 edits per second on the English

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:36.302
language Wikipedia, and 600 new articles added every day.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.362
Nobody is paid to do this, as you may know.

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:46.912
It is completely manned by volunteers, people sort of like me and you all

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:51.262
across the world who are passionate about the goal of Wikipedia, which is

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:56.112
to be “a comprehensive collection of all of the knowledge in the world”.

00:03:56.932 --> 00:04:03.280
Now, this is quite some achievement, it is a pretty amazing resource, available to anyone,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.434
anywhere, completely free, with no adverts, no selling of data, no ulterior motive.

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:13.004
How has this been achieved?

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:20.991
Wikipedia technically celebrated its 20th year of life earlier in 2021, but

00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:27.621
to understand where it came from we have to go back a lot further than 2001.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:33.971
The idea of collating all human knowledge and making it available

00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:38.301
to all is, of course, not something that arrived with Wikipedia.

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:45.681
Since writing has existed, humans have wanted to document knowledge, to write down

00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:51.651
what people know so that it is not lost, and it can be referenced by other people.

00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:58.241
Pliny the Elder, the Roman philosopher, was in the middle of writing a book like this,

00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:04.931
an early encyclopedia, when he was killed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:11.411
And since Pliny the Elder, scholars and thinkers have worked on documenting

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:17.261
knowledge, writing down what is known by mankind, so that others can benefit from it.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:25.712
The person probably most famous for this idea, though, the idea of an Encyclopedia, was a Frenchman

00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:35.984
named Denis Diderot, who published his famous Encyclopédie, his Encyclopedia, between 1751 and 1772.

00:05:36.928 --> 00:05:41.114
At the time of Diderot’s Encyclopedia, literacy rates were

00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:47.246
around 50% for men and 27% for women, in France that is.

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:52.648
The cost of printing had reduced sufficiently so that books were more

00:05:52.648 --> 00:05:57.648
widely available than ever before, and so that it was easier than

00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:02.881
ever to consult a book to find information about almost anything.

00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:09.151
Of course, you still had to physically have access to the book, and finding the

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:15.491
information required would have been a much more time consuming process than the one we

00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:21.951
are used to now, but it was still an important event in the history of encyclopedias.

00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:28.861
Fast forward a few hundred years, to the mid 1990s, and it was suddenly

00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:33.861
possible to access this kind of information from a computer, digitally,

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:39.281
with programmes such as Microsoft Encarta and Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:45.911
I can vividly remember receiving a CD-ROM of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:06:46.411 --> 00:06:52.111
This was probably in 1998 or something, and I can remember thinking

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:56.471
that it was absolutely amazing that I could just put the CD into the

00:06:56.471 --> 00:07:01.791
computer, search for anything and this CD would contain the information.

00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:08.621
At the same time as this curious 11-year-old was trying to find information on his

00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:14.991
Encyclopedia Britannica, across the Atlantic Ocean a group of Americans had been working on

00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:21.766
something very different that would, ultimately, turn into what we now know as Wikipedia.

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:28.846
Jimmy Wales was 29 years old in 1996, and had left his

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:33.186
job working in finance to start an internet company.

00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:40.496
This was just as the dot-com-boom was starting, and Wales had seen the potential of

00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:46.986
the internet not just to make money, but to connect people, and to share information.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.950
The company he first started was not Wikipedia though.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.870
It was called Bomis, Bomis.com, which was a male-focussed search engine, and turned

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:07.170
into, essentially, a way for people to find erotic images, nude pictures of women.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.180
Helping men find pictures of naked women wasn’t Wales’

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.360
passion, although there was plenty of demand for it.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.840
Wales had long been interested in the idea of an encyclopedia, of creating a

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:27.470
way for people to share knowledge about everything in the world, not just porn.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:34.760
So, in 1999, Wales launched a company called Nupedia, which was

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:41.020
financed, it was paid for, by Bomis, the adult content discovery website.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:47.890
Nupedia was an encyclopedia, essentially, but with a few important differences.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.704
The idea was that subject matter experts, whether they were academics, researchers, or just

00:08:55.714 --> 00:09:02.364
individuals who knew a lot about a particular subject, could submit an article about anything.

00:09:03.424 --> 00:09:08.344
There was then a seven-step process to review the article, to

00:09:08.504 --> 00:09:12.844
make sure that it was correct, and adhered to the guidelines.

00:09:13.434 --> 00:09:19.654
Then, if it passed this process, it would be published, it would be put on the website.

00:09:20.724 --> 00:09:26.104
The main way in which it was different to previous encyclopedias is

00:09:26.104 --> 00:09:31.824
that it was crowd-sourced, the information was submitted by experts,

00:09:31.874 --> 00:09:36.024
rather than created by a relatively small selection of writers.

00:09:36.484 --> 00:09:43.654
But, there was still this seven-step review process, which attempted to guarantee high quality.

00:09:44.574 --> 00:09:49.364
It is of course easy to say with retrospect, but this process

00:09:49.484 --> 00:09:53.264
meant that actually getting anything published took a long time.

00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:59.824
And indeed, after 18 months Nupedia had only just over 20

00:09:59.914 --> 00:10:04.354
articles in total, an average of one published a month.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.150
If you are trying to collate all the information in the world, well,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.910
it’s going to take a long time if that’s how fast you are going.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:20.310
Wales had hired a man called Larry Sanger to be the editor-in-chief of

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:26.110
Nupedia, and soon Sanger grew frustrated with how long things were taking.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:34.264
A few months after Nupedia had started, Wales and Sanger had launched another encyclopedia project

00:10:34.314 --> 00:10:41.528
to run at the same time as Nupedia, to test out an alternative approach that could grow faster.

00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:44.248
The name of this side-project?

00:10:44.648 --> 00:10:45.198
Wikipedia.

00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:50.897
Now, why did Wikipedia succeed when Nupedia failed?

00:10:51.623 --> 00:10:55.643
One clue is actually in the name - “wiki”.

00:10:56.143 --> 00:11:00.703
A “wiki” is a kind of publication that can be edited

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:04.323
by its own audience directly in the web browser.

00:11:05.103 --> 00:11:09.303
Anyone can create articles, and they can make edits.

00:11:09.763 --> 00:11:12.773
In short, anyone can write for Wikipedia.

00:11:13.803 --> 00:11:19.983
There are some exceptions, and some articles require approval by administrators

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:25.763
for changes to be accepted, but this is the basic concept of Wikipedia.

00:11:26.663 --> 00:11:32.623
Instead of the Nupedia model where for any piece of information to be published it

00:11:32.623 --> 00:11:38.873
needed to go through a very detailed review process, with a Wiki, and at least in

00:11:38.873 --> 00:11:44.506
the early days of Wikipedia, there was no review process - anyone could write it.

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:52.663
This has its own share of problems, which we’ll come on to discuss a bit later, but the “open

00:11:52.663 --> 00:12:00.236
source” nature of Wikipedia meant that it grew significantly faster than its big brother, Nupedia.

00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:10.773
Wikipedia was founded on January 15th 2001, and within three months there were 3,900 articles.

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:18.003
The more articles it had, the more Wikipedia pages appeared as results on search engines, so the

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:23.573
more people knew about it, and more people started to contribute to it, so more articles were

00:12:23.573 --> 00:12:30.333
published, and it started to appear in even more search results - it really was a snowball effect.

00:12:30.593 --> 00:12:33.293
The more it grew, the faster it grew.

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:39.613
At the same time, growth at Nupedia was stagnating, it really wasn’t

00:12:39.653 --> 00:12:44.793
going anywhere, and both Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger’s attentions

00:12:45.003 --> 00:12:50.403
were devoted mainly to this new, open source, people’s Encyclopedia.

00:12:51.663 --> 00:12:57.513
As it started to be more and more popular, inevitably the criticisms started.

00:12:58.353 --> 00:13:01.003
If anyone can edit it, how can we trust it?

00:13:01.443 --> 00:13:06.373
If it hasn’t been reviewed by any subject matter experts, how can we trust it?

00:13:06.743 --> 00:13:11.573
If all contributions are anonymous, and you don’t have to use your real

00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:17.853
name, isn’t this just opening it up for spam, abuse and misinformation?

00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:23.023
These were all very valid questions, and indeed early

00:13:23.073 --> 00:13:28.093
Wikipedia was plagued with trolls and bad actors.

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:35.575
Because anyone could edit it, it was relatively easy for anyone to change an article to promote

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:41.565
their world view, be rude about something they didn’t agree with, or just abuse the system.

00:13:42.452 --> 00:13:48.592
There were controls in place to try to stop this, but it was hard to keep up with all of them.

00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:56.092
In an interview with Larry Sanger, he reported how many of the early contributors, people with

00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:03.926
honourable intentions, left the project because it was so dispiriting, so annoying and tedious, to

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:10.936
be constantly removing the spam and abuse, instead of actually contributing real knowledge to it.

00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:19.506
Wikipedia at this point was still 100% funded by Bomis, which was itself, like almost

00:14:19.546 --> 00:14:24.946
every Internet company just before the dot-com crash, not doing very well at this time.

00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:30.376
Although Wikipedia could have easily started to make a lot of money if

00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:35.536
it had allowed adverts on the website, for example, Wales was completely

00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:40.906
against this, as he thought it went against the ethos of Wikipedia.

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:47.936
Instead, he wanted the website to be paid for by donations from its users.

00:14:48.685 --> 00:14:54.165
His view was that if Wikipedia was good enough, and it helped enough

00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:58.645
people, then they would be willing to support it through donations.

00:14:59.424 --> 00:15:00.824
He proved to be right.

00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:04.604
One of its first fundraisers, its first attempt at raising

00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:12.014
money from its readers in late 2004, raised $44,000.

00:15:12.464 --> 00:15:18.684
Not much, but a sign that some people did value it enough to support it financially.

00:15:19.584 --> 00:15:24.394
Now, it raises around $130 million dollars a year from its

00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:28.604
readers, the majority of which comes in small donations.

00:15:29.394 --> 00:15:36.009
This might sound like a lot of money, but when you think that Alphabet, the parent company of

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:42.199
Google, makes this amount of money in about five hours, it really puts it into perspective.

00:15:43.439 --> 00:15:47.969
Almost since the day it was founded, Wikipedia has continued to grow

00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:52.089
and grow in practically every language and country in the world.

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:56.029
While English is still the dominant language, articles

00:15:56.029 --> 00:16:00.539
in English now only make up 11.5% of Wikipedia.

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:06.769
You might be surprised to learn about the second and third most popular

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:11.309
languages on Wikipedia, at least in terms of number of articles.

00:16:12.469 --> 00:16:18.989
The second is a Filipino language called Cebuano, and the third is Swedish.

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:21.319
Weird, you are probably thinking.

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:24.259
I was certainly surprised when I found this out.

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:28.619
Cebuano is the second most widely spoken language in

00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:31.929
the Philippines, but only has 20 million speakers.

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:37.809
And Swedish, well there are only around 11 million people who can speak Swedish.

00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:42.669
And Sweden and, to a lesser extent, the Philippines, have very high

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:48.519
levels of English, so why are the Cebuano and Swedish Wikipedias so large?

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:55.169
There’s actually an automated computer program, a bot, created by a Swedish

00:16:55.179 --> 00:17:00.419
programmer called Sverker Johansson that is responsible for all of these articles.

00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:05.559
Johansson’s bot, his computer program, creates articles in

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:09.989
an automated way, using information stored in databases.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.859
It is, reportedly, pretty well written, but it isn’t always

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:20.219
100% accurate, and sometimes sounds a little strange.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:27.069
Imagine you were translating an entire document in English to your language via Google Translate

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:33.439
- you can get the meaning, but it probably sounds a little weird, not quite completely normal.

00:17:34.499 --> 00:17:40.769
Johansson’s bot is a bit of a controversial point within Wikipedia, and actually leads

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:46.529
us nicely on to the last section, where we will contemplate some of the questions that

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:52.659
Wikipedia gets us thinking about, and look at some of the criticisms of the website.

00:17:53.699 --> 00:18:00.729
If anyone can add articles, even a bot which adds information that isn’t always perfectly written,

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:07.479
how can you ensure firstly the quality of what is published, secondly whether the information

00:18:07.659 --> 00:18:14.469
is actually accurate or not, and thirdly what actually deserves its own article on Wikipedia?

00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:19.819
To the first question, of the quality of the articles, the fact that

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:23.979
there are thousands of editors means that badly written articles are

00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:28.699
normally quickly corrected, especially if the article has lots of readers.

00:18:29.179 --> 00:18:34.629
Of course, the more speakers of a language that exist on Wikipedia, and the more

00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:40.718
popular an article is, the quicker this correction happens, so for major languages

00:18:40.748 --> 00:18:45.843
such as English and for more popular subjects, it isn’t such a huge issue.

00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:52.603
But the question of accuracy of information is a big, incredibly complicated issue.

00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:58.183
Ultimately, it is a question of who decides what “truth” is?

00:18:58.733 --> 00:19:04.873
There are some categories of articles where “truth” is perhaps easier to define.

00:19:05.533 --> 00:19:10.563
An article about the chemical properties of oxygen, for example.

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:14.643
With Johansson’s computer bot, it publishes lots of

00:19:14.643 --> 00:19:18.773
articles about living organisms, where facts are facts.

00:19:19.303 --> 00:19:23.643
But when it comes to almost anything else, especially

00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:28.323
people, who decides what goes on the Wikipedia page?

00:19:28.353 --> 00:19:31.993
And how can an article remain completely neutral?

00:19:33.313 --> 00:19:39.053
Larry Sanger, the original editor-in-chief of Wikipedia, and the man who also

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:45.603
designed the 7-step-process for Wikipedia’s predecessor, Nupedia, has become

00:19:45.603 --> 00:19:51.753
an outspoken critic of Wikipedia, or at least what Wikipedia has become.

00:19:52.723 --> 00:19:58.913
His relationship with Wikipedia ended in 2002 after it ran out of money and couldn’t

00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:04.906
pay him, and he now frequently gives interviews where he gives examples of some

00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:09.906
of the problems with Wikipedia, and with the entire philosophy of the platform.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:16.586
A recent example he gave in an interview with the British publication Unherd was

00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:22.104
of the differences between the Wikipedia entries for Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:26.913
Now, of course they are two very different people, and they should have different

00:20:26.913 --> 00:20:33.978
entries, with different sections on different parts of their life, but in the Wikipedia

00:20:33.978 --> 00:20:39.728
article on Donald Trump there is a very large section on his controversies and on

00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:45.818
what Trump’s opponents have accused him of doing, whereas in the article for Joe

00:20:45.818 --> 00:20:51.518
Biden there is very little about what Biden’s opponents have accused him of doing.

00:20:52.658 --> 00:20:58.188
Sanger’s point is that it doesn’t matter whether you are a Trump or a Biden supporter, or neither.

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:04.348
The point is that what information is or isn’t included in someone’s Wikipedia

00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:09.658
page is incredibly important, especially as hundreds of millions of people,

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:15.655
490 million people a month in fact, turn to it as a source of information.

00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:21.258
If Wikipedia is a source of truth for hundreds of millions of people,

00:21:21.398 --> 00:21:26.878
then it needs to do a better job at neutrality, and being more equal

00:21:26.898 --> 00:21:31.308
in terms of what information is and isn’t included in an article.

00:21:31.998 --> 00:21:36.828
The third main criticism of Wikipedia is about the choices

00:21:36.968 --> 00:21:40.678
of what subjects are written about, and what are not.

00:21:41.598 --> 00:21:47.008
Given that the editors are not paid to contribute to Wikipedia, they

00:21:47.178 --> 00:21:52.078
typically write about what is interesting to them, and what they know about.

00:21:52.842 --> 00:21:57.478
Thus, the content of Wikipedia is greatly influenced

00:21:57.668 --> 00:22:00.938
by the humans who have decided to contribute to it.

00:22:02.668 --> 00:22:06.478
And who exactly are these people, these editors of Wikipedia?

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:13.868
Wikipedia doesn’t provide detailed information on the demographics of its editors, but

00:22:14.008 --> 00:22:21.778
studies have shown that up to 90% of the active editors are male, they are men, and it is

00:22:21.798 --> 00:22:28.318
widely believed that they are mainly young, computer-literate white Europeans and Americans.

00:22:28.758 --> 00:22:35.678
Indeed, Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, stated that it has "completely failed"

00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:41.068
to meet its goals of resolving the lack of diversity amongst Wikipedia editors.

00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:46.998
This has two main effects in terms of what you or I would see on the website.

00:22:47.698 --> 00:22:52.848
Firstly, the choice of what information to include, what points of discussion to

00:22:52.858 --> 00:22:59.178
highlight, and what sources to reference is reflective of the authors of an article.

00:22:59.848 --> 00:23:05.338
Wikipedia is officially neutral and articles should not provide a point of

00:23:05.348 --> 00:23:11.438
view, but, as you’ve seen, in many cases this is very hard to do in practice.

00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:17.698
And secondly, the choice of what to actually write about reflects the authors.

00:23:19.038 --> 00:23:24.728
In 2015 there was a study that showed that there were more contributors to

00:23:24.728 --> 00:23:30.018
the Wikipedia list of Pornographic Actresses than the List of Female Poets.

00:23:31.348 --> 00:23:37.488
So, this highlights some of the not insignificant problems that the site is battling.

00:23:38.358 --> 00:23:41.128
Now, it is easy to criticise Wikipedia.

00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:43.638
It is certainly imperfect.

00:23:44.088 --> 00:23:48.118
I imagine that you might have read an article on Wikipedia and found

00:23:48.118 --> 00:23:52.468
something that was incorrect, or you thought that something was missing.

00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:58.528
Of course, the best thing you can do in that situation is correct it, if you like.

00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:02.898
In case this was news for you, anyone can be a contributor

00:24:02.898 --> 00:24:06.968
to Wikipedia, and thousands of people edit it every month.

00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:12.138
I am not a frequent contributor to Wikipedia, but I have done it before.

00:24:12.638 --> 00:24:17.838
It does feel a bit strange doing it, but it is a pretty amazing

00:24:17.838 --> 00:24:21.528
feeling, knowing that you are contributing, even in a tiny, tiny

00:24:21.528 --> 00:24:25.708
way, to the largest collection of written knowledge in world history.

00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:32.698
And although Wikipedia is 20 years old, and has already firmly established

00:24:32.698 --> 00:24:38.598
itself as one of the world’s 10 most visited websites, and importantly the only

00:24:38.598 --> 00:24:43.818
one that is a not-for-profit, it believes that its work is far from complete.

00:24:44.788 --> 00:24:50.548
There are currently 6 million articles in English, and by one Wikipedia contributor’s

00:24:50.548 --> 00:24:57.288
estimate in order to record all of the world’s information, including every village, every

00:24:57.308 --> 00:25:03.078
elected official, every famous painting, there would need to be 100 million articles.

00:25:04.138 --> 00:25:09.308
If that is indeed the case, Wikipedia is only just getting started.

00:25:12.138 --> 00:25:17.708
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the history of Wikipedia.

00:25:18.218 --> 00:25:21.878
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that

00:25:21.888 --> 00:25:26.528
next time you find yourself on Wikipedia, which I guess might be quite soon,

00:25:26.738 --> 00:25:31.498
then you’ll know a little bit more about the history of this amazing project.

00:25:32.233 --> 00:25:35.998
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:36.318 --> 00:25:39.758
What do you think some of the problems are with Wikipedia?

00:25:40.058 --> 00:25:44.668
Who should decide what deserves to go into an article, and what doesn’t?

00:25:45.196 --> 00:25:51.736
What questions does it raise about what things like “neutral information” or “truth” really are?

00:25:52.403 --> 00:25:53.673
I would love to know.

00:25:53.893 --> 00:25:58.463

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.580
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.050
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.920
about the mysterious life of Grigori Rasputin - The Mad Monk.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.560
He was the peasant who went from a village in Siberia to the centre of the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.500
Russian imperial court, befriending the Tsar and the Tsarina, and playing

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.000
a role in the downfall of Russia’s longest serving dynasty, The Romanovs.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.220
It’s an amazing story that will involve mysticism, kings and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.730
queens, the Russian Orthodox church, sex, violence, war and murder.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.680
So, buckle up, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.530
OK then, Grigori Rasputin.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.250
Now, let’s start with a little bit of Russian history for context.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.172
Throughout history, Russia has had two main dynasties: the Rurikids and the Romanovs.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.250
Today we are going to focus on the fall of the Romanov dynasty.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.580
The Romanov family ruled imperial Russia from 1613 until 1917 when a Bolshevik squad murdered the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.990
entire Romanov family, including tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their five children.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.560
At the time of the early 1900s, Russia was one of the poorest countries

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.870
in Europe and due to a population, boom, poor working conditions and high

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.442
taxes the majority of the Russians lived in a state of extreme poverty.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:03.792
As living conditions worsened, the Russian working class led a series

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:10.152
of protests against the monarchy and in 1905, the tsar’s troops killed

00:02:10.152 --> 00:02:14.852
hundreds of protesters in an event called the Bloody Sunday Massacre.

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:20.352
This violent event was the beginning of the start of the Russian Revolution

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:26.152
in which workers went on multiple strikes, further hurting Russia’s economy.

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:32.732
In response to the massacre and the strikes, Tsar Nicholas put in place some

00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:39.372
political reform, in the form of small representative governments called Dumas, but

00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:44.832
he repeatedly abolished these Dumas when they went against him and his influence.

00:02:45.452 --> 00:02:51.332
A second revolution happened on March 8, 1917 and four

00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:54.342
days later, the Duma established its own government.

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:58.952
Tsar Nicholas was forced to resign from the throne, but

00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:02.832
as you might remember, the Duma wasn’t in power for long.

00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:06.842
In October of the same year, the Bolsheviks occupied

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:10.342
government buildings and overthrew the capitalist government.

00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:15.142
The Bolsheviks formed a new government made up of peasants and workers.

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:20.284
A civil war broke out in Russia with the Red Army fighting for the

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:24.754
Bolshevik government, and the White Army fighting for democratic socialism.

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:31.104
In 1923, the civil war ended, the Red Army won, and the Soviet

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:35.314
Union, the world’s first communist country, was established.

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:42.514
Grigori Rasputin, our story’s protagonist, played an important role in this major

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:48.674
shift in Russian history but to understand how, we have to start from the beginning.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:54.434
In the year 1869, in the village of Pokrovskoye in

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:58.484
Siberia, an illiterate peasant woman gave birth to a boy.

00:03:59.504 --> 00:04:02.967
She called him Grigory Yefimovich Novykh.

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:07.154
Growing up, the boy worked on his family’s farm.

00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:13.234
He did go to school, but never learned to read or write, he remained illiterate.

00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:17.764
As a child, the boy claimed he had visions.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.814
He is also said to have healed a number of horses.

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:30.024
Members of his small town marvelled at his magical abilities but instead of viewing him

00:04:30.284 --> 00:04:36.754
as a healer, they believed that he was somehow related to the devil and they avoided him.

00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:44.066
The boy claimed that when he got older, he also gained the ability to tell the future.

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:49.896
He was clearly a bit of a wild youth, and was given the name

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.696
“Rasputin”, which means “the debauched one”, the “wild” one.

00:04:56.116 --> 00:05:01.566
By the age of eighteen, Rasputin got married to a girl from a nearby village,

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:06.936
and together they had seven children, but only three of them survived.

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:13.586
By all reports, his early married life was relatively uneventful.

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:19.826
But in 1897, when he was 28 years old, everything changed.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:28.786
Rasputin started a spiritual journey, though the reasons for starting it are a little unclear.

00:05:29.876 --> 00:05:33.966
According to some, his interest in his religious pilgrimage

00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:38.476
was because he wanted to escape punishment for horse theft.

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:42.626
Essentially, he had been caught stealing horses and

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:47.156
turning to religion provided a way of avoiding punishment.

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:51.716
Others say that he had a vision of the Virgin Mary.

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:55.856
Either way, he left his family to go to live in a

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:58.936
monastery in a town several hundred kilometres away

00:05:59.937 --> 00:06:03.346
.
It was here that he was completely transformed.

00:06:04.492 --> 00:06:08.736
Rasputin grew fascinated by an underground, secret

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:13.146
sect of the Russian Orthodox Church called the Khylsts.

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:18.096
The Khylsts believed in “sinning to drive out sin”.

00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:22.946
To do this, they often participated in acts that were

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:27.956
considered to be sexually deviant in order to be closer to God.

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:35.695
To put it more bluntly, they would dance, get wild and worked up, then all have sex with each other.

00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:44.005
To a man already with a bit of a wild past, and who would later become known for

00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:50.585
his voracious sexual appetite, this must have been like opening the doors of heaven.

00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:58.895
He embraced this sect completely, and became devoted to this particular part of the church.

00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:06.585
Unlike other monks, Rasputin didn’t abandon his family; he continued to see his

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:11.825
wife and three children throughout his life, though he had a wild reputation.

00:07:12.476 --> 00:07:19.735
Rasputin was known for having many sexual partners and affairs as well as for drinking excessively.

00:07:21.055 --> 00:07:25.555
With his rockstar lifestyle and debauched behaviour, he earned the

00:07:25.555 --> 00:07:31.345
nickname “Mad Monk” though in reality, he was never technically a monk.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.520
Word of a charismatic holy man started to spread, and Rasputin was invited to

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.777
St Petersburg to meet with the city’s most powerful bishop, Bishop Theofan.

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:50.790
Rasputin’s arrival to the Russian capital, in 1905, came at the right time.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.590
In the early 20th century, people in St Petersburg, like in many

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.150
places in Russia, had become superstitious and interested in mysticism.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.790
There was also an increasingly liberal attitude towards sex, and the newspapers at

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:16.250
the time were even publishing adverts for treatments of sexually transmitted diseases.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:24.840
This fascination with mysticism, coupled with an increasingly free society, sexually at

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:32.643
least, created an environment where Rasputin, this new mystic sex-fueled monk, could thrive.

00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:39.020
Rasputin soon became well-known in the city and he gained many followers.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.570
People were obsessed with Rasputin, although I wouldn’t

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.180
blame you if you find it difficult to understand why.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.990
Physically, he was very dirty, he was completely filthy.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.840
He would rarely wash or brush his teeth, and it was said that he smelled like a goat.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.540
This didn’t seem to put off his followers though, especially the female ones.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.420
They would often spend hours bathing him or licking his fingers clean.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.800
As souvenirs, they would collect Rasputin’s nail clippings, the

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.430
piece of his nails that he cut off, and attach them to their dresses.

00:09:25.584 --> 00:09:31.794
As Rasputin’s reputation as a mystic grew, Bishop Theophane eventually introduced

00:09:31.794 --> 00:09:38.084
Rasputin to the Romanov family, tsar Nicholas II and his wife, tsarina Alexandra.

00:09:39.444 --> 00:09:46.064
Nicholas and Alexandra had consulted spiritual advisors similar to Rasputin in the past.

00:09:46.594 --> 00:09:52.404
The imperial family had tried to have a male heir, a son,

00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:56.634
but for 9 years they only managed to produce daughters.

00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:04.324
In 1904, after the birth of four daughters, finally a son arrived, Alexei.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.534
There was a problem though.

00:10:06.894 --> 00:10:13.054
He was born with haemophilia, an illness in which blood doesn’t clot or come together.

00:10:13.954 --> 00:10:18.034
For people suffering from haemophilia at the time, even with

00:10:18.044 --> 00:10:22.294
the best doctors in the world, the disease could be fatal.

00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:26.374
A small cut could cause you to bleed to death.

00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:34.124
The boy’s condition was kept secret from everyone apart from their trusted inner circle.

00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:39.614
The family was desperate to find a cure and after consulting with

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:45.004
fortune tellers and mediums who claimed to be able to speak to the dead,

00:10:45.574 --> 00:10:51.386
tsarina Alexandra found the cure that she had been looking for: Rasputin.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.720
Rasputin was instructed to spend time with the boy, in order to cure him from this illness.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:06.140
After Rasputin’s visit, where he threw away all the medicine the doctors had recommended

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:13.380
and conducted his own treatment on the boy, Alexei miraculously started to get better.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.800
As a result of having cured the only male heir to the Russian

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.280
throne, Rasputin soon became the royal family’s most trusted advisor.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.740
While many people believed that Rasputin had mystical powers, and indeed

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:36.140
the tsarina certainly thought that Raspuin had performed magic to save her

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.190
son’s life, there are some logical explanations for his healing abilities.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.090
In fact, it’s more about what Rasputin didn’t do than what he did do.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.780
Remember, he threw away all of the medicine that the doctors had been prescribing to the boy.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.440
Doctors at that time would most likely would have given Alexei aspirin,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.690
which would have thinned the blood and made it less likely to clot.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.550
It might have been a simple case of good luck, but Rasputin’s

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:16.410
distrust of doctors, and his subsequent actions, helped save Alexei.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.710
The family trusted Rasputin and after performing this

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.440
miracle, Rasputin secured a place in the imperial family.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:33.310
He even started to refer to Nicholas and Alexandra as “mama and

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:39.024
papa”, which was particularly strange as Rasputin was only 8 months

00:12:39.076 --> 00:12:43.960
younger than Nicholas and actually 3 years older than Alexandra.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:51.380
Because he was regarded as the saviour of the heir, he gained access to the palace and the family.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:59.480
He became especially close with Alexandra, who in 1915 was in charge of Russia’s

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:05.930
internal affairs, as her husband was leading the Russian war effort in World War One.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:13.410
Due to Rasputin’s sexually promiscuous reputation, many people believe that he and

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.800
the tsarina actually had an intimate relationship, that they were sleeping together.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.650
Although there is no evidence to prove this, the

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.340
important thing is that the public believed it was true.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:34.760
Soldiers openly joked about it as if it were a fact, Russian newspapers printed

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:41.080
cartoons suggesting that it was the case, and it was believed to be common knowledge.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.480
While it’s not known whether their intimacy extended to the

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.570
bedroom, Rasputin and the tsarina were certainly growing closer.

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:59.670
Rasputin went from a mere spiritual advisor to Alexandra, to an advisor on almost everything.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.690
He influenced her decisions when choosing members of the

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.220
cabinet and sometimes advised her about military matters.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:15.350
As Rasputin’s political power and influence grew, the Russian elite felt threatened.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.164
After all, he was a filthy, illiterate peasant from

00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:24.594
Siberia whose role was supposedly as a mystical healer.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:32.844
And now there he was whispering in the Tsarina’s ear, influencing Russian political decisions.

00:14:34.364 --> 00:14:38.574
Secret police began to watch Rasputin and they took note of

00:14:38.574 --> 00:14:43.274
his frequent visits to prostitutes, often multiple times a day.

00:14:44.624 --> 00:14:50.034
Many people close to the royal family believed that Rasputin was a dangerous

00:14:50.034 --> 00:14:55.434
man and that the tsar and the tsarina were foolish to put their trust in him.

00:14:57.472 --> 00:15:03.135
Even in the early days of his political influence, Rasputin had plenty of enemies.

00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:11.605
In 1914, a year before becoming the tsarina’s personal advisor, there was an assassination

00:15:11.635 --> 00:15:18.065
attempt made on Rasputin’s life by a noseless, peasant woman named Khioniya Guseva.

00:15:19.192 --> 00:15:26.572
Guseva was the follower of a man called Iliodor, who was a former priest and supporter of Rasputin

00:15:26.782 --> 00:15:32.752
before he grew jealous of Rasputin’s relationship with the royal family and he turned against him.

00:15:33.972 --> 00:15:37.892
Guseva had listened closely to Iliodor’s teaching about

00:15:37.892 --> 00:15:42.962
Rasputin, and had decided that Rasputin was a false prophet.

00:15:44.532 --> 00:15:51.752
On July 14th, 1914, she waited for Rasputin outside his home in Pokrovskoye.

00:15:52.632 --> 00:15:58.112
When he arrived, she stabbed him in the stomach, and went so far as to try

00:15:58.182 --> 00:16:03.442
to pull his intestines out of his body while he was lying in front of her.

00:16:04.982 --> 00:16:10.542
Somehow, Rasputin survived this attempt on his life but unfortunately

00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:14.342
for him, this wouldn’t be the last time that someone tried to kill him.

00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:20.462
There were several other assassination plots that were discovered before Rasputin’s life

00:16:20.532 --> 00:16:28.122
was seriously threatened, but in late 1916 fate finally caught up with Grigori Rasputin.

00:16:28.782 --> 00:16:33.302
He had made too many enemies, and not enough powerful friends.

00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:35.152
The clock was ticking.

00:16:35.812 --> 00:16:43.502
A group of conservatives formed a plan to kill Rasputin and save the monarchy from more scandal.

00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:49.582
This group included one of the richest men in Russia, Prince

00:16:49.582 --> 00:16:54.132
Feliks Yusupov, who was also the husband of the tsar’s niece.

00:16:55.212 --> 00:16:59.852
The plan was to lure Rasputin to Yusupov’s home, Moika

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:05.612
Palace, and on December 30th of 1916, Rasputin arrived.

00:17:06.932 --> 00:17:14.112
What exactly happened that day is unknown, and there are many myths surrounding Rasputin’s death.

00:17:15.062 --> 00:17:22.102
According to Yusupov, he offered Rasputin tea and cakes, which Rasputin ate with pleasure.

00:17:22.882 --> 00:17:27.062
What Rasputin didn’t know, of course, was that the food

00:17:27.292 --> 00:17:31.702
and drink had been laced with cyanide, a deadly poison.

00:17:33.032 --> 00:17:38.672
Rasputin reportedly ate the cakes but didn’t seem affected by the poison.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:43.742
He then asked for some wine, which was provided to him.

00:17:44.342 --> 00:17:46.732
The wine too, had cyanide in it.

00:17:47.592 --> 00:17:55.222
It got to 2.30 in the morning, but Rasputin was still there, seemingly completely fine.

00:17:56.472 --> 00:18:01.132
Yusupov excused himself and went upstairs to consult his

00:18:01.182 --> 00:18:05.242
co-conspirators, the other two men who were involved in the plan.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:11.712
He returned downstairs, took a gun, and shot Rasputin in the chest.

00:18:12.672 --> 00:18:17.302
Now, being shot directly in the chest did affect Rasputin, of course.

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:23.772
Yusupov thought he had killed Rasputin, so he returned upstairs to celebrate.

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:31.342
The men dressed someone in Rasputin’s clothes and ordered him to drive to

00:18:31.462 --> 00:18:35.882
Rasputin’s apartment to make it seem like he had returned home that night.

00:18:36.952 --> 00:18:44.262
But when they returned to dispose of Rasputin’s body, to get rid of the

00:18:44.262 --> 00:18:48.632
body, they found that he was still alive and he proceeded to fight Yusupuv.

00:18:49.652 --> 00:18:53.822
A few more shots seemed to do the trick, they shot

00:18:53.872 --> 00:18:58.862
Rasputin a few more times, and he collapsed, finally dead.

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:05.752
The men took his body, wrapped him up in a thick cloth and took him to a frozen river.

00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:10.092
They found a hole in the ice and threw him in.

00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:15.572
News travelled fast of Rasputin’s death and on January the

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:19.632
1st, policemen found Rasputin’s body under the river ice.

00:19:20.812 --> 00:19:27.052
Although Yusupov told this elaborate story about Rasputin’s death, Rasputin’s daughter

00:19:27.222 --> 00:19:33.672
Maria questioned Yusupov’s account, saying that her father would never have eaten cakes.

00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:41.027
In addition, autopsy reports showed no signs of Rasputin being poisoned, though it

00:19:41.172 --> 00:19:47.432
was clear that Rasputin’s body had undergone a lot of physical trauma after he died.

00:19:48.932 --> 00:19:54.862
The cause of death was determined to be three gunshot wounds but there was

00:19:54.862 --> 00:20:01.233
reportedly water found in his lungs, which indicates that Rasputin could have been

00:20:01.253 --> 00:20:07.633
alive when he was thrown into the river, this is after having eaten enough cyanide

00:20:07.763 --> 00:20:13.483
to kill a herd of elephants and being shot several times at point-blank range.

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:20.343
He might have been impossible to kill, but he was now certainly dead.

00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:28.143
And in the months after Rasputin’s murder, things went from bad to worse for the Romanovs.

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:34.673
People were starving, the transportation system was falling apart, and Russia had suffered

00:20:34.673 --> 00:20:41.013
greatly in World War One, with an estimated 3 million Russians losing their lives.

00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:49.213
As the majority of the country celebrated Rasputin’s death, the Romanovs continued to mourn him.

00:20:49.653 --> 00:20:54.193
This only made the public hate the Royal family even more.

00:20:54.193 --> 00:21:01.613
To the Bolsheviks and their supporters, Rasputin had represented the corruption of the monarchy.

00:21:02.623 --> 00:21:07.373
While they might have hated him personally, his murder was seen as a desperate

00:21:07.413 --> 00:21:12.793
attempt by the elite to hold onto power at the expense of the working class.

00:21:13.793 --> 00:21:18.513
Put another way, he was killed by some of the richest and most powerful men

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:23.653
in Russia in an attempt to save the Romanov dynasty and stop the revolution.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:28.973
Although Rasputin might have been killed to maintain order

00:21:29.193 --> 00:21:33.937
and to keep the monarchy intact, his murder did the opposite.

00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:38.803
It only served to make people more angry and was yet another

00:21:38.813 --> 00:21:43.503
reason to take action against the Romanovs, once and for all.

00:21:44.163 --> 00:21:51.513
And in March of 1917, just over two months after Rasputin’s death and after a series

00:21:51.523 --> 00:21:58.768
of strikes and protests, Nicholas was forced to step down from his position as tsar.

00:21:59.363 --> 00:22:03.243
Rasputin’s body was dug up and burned by Soviet

00:22:03.243 --> 00:22:06.733
soldiers so that his grave could not become a shrine.

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:15.473
He was a controversial and polarising figure both in life and death and his legacy continues today.

00:22:16.613 --> 00:22:23.543
Although he is mostly remembered outside Russia as the man who wouldn’t die, the mystery

00:22:23.643 --> 00:22:30.403
of his life and death has inspired stories all over the world, and has added yet another

00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:36.503
flavour, another vivid dimension, to the fascinating history of the Russian revolution.

00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:44.777
It’s interesting to wonder about the extent to which Rasputin influenced the fall of the Romanovs.

00:22:45.587 --> 00:22:50.613
Certainly it’s hard to make the argument that he did anything to help their

00:22:50.613 --> 00:22:57.323
survival, but quite how much importance he had in their downfall is up for debate.

00:22:58.223 --> 00:23:04.253
For some, he was merely an interesting character who had no real political power.

00:23:04.593 --> 00:23:11.633
A strange, mad peasant who simply existed and caused some controversy in high society.

00:23:12.723 --> 00:23:15.473
But for others, he was much more.

00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:20.743
When the Russian revolution ended, the Provisional Government leader

00:23:21.143 --> 00:23:26.643
Alexander Kerensky said, “Without Rasputin, there would have been no Lenin.”

00:23:28.283 --> 00:23:31.863
Whatever you think of Grigori Rasputin the man, it is

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:35.483
undeniable that the legend has gone down in history.

00:23:36.443 --> 00:23:43.303
Had his life gone another way, he might have remained a Russian peasant, farming his land,

00:23:43.663 --> 00:23:49.763
rarely leaving his village, and probably having the occasional wild night in Siberia.

00:23:50.573 --> 00:23:56.333
Instead, he set off for the capital, claimed to have cured the heir to the

00:23:56.333 --> 00:24:02.223
throne, seduced the Tsar, Tsarina, and hundreds if not thousands of other

00:24:02.223 --> 00:24:08.203
women in Russian high society, became the lover of many and the enemy of many

00:24:08.203 --> 00:24:14.673
more, and perhaps, just perhaps, changed the course of Russian history forever.

00:24:16.693 --> 00:24:20.033
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:24:20.363 --> 00:24:24.093
It is a fascinating story and there are plenty of tales

00:24:24.253 --> 00:24:27.503
about his life that we haven’t had the time to include today.

00:24:27.953 --> 00:24:32.733
So, I’d love to know, especially from the listeners in Russia, how

00:24:32.733 --> 00:24:37.203
important do you think Rasputin was in the story of modern Russia?

00:24:37.703 --> 00:24:41.911
How would Russian history have been different without him, if at all?

00:24:42.623 --> 00:24:43.783
I would love to know.

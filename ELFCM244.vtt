Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:17.994
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:22.394
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:28.324
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Scandalous

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:34.644
Life of Lord Byron, the man known as “mad, bad, and dangerous to know”.

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:41.364
Imagine a young man indulging in all sorts of vice, experimenting with

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:46.464
sexuality in all ways possible, breaking all the norms of his time,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:51.984
and being celebrated for his genius yet hated for his wild lifestyle.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:58.124
This is not a fictional character we are talking about here but a real-life

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:05.224
hero – a poet unmasking society’s hypocrisy, an actor playing a self-chosen

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:10.884
role, and a creative and freethinking intellectual way ahead of his time.

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:17.784
Lord Byron – the lover, the poet, the celebrity, and the cripple, lived just 36 years.

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:22.584
He left a legacy of words, men, women, lovers and

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:26.324
children, and today we are going to tell his story.

00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:32.473
OK then, the Scandalous Life of Lord Byron.

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:42.793
Lord Byron or George Gordon Byron was born with a lame foot, called a clubfoot, in 1788, in England.

00:01:44.223 --> 00:01:50.483
His father, Captain John was a wild but handsome man who lived up to

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:56.233
his nickname of “Mad Jack”, squandering, that is foolishly spending,

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:01.933
the money of his Scottish wife, Catherine Gordon who was a rich heiress.

00:02:03.403 --> 00:02:08.223
The family’s fortune dwindled, it reduced, to such a point that

00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:12.533
Catherine, accompanied by baby George and eventually, her husband,

00:02:12.813 --> 00:02:18.153
had to move from London to Aberdeen, in the far northeast of Scotland.

00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:25.223
Byron the child lived in near poverty in the far northern city.

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:32.343
Within a year, his father had deserted the family, moving to France and dying a year later.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:41.233
However, it was not George Gordon Byron’s destiny to remain penniless, to remain poor, in Scotland.

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:48.153
In 1798, when he was just 10 years old, an unexpected turn of

00:02:48.153 --> 00:02:52.793
events added the title of ‘Lord’ before the young boy’s name.

00:02:53.643 --> 00:03:00.643
His great-uncle died, leaving ten-year-old George an enormous fortune, a large amount of

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:07.483
money, the magnificent house of Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, and his title, “Lord”.

00:03:08.743 --> 00:03:13.213
The young boy was now a Lord, and he was spectacularly wealthy.

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:21.443
The mother-son duo moved back down to England to live a very comfortable life there.

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:26.813
This huge house, Newstead Abbey, was then in a state of disrepair.

00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:33.333
It was very Gothic-looking with large ghostly halls and spacious ruins.

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:39.783
Byron reportedly adored it and it no doubt inspired his later works.

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:47.713
George - or the new Lord Byron - lived at the abbey for a short time before

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:54.273
enrolling at Harrow – a famous boys-only public school on the outskirts of London.

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:59.233
You might be surprised to discover now that someone with

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:02.743
such a wonderful mind as Byron’s did not do well at school.

00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:10.213
Indeed, he dropped out of Harrow aged only 15, but it wasn’t due to his academic performance.

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:17.363
It was because he had fallen in love, not just with an older woman, not just with a woman

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:23.703
who was also his distant cousin, but with a woman who was also engaged to someone else.

00:04:25.154 --> 00:04:29.764
This woman, Mary Chaworth, rejected him, and became,

00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:34.154
for him, an idealised symbol of unrequited love.

00:04:34.814 --> 00:04:38.344
Unrequited love means when someone doesn’t love you back.

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:44.624
It was Byron's first real rejection, but as we’ll discover,

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:49.674
attracting women wouldn’t be a continual problem for our protagonist.

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:52.744
Nor would attracting men, it would seem.

00:04:53.514 --> 00:05:00.294
He returned to Harrow school the following year, and was reported as having - and I'm quoting

00:05:00.294 --> 00:05:06.554
directly here - “violently passionate” homosexual relationships with at least two boys there.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:13.414
After Harrow, as would be traditional for men of his wealth and

00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:17.804
social class at the time, he went on to study at Cambridge University.

00:05:18.814 --> 00:05:26.444
Here, Byron seems to have fallen in love with a male chorister, a singer, John Edleston.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:31.734
Byron later wrote a number of poems about John, the man

00:05:31.904 --> 00:05:35.854
for whom he said his love was “pure” and “passionate”.

00:05:36.854 --> 00:05:42.464
While we might now see nothing strange about a man declaring his love for another man

00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:49.134
as “pure” and “passionate”, in the early 19th century it was a crime punishable by

00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:56.344
death, so admitting to it was a scandalous and dangerous thing for Byron to have done.

00:05:57.184 --> 00:06:01.424
But Lord Byron proved to be completely unafraid of scandal.

00:06:02.164 --> 00:06:08.354
While at university, Byron lived a pretty hedonistic life: boozing, that

00:06:08.354 --> 00:06:13.474
is drinking large amounts of alcohol, partying, taking drugs, and gambling.

00:06:14.764 --> 00:06:20.424
Because of these habits, he piled up enormous debts during his time at university.

00:06:21.404 --> 00:06:26.944
The other element of his student life was sleeping around, having casual

00:06:26.944 --> 00:06:33.854
sex, and in Byron’s case both men and women were fair game, he was bisexual.

00:06:34.554 --> 00:06:38.534
And he was never short of admirers, both men and women.

00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:44.734
Now, it’s worth noting that, especially for aristocratic young men of

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:49.494
this time, having sexual relationships with other men wouldn’t have been

00:06:49.494 --> 00:06:55.524
considered particularly unusual, especially at male-only boarding schools.

00:06:56.424 --> 00:07:00.954
But the difference was that Lord Byron did nothing to try to hide it.

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:06.904
Indeed, he had a certain disregard for the rules - he liked disobeying

00:07:06.914 --> 00:07:12.424
authority, and going against any norms or rules that he came across.

00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:20.194
Famously, when he was a student at Cambridge University, he kept a bear as a pet.

00:07:20.984 --> 00:07:23.654
You might be thinking that it’s a slightly strange

00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:27.074
animal to keep, but there was a certain logic to it.

00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:35.244
The university forbade him from keeping a pet dog on the premises, but as there

00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:40.364
was no mention of bears in the rule books, Byron decided he could keep a bear.

00:07:41.184 --> 00:07:47.324
And as there was no university law about bears, the university couldn't technically stop him.

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:54.804
Now, this interest in exotic animals will be a theme throughout his life, and in later

00:07:54.804 --> 00:08:02.194
years, Byron’s homes would become more like zoos, with all kinds of exotic creatures

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:09.094
walking in and out, and monkeys and peacocks often accompanying him on his travels.

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:18.694
Byron made his “first dash into poetry", his first real attempt at poetry, when he was 12 years old.

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:24.524
A passion for his cousin, Margaret Parker, had caused him to put pen

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:29.614
to paper, and by the time he was at Cambridge, he was a published poet.

00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:35.054
The young Byron had befriended a female writer friend of his

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:38.954
mother's who had encouraged him to publish his first poetry.

00:08:39.504 --> 00:08:43.144
His first volume was printed when he was just 17.

00:08:43.434 --> 00:08:45.784
It was called Fugitive Pieces.

00:08:46.684 --> 00:08:55.214
However, a vicar got rather upset about its lustful verses, inspired, it seems by Mary Chaworth,

00:08:55.494 --> 00:09:03.041
his second object of desire, and the books ended up being recalled from the printers and burned.

00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:10.561
Moving back to his personal life, up until now, the life of Lord Byron had been quite

00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:17.821
exciting and full of sexual exploits, but it was nothing compared to what was to come.

00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:26.371
The true scandalous journey of Lord Byron began when he, accompanied by his university

00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:33.121
friend, John Hobhouse, and their many servants, set off on a Grand Tour across Europe.

00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:38.721
The Grand Tour, by the way, was a tour of mainly Italy that

00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:42.851
young, aristocratic British men would go on in the 18th century.

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:50.061
There is an entire episode of this podcast on it, it's episode number 156, if you’re interested.

00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:57.171
At that time, Byron was practically penniless, he had spent all of the money that

00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:03.221
he had inherited, and his expenses far outweighed any income he made from poetry.

00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:10.381
He paid for his trip by taking on even more debt; a lack of readily available

00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:14.651
money was not the sort of thing to stop Lord Byron from seeking adventure.

00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:22.441
So, he did, first in Portugal, then Spain, Gibraltar, Sardinia, Malta and Greece.

00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:28.641
Because of his aristocratic title, he expected to be greeted

00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.401
with a royal gun salute when his ship arrived in Malta.

00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:38.771
While the rest of the passengers disembarked, they got off the ship, he remained on the boat.

00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:47.191
When night fell and no salute had been given, Byron reluctantly accepted to be rowed to shore.

00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:54.781
In Albania, he spent time with the fear-inducing ruler, Ali Pasha of Ioannina.

00:10:55.971 --> 00:11:03.851
Despite Ali Pasha’s reputation as being ferocious and brutal, he welcomed Byron with open arms.

00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:08.871
Some historians are convinced of sexual relations between the two.

00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:14.471
Byron fell in love with Greece, finding the people unreserved

00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:20.011
and morally tolerant, in stark contrast to 19th century England.

00:11:20.801 --> 00:11:27.121
In Athens, he formed a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy, Nicolo Giraud.

00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:32.901
He also formed an unhealthy attachment to a 12-year-old girl, Teresa

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:39.173
Makri, for whom he wrote a poem about and attempted to buy for £500.

00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:43.871
As a reminder, at this time Byron is 22 years old.

00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:50.541
They say travel broadens the mind, and it certainly impacted Byron’s poetry.

00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:57.811
He wrote a semi-autobiographical poem, full of regret about wasting his youth in

00:11:58.131 --> 00:12:04.721
useless vice and sin, but having a chance to reform and transform through pilgrimage.

00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:10.851
His hero was the characteristic moody figure of the Romantic period,

00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:16.121
blessed with good looks and a tendency to question society's norms.

00:12:16.761 --> 00:12:19.971
This hero was, of course, how he saw himself.

00:12:20.731 --> 00:12:24.711
This poem was called Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, and it

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:28.621
was the poem that would make Lord Byron famous overnight.

00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:37.061
The Grand Tour over, Byron returned to England in 1811, after two years travelling around Europe.

00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:44.061
He had never accepted the societal norms of England, but his acquaintance with

00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:50.271
foreign societies of relaxed cultures made him even more bold and experimental.

00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.311
By the time he returned, he was a celebrity.

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:59.391
And he said, “I awoke one morning and found myself famous.”

00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:07.131
With the enormous fame came many wanted and some unwanted advances from women.

00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:12.811
He started affairs with married women, their daughters, and even their maids.

00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:16.881
He was famous, chased, loved, and desired.

00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:24.141
One sexual conquest after another, Byron did not commit to a single woman or man for that matter.

00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:31.811
But he deeply mourned his chorister lover, John Eddleston, who died of consumption in that year.

00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:37.221
He wrote a love poem for him, concealing John’s name with a woman’s name.

00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:44.801
Now, this episode would last several hours if we were to detail every one of his

00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:51.401
romantic relationships, but here are a few that were fundamental to his life and legacy.

00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:59.511
One was an aristocrat called Lady Caroline Lamb, a Gothic writer who would visit Byron

00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:07.111
dressed up as a boy and who famously described Byron as ‘mad, bad, and dangerous to know’.

00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:14.561
Sure, she was married, but that was far from scandalous compared to what was next.

00:14:15.651 --> 00:14:23.001
In 1813, when he was 25, he started an affair with a lady called Augusta Leigh.

00:14:23.851 --> 00:14:27.491
She was also married, but that wasn’t the main problem.

00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:34.161
The problem was that she was his half-sister from his father’s first marriage!

00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:41.351
If you were rich or famous enough, you could perhaps get away with alcoholism and

00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:47.771
drugs, which Byron would consume in vast quantities, and even homosexual relations.

00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:52.941
However, incest was another matter altogether.

00:14:53.231 --> 00:14:58.081
You couldn’t bed your half-sister and get away with it and Byron knew it.

00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:01.201
He did all he could to hide the affair.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:07.721
Augusta even gave birth to a daughter, Medora, who was rumoured to be Byron’s.

00:15:09.391 --> 00:15:14.621
Byron was now both needing to shut down the rumours of incest as well as

00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:21.521
drowning in debt, so he decided to propose to a rich heiress, Annabella Milbanke.

00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:26.911
She rejected him at first, which must have come as quite a shock.

00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:31.661
He wasn’t used to rejection, and so he persevered in his

00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:36.531
attempts to seduce Annabella, who finally agreed to marry him.

00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:42.421
They got married in 1815, but that didn’t mean that he

00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:45.931
packed in his, that he stopped, his scandalous ways.

00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:50.321
He took his wife to visit Augusta, his half-sister.

00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:54.691
While Augusta’s husband was away, Byron and Augusta

00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:58.861
shared a bed, while Annabella slept alone in a guest room.

00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:04.471
And it wasn’t like Byron was loyal only to his lover - he

00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:07.641
continued to sleep with other men and women throughout.

00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:15.321
Annabella, his wife, understandably found it to be too much, she considered

00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:21.421
him insane, and filed for divorce after the birth of their daughter, Ada.

00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:28.111
Ada, by the way, Byron’s daughter, was Ada Lovelace, the famous mathematician.

00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:34.181
We have another episode just on her, it’s episode number 153 if you’re interested.

00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:41.911
Ada was a genius in her own right, although it is slightly ironic that her genius was

00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:49.441
of a logical, mathematical type, whereas her father’s was completely chaotic and poetic.

00:16:50.431 --> 00:16:55.191
Now, going back to Byron, though, once his incest with his

00:16:55.201 --> 00:17:00.141
half-sister became public information, the country turned against him.

00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:05.411
He had no money, friends deserted him, and some of

00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:09.611
his previous lovers joined hands to discredit him.

00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:17.095
Disheartened by the moral outrage, in 1816, aged 28,

00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:21.831
Byron went into exile, never to return to England.

00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:26.181
Life gave him another chance to travel and explore.

00:17:26.801 --> 00:17:29.691
Broke as he was, he still travelled in great style.

00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:35.221
Although most of his London possessions were seized by bailiffs,

00:17:35.531 --> 00:17:39.771
he had managed to escape in his coach so was not without luxury.

00:17:41.211 --> 00:17:44.651
The coach had couches and a luxurious bedroom.

00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:50.181
Meanwhile, his servants and luggage followed behind in another carriage.

00:17:50.411 --> 00:17:54.831
There was also a peacock, a monkey and a dog in the travelling party.

00:17:56.091 --> 00:18:02.051
Byron was accompanied by his personal doctor who had been paid a princely sum of

00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:08.531
£500 from a publisher to write a secret diary of the poet’s scandalous adventures.

00:18:09.251 --> 00:18:11.801
This book, by the way, was later burned.

00:18:13.723 --> 00:18:19.453
During his travels, Byron befriended the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley who was on the

00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:25.503
run from his own wife, Shelley’s 18-year old mistress Mary, who would become Mary

00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:31.833
Shelley, and spent time with Mary’s half-sister, Claire Clairmont with whom Byron

00:18:31.953 --> 00:18:37.383
had had an affair back in London and was actually pregnant with his child, Allegra.

00:18:38.803 --> 00:18:40.963
The weather that summer was awful.

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:46.113
This was because a volcanic ash cloud had stolen the sun from

00:18:46.113 --> 00:18:50.903
much of Europe, leading to almost constant rain and thunderstorms.

00:18:52.183 --> 00:18:58.893
In this atmospheric setting, and high on wine and opium, the new friends wrote

00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:05.213
gothic horror stories together, most famously Frankenstein, before parting company.

00:19:06.303 --> 00:19:09.803
Byron spent the winter of 1816 in Venice.

00:19:09.913 --> 00:19:14.273
The somewhat liberal Italian morals suited his temperament.

00:19:14.803 --> 00:19:18.043
And, of course, the womanising continued.

00:19:18.473 --> 00:19:23.473
He claimed to sleep with over 200 women during his two-year stay there,

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:28.883
writing that "some of them are Countesses - and some of them Cobbler’s

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:34.503
wives - some noble - some middling - some low - and all whores."

00:19:35.803 --> 00:19:41.023
The travelling and new sexual experiences ignited his creativity.

00:19:41.303 --> 00:19:45.273
He completed another part of Harold’s Pilgrimage and

00:19:45.473 --> 00:19:50.353
composed Beppo, a poem comparing English and Italian customs.

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:58.803
Among his many mistresses in Venice were Marianna Segati, the wife of his landlord and

00:19:58.943 --> 00:20:05.623
Margarita Cogni, the wife of a local baker who left her husband and moved in with Byron.

00:20:06.573 --> 00:20:13.723
Apparently, his and Cogni’s fighting got so bad, Byron would sleep the night in a gondola.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:20.563
After he asked her to leave, she dramatically threw herself into the canal in Venice.

00:20:21.693 --> 00:20:25.793
His sexual adventures in Venice and Rome inspired

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:29.333
him to write one of his most famous poems, Don Juan.

00:20:30.773 --> 00:20:37.273
Penned as a story of an uncultured man who was easily seduced by women, the poem is

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:43.313
also a commentary on the absurdities and hypocrisies of societal norms and culture.

00:20:44.513 --> 00:20:50.623
Byron was visited by his old friend Shelley in 1818, who found him

00:20:50.923 --> 00:20:56.513
growing fat, with unkempt hair, and drowning in sexual promiscuity.

00:20:57.623 --> 00:21:05.413
It is then that Byron gave up what he called “miscellaneous harlotry,” he settled for the “strictest

00:21:05.423 --> 00:21:13.173
adultery” with Countess Teresa Guiccioli – an 18-year-old girl married to a man three times her age.

00:21:14.113 --> 00:21:19.093
In the course of their relationship, Teresa gave some order to his life.

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:26.203
He lived in Ravenna, in central Italy, for two years just to be close to Teresa.

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:32.093
Byron’s home in Ravenna was described by Shelley as having ten horses,

00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:36.663
eight enormous dogs, three monkeys, five cats, an eagle, a crow,

00:21:36.673 --> 00:21:41.423
a falcon, five peacocks, two guinea hens, and an Egyptian crane.

00:21:42.323 --> 00:21:45.853
All of these, said Shelley, except the horses, walked

00:21:45.863 --> 00:21:48.215
about the house as if they were the masters of it.

00:21:49.529 --> 00:21:54.103
Teresa and Byron became inseparable, following each other

00:21:54.103 --> 00:21:58.323
to different cities and leaving a trail of rumours behind.

00:21:59.143 --> 00:22:05.413
However, tragically, Teresa was forced to leave Byron to save her father from exile.

00:22:06.913 --> 00:22:10.493
Soon after, Byron looked for a new adventure.

00:22:11.803 --> 00:22:18.133
Revisiting his old Romantic dream of helping the Greeks gain independence, he left for Cephalonia.

00:22:19.483 --> 00:22:26.343
His lavish and active imagination again came into play and he spent £4,000 to

00:22:26.343 --> 00:22:31.433
design grand army costumes for the Greeks, preparing the fleet for the sea.

00:22:32.273 --> 00:22:39.083
He joined forces with Prince Aléxandros Mavrokordátos, a leader representing western Greece.

00:22:39.883 --> 00:22:44.383
However, he found the Greeks divided even among themselves.

00:22:44.683 --> 00:22:50.313
He talked to rival factions to reach an agreement between them, but it didn’t work.

00:22:51.173 --> 00:22:56.193
He invested what would be millions of Euros in today’s money into the cause,

00:22:56.543 --> 00:23:01.573
funding troops and helping both Muslim and Christian victims of the war.

00:23:02.463 --> 00:23:08.153
He took the rebel army under his own command, despite his lack of military experience.

00:23:08.563 --> 00:23:15.003
He was welcomed as a semi-Messiah figure and there is no doubt this fed his ego.

00:23:15.913 --> 00:23:23.093
The ‘mad, bad and dangerous to know’ poet developed a sort of national hero status in Greece,

00:23:23.133 --> 00:23:28.873
and there were commentators at the time that said he could have become King of Greece.

00:23:29.373 --> 00:23:31.813
But his behaviour was erratic.

00:23:32.103 --> 00:23:35.593
There was speculation that he was going mad and showing

00:23:35.593 --> 00:23:39.743
symptoms of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis.

00:23:40.673 --> 00:23:46.743
Others think he was actually just a deeply impassioned man who fought for what he loved.

00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:50.693
He had said years before, “If I am a poet...

00:23:50.973 --> 00:23:53.093
the air of Greece has made me one.”

00:23:54.313 --> 00:23:58.093
However, it was here while preparing for a revolution

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:03.393
that his life was cut short, and he died aged just 36.

00:24:03.823 --> 00:24:09.153
He had got very wet while out riding, and then afterwards became feverish.

00:24:09.673 --> 00:24:16.023
He died as he had lived, in dramatic fashion, with lightning flashing all around him.

00:24:17.123 --> 00:24:22.023
His body was delivered back to England but it was denied burial

00:24:22.113 --> 00:24:26.173
in Westminster Abbey because of his ‘questionable morality’.

00:24:27.223 --> 00:24:32.703
Now, say or think what you want about Lord Byron, he was clearly a man

00:24:32.803 --> 00:24:37.963
who lived life to its fullest, and left a mark on everyone he came across.

00:24:39.553 --> 00:24:46.710
He fell headfirst into a life of scandal, rebelling against and exposing what he saw as

00:24:46.946 --> 00:24:53.663
Britain’s hypocrisy, carefully concealed under the many prim and proper conventions of the day.

00:24:54.183 --> 00:24:57.403
He really became the first rock-star poet.

00:24:58.103 --> 00:25:04.113
He had his drama, his hedonism, his radical ideas, and his rudeness,

00:25:04.143 --> 00:25:08.733
but he also had his genius, which was way ahead of his time.

00:25:09.343 --> 00:25:14.603
So let me just finish with a short quote from one of his poems:

00:25:16.033 --> 00:25:19.703
“There are four questions of value in life, Don Octavio.

00:25:20.383 --> 00:25:21.583
What is sacred?

00:25:22.193 --> 00:25:24.173
Of what is the spirit made?

00:25:24.783 --> 00:25:29.113
What is worth living for and what is worth dying for?

00:25:30.053 --> 00:25:32.713
The answer to each is the same.

00:25:34.063 --> 00:25:35.063
Only love.”

00:25:38.023 --> 00:25:43.543
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Scandalous Life of Lord Byron.

Hero, villain, or somewhere in between?

00:25:57.803 --> 00:26:01.423
And especially for the Italians and Greeks among you,

00:26:01.773 --> 00:26:05.413
how do people in your country remember him, if at all?

00:26:05.883 --> 00:26:07.053

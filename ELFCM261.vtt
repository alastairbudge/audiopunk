Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:16.514
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:20.644
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:25.744
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The

00:00:25.744 --> 00:00:30.534
Prohibition Era, the thirteen-year period in the early 20th century

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:34.624
when alcohol was made illegal in the United States of America.

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:42.064
It is an amazing period of time, one where a society tried to outlaw a drug that people had been

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:48.224
using for thousands of years, with the intention of making modern society into a better place.

00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:54.184
We’ll start by looking at why prohibition was introduced, what actually happened

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:59.714
from a practical point of view, how what happened compared to what the authorities

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:05.034
thought would happen, when and why prohibition was repealed, how drinking habits

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:10.704
have changed since then, and ask ourselves what, if anything, we can take from this.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:14.154
Ok then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:22.794
As of 2022, there are only 14 countries in the entire world where alcohol is illegal.

00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:29.724
These tend to be majority-Muslim countries, where alcohol is banned for religious reasons.

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:35.474
So, for those of us who live in a country where alcohol is legal, which is

00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:40.924
of course most of the world, a useful exercise might be to imagine if one

00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:46.844
day all alcohol was banned, and it became a criminal offence to sell alcohol.

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:52.384
Now, it doesn’t matter whether you personally never drink a drop of alcohol,

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:57.154
or you are the sort of person who can frequently be found at your local bar or

00:01:57.214 --> 00:02:03.224
pub, it’s clear that a ban on alcohol would lead to a very different society.

00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:09.684
It might be better, it might be worse, but you can certainly agree that it would be different.

00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:17.374
In 19th century America, there was a growing movement of people who believed that removing alcohol

00:02:17.514 --> 00:02:23.514
from society would make life better for everyone, a movement called the “Temperance Movement”.

00:02:24.614 --> 00:02:31.154
This movement was spearheaded, it was led by women, women who had often seen the

00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:36.834
devastating effects that drinking alcohol had on their husbands and male family members.

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:43.734
From domestic abuse to losing their jobs, getting in accidents or fights, there was

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:48.734
a growing movement of women who were simply fed up with their husbands’ drinking

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:53.489
habits, and started putting pressure on the government to do something about it.

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:58.824
Especially in the early 19th century, the average American

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:03.214
man drank like a fish, he consumed a lot of alcohol.

00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:11.364
Alcohol was deeply ingrained in society, and heavy drinking was the expectation for male behaviour.

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:19.194
There’s a great section in a book called “Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition”, by Daniel

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:25.624
Okrent, where he describes a dinner hosted by the governor of New York for the French Ambassador.

00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:34.754
During one evening for 120 guests, they drank ‘135 bottles of madeira, 36

00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:41.124
bottles of port, 60 bottles of English beer and 30 large cups of rum punch.’

00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:42.224
A lot, right?

00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:49.444
By the 1830s alcohol consumption per capita, per person, reached

00:03:49.594 --> 00:03:55.924
a whopping 31 litres of pure alcohol every year, which is about 80

00:03:55.954 --> 00:04:02.244
bottles of whisky, 260 bottles of wine, or 800 beers every single year.

00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:08.604
And that’s on average, so let’s not forget that it would be men, not

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:13.854
women, that were doing most of the drinking, and, like today, some people

00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:18.334
would be drinking significantly more than this already very high average.

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:25.234
Americans were drinking a lot, and as no doubt you don’t need me to say, drinking this

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:30.984
amount of alcohol isn’t generally a good idea for leading a healthy and productive life.

00:04:31.394 --> 00:04:34.344
The women’s complaints were certainly justified.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:39.274
One woman in particular took things into her own hands.

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:46.114
Her name was Carrie Nation, and she would later be given the nickname of “Hatchet Granny”.

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:51.924
A hatchet is a kind of axe, and the reason she was given this nickname

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:56.744
was because she would go from bar to bar with this axe and smash

00:04:56.914 --> 00:05:02.784
everything up, smash up bottles, bars, every sign of alcohol she found.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:11.764
She would recite Bible verses as she did this, but her anti-alcohol views were not only religious,

00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:19.444
they were also personal; she lost her first husband to alcohol-related diseases, a mere one

00:05:19.474 --> 00:05:25.704
and a half years after they were married, leaving her with no support and a 6-month-old child.

00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:31.824
But this anti-alcohol sentiment wasn’t just a fringe belief,

00:05:31.844 --> 00:05:36.004
something felt by women with alcoholic and abusive husbands.

00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:42.724
Moving towards the end of the 19th century, alcohol was increasingly believed, and presented,

00:05:42.924 --> 00:05:48.994
to be responsible for a large proportion of society’s ills, from health problems to crime.

00:05:50.034 --> 00:05:53.504
If you were a business or factory owner, the message was

00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:56.834
that alcohol was making your employees less productive.

00:05:57.614 --> 00:06:00.724
If they didn’t drink so much, they would be able to work

00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:03.904
more efficiently and you would be able to make more money.

00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:12.154
If you were a factory worker, the message was that alcohol was a tool used by the ruling class

00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:19.324
to subjugate you, it was a capitalist ploy to stop you from rising up against the ruling class.

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:26.094
Das Kapital had been published in 1867, its first English-language translation

00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:32.154
came out in 1887, and there was a small but growing workers-rights movement.

00:06:33.114 --> 00:06:38.854
From a public safety point of view, the toll that alcohol was taking was clear to see.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:44.794
Bar fights, accidents caused by drunkenness, domestic abuse, and all

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:49.214
of the sorts of problems exacerbated by alcohol that still exist today.

00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:54.274
Similarly, from a public health point of view, the health dangers

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:59.104
of heavy drinking were similar 150 years ago to what they are today.

00:06:59.744 --> 00:07:06.284
Drinking heavily causes all sorts of health problems and often takes alcoholics to an early grave.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:12.894
Now, picture this, a country barely 100 years old with a growing alcohol problem.

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:17.774
A country that was founded as an escape from the old, European

00:07:17.774 --> 00:07:21.994
ideals, and a country where anything was considered to be possible.

00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:27.764
A country that prided itself on freedom, where literally the first amendment to its

00:07:27.764 --> 00:07:33.824
constitution guarantees certain freedoms still not given to citizens of every country.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:39.944
So, what would happen if this country, in a bold attempt to reshape

00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:45.114
its trajectory, removed the freedom from its citizens to drink alcohol?

00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:50.524
It would be a radical act, but America was a radical country.

00:07:51.594 --> 00:07:58.004
Its decision to do so was expedited, or sped up, by the First World War in Europe.

00:07:58.964 --> 00:08:06.524
Firstly, as beer, or lager, was seen as a German drink, it became unpatriotic to drink

00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:11.844
the national drink of the country that your allies, and later you, were fighting against.

00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:17.935
You might have thought this would have meant that people switched to stronger alcohols,

00:08:18.044 --> 00:08:25.514
wines and spirits, but in late 1918, in fact after the Armistice, after the end of the war,

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:33.691
the US Congress passed an act banning the sale of alcoholic beverages stronger than 1.28%.

00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:39.934
The objective of this was to conserve grain for food, rather than alcohol.

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:45.994
In case you need a point of comparison, beer is typically between

00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:53.714
4 and 5%, wine is more like 11 to 13% and spirits are around 40%.

00:08:54.394 --> 00:08:59.504
So, essentially only very, very weak alcohol was allowed to be sold.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:05.944
This wartime act was followed shortly after, on January 16th of

00:09:05.944 --> 00:09:12.034
1919, by a vote to ban the manufacture, transport and sale of

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:17.504
alcohol, but importantly it did not make drinking alcohol illegal.

00:09:17.984 --> 00:09:21.474
The importance of this point will become clear soon enough.

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:26.364
Another important point to note is the definition of alcohol.

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:34.194
To many people, even to those advocating for a ban on alcohol, it came as a surprise

00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:41.174
that the act included all alcohol, not only spirits, as many had previously assumed.

00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:45.604
Many people had thought that beer and wine would still be allowed.

00:09:46.414 --> 00:09:50.514
This was an extreme move, not just a ban on hard

00:09:50.564 --> 00:09:54.944
liquor, but a ban on all liquor for public consumption.

00:09:55.884 --> 00:10:01.214
The country had chosen to go “dry”, but there was another important point to

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:07.614
note: the act wouldn’t come into effect until a year later, giving people plenty

00:10:07.614 --> 00:10:13.484
of time to get ready and plenty of time to figure out ways to get around the law.

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:20.204
It turned out that there would be plenty of loopholes, plenty of ways to get around the law.

00:10:21.764 --> 00:10:27.134
So it was that on January 17th of 1920, Prohibition,

00:10:27.474 --> 00:10:31.394
otherwise known as the Volstead Act, went into effect.

00:10:32.144 --> 00:10:39.204
The manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol over 0.5% was banned.

00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:44.144
Saloons, old-fashioned bars, had to close their doors forever.

00:10:44.614 --> 00:10:47.424
Distilleries and breweries were closed.

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:50.804
Imports of beer, wine and spirits were banned.

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:53.314
But did the drinking stop?

00:10:53.864 --> 00:10:55.334
Well, not completely.

00:10:55.804 --> 00:11:01.674
The nature of drinking, and the alcohol industry just changed, and the fact that

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:08.644
alcohol was now illegal opened the doors for small and big-time criminals to emerge.

00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:16.404
On a small-time level, as the production of alcohol was now illegal, people who brewed their

00:11:16.444 --> 00:11:23.324
own beer at home purely for personal consumption were suddenly criminalised, they were outlaws.

00:11:24.234 --> 00:11:29.524
On a more organised level, Prohibition created an environment where the production,

00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:35.877
transportation and sale of alcohol suddenly became an incredibly profitable activity.

00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:41.457
The 1920s gave rise to criminals such as Al Capone, whose

00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:45.307
primary source of income was the bootlegged alcohol trade.

00:11:46.257 --> 00:11:53.487
The loopholes and problems with the Prohibition legislation provided a huge incentive to turn

00:11:53.487 --> 00:12:00.917
to crime, and turned many people from honest, law-abiding citizens into hardened criminals.

00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:08.597
One particular example of this was a criminal defence lawyer named George Remus.

00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:13.477
When he saw that his clients had become incredibly wealthy

00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:17.117
by selling alcohol, he wanted a piece of the action.

00:12:17.957 --> 00:12:24.287
Using his legal background, he studied the Volstead Act, the Prohibition Act, and realised

00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:30.687
not only that pharmacies were able to sell alcohol for medical purposes, but that there

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:36.477
were large amounts of spirits, of hard liquor, sitting in government distilleries.

00:12:37.537 --> 00:12:43.587
Remus just needed to figure out a way of getting his hands on this alcohol and selling it

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:50.137
to people who wanted to use it for, well let’s just say not technically medical purposes.

00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:57.117
Remus bought up a series of distilleries, but he couldn’t just take the alcohol and sell it.

00:12:57.417 --> 00:13:01.177
He needed to figure out a way of getting it out legally,

00:13:01.637 --> 00:13:04.897
or at least make it look like he was still obeying the law.

00:13:05.507 --> 00:13:10.687
So, he also bought pharmacies and transportation companies, and would

00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:15.697
arrange for his pharmacies to buy alcohol from his distilleries, and

00:13:15.697 --> 00:13:19.487
the alcohol would be transported by his transportation companies.

00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:26.727
Then, when the alcohol was in transit, when it was being transported, the trucks would

00:13:26.737 --> 00:13:32.137
be held up, they would be mysteriously robbed, and all the alcohol would disappear.

00:13:32.877 --> 00:13:36.417
The robbers were, of course, Remus’s own men.

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:43.777
At one point Remus controlled 30% of all of the illegal alcohol in the United

00:13:43.777 --> 00:13:48.737
States, and over the course of just three years it’s thought that he made

00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:54.047
$40 million dollars, which is over half a billion dollars in today’s money.

00:13:54.927 --> 00:13:57.917
People were clearly still drinking alcohol.

00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:04.287
As you might expect, finding any kind of reliable statistics on alcohol consumption

00:14:04.447 --> 00:14:10.287
from this period is difficult, but one study suggested that consumption dropped

00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:16.277
to 30% of its pre-Prohibition levels immediately after prohibition was put into

00:14:16.277 --> 00:14:24.027
place, but shortly after it returned to between 60-70% of pre-Prohibition levels.

00:14:24.957 --> 00:14:30.077
The public saloons might have closed, but they were replaced by things called

00:14:30.157 --> 00:14:35.947
“speakeasies”, illegal bars where you might have to knock on the door and provide

00:14:35.947 --> 00:14:42.427
a code word to get in, then you’d be let in and the alcohol would be free flowing.

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:47.107
Remember, there had been a year’s time between the vote

00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:50.807
for Prohibition and the act actually coming into effect.

00:14:51.217 --> 00:14:59.087
This year provided plenty of time for bars and clubs to prepare, and many stockpiled alcohol

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:04.527
in advance, they bought huge amounts of alcohol that would last them for several years.

00:15:05.327 --> 00:15:09.227
The fact that these bars were unlicensed meant that anyone

00:15:09.227 --> 00:15:12.367
could start one because, well, there were no licences.

00:15:12.947 --> 00:15:18.397
All you needed to have was a room and someone to sell you alcohol, and as you’ll

00:15:18.397 --> 00:15:22.987
have gathered by now, there was no shortage of people willing to sell you alcohol.

00:15:23.817 --> 00:15:29.497
And of course, given that they were illegal, it’s hard to get an accurate estimate

00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:35.257
for the number of these speakeasy bars across the country, but one estimate has

00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:42.797
there being anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 speakeasy bars in New York City alone.

00:15:44.287 --> 00:15:51.367
As a point of comparison, now, when alcohol is legal, there are around 25,000 bars

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:57.287
in New York city, so even at the lower end of that estimate from Prohibition, there

00:15:57.287 --> 00:16:03.667
were more places serving alcohol when it was illegal than now, when it is legal.

00:16:04.557 --> 00:16:10.897
One major reason that alcohol continued to be so free flowing was that there were comparatively

00:16:11.207 --> 00:16:19.366
so few law enforcement officers dedicated to enforcing the Volstead Act, to enforcing Prohibition.

00:16:20.366 --> 00:16:26.386
At the start, there were only 1,500 police officers assigned to enforcing the

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:32.356
Prohibition law - a tiny amount compared to how many people continued to drink alcohol.

00:16:33.086 --> 00:16:39.196
Sure, there were prosecutions for alcohol-related offences, and people were sent to prison.

00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:45.456
But these cases ended up clogging up, filling up the court system and the

00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:50.256
jails, filling up the justice system with people who had become criminals

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:54.476
simply through doing something that was perfectly legal just a few years

00:16:54.476 --> 00:16:59.466
before, and to many people wasn’t considered to be a serious crime at all.

00:17:00.636 --> 00:17:06.566
It’s telling, it's revealing, that two of the biggest bootlegging criminals in the entire

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:13.856
country, Al Capone and George Remus, never served any prison time for alcohol-related crime.

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:18.596
In Capone’s case, he was sent to prison for tax evasion,

00:17:18.856 --> 00:17:22.626
and in Remus case he murdered his wife in broad daylight.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:27.816
Towards the end of the 1920s support for Prohibition

00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:31.556
had started to dwindle, it had reduced drastically.

00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:37.066
The promised new society of good health, low crime, reduced

00:17:37.076 --> 00:17:41.856
poverty and better economic prospects simply hadn’t emerged.

00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:44.476
And people were clearly still drinking.

00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:51.836
In fact, on an economic level, Prohibition is believed to have made the situation worse.

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:59.026
Tax revenues from alcohol previously made up almost 75% of state taxes in

00:17:59.026 --> 00:18:05.256
places like New York, and given that alcohol was illegal, this went to 0.

00:18:06.026 --> 00:18:09.356
As a result, it's thought that Prohibition cost the

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:13.778
federal government around $11 billion in lost taxes.

00:18:14.348 --> 00:18:20.718
And of course, anyone who previously worked in the sizable alcohol industry was out of a job.

00:18:21.838 --> 00:18:25.398
Then in 1929, the Great Depression hit.

00:18:25.818 --> 00:18:30.728
Millions were put out of work and tax revenues dipped even more.

00:18:31.698 --> 00:18:37.348
Still, Herbert Hoover, the sitting US president, resisted the suggestions of

00:18:37.358 --> 00:18:43.318
colleagues and aides to repeal Prohibition, to generate some much needed tax revenue,

00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:49.808
and give people a distraction from the realities of their grim economic situation.

00:18:50.978 --> 00:18:55.728
When the opportunity arose, the then governor of New York, Franklin D.

00:18:55.728 --> 00:19:01.328
Roosevelt, or FDR as he was known, decided to run for the US presidency

00:19:01.528 --> 00:19:07.458
against Hoover on a platform to repeal Prohibition, to legalise alcohol.

00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:13.708
And in the 1933 election Roosevelt won by a landslide,

00:19:13.998 --> 00:19:20.008
winning 42 of the 48 states, and 89% of the electoral vote.

00:19:21.018 --> 00:19:27.548
Hoover became the first US president to not win reelection, and by voting in

00:19:27.548 --> 00:19:33.468
FDR the country had delivered a clear message: we’ve had enough of Prohibition.

00:19:34.368 --> 00:19:41.388
In one of his first acts after becoming president, Roosevelt overturned Prohibition, and on December

00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:50.018
5th of 1933 the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol became legalised on a federal level.

00:19:50.798 --> 00:19:56.588
This 13-year period would become known as The Noble Experiment, a time when

00:19:56.618 --> 00:20:01.798
an entire country tried to see what would happen if alcohol was made illegal.

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:08.928
So, like after any experiment, let’s take a look at the hypothesis and the results.

00:20:09.498 --> 00:20:12.998
The hypothesis of this Noble Experiment was that it

00:20:12.998 --> 00:20:15.988
would have an all-round positive effect on society.

00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:20.748
It was believed that it would lead to a boom in sales of everything

00:20:20.748 --> 00:20:25.366
from household goods to clothing, as people had more disposable

00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:29.476
income now they were not spending money on booze, on alcohol.

00:20:30.016 --> 00:20:35.706
Fruit juice manufacturers, cinema owners, all sorts of business owners anticipated

00:20:35.736 --> 00:20:41.676
a bumper payday as people switched from alcohol to new forms of entertainment.

00:20:42.656 --> 00:20:47.816
There would be better workers rights, a more moral society, productivity would

00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:52.586
increase, accidents would decrease, people would be healthier and happier.

00:20:53.096 --> 00:20:56.376
All round, life would be better for everyone.

00:20:57.376 --> 00:21:02.556
An ambitious hypothesis, but unfortunately very little of it happened.

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:09.086
Anyone who was employed in the alcohol industry was suddenly out of a job, the

00:21:09.106 --> 00:21:14.816
tax revenues from alcohol evaporated, and people continued to drink alcohol,

00:21:15.106 --> 00:21:19.676
although now it was the criminal underworld that profited, not the government.

00:21:20.206 --> 00:21:26.146
On a health level, there was some positive news, with one study suggesting that the

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:34.296
occurrence of liver cirrhosis, which is a useful proxy for alcoholism, declined by 10-20%.

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:40.256
Good news, perhaps, but this reduction was replaced with injuries

00:21:40.276 --> 00:21:44.896
and deaths from illegally prepared alcohol, so-called “moonshine”.

00:21:45.986 --> 00:21:51.026
What’s more, the deaths and injuries from alcohol-related criminal activity

00:21:51.256 --> 00:21:57.832
skyrocketed, with violent crime in some states increasing anywhere between 30 and 60%.

00:21:58.282 --> 00:22:03.012
People might not be dying so frequently from alcohol-related illnesses,

00:22:03.152 --> 00:22:07.952
but they were dying from the bootlegger’s dodgy alcohol and their bullets.

00:22:08.992 --> 00:22:12.622
And on a cultural level related to drinking, the United

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:17.182
States didn’t simply return to how it was before Prohibition.

00:22:17.782 --> 00:22:24.392
Prohibition meant 13 years of a different type of bar, the speakeasy, a place very

00:22:24.392 --> 00:22:30.592
different from the traditionally macho saloon bar dominated by heavy drinking of spirits.

00:22:31.342 --> 00:22:36.972
Speakeasies were places with music and dancing, places were men and women,

00:22:37.032 --> 00:22:41.462
and people from different ethnicities and backgrounds could all mix.

00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:47.416
After the repeal of Prohibition, it became accepted for women to drink alcohol

00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:52.476
at bars, something that simply wasn’t accepted in pre-Prohibition society.

00:22:53.596 --> 00:22:58.606
In terms of how much people actually drank, after Prohibition was repealed

00:22:58.786 --> 00:23:04.346
alcohol consumption took a long time to regain its pre-Prohibition levels.

00:23:04.956 --> 00:23:10.836
Immediately after, the country was still in the middle of the greatest economic downturn in its

00:23:10.836 --> 00:23:18.123
short history, then it went straight into World War Two, and it wasn’t until the early 1970s

00:23:18.153 --> 00:23:24.573
that alcohol consumption surpassed, it overtook what it was immediately before Prohibition.

00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:31.523
Purely in terms of changing the country’s attitudes towards alcohol and the amount that people

00:23:31.733 --> 00:23:38.263
drink, Prohibition itself appears to have done very little to alter the amount that Americans drink.

00:23:38.993 --> 00:23:44.913
And when people look back at Prohibition now, it’s often considered a failure.

00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:51.623
If you take it at face value, and look at what it set out to achieve and what actually

00:23:51.623 --> 00:23:58.493
happened, yes, it failed to achieve this utopian society which its proponents had hoped for.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.820
But perhaps it taught the country another, more valuable lesson.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:11.770
That society is a complicated beast, and that it might be simple and convenient to point at

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:18.050
one thing in particular, whether that’s alcohol, drugs, or whichever political party is in

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:24.710
charge at the moment in time, and identify that thing as the root of all society’s problems.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:32.110
Yet as this 13-year Noble Experiment teaches its students, no matter what hypotheses

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:37.870
and predictions you might have, good intentions often lead to unexpected outcomes,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:43.640
and there is rarely such a thing as one solution to all society’s problems.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.210
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Prohibition Era.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.220
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:24:55.088 --> 00:24:58.268
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:24:58.548 --> 00:25:03.617
What do you think would happen in your country if Prohibition was proposed tomorrow?

00:25:04.027 --> 00:25:09.087
How do you think the effects would be different, or would they be exactly the same?

00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:16.287
And can you see a world where Prohibition, where the abolition of alcohol, is put into place again?

00:25:17.007 --> 00:25:20.627
I would love to know your thoughts, so let’s get this discussion started.

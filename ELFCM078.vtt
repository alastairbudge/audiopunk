Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:16.049
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.459
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:27.468
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about pirates.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.494
But not the old kind with swords, earrings and parrots.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:36.984
We are going to be talking about modern pirates, the kind

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:40.794
with speedboats, machine guns and night-vision goggles.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.830
We’ll be talking about where they come from, why pirates have suddenly re-emerged after piracy

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.990
not really being a problem for 200 years or so, and we’ll find out what pirates are doing in 2020.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.850
Before we get right into that though, let me just remind you that you

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.660
can get all of the bonus episodes, plus subtitles, transcripts, and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.940
key vocabulary, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.750
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.990
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:31.109
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.529
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:43.749
OK then, let’s get started, and get right into the fascinating topic of modern day pirates.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:52.099
Now, piracy, of course, has been around for thousands of years, in different shapes and forms.

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:58.959
For almost as long as there have been boats, there have been pirates, and there is evidence

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:06.379
of pirates going back to the 14th century BC, almost three and a half thousand years ago.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:14.209
Nowadays, the term piracy can be used for a whole variety of things - pirate

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.879
radio, pirate CDs, pirate video games, pirate music, and so on.

00:02:19.528 --> 00:02:24.138
But the subject of today’s episode is the more ‘traditional’ type of piracy,

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:30.228
of groups of people attacking other ships in order to steal their treasure.

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:36.736
And we’ll find out that although the pirates of the 21st century are ‘traditional’

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:43.236
in that their overall aim is similar to that of famous pirates like Redbeard or

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:49.546
Blackbeard, their reasons for turning to piracy and their methods are quite different.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:55.256
Now, you may well have heard about modern piracy, about where

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:58.746
it takes place, and how these pirates typically operate.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:04.753
The world hotspot for piracy in the 21st century, and where the

00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:09.213
majority of pirate attacks have taken place over the past 20 years or

00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:14.883
so, is off the coast of Somalia, to the east of the horn of Africa.

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:19.663
What you might not know though is the reasons for

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:23.806
this, and they are threefold, there are three of them.

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:33.236
Firstly, the Somali government collapsed in 1991, and the country was plunged into disarray.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:39.266
The navy was disbanded, and there was practically no rule of law.

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:44.256
This, of course, is in the potential pirate’s advantage.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:50.194
As a result of this, and secondly, the waters off the coast

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:54.804
of Somalia began to be heavily fished by foreign boats.

00:03:55.564 --> 00:04:01.964
Now, they weren’t actually allowed to do this, they were trespassing into Somali waters, and

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:07.864
they didn’t have the right to fish there, but as there was nobody to stop them, they continued.

00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:14.724
What had previously been a very fertile area for fishing quickly became overfished,

00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:20.644
and the local fishermen found that there weren’t nearly as many fish left for them.

00:04:22.144 --> 00:04:29.204
And finally, as there was no Somali navy, and effectively no police to control anything

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:36.964
that went on, foreign ships began to dump toxic waste in the water off Somalia.

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:43.374
They would bring rubbish from Europe, and just throw it overboard, or on the coast

00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:48.254
of Somalia, which by the way is the longest coastline in the whole of Africa.

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:53.954
It’s said that Italian companies with links to the mafia would take

00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:59.704
rubbish from Europe, then strike deals with Somali warlords to dump

00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:04.484
huge amounts of waste either in the sea, or on the Somali beaches.

00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:11.674
Some of this was highly toxic, and it’s thought that it also included nuclear waste.

00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:17.504
This led to people getting respiratory infections, mouth

00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:22.154
ulcers, skin infections, and all sorts of nasty things.

00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:30.504
This was exacerbated, it was made worse, after the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean.

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:36.354
While India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand were the worst

00:05:36.354 --> 00:05:40.637
hit, the tsunami also did some serious damage to Somalia.

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:48.767
And how this is relevant to our story is that it stirred up a lot of this toxic waste that had

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:55.217
been sitting at the bottom of the ocean, and it ended up polluting even more of the coastline.

00:05:56.717 --> 00:06:00.677
So, we have these three core factors going on.

00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:06.837
The lack of the rule of law, the overfishing, and the illegal waste dumping.

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:13.741
Combined with this, Somalia was, and still is, an incredibly poor country.

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:22.261
GDP per capita was $187 in 2010, which is 1% of the world’s average.

00:06:23.401 --> 00:06:26.604
You could say, it was ripe for piracy.

00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:34.034
However, you might be wondering, what does the overfishing and the rubbish have to do with it?

00:06:35.174 --> 00:06:40.668
Well, the overfishing led to people struggling even more to make a living.

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:47.128
The sea had been plentiful, but after the arrival of these foreign boats,

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.487
mainly from Iran and Yemen, there were a lot fewer fish to go around.

00:06:53.947 --> 00:06:57.627
And the dumping of the toxic waste, of course, had an impact

00:06:57.807 --> 00:07:01.097
on the marine system, and wasn’t good for the fish stocks.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:05.957
There were fewer fish in the ocean anyway because there were more people

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:11.367
trying to catch them and there was toxic, even nuclear, waste that had

00:07:11.367 --> 00:07:16.467
been dumped there illegally, so this was killing what fish there were left.

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:19.817
So, what happened next?

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:25.917
Small, Somali fishing communities decided to take matters into their own hands.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:32.897
There was no navy or police to defend their seas, so they had to act for themselves.

00:07:34.397 --> 00:07:40.077
They armed themselves, and went out into the ocean to scare these fishing boats away.

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:45.067
This was their sea, their ocean, the foreign boats didn’t have the

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:50.457
right to be there, and they were prepared to defend their territory

00:07:51.693 --> 00:07:56.556
.  
Occasionally, when a fishing boat got too close, the Somali fishermen

00:07:56.576 --> 00:08:01.226
would get on board the boats, and demand a payment from the boat’s owner.

00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:08.495
The idea behind this, reportedly I should say, was as some kind of compensation.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:13.975
These fishing boats had stolen all of their fish, so they needed to pay.

00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:20.245
The fishermen soon realised that this was actually a pretty good business.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:27.635
All you needed was a boat, some guns, and a few friends, and you could quickly make a lot of money.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:33.165
It turns out that people are prepared to pay quite a lot of money to not

00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:38.155
be killed, and to have their boat back, so this was a potentially lucrative

00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:42.765
source of income for the fishermen in these poverty-stricken communities.

00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:52.152
Especially young, unemployed men saw it as a quick way to make money to support their families.

00:08:52.152 --> 00:08:55.275
Just one raid and they could support a family for years.

00:08:56.775 --> 00:09:02.205
Soon, the number of attacks started to increase, and the ransoms paid, the

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:07.465
money paid to release the prisoners, or ships, started to increase as well.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:14.955
And soon these fishermen went from defenders of their fishing stock, and brave

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:20.945
defenders of the coastline against foreign invaders into fully-fledged pirates.

00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:24.996
They were typically organised in small groups.

00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:30.536
They would either attack directly from the coast, or if they were searching

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:35.646
for prey further away from the coast, there would be a main ‘mothership’, a

00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:40.946
larger ship, and smaller speedboats from which these attacks would be launched.

00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:45.396
They would rush up on a ship, normally in the early

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:50.236
morning, armed to the teeth, and try to seize control of it.

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:56.343
Once they had got control of the ship, they would do a combination of things.

00:09:57.353 --> 00:09:59.843
They might just steal what was on the ship.

00:10:00.673 --> 00:10:05.883
These ships would normally carry quite a lot of cash, in US dollars, so they

00:10:05.883 --> 00:10:10.003
would just take that, along with anything else that was valuable on the boat.

00:10:11.023 --> 00:10:15.693
Sometimes they would ask for a ransom, when you request money for something,

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:20.673
so either for the crew, the people on the ship, or the ship’s cargo.

00:10:21.983 --> 00:10:26.583
These could be in the millions of dollars, and would normally be paid.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:31.543
Think about it - if you have a ship with hundreds of millions or dollars on

00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:37.703
it, then you are quite likely to pay a considerable sum to get that ship back.

00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:43.253
The record for a ransom, the record amount paid to

00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:47.403
these modern day pirates, was 13.5 million dollars.

00:10:48.663 --> 00:10:55.743
It was paid for a Greek oil tanker that was carrying $200 million worth of oil.

00:10:56.943 --> 00:11:01.403
So you could say, 13.5 million dollars is quite a bargain.

00:11:02.903 --> 00:11:08.933
But if you were a pirate and you wanted to launch a big attack, the sort of one where you could

00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:17.013
feasibly get a ransom like this from a large cargo ship, this would require a lot of resources.

00:11:17.473 --> 00:11:21.733
You would need a large mother ship, smaller speedboats, and

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:25.513
a big group of pirates, it wasn’t a cheap thing to do at all.

00:11:26.743 --> 00:11:32.063
All of your pirates would all need to be paid, plus you would need to buy all of the

00:11:32.063 --> 00:11:39.033
guns, grenades, boats, equipment and everything else to successfully mount the attack.

00:11:40.163 --> 00:11:46.113
And unless you were already a pirate that had launched several successful attacks, you needed

00:11:46.143 --> 00:11:52.523
someone to loan you the money, or provide the cash for you to go on your pirate adventure.

00:11:54.023 --> 00:12:00.703
What this led to is a sort of pirate stock market, where people could invest in a pirate

00:12:00.723 --> 00:12:06.603
mission, providing the capital, the money, and then taking a share of the profits.

00:12:07.942 --> 00:12:10.392
This became a pretty big business.

00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:18.042
One of the bigger pirate expeditions could cost $30,000, and the investor,

00:12:18.072 --> 00:12:22.952
the person putting in the money, might get three quarters of the total ransom.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:32.972
If we’re talking about a ransom of $13.5 million, that’s $10 million from a $30,000 investment.

00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:39.172
And it’s not just the pirate investors that were getting rich, the

00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:43.792
normal, fisherman-type pirates were also making huge amounts of money.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:52.042
They would typically get between 30 and 50 thousand dollars per raid, and reportedly there would

00:12:52.052 --> 00:12:58.562
be a bonus of $10,000 for the first pirate to get aboard the ship that they were attacking.

00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:05.252
30 to 50 thousand dollars would obviously be a lot of money for pretty much

00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:10.652
everyone, but for someone in a country that is frequently ranked as one of

00:13:10.652 --> 00:13:15.462
the poorest countries in the world, this is a monumental amount of money.

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:20.662
And the amount of money that these pirates made actually

00:13:20.662 --> 00:13:25.152
started pushing up the price of things on shore, on land.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:30.132
The pirates had so much money that they could outbid

00:13:30.282 --> 00:13:33.742
everyone else, and the price of everything went up.

00:13:35.242 --> 00:13:38.892
The local merchants were happy with this, of course, because they were

00:13:38.892 --> 00:13:43.082
making more money, but it wasn’t good news for the local people who

00:13:43.082 --> 00:13:47.492
suddenly had to pay more for the same things, to compete with the pirates.

00:13:48.657 --> 00:13:53.492
One thing the local people were happy about though is that the

00:13:53.492 --> 00:13:58.332
arrival of the pirates has, understandably, scared off a lot of

00:13:58.342 --> 00:14:02.672
these big fishing boats, and fish stocks have started to come back.

00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:06.482
I don’t think that we can say that these pirates are

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:11.372
eco-warriors, but this is certainly one positive side-effect.

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:19.892
So, what is actually happening now with pirates, and is there any end to this super

00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:24.902
lucrative profession that is tarnishing the reputation of Somalia, and meaning

00:14:24.902 --> 00:14:30.652
that ships avoid the country’s waters out of fear of being taken over by pirates?

00:14:32.152 --> 00:14:36.542
The good news if you're a shipowner, and bad news if you’re a pirate, is

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:41.422
that the golden age of the modern pirate does seem to be coming to a close.

00:14:42.502 --> 00:14:49.062
Ships are now much more heavily guarded, and they tend to sail much further away

00:14:49.082 --> 00:14:53.782
from the coast, meaning it’s harder for them to be found by the pirates, who

00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:58.842
often launch their attacks from the coast, or at least not far from the shore.

00:15:00.342 --> 00:15:03.932
And the numbers of attacks show that it’s getting harder.

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:12.482
Since 2011, the number of pirate raids has reduced almost every year, and off the

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:17.992
Somali coast, the life of a pirate isn’t quite as easy as it was 10 years ago.

00:15:19.492 --> 00:15:24.242
But, elsewhere in the world, new pirate hotspots are emerging.

00:15:25.222 --> 00:15:30.052
The world’s piracy hotspot in 2020 is now the Gulf of Guinea,

00:15:30.622 --> 00:15:34.982
on the other side of Africa from Somalia, just below Nigeria.

00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:40.212
There were 21 pirate attacks in the Gulf of Guinea in the

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:45.682
first 3 months of 2020, out of the total of 47 worldwide.

00:15:46.722 --> 00:15:53.552
And this is actually increasing, it’s up from 38 worldwide in the same period the year before.

00:15:55.132 --> 00:16:02.732
So, as long as there are large ships carrying multi-million dollar cargo, and people without many

00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:09.132
economic opportunities have access to speedboats and machine guns, then I think we’ll continue

00:16:09.132 --> 00:16:16.002
to see modern pirates popping up in new and unexpected places for a few more years to come.

00:16:18.163 --> 00:16:22.833
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Modern Day Pirates.

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:27.153
Thank you very much for listening to the show, and I hope that you now

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:30.253
know a little bit more about modern pirates than you did 20 minutes ago.

00:16:30.273 --> 00:16:35.503
As always I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:16:36.173 --> 00:16:41.313
I normally say that I’d particularly like to hear from you if you have a personal story about this.

00:16:41.573 --> 00:16:47.993

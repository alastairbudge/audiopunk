Hello hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:09.599
Leonardo English.

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:10.949
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:17.852
I have to give a quick parental guidance warning for this podcast as there is a slightly naughty

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:20.252
word that is going to come up quite frequently.

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:26.942
It shouldn't come as a huge surprise, as the word is also in the title of this podcast, so now is

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:30.292
your time to press pause if you are not ready.

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:36.412
Okay then the naughty but not really that naughty word is bullshit.

00:00:38.127 --> 00:00:45.927
Today, we are going to be asking ourselves why so many jobs seem so pointless and talking about the

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:50.607
phenomenon of the rise of bullshit jobs.

00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:56.886
Before we jump right into the heart of the podcast though, I just want to remind those of you

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:04.556
listening on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iVoox or wherever you get your podcasts that you can get the

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:09.936
transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:17.261
The transcript is super helpful for following every single word that I say and not missing one

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:23.591
single thing, and the key vocabulary provides you with definitions of the trickier words, so you can

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:27.071
build your vocabulary at the same time as improving your listening.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.471
So check that out, it's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.191
Okay then bullshit jobs.

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:42.881
So this is an idea pioneered by an anthropologist from the London University of Economics called

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:43.781
David Graeber.

00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:55.941
In 2013 he wrote an article called On The Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs, which essentially argued that

00:01:55.941 --> 00:02:03.171
a large proportion of the jobs that are currently in existence are pointless, are bullshit.

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:11.721
He said if they went away tomorrow, these jobs, there would actually be no meaningful difference to

00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:16.521
the world, and in fact, it could be a better place.

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:27.606
He said, about bullshit jobs, he said, it is a scar across our collective soul, yet virtually no one

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:28.446
talks about it.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.716
So what are these bullshit jobs?

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:36.796
Why are they bullshit and what should we do about it?

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:46.256
Well, the jobs he took aim at, the ones he was referring to, were mainly those in the fields of

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:52.956
things like finance, law, human resources, public relations and consultancy.

00:02:54.416 --> 00:03:01.706
You might consider them classic office jobs that you might imagine someone wearing a suit for and

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:06.176
spending a lot of time in meetings and sitting in front of a computer.

00:03:07.313 --> 00:03:16.933
He published the article in a slightly obscure magazine called Strike, and it was a viral hit, a

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.933
huge, almost overnight success.

00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:25.935
The article had more than 1 million visitors and it crashed the website.

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:36.415
It was translated into 12 languages, and some guerilla activists even replaced hundreds of adverts

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:45.100
inside London tube carriages, inside the London Metro, with quotes from the article in order to

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.980
provoke commuters into realising the pointlessness of their jobs.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.906
The article was reproduced in magazines in dozens of different countries and Graeber, that author,

00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:06.796
received hundreds of emails from people all over the world telling him about their own completely

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:09.016
pointless, completely bullshit jobs.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.593
He never expected the article to have such an impact, but the reception it received really validated

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:26.213
the fact that what he had written about had really struck a chord, he had published something that

00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:29.153
resonated with a huge amount of people.

00:04:30.863 --> 00:04:39.867
In 2018, five years after the original article, he published a book called Bullshit Jobs: A Theory,

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:48.563
which is an extension of the essay, and also really interestingly, it includes a lot of the examples

00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:54.353
that he received from people around the world as a reaction to the original article.

00:04:55.387 --> 00:05:00.703
It's an excellent book, a fascinating read, and I'd definitely recommend it for those of you that

00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:04.153
feel comfortable enough reading books in English.

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:11.391
So today we are going to be talking about these bullshit jobs, the kinds of jobs that Graeber takes

00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:16.401
aim at, the reasons for this and the impact it has on society.

00:05:18.077 --> 00:05:25.248
So Graeber says that a vast amount of jobs that we have in the world today are pointless, that they

00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:31.548
exist for pointless reasons, and the world would be a better place if we got rid of them altogether.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:39.074
The definition of a bullshit job, according to Graeber is, and I'm just quoting directly from him

00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:47.864
now, it is "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious,

00:05:48.224 --> 00:05:56.414
so damaging, that even the employee cannot justify its existence, even though as part of the

00:05:56.414 --> 00:06:02.849
conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case".

00:06:03.877 --> 00:06:07.433
So that's the definition of a bullshit job according to Graeber.

00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:13.284
He puts these bullshit jobs into five different categories.

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:17.214
The first one he calls flunkies.

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:26.229
So these are people who serve to make their superiors, their bosses feel important, so things like

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.899
receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, and so on.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.959
The second category is the category of what he calls goons.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:46.944
So these are people who act aggressively on behalf of their employers, so lobbyists, corporate

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:51.114
lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists.

00:06:52.524 --> 00:06:56.484
The third category is what he calls duct tapers.

00:06:57.024 --> 00:07:05.274
So duct tape is the special type of sticky tape, the sellotape that you put on to cover up a hole or

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:05.784
a crack.

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:13.734
Graeber talks about duct tapers, saying that they are the people who try to smooth over preventable

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:23.454
problems, so programmers, developers who are repairing poor quality code, airline desk staff who

00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:26.184
calm passengers whose bags don't arrive.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:32.859
The fourth category is what Graeber calls box tickers.

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:43.269
So people who use paperwork or gestures as a proxy, as a replacement for action, for actually doing

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:43.809
things.

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:51.549
So people like performance managers, in-house magazine journalists, leisure coordinators.

00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:57.934
And the fifth category of bullshit jobs is taskmasters.

00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:04.764
So these are people who manage or create extra work for people who don't need it.

00:08:05.154 --> 00:08:08.844
So middle management, leadership professionals.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.059
So those are our five categories of bullshit jobs.

00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:18.879
Flunkies, goons, duct tapers, box tickers, and taskmasters.

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:28.779
Graeber points out that despite the prediction of the famous economist John Maynard Keynes in 1930

00:08:29.229 --> 00:08:36.219
that increases in productivity would lead to everyone working 15 hours a week, what has actually

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:45.549
happened is that a whole category of jobs has emerged that has no real purpose in society other than

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:49.719
the bullshit purposes in the five categories that we just spoke about.

00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:57.123
If you have ever worked in any sort of medium to large organization, whether that's in the private

00:08:57.123 --> 00:09:02.463
or public sector, I'm sure that a lot of this might be familiar to you.

00:09:04.338 --> 00:09:12.018
On a personal level, I used to work both as an employee and a contractor, a consultant to some quite

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:21.228
big companies, and I was astounded to see how much of the work that people do in these companies is

00:09:21.378 --> 00:09:24.678
exactly this, is pointless, is bullshit.

00:09:26.096 --> 00:09:34.106
It's especially the case with private companies, which you might expect would be more efficient as

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:40.586
every employee who doesn't need to be there and isn't actually adding value is reducing the

00:09:40.586 --> 00:09:42.326
profitability of the company.

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:49.166
Capitalism in theory, should get rid of these kinds of inefficiencies.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:56.081
So why, Graeber asks, do such jobs exist?

00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:02.691
Graeber suggests that it's actually a sort of systematic problem.

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:09.921
Politicians are obsessed with employment numbers, always trying to get more and more people into

00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:10.341
work.

00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:17.241
Plus people want to feel like they are busy and contributing to society.

00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:27.933
Not working is almost demonized, almost thought of as a bad thing to be doing, and so people engage

00:10:27.963 --> 00:10:34.443
in these kinds of pointless, these bullshit jobs, even though they know that they aren't really

00:10:34.443 --> 00:10:37.053
adding any huge value to society.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:44.612
Graeber suggests that these jobs are actually really damaging to us individually and collectively.

00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:54.422
He also says that one result of the bullshitization of many jobs is that people look down on, they

00:10:54.422 --> 00:11:04.022
almost disparage, jobs that are inherently useful and assume that the pay for these kinds of jobs,

00:11:04.022 --> 00:11:12.587
these useful jobs should be lower, almost because they have a value to society and are good jobs,

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:15.587
they don't need to be paid as much.

00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:25.127
So things like teachers, nurses, carers, where there is an obvious and tangible benefit to society,

00:11:25.697 --> 00:11:34.037
these are jobs in the UK at least where the pay is comparatively low, while what Graeber would call

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:41.747
bullshit jobs, corporate lawyers, financial consultants, and so on are some of the highest paid.

00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:50.147
The solution could be, Graeber argues, for some sort of universal basic income.

00:11:52.275 --> 00:12:00.515
If people are being paid large amounts to do bullshit jobs where not a huge amount of value is being

00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:08.045
created, why not just pay everyone a fixed amount so that they are freer, they are more free, to

00:12:08.045 --> 00:12:15.425
engage in their own passions and do things that are actually valuable, not pointless work.

00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:23.468
The logic goes, if someone is sitting at their desk for 40 hours and their job isn't actually

00:12:23.468 --> 00:12:28.778
contributing anything, why make them sit at their desk in the first place?

00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:36.869
It really is an interesting idea and it struck a chord, it resonated with me as I've experienced a

00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:38.369
lot of this firsthand.

00:12:39.497 --> 00:12:46.479
And I'd guess even if you haven't ever been exposed to working environments where there are these

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:54.049
kinds of pointless or bullshit jobs yourself, I guess that you might recognise a lot of what Graeber

00:12:54.099 --> 00:13:00.909
talks about in the book through conversations and experiences shared with friends or family.

00:13:02.308 --> 00:13:09.364
And one thing I think is absolutely fascinating is that after the original article was published,

00:13:09.604 --> 00:13:14.872
which was more just a theory saying he thought these things existed, so after this thing was

00:13:14.872 --> 00:13:22.162
published, he was contacted by people all over the world saying, this is exactly my life, you've hit

00:13:22.162 --> 00:13:28.012
the nail on the head, and they would recount, they would tell him exactly what they did.

00:13:29.597 --> 00:13:36.575
Lots of them are really interesting, so much so that I want to finish today's podcast by reading out

00:13:36.605 --> 00:13:38.705
five examples from the book.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:45.720
So these are examples that were sent in by these anonymous workers who did bullshit jobs.

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:55.738
Our first is called guarding an empty room, and I'm just reading this out directly from the person

00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:56.331
who did the job.

00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:04.511
I worked as a museum guard for a global security company in a museum where one exhibition room was

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.411
left unused.

00:14:06.741 --> 00:14:14.361
My job was to guard that empty room ensuring no museum guests touched the, well, nothing in the

00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:17.841
room, and ensure nobody set any fires.

00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:26.511
To keep my mind sharp and attention undivided I was forbidden any form of mental stimulation like

00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:28.041
books, phones, et cetera.

00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:37.581
As nobody was ever there, I sat still and twiddled my thumbs for seven and a half hours waiting for

00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:38.991
the fire alarm to sound.

00:14:40.071 --> 00:14:43.881
If it did, I was to calmly stand up and walk out.

00:14:44.691 --> 00:14:45.441
That was it.

00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:47.931
Okay.

00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:52.341
Our second example is called copying and pasting.

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:55.015
I was given one responsibility.

00:14:55.675 --> 00:15:04.165
Watching an inbox that received emails in a certain form from employees asking for tech help and

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.805
copy and paste it into a different form.

00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:16.425
Not only was this a textbook example of an automatable job, it actually used to be automated.

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:24.175
There was some disagreement between managers that led to a standardisation that nullified, that got

00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:25.825
rid of, the automation.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:30.703
The third example is called looking busy.

00:15:32.813 --> 00:15:38.273
I was hired as a temp, as a temporary worker, but not assigned any duties.

00:15:38.963 --> 00:15:46.283
I was told it was very important that I stay busy, but I wasn't to play games or surf the web.

00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:55.363
My primary function seemed to be occupying a chair and contributing to the decorum of the office.

00:15:56.593 --> 00:16:03.673
At first, this seemed pretty easy, but I quickly discovered that looking busy when you aren't is one

00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:06.613
of the least pleasant office activities imaginable.

00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:14.361
In fact, after two days it was clear that this was going to be the worst job I ever had.

00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:23.536
I installed Lynx, a text-only web browser that basically looks like a DOS, a disc operating system

00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:30.166
window, no images, just monospaced text on an endless black background.

00:16:31.037 --> 00:16:36.527
My absent minded browsing of the internet now appeared to be the work of a skilled technician.

00:16:36.887 --> 00:16:43.127
The web browser, a terminal into which diligently typed commands signalled my endless productivity.

00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:49.716
Fourth, we have a bullshit job called sitting in the right place.

00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:53.366
I worked in a college dormitory during the summer.

00:16:54.086 --> 00:17:00.026
I have worked at this job for three years, and at this point it is still unclear to me what my

00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:01.286
actual duties are.

00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:08.156
Primarily, it seems that my job consists of physically occupying space at the front desk.

00:17:09.606 --> 00:17:16.546
While engaged in this, I am free to pursue my own projects, which I take to mean mainly creating

00:17:16.596 --> 00:17:20.826
rubber band balls out of rubber bands I find in the cabinets.

00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:26.436
When I'm not busy with this, I might be checking the office email account.

00:17:27.156 --> 00:17:33.216
I have basically no training or administrative power of course, so all I can do is forward these

00:17:33.216 --> 00:17:34.146
emails to my boss.

00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:41.931
I move packages from the door where they get dropped off to the package room, answering phone calls,

00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:48.651
again, I know nothing and rarely answer a question to the caller's satisfaction or finding ketchup

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:51.651
packets from 2005 in the desk drawers.

00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:55.558
For these duties I am paid $14 an hour.

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.763
Then the last one is my favourite one.

00:18:01.638 --> 00:18:06.618
I do digital consultancy for global pharmaceutical companies' marketing departments.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:14.778
I often work with global PR agencies on this and write reports with titles like "how to improve

00:18:14.778 --> 00:18:17.538
engagement among digital healthcare stakeholders".

00:18:18.648 --> 00:18:25.188
It is pure, unadulterated bullshit and serves no purpose beyond ticking boxes for marketing

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:25.878
departments.

00:18:26.631 --> 00:18:33.457
I was recently able to charge around 12,000 pounds to write a two page report for a pharmaceutical

00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:36.427
client to present during a global strategy meeting.

00:18:37.447 --> 00:18:42.097
The report wasn't used in the end because they didn't manage to get to that agenda point.

00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:46.177
Fascinating, right, these examples?

00:18:47.182 --> 00:18:54.292
If you enjoyed this podcast and this idea of bullshit jobs, then I'd definitely recommend picking up

00:18:54.292 --> 00:18:55.432
a copy of the book.

00:18:55.732 --> 00:18:57.682
It is really an interesting read.

00:18:58.222 --> 00:19:04.372
The language isn't super complicated and if you could understand most of the examples I just read

00:19:04.372 --> 00:19:07.072
out, then you should have no trouble reading the book.

00:19:08.587 --> 00:19:14.137
Okay that is it for today's little foray into bullshit jobs.

00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:18.427
It's a really interesting idea, and I'd love to know what you think.

00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:26.587

As always, if you are looking for the transcripts or key vocabulary, then you can grab yourself a

00:19:33.052 --> 00:19:40.012
membership to Leonardo English and get access to every transcript and key vocabulary for every

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:44.562
podcast we've ever done over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:19:45.072 --> 00:19:50.682
As I said, the transcripts can be the most amazing resource to help you follow every word and the

00:19:50.682 --> 00:19:55.542
key vocabulary is super useful for learning new words and phrases.

00:19:56.397 --> 00:20:03.027

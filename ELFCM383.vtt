Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:16.271
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.291
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:24.921
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is going to be the start of another

00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:29.801
three-part mini-series, this time on the subject of France.

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:34.861
In today’s episode we will learn about the patron saint of France,

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.661
Jeanne D’Arc, a mysterious young lady who was burned at the stake.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:45.311
Next, in part two, it’ll be a boy from Corsica who turned into the

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:49.511
greatest military genius the country had ever seen, until…he wasn’t.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.101
And by this I mean, of course, Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:00:53.921 --> 00:01:00.221
And in the final part, part three, it’s going to be the complex but incredibly important case

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:07.401
of L’affaire Dreyfus, the Dreyfus Affair, the biggest miscarriage of justice in French history.

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:15.201
OK then, let’s get right into it and start with a patron saint of France, the famed

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:21.061
defender of her motherland, Jeanne D’Arc, or to anglicise her name, Joan of Arc.

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:30.291
For many people, their late teens are important years in terms of self development and growing up.

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:38.511
When you’re 17, 18, 19, society starts to consider you a “grown up”, an adult.

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.721
In the UK you can get a driving licence when you’re 17, you can vote in

00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:50.011
elections when you’re 18, you can legally buy alcohol and cigarettes, and

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:54.991
by your 18th birthday you’re treated as an adult in the eyes of the law.

00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:01.651
This might be a time when you finish school, start university, leave home,

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.411
fall in love, do all the sorts of things that are probably very important

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:11.761
to you, but probably not so important outside of your immediate circle.

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:18.131
For the subject of today’s episode these years were somewhat different.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:25.191
Very little is known about Joan of Arc as a young girl, and nothing is

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.031
known about her after her teenage years because she was burned at the

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:33.881
stake, she was publicly executed by the English before her 20th birthday.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:41.431
And in these years, during these late teenage years, her actions turned her into

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:46.911
a French heroine, remembered as the saviour of the country, and they would lead

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:51.878
her to her being canonised, turned into a saint, several hundred years later.

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:59.878
So, before we get into the short but eventful life of this young lady, it’s worth reminding

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:05.818
ourselves of what exactly was happening in France, and in Europe, at the time of her life.

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:12.388
Joan was born in 1412, so towards the end of the series of

00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:15.648
wars that would come to be called the Hundred Years War.

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:24.918
Long story short, this conflict was primarily about who had the rightful claim to be king of France.

00:03:26.528 --> 00:03:34.558
In 1328 Charles IV of France died, leaving no direct male heirs, no sons or brothers.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:41.048
His closest male relative was Edward III, the King of England.

00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:48.308
Remember, it was only in 1066, only a few centuries before, that William the

00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:53.528
Conqueror had sailed over from Normandy, in France, to claim the English throne

00:03:53.528 --> 00:03:59.338
for himself, and the French and English royal families had a lot of overlap.

00:04:00.388 --> 00:04:07.212
So, it’s 1328, the French  king dies, his nearest relative is the English king,

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:13.122
but clearly, allowing the King of England to also become King of France would

00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:18.932
be problematic; the French weren't so keen on the idea, but the English were.

00:04:20.422 --> 00:04:23.732
This triggered a series of wars that would last

00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:28.782
until 1453 and drag in several other European states.

00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:37.302
So, this was the environment Joan was born into, and the conflict that would dominate her life.

00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:41.602
Right, let’s talk about Joan herself.

00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:45.536
She was born in or around 1412.

00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:49.742
Her father was a peasant farmer called Jacques d’Arc

00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:53.742
and her mother a pious woman named Isabelle Romée.

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:59.762
Now, not a huge amount is known about the details of the early life of

00:04:59.762 --> 00:05:05.352
Joan, and what we do know, at least in terms of her upbringing and family

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:09.752
life, would have been pretty standard for a young lady at that time.

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:15.502
She grew up in a small village called Domrémy, to the east of Paris.

00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:21.302
Given its location to the north of the country, relatively close

00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:26.522
to England, Domrémy, this village was at the heart of the conflict.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:32.162
She was brought up in a highly religious environment, Catholic of course.

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:39.182
Her youth would have been spent helping her parents work the land, cooking, and doing housework.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:43.812
She never went to school, so never learned to read or write.

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:51.792
So far, just your normal, run-of-the-mill French peasant teenage girl in the 15th century.

00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:58.262
But soon enough it was clear that this young woman was different.

00:05:59.832 --> 00:06:04.452
When she was 13 years old, she said that she heard voices.

00:06:04.952 --> 00:06:09.152
Or rather, the voice of an angel, sent to her by God.

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:17.075
And what did this angel want, what was the message that it was bringing to her, directly from God?

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:23.282
The first message, so Joan would say, was simply that she should be

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:27.592
a good young Christian - she would behave well, and go to church.

00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:34.692
Fortunately, she was doing this already, so it didn't require a great change of lifestyle.

00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:41.062
But this would be the first of many messages she would receive, many

00:06:41.162 --> 00:06:45.372
visions that she would have of being visited by messengers of God.

00:06:46.942 --> 00:06:52.712
And soon the voice would tell her to do something that did require a bit of a change.

00:06:53.222 --> 00:06:56.152
It told her that she needed to “go to France”.

00:06:57.132 --> 00:07:02.052
Now, this might sound like a confusing message, given that she was in

00:07:02.062 --> 00:07:06.742
modern France, she had never and would never leave her country of birth.

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:14.129
But what is believed to have been meant by this, or at least how Joan said

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:19.549
she understood it, was that she needed to go inwards, to the central part

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:24.969
of France, as Domrémy, her village, was on the periphery of the country.

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:32.249
Joan believed that the messenger was Archangel Michael, or Saint Michael in French.

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:36.929
And he gave her a very specific message.

00:07:38.338 --> 00:07:44.957
According to Joan, she should go to France and find a man called Robert de Baudricourt,

00:07:45.578 --> 00:07:52.045
the commander of the fortress of Vaucolouers, which was about 20 km north of Domrémy.

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:57.298
He would give her an army, and it would be her job to go to

00:07:57.298 --> 00:08:01.558
the besieged city of Orleans and free it from the English.

00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:06.237
The only problem here was that Joan was not an

00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:10.027
experienced military commander; she was a teenage girl.

00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:15.247
She seemed to acknowledge the issue, and told the archangel that

00:08:15.247 --> 00:08:18.637
she didn’t know how to ride a horse, let alone to lead an army.

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:27.737
But this was a divine mission, these kinds of practicalities were unimportant, and indeed

00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:31.747
they would actually prove themselves unimportant in the adventures that were to come.

00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:42.321
And so it was that in May of 1428, when Joan would have been 15 or 16, that she arrived at

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:49.410
Vaucolouers to ask Robert de Baudricourt, the commander, to give her an army to go to Orléans.

00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:53.521
Unsurprisingly, perhaps, he said no.

00:08:54.521 --> 00:09:00.261
But she didn’t give up, and came back time and time again to ask him.

00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:06.381
Her case was strengthened by the fact that she had a growing band of supporters.

00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:12.631
There were several prophecies about a young girl who was destined to save France,

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:18.031
and here was a very persistent young girl who claimed she had been sent by God.

00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:23.571
If you were the sort of person who believed in prophecies, which would have been a

00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:28.381
sizable proportion of the population back then, then she matched the description.

00:09:29.916 --> 00:09:37.136
What’s more, France was in a pretty poor position at the time, the 100 Years War was not going well.

00:09:38.396 --> 00:09:45.406
The English had won a decisive victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:52.626
English King Henry V had become regent of France, essentially de-facto king, in 1420.

00:09:54.076 --> 00:10:00.026
The French heir to the throne, or the French king, if you asked a Frenchman, was Charles VII.

00:10:00.546 --> 00:10:06.256
But he had never been officially crowned king, because Reims, the city

00:10:06.286 --> 00:10:10.366
where French kings were crowned, was under the control of the English.

00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:16.246
By the late 1420s, the English forces had won control of much of

00:10:16.246 --> 00:10:20.526
northern France, including Paris, as well as the south west coast.

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:25.526
In fact, it wasn’t quite as simple as the English vs.

00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:29.616
the French, as France was split into warring groups.

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:36.136
Specifically, it was a case of the Armagnacs, the allies of Charles VII, against the

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:41.326
Bugundians, the supporters of the Duke of Burgundy, who were allied with the English.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:47.126
The front line of the conflict was at Orleans, a strategic

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:51.346
point on the river Loire, just over 100km south West of Paris.

00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:58.286
If the siege had succeeded and Orleans had fallen, it would have provided

00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:02.032
the English army with an entry point through which to move southwards

00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:07.446
and take the rest of France, perhaps causing the entire country to fall.

00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:14.389
And since October of 1428, Orleans had been under siege.

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:18.939
But try as they might, the English couldn’t break through.

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:26.219
So, in a sentence, to sum things up, things weren’t looking rosy for the French.

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:32.869
And there was Joan, a 15-year-old girl, claiming to have been sent by God.

00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:40.611
Eventually, Robert de Baudricourt, relented, he gave up, and he agreed to give Joan

00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:45.721
enough troops and horses to make the journey to Chinon, in the west of the country.

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:52.647
Joan wanted to go here because it was there that Charles, the uncrowned

00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:56.747
king of France was staying, firmly out of the way of the English.

00:11:58.157 --> 00:12:04.337
Before she left, Joan made some preparations to make herself look less like a 15-year-old girl.

00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:09.757
She cut her hair short, like a boy’s, and dressed in men’s clothing.

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:16.837
When she arrived at Charles’ court, she was forced to wait for two days for an audience with him.

00:12:18.227 --> 00:12:21.167
Then she would meet her first real test.

00:12:22.764 --> 00:12:28.074
She had claimed to have divine powers, so the king wanted to see if she would

00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:33.184
be able to recognise him, if she would be able to pick him out from the crowd.

00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:41.204
Charles disguised himself in the crowd, wearing normal clothes, but Joan reportedly

00:12:41.204 --> 00:12:47.784
walked right up to him, identifying him immediately, despite never having seen him before.

00:12:49.224 --> 00:12:50.154
It was a promising start.

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:56.297
She told Charles that she had been sent by God to help get rid of the English

00:12:56.307 --> 00:13:02.257
once and for all, and she wouldn’t rest until he had been crowned King of France.

00:13:03.664 --> 00:13:09.204
To do this, she said, she needed him to give her an army to go to Orleans.

00:13:10.554 --> 00:13:16.694
This no doubt sounded like music to his ears, but Joan wasn’t exactly an experienced

00:13:16.704 --> 00:13:21.534
knight or seasoned warrior; she was a teenage girl who had never seen battle.

00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:27.634
Still, she seemed like an inspirational figure, she claimed to

00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:32.084
have been sent by God, so Charles was interested in hearing more.

00:13:33.534 --> 00:13:37.644
First though, he needed to check that she was who she said she

00:13:37.644 --> 00:13:41.184
was, that she was indeed the good Catholic that she claimed to be.

00:13:42.294 --> 00:13:45.784
She was examined by theologians, by religious experts.

00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:52.094
She was even intimately examined by Charles’ mother-in-law to check that she was still a virgin.

00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:59.024
Fortunately, she passed with flying colours, and Charles agreed to send her to Orléans.

00:14:00.254 --> 00:14:04.404
A suit of white armour was made and she set off on a white

00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:08.834
horse on a mission to liberate France from the English invaders.

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:14.954
Most historians tend to believe that Charles agreed to send her to Orléans

00:14:15.214 --> 00:14:19.874
because she could be an inspiration, a morale-booster, to the French troops.

00:14:21.014 --> 00:14:25.864
Perhaps he did indeed believe she was sent by God, but he may well have thought,

00:14:26.314 --> 00:14:30.714
well, she’s a pretty impressive young lady and things aren’t going very well.

00:14:31.144 --> 00:14:32.764
I’ll give her a horse and a few men.

00:14:33.124 --> 00:14:34.464
What’s the worst that could happen?

00:14:35.974 --> 00:14:41.284
She set off at the end of April, 1429, and made her way into the city of

00:14:41.284 --> 00:14:45.974
Orléans, sneaking through the English siege and managing to enter the city.

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:51.014
She was, reportedly, welcomed warmly by the troops.

00:14:51.684 --> 00:14:57.274
I mean, if you are stuck in Orleans in a pretty sticky situation, a young woman arrives

00:14:57.494 --> 00:15:02.104
saying she has been sent by God to save France, and you believe in the prophecy that

00:15:02.104 --> 00:15:07.104
France will be saved by a young woman, then this would understandably be good news.

00:15:08.434 --> 00:15:14.474
Initially she was a sort of mascot figure, cheering on the troops, encouraging them on.

00:15:15.784 --> 00:15:21.274
Within no time at all though it was clear that she was much more than this; this

00:15:21.404 --> 00:15:26.634
was an extremely brave young woman who truly believed in what she was doing.

00:15:27.974 --> 00:15:32.724
She personally led the French armies in attacks, taking off her helmet so

00:15:32.774 --> 00:15:37.564
everyone could see who she was, and raising her flag high into the sky.

00:15:38.984 --> 00:15:45.004
She was an inspiration to the French troops, and must have been a confusing sight for the

00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:50.594
English - there was someone who seemed to be a young woman at the frontlines, waving a

00:15:50.604 --> 00:15:56.474
banner, cheering on her country folk, a woman who seemed to be utterly unafraid of death.

00:15:57.614 --> 00:16:01.244
She wrote multiple letters to the English commander informing

00:16:01.244 --> 00:16:04.504
them that she had been sent by God to chase them from France.

00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:10.524
The English knew who she was, and knew how successfully she was boosting French morale.

00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:15.274
Whether or not they too believed she was sent by God

00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:19.604
is unclear, but she was clearly a frustrating presence.

00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:24.284
So you can imagine that there must have been cheers on the English

00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:28.904
side when one day she was shot in the neck by an English archer.

00:16:30.284 --> 00:16:35.214
She had taken off her helmet, as was her wont, and an English arrow had

00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:40.964
landed straight in her neck, lodging itself 15 centimetres in between

00:16:40.964 --> 00:16:45.824
her neck and her shoulders, a wound that would surely prove fatal.

00:16:46.574 --> 00:16:50.154
She fell to the floor and was dragged away from the battle

00:16:51.374 --> 00:16:56.304
There were English celebrations, as it seemed that this teenage messenger of God

00:16:56.654 --> 00:17:02.164
might not be so holy at all; she was just flesh and blood like every other soldier.

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:10.334
But a few hours later she returned to the field of battle, alive and well, shocking the

00:17:10.334 --> 00:17:17.864
English army and rumours going around that she was some sort of unholy, invincible witch.

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:24.164
Whether this was the final morale-denting nail in the coffin we will never know.

00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:31.214
The following day, this is May the 8th by the way, of 1429, the English

00:17:31.214 --> 00:17:36.684
forces withdrew from the city, they gave up and the siege was broken.

00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:43.864
It was a hugely important French victory, and would turn the tide of the hundred years war.

00:17:45.484 --> 00:17:50.674
As a result, the name Jeanne D'Arc, Joan of Arc spread through France.

00:17:51.164 --> 00:17:54.264
She was the defender of the nation, the young woman who

00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:57.464
had saved the country from the scourge of the English.

00:17:58.284 --> 00:18:01.804
If there had been any doubt about the authenticity of her

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:06.934
claims to be sent from God before, these were put to rest now.

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:11.664
The next step for Joan was to fulfil her promise to see

00:18:11.664 --> 00:18:15.024
Charles crowned at Reims, in the far east of the country.

00:18:16.254 --> 00:18:23.644
She accompanied him, along with the French forces, and on July 17th, 1429, Charles

00:18:23.764 --> 00:18:29.734
VII was given a full coronation, with Joan of Arc a guest of honour at the ceremony.

00:18:31.244 --> 00:18:36.884
Her promise had been fulfilled, but there was still the not insignificant question

00:18:37.094 --> 00:18:42.017
of the English and Bugundian armies, which still controlled much of Northern France.

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:48.404
Much of the next year was filled by small battles between the French and

00:18:48.404 --> 00:18:53.324
English forces, with Joan still playing a role, albeit a decreasing one,

00:18:53.784 --> 00:18:57.814
as she would never repeat the military success she had had at Orléans.

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:06.724
But we need to fast forward to the 23rd of May 1430, just over a year after the victory at Orleans.

00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:14.224
Joan had gone with a small army to the town of Compiègne, north east of Paris.

00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:17.774
She had gone against the orders of the king, she

00:19:17.844 --> 00:19:21.204
wasn’t supposed to have done this, but she went anyway.

00:19:22.634 --> 00:19:29.864
This town was under siege by the Duke of Burgundy, who was French, but was an ally of the English.

00:19:31.394 --> 00:19:35.594
She had taken a group of soldiers out of the town to fight the Bugundians,

00:19:36.214 --> 00:19:40.754
but had been forced to retreat, to go back into the town to escape.

00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:47.804
Unfortunately, as she was trying to return to safety Joan was dragged off her

00:19:47.814 --> 00:19:53.734
horse, captured by the supporters of the Duke of Burgundy, and sold to the English.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:59.614
Although historians believe that it would have been relatively easy for Charles

00:19:59.624 --> 00:20:05.374
VII to have got her back if he wanted, probably by paying a ransom or asking

00:20:05.374 --> 00:20:10.644
the pope to intervene, he did absolutely nothing, he didn't lift a finger.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:13.694
Now, why was this?

00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:19.694
She had, after all, saved the country and fulfilled her promise to have him crowned king of France.

00:20:21.204 --> 00:20:28.644
Well, ever since that victory at Orleans, Joan had proved herself to be a bit of a liability,

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:34.804
taking matters into her own hands, getting injured and presiding over several military defeats.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:39.834
Perhaps she wasn’t quite as sent by God as she said she was,

00:20:40.264 --> 00:20:43.931
and Charles didn't want his name to be associated with hers.

00:20:44.771 --> 00:20:48.631
In any case, there is no evidence that he ever tried to get her

00:20:48.631 --> 00:20:53.394
back, instead leaving her at the mercy of her English captors.

00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:58.391
As you might imagine, this was quite the coup for the

00:20:58.401 --> 00:21:01.501
English, and they sought to make an example of her.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:07.711
On January the 9th, 1431, she was put on trial for heresy.

00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:13.721
Although it was theoretically a trial, where evidence would be presented

00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:18.071
and she could be found guilty or innocent, and the entire process did

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:22.681
take four and a half months, the verdict was a foregone conclusion.

00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:29.201
She had claimed she had spoken directly to God, which was not allowed

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.911
by the church, it literally was heresy by the law of the church.

00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:39.021
To speak to God you had to speak through a clergyman, you had to go through the church.

00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:46.811
On May the 24th, after more than four months of questioning, she was made aware of her fate.

00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:53.141
She had been found guilty of heresy and would be immediately

00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:56.961
burned at the stake, killed by being burned alive.

00:21:58.021 --> 00:21:59.871
But there was a way out.

00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:07.541
If she signed a document declaring that her visions of God were a lie, and that she promised to

00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:13.031
stop wearing men’s clothes, she would be saved, she would only have to face life imprisonment.

00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:18.041
She signed the document, and was saved from the flames.

00:22:19.441 --> 00:22:24.481
But just four days later she went back on this, she rejected her rejection.

00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:30.361
She yet again put on the uniform of a male soldier, saying that St

00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:34.221
Catherine and St Margaret had told her off for giving in so easily.

00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:38.331
By now, her fate was sealed.

00:22:39.381 --> 00:22:46.701
On May the 29th of 1431 she was led to the town square at Rouen, placed on

00:22:46.731 --> 00:22:52.811
top of a pile of wood, tied to a pole, and burned alive at the age of 19.

00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:59.041
Now, as to the legacy of Joan of Arc, she is, as you heard

00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:02.131
at the start of the episode, a patron saint of France.

00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:07.401
She was canonised, turned into a saint, by the pope in 1920.

00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:13.481
And since her death she has been used as a symbol of French resistance.

00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:18.711
During both world wars she was called upon as a source of inspiration,

00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:24.251
perhaps not divine inspiration,  but she was used as an example of

00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:28.461
the French fighting spirit and bravery in the face of adversity.

00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:35.621
Despite this status as the so-called “maid of France”, a French icon who was

00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:40.841
decisively anti-English, there are a few important points to be made that go

00:23:40.871 --> 00:23:45.101
somewhat against this narrative, and I’m not only saying this as an Englishman.

00:23:46.361 --> 00:23:52.621
Firstly, she was put on trial by the English, but of the 131 members

00:23:52.621 --> 00:23:56.326
of the church who were involved in her trial, and who found her

00:23:56.341 --> 00:24:02.725
guilty, 123 were French, she was found guilty and killed by the French.

00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:08.395
Secondly, she was caught not by the English but by the Bugundians,

00:24:08.395 --> 00:24:12.735
supporters of the Duke of Burgundy, and as anyone who likes their red

00:24:12.735 --> 00:24:17.445
wine will know, Burgundy, or Bourgogne, is most definitely in France.

00:24:18.205 --> 00:24:24.185
She was also sold to the English by the Bugundians, inhabitants of modern France, although

00:24:24.285 --> 00:24:28.845
it’s debatable whether they would have referred to themselves back then as French.

00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:34.445
And finally, she was betrayed, or at least not saved,

00:24:34.715 --> 00:24:37.905
by none other than the French king, Charles VII.

00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:44.325
He had the chance to save her from the flames, yet he did absolutely nothing.

00:24:45.492 --> 00:24:49.342
So, she might be a French heroine, but she wasn't treated

00:24:49.342 --> 00:24:52.322
so well by her fellow citizens when she was alive.

00:24:53.642 --> 00:25:00.782
Now, as for Joan herself, as you might imagine, modern historians and medical professionals have

00:25:00.782 --> 00:25:06.642
tried to rationally explain her condition and her visions, if indeed they were not the word of God.

00:25:07.652 --> 00:25:13.602
There’s a theory she might have been schizophrenic, epileptic, or even have had a lump in her brain.

00:25:14.902 --> 00:25:18.102
Whether or not these are true is anyone's guess.

00:25:18.932 --> 00:25:24.612
What seems to be hard to deny is that she really believed that she had been visited by

00:25:24.612 --> 00:25:30.133
messengers of God, that she was divinely appointed to save France, that she had been chosen.

00:25:31.023 --> 00:25:35.753
She believed she was exactly who she said she was; she was no fraud.

00:25:36.933 --> 00:25:42.103
During her four and a half month trial against a group of 131 learned clergymen

00:25:42.633 --> 00:25:47.613
she was able to hold her own, staying steadfast in her own convictions.

00:25:48.543 --> 00:25:53.783
She didn’t give up, she faced her fate with pride, even asking an

00:25:53.813 --> 00:25:58.153
English soldier to allow her to see the cross as she burned to death.

00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:04.013
Whether you believe or not that she was truly the saviour of France is

00:26:04.023 --> 00:26:09.983
up to you, but it’s undeniable that she was a remarkable young woman.

00:26:12.642 --> 00:26:17.812
Ok then, that is it for Joan of Arc, Jeanne D'Arc, the young lady

00:26:17.902 --> 00:26:22.122
who believed she was destined to save France and well, kind of did.

00:26:22.892 --> 00:26:25.462
As always, I would love to hear what you thought about this

00:26:25.462 --> 00:26:28.292
episode, especially for the French listeners among you.

00:26:29.022 --> 00:26:31.942
Do you think Joan of Arc was betrayed by her countrymen?

00:26:32.512 --> 00:26:35.822
How would history have been different had Orleans fell?

00:26:36.822 --> 00:26:39.622
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:16.133
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.023
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:25.573
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about language.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:28.943
Specifically, we are going to talk about how language

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:33.233
changes over time, and the often political reasons for this.

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:37.573
And even more specifically, we are going to look at the

00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:41.593
example of how to refer to people who do not live in a house.

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:46.923
It might seem like an odd example, a strange word to choose, but

00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:51.533
believe you me, it is a question that opens up a whole host of different

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.943
questions, questions that are more controversial than you might think.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.629
OK then, Homes, Homelessness and Evolving English

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.649
If I asked you, “so, what is the purpose of language”, you would probably

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.699
say something like “to communicate information from one person to another”.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.429
There are lots of things in the world - animals, people, objects, emotions,

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.239
ideas - we have common agreed words or expressions for them, so that when

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:29.649
we use these common words or expressions, other people know what we mean.

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:36.139
If I ask you “what is your name?”, you know what I mean by that, and you answer me.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.619
If I say “what are you doing on Tuesday?” and you tell me

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.459
“I’m going swimming”, we both know what each other mean.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.589
All clear so far, there was nothing controversial or politically divisive there.

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:55.659
But as we both know, language can be problematic.

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.139
Words and phrases can be offensive, they can cause harm.

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:07.059
They can be created to cause deliberate offence to people, like some racial slurs for example.

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.839
But, more often than not, a word that was once commonplace, in common usage, starts

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:21.069
to be considered offensive by a small group of people, and over time often becomes

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:27.659
unusable, considered too offensive and inappropiate to be used in the language.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.649
You may have heard about the works of Roald Dahl, the British author,

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.539
being rewritten to make them seem less offensive to a modern audience.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.389
This was big news when it was first reported in February of this year, and it was

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:50.109
revealed that characters could no longer be referred to as “fat” or “ugly”, for example.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.059
Fair enough, you might think, it’s possible to enjoy these books

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.249
without needlessly offending people who might take offence.

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:04.099
Or, it’s “absurd censorship”, as his fellow author Salmand Rushdie put it.

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:10.619
To explore this question of evolving language, specifically evolving English,

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.239
we are going to look at the very specific question of how we refer to people

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.159
without a permanent and stable place to live, as this example touches on lots of

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.599
interesting linguistic points as well as highlights the politicisation of language.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.559
To do this, let’s first address the question of what we call the place we live in.

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:41.169
In English there are two main words that we can use to describe the place we live.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.029
It can be our house or it can be our home.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.659
They refer to the same thing, but they don’t have exactly the same meaning.

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:57.999
A house is more practical, it refers to the structure

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.569
itself, whereas a home gives an idea of comfort.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.869
English, of course, isn’t unique in this; many other languages have this

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:14.539
concept, of there being a word or expression for the physical place and

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.309
there being another word or expression that conveys a more emotional meaning.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.699
Now, why is this important?

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:28.329
It’s important because it describes how you feel about the place in which you live.

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:33.089
If you say “something feels like home”, it means that it

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:37.299
feels familiar and comfortable, it's where you should be.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:46.219
You can’t say “it feels like house” or even “it feels like my house”, because there is no emotional

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:53.619
attachment between a person and a house; if you want to convey emotion, you use the term “home”.

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.609
It’s a relatively simple distinction in English, and

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.119
it’s one that I imagine you probably already knew.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:05.189
But where it becomes perhaps more complicated is when the place

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.209
someone calls “home” is not a house, not a traditional dwelling.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:17.039
To give you a fictional example, Mowgli, the boy in the Jungle Book, calls

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:21.709
the jungle “home”, because he has an emotional attachment to it, it’s

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:26.589
where he feels he belongs, with Baloo the Bear and Bagheera the Panther.

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.279
To give you a more practical, modern-day example, clearly not everyone in the

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:40.739
world lives in a traditional house, with one UN study estimating that 150 million

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:46.459
people, so that's 2% of the world’s population, fall into this category: they

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:52.239
live on the streets, in temporary accommodation, or without any fixed home.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.269
Now, the most common expression for this still is “homeless”.

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.119
If someone lives on the streets, in a tent, perhaps even in a car, or anywhere

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:09.349
that is not a standard fixed “house”, they are referred to as “homeless”.

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:15.499
This, for the time being, is the most frequently used term that you’ll read or hear.

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.468
But it only really started to be used in the 1980s.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:28.469
Before this, people used terms that are now considered offensive: vagrant, tramp, hobo and bum.

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:34.469
“Homeless” started to be used as a more neutral term, a word that

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.169
simply described what was going on without casting judgement.

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.439
As you will know, you can add the suffix “less”, L E S

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.119
S, to the end of many words in English to mean “without”.

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:52.899
Heartless means without a heart, so not having any sympathy.

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:58.869
Hopeless means without hope, limitless means without having limits, and

00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:03.569
if you add “less” to “home” you get “homeless”, someone without a home.

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.319
It might seem like a perfectly sensible term to use.

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:12.889
But, as with many things in language, words and expressions

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.509
that once seemed innocent and harmless start to be questioned.

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:20.129
What does using this word communicate?

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:23.209
Does it accurately describe what we are trying to say?

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:29.089
You might remember in May of this year, there was an incident on the New York

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:34.699
Subway when a member of the public restrained another passenger, he held him down

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:39.869
on the ground, with his arms around the man’s neck, and killed him in the process.

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.249
The man who died was called Jordan Neeley, and he had been living on the streets

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:50.929
of New York for several years, he was what most people would call “homeless”.

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:58.069
And on May the 3rd of this year, shortly after the incident, the American

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:03.619
politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC as she’s known, tweeted out this:

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:06.299
Jordan Neely was murdered.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:12.639
But bc Jordan was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:18.009
raising rents and stripping services to militarize itself while many in power

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:24.109
demonize the poor, the murderer gets protected w/ passive headlines + no charges.

00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:25.599
It’s disgusting.

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:31.769
Now, there are several pieces of debatable language there, mainly the reference to

00:08:32.109 --> 00:08:38.149
murder, which implies that the man who killed him did so unjustifiably and unlawfully.

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:48.079
But the point I want to focus on here is how she described Jordan Neely: “houseless” NOT “homeless”.

00:08:49.109 --> 00:08:55.469
While most TV channels and newspapers were describing Neely as “homeless”, AOC went

00:08:55.479 --> 00:09:01.209
for “houseless”, a term practically unknown outside some very specific circles.

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:07.339
This tweet about the incident has been seen 21 million times as of

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.469
the time of me recording this episode, and it introduced millions

00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:15.939
of Americans to a word that they had, until then, been unaware of.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:19.609
So, why did AOC use this word?

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:24.849
It wasn’t a mistake, and it’s not a common synonym for homeless.

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:26.259
She was making a point.

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:28.709
So what point was this?

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:35.399
Well, for several years, various advocacy groups have been pushing to stop the use of the

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:41.009
term “homeless”, as they believe that it is derogatory to the people it is describing.

00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:47.059
To quote one organisation directly, the Los Angeles Community Alliance:

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:54.066
“Not everyone has housing, but everyone has a home—including  our houseless  beneficiaries at LACA.

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:58.966
The term “homeless” makes the spaces they do call home sound

00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:03.156
illegitimate, when home represents far more than a location.

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:06.616
Instead, home is friends, family, and community.”

00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:07.666
END QUOTE

00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:13.746
In other words, because “home” has the connotation of comfort, happiness and

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:18.746
legitimacy, if you say that someone living on the streets is “homeless”, the

00:10:18.746 --> 00:10:23.316
implication is that they cannot be happy and comfortable where they live, and

00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:27.746
therefore you are demeaning and belittling the place that they have come to call home.

00:10:28.846 --> 00:10:33.226
What’s more, you are saying that the space they call home, be it the

00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:37.866
streets or a public park, is not a legitimate place to call home.

00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:43.646
And with the growing amount of people who are homeless or houseless in the

00:10:43.646 --> 00:10:49.036
United States, with almost 0.2% of the US population falling into this category,

00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:54.306
this has become an increasing point of contention, an area for discussion.

00:10:55.586 --> 00:11:00.126
What is the right word to describe these people, according to these groups?

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:07.256
“Houseless” is one option, as is “unhoused” or “people experiencing homelessness”.

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:09.716
It’s a complicated question.

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:15.806
Over half a million people fall into this category, and clearly there is a wide variety

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:20.846
of people, from someone who has been living on the streets for 10 years and suffers from

00:11:20.886 --> 00:11:25.066
addiction and mental health issues through to someone who has just lost their job and

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:29.626
has been sleeping on friend’s sofa for a couple of weeks through to a parent who recently

00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:33.906
separated from their partner and is living out of their car while they find a new place.

00:11:35.096 --> 00:11:36.826
Are they all “homeless”?

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:42.256
Are they “experiencing homelessness” or are they unhoused?

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:44.026
Are they “houseless"?

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:48.756
It’s a really interesting question that has triggered debate about the

00:11:48.766 --> 00:11:53.596
issue of housing and homelessness, or houselessness perhaps should I say.

00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:59.046
One of the main criticisms of the term “homelessness” is because it

00:11:59.046 --> 00:12:02.576
makes it sound like the streets are not a legitimate place to call home.

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:06.456
And this is a question of political opinion.

00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:12.196
If you believe that people should be free to live on the streets, to be able to live in

00:12:12.256 --> 00:12:18.926
tents on public streets and in public parks, then these areas can be a legitimate home.

00:12:19.796 --> 00:12:25.606
If, on the other hand, you believe that society shouldn’t be enabling people to live like this, as

00:12:25.606 --> 00:12:31.256
we should be trying to do everything we can to get people off the streets and into housing, then

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:37.016
language should accurately reflect the fact these are not legitimate places to live and call home.

00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:44.969
If this is your opinion, “homeless”, not “houseless” or “ unhoused” is the most appropriate term.

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:50.839
To some, especially on the political right, it has become yet another

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:55.319
sign of academics and policymakers using taxpayer money to have

00:12:55.699 --> 00:13:00.019
esoteric linguistic discussions rather than addressing the real problem.

00:13:00.939 --> 00:13:04.309
The US government provides billions of dollars in federal funding

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:08.309
for homeless assistance programmes, yet the number of homeless

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:12.809
people, or people experiencing homelessness, has continued to rise.

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:19.409
Furthermore, to the critics of this term, implying that the streets, and public

00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:24.599
spaces are a legitimate place for someone to call home is offensive in itself.

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:30.619
These organisations, instead of helping people off the streets, whether that's

00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:34.379
through finding some form of accommodation or helping them cure themselves

00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:38.999
of addiction, are implicitly saying “it’s ok to call the streets your home”.

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:46.549
And to the critics of the term, that’s not ok; it’s public property, not an individual’s home.

00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:51.139
But to perhaps the most important question that we haven’t yet

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:54.909
addressed: is it something that actually matters to homeless people?

00:13:56.149 --> 00:14:00.699
As a lexicographer from Dictionary.com put it, “there are three people in every

00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:06.759
conversation: the speaker, the person being spoken about, and the person being spoken to.

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:10.899
Too often in conversations about homeless people, according to

00:14:11.049 --> 00:14:15.279
this quote, the person being spoken about is absent from the room.”

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:19.139
So, what happens if you ask a homeless person?

00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:23.949
Is this something that homeless or houseless people care deeply about?

00:14:25.135 --> 00:14:29.375
In one of the original and most well-known thought-pieces about whether

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:33.535
homeless is an offensive term, the journalist wrote about a conversation

00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:37.445
with a homeless policy director, where she asked this very question.

00:14:38.305 --> 00:14:42.905
The journalist asked her what homeless people thought about being called “homeless”.

00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:44.795
Was it deeply offensive?

00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:48.112
Would they prefer “houseless” or “unhoused”?

00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:54.755
After all, the term was being used to describe them, so surely they should have an opinion about it.

00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:59.385
The policy director admitted that most homeless people don’t

00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:02.625
really care, they just wanted to be treated with respect.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:08.795
You can certainly argue about whether using the term “homeless” is disrespectful,

00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:13.505
but I think it would be hard to argue that the biggest concern of a homeless

00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:17.165
person is what language The New York Times is using to describe them.

00:15:18.075 --> 00:15:24.145
Now, clearly the issue of homelessness is very complicated, with no simple solutions.

00:15:24.405 --> 00:15:29.165
And indeed we have only looked at it through the very specific lens of language today.

00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:37.315
President Biden announced the lofty goal of reducing American homelessness by 25% by the year

00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:45.295
2025, and pledged to increase the federal budget to combat homelessness to $10 billion per year.

00:15:46.685 --> 00:15:52.245
Time will only tell whether he will succeed, but if you ask a homeless person what

00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:56.605
is going to have an impact, what really is going to move the needle, it seems to me

00:15:56.865 --> 00:16:01.225
that you wouldn’t find the term used to describe them right at the top of their list.

00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:07.255
OK then, that is it for this little exploration of evolving

00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:10.735
English, looked at through the lens of homes and homelessness.

00:16:11.225 --> 00:16:14.235
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:16:14.655 --> 00:16:18.315
Is there debate about what to call homeless people in your language?

00:16:18.685 --> 00:16:20.575
How has this changed over time?

00:16:21.115 --> 00:16:25.595
What other words have become politicised and no longer acceptable in your language?

00:16:26.075 --> 00:16:29.055
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:16:29.375 --> 00:16:31.895

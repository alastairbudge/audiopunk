Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:15.958
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.838
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:24.788
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the country of El

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:31.088
Salvador, and more specifically, its latest and controversial president, Nayib Bukele.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:36.678
To some, he is a harsh and dangerous disciplinarian with authoritarian

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:40.868
tendencies, a man who is behaving in an utterly irresponsible way

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:45.398
with the country’s legal system and already precarious finances.

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:51.528
To others, he is a voice of reason, a true leader who has made brave

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:55.788
decisions that have made his country a safer and more prosperous nation.

00:00:56.508 --> 00:01:00.643
OK then, let’s get right into it, and learn about Nayib

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:04.598
Bukele, the self-described “world’s coolest dictator”.

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:11.148
On the 5th of June 2021, the president of El Salvador

00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:15.018
stood in front of a podium, ready to make an announcement.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:21.718
Nayib Bukele, who was then a few weeks away from celebrating his 40th

00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:27.258
birthday, stood up and proudly announced that El Salvador would become

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:32.628
the first country in the world to recognise Bitcoin as legal currency.

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:41.480
Not just this, but El Salvador was setting aside $150 million of its budget to buy Bitcoin.

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:49.278
It was a big move, to say the least, and it was immediately all over the global news.

00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:52.928
What was he doing, commentators asked?

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:58.438
Who was this young man who was playing Russian roulette with his country’s finances?

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:05.394
These commentators were quick to pat themselves on the back when the very same day that

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:12.931
Bukele made this announcement, the price of Bitcoin crashed from $52,000 to US$43,000.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:19.351
This decision was emblematic of Bukele, and the direction in which he has

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:26.501
been taking El Salvador: controversial, unusual and unexpected, and most

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:31.781
likely one which the full impact of which will take many years to be shown.

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.491
Now, to understand how Bukele became president, we need to

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.861
talk a bit more about El Salvador before he was elected.

00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:47.081
As you may know, El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America.

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:54.721
Guatemala is to the north, Honduras to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the south and west.

00:02:56.331 --> 00:03:01.401
In economic terms, it is not a prosperous part of the world, and the region

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:05.861
has suffered from high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality.

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:13.501
El Salvador, like neighbouring Honduras, has also suffered from high levels of gang

00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:21.011
violence and murder, and for much of the 2010s had the highest murder rate in the world.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:31.061
In 2015, the murder rate in the country rose to 103 per 100,000, meaning that

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:37.171
more than 1 in every 1,000 people in El Salvador was violently killed that year.

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:43.731
It was, it's perhaps no exaggeration to say, the most dangerous place in the world.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:53.541
As a point of comparison, the murder rate in the UK is around 1 per 100,000, so in 2015

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:59.901
you were 100 times more likely to be killed in El Salvador than you were in the UK.

00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.761
Those odds don’t sound like much fun to me, and they

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:08.101
clearly weren’t much fun for the citizens of El Salvador.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:12.531
And there didn’t seem to be much of an end in sight.

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.951
The murder rate and violence had been high for several years.

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:25.461
A truce between two major gangs, a peace agreement, had been brokered in 2012, but when

00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:31.891
the agreement broke down, the bullets started to fly again, and the murder rate soared.

00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:37.971
And, as you might expect, given this huge level of violence and

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:41.851
real danger, there was minimal foreign investment in the country.

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.971
It was dangerous, there was a very real chance of getting shot, the rule of

00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:53.021
law was weak, and this was a huge deterrent for potential foreign investors.

00:04:54.571 --> 00:05:00.201
There were two main political parties in El Salvador, one left wing and one right wing.

00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:08.871
The left wing party, the FMLN, had been in power since 2009, and the gang

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:14.521
violence and deaths had exploded under its watch, and the right wing party

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:18.401
hadn’t shown any particular signs that it would be able to do any better.

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:22.311
Life in El Salvador was pretty bleak.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.501
So when it came to the presidential elections in

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:32.081
2019, there was an understandable appetite for change.

00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:39.341
Not just superficial change, a polished career politician who goes on TV and talks about

00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:44.331
how they really care about the average citizen, and how they truly understand the country.

00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:45.411
No.

00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:50.731
There was appetite for someone who was a breath of fresh air, who spoke

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:56.101
differently, looked different, and had a very different vision for the future.

00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.074
This person was, of course, Nayib Bukele.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:07.011
Perhaps you can tell from his name that he was a little different from everyone else.

00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:12.821
His father was a Palestinian immigrant who opened the first McDonald’s franchise

00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:18.321
in El Salvador, and went on to have a wide-ranging and successful business career.

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:23.739
Bukele’s background was in business, working first for his

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:27.499
father’s advertising agency before setting out on his own.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.729
And when he turned 30, he announced that he would pack it all in,

00:06:34.113 --> 00:06:37.869
he would close the door on his business career, and enter politics.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.379
He took the traditional route to begin with, joining the major

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:49.099
left-wing party, the FMLN, and became the mayor first of a small town

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:54.429
before being elected mayor of the capital city, San Salvador, in 2015.

00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:57.749
And he was exceptionally popular.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.489
He launched a programme to install street lights in the capital to deter crime, he

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:09.579
donated his salary to social initiatives to stop children joining gangs, he cracked down

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:15.729
on violence and corruption and was generally seen as a man who could get stuff done.

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:24.209
He was also a keen and adept user of social media, and he was only in his early 30s at

00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:29.519
the time, so he was seen as much more approachable than the often grey-haired men and

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:35.149
women who Salvadorans–people from El Salvador–were used to seeing in positions of power.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:40.999
He had a sort of boy-wonder status, and this ruffled the

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:45.024
feathers of some colleagues within his party, the FMLN.

00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:53.839
In 2017, Bukele ended up being kicked out of the party, and shortly after he announced that

00:07:53.839 --> 00:08:00.609
he would start his own political movement, and ultimately run for the presidency in 2019.

00:08:02.094 --> 00:08:08.874
Fast forward a couple of years, and he won the 2019 election by a landslide, winning

00:08:08.924 --> 00:08:16.034
53% of the vote, while the other two main parties got 32% and 14% respectively.

00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:23.544
His message was a simple one: I am the only person who can fix corruption,

00:08:23.924 --> 00:08:28.384
get rid of the gangs, and can make your lives safer and better.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:35.184
Or to quote his campaign slogan, ‘There’s enough money as long as no one steals it’.

00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.801
He was young, charismatic, and could be found just as often

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.161
in a black leather jacket as in a formal business suit.

00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:50.271
More importantly, he seemed to bridge the left-right divide.

00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:53.351
He had traditionally been aligned with the left,

00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:57.961
but he positioned himself as neither right nor left.

00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:02.871
He was the man who would crack down on gang violence and crime, and

00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.921
that was an issue that affected everyone, regardless of political views.

00:09:09.427 --> 00:09:11.637
And you may know what came next.

00:09:12.907 --> 00:09:20.277
In 2019, El Salvador had an estimated 67,000 citizens who were members of

00:09:20.277 --> 00:09:25.137
criminal gangs, and this is out of a population of just over 6 million.

00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:32.673
In other words, more than 1% of the country’s population was an active gang member.

00:09:34.182 --> 00:09:39.807
Bukele’s plan to eradicate gang violence was, on one level, blissfully

00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:44.767
simple: round up the gang members and remove them from society.

00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:49.777
If they are off the streets, imprisoned, they cannot commit crimes.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:56.777
Shortly after his election, he announced something called the Territorial Control Plan,

00:09:57.267 --> 00:10:03.007
which was a seven-part plan to eradicate gang violence from the streets of El Salvador.

00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:11.907
This was in 2019, and between then and now, more than 80,000

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:15.687
suspected gang members have been rounded up and sent to prison.

00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:21.607
And we must put an emphasis on “suspected” there, as these were

00:10:21.607 --> 00:10:25.817
not 80,000 people who had been proved guilty in a court of law.

00:10:27.318 --> 00:10:31.915
Fortunately, the fact that many gang members had very visible tattoos

00:10:32.175 --> 00:10:37.195
made tracking them down relatively easy, but human rights campaigners

00:10:37.195 --> 00:10:41.515
have raised alarm bells that many people have been wrongly imprisoned.

00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:46.795
Indeed, over 10% of those arrested and imprisoned have been

00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:51.965
released, but for the remaining 90%, they are now behind bars.

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:57.795
And Bukele has wasted no time sharing videos of the miserable

00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:00.865
conditions in which these gang members have to live.

00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:06.995
Their heads shaved, no mattresses to sleep on, minimal food, and mixed up

00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:11.225
completely so they are not with their old friends or fellow gang members.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.205
Bukele’s intention is twofold.

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:21.635
First, remove the dangerous criminals from the streets, and secondly make it

00:11:21.665 --> 00:11:26.735
abundantly clear to anyone who might consider joining a gang that you will end up

00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:32.545
in prison, living in awful conditions, that gang life is anything but glamorous.

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:37.145
It seems to have worked, so far at least.

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:42.965
Every year since Bukele has been in power, the murder rate has reduced.

00:11:44.475 --> 00:11:48.155
And earlier this year, he proudly announced that the

00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:54.285
murder rate in 2023 was 2.4 per 100,000 inhabitants.

00:11:55.095 --> 00:12:01.915
Remember, it was 103 in 2015 at the most recent height of the violence, and

00:12:01.915 --> 00:12:08.785
even 38 when he was elected president in 2019, so in the course of 4 years, he

00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:17.035
managed to reduce it by 94%, a reduction of 98% from the bloody days of 2015.

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:19.525
The plan worked.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:24.075
The gang members are behind bars, so they cannot terrorise the

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:28.205
streets and kill hard-working citizens or each other any more.

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:35.135
And, as you might expect, in El Salvador this policy is incredibly popular.

00:12:36.365 --> 00:12:43.155
According to polls taken at the height of the crackdowns, between 80 and 90% of Salvadorans

00:12:43.525 --> 00:12:48.975
approved of them, saying ‘yes, lock up these men, we do not want them on our streets’.

00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:56.015
Abroad, however, his methods and agenda have come under greater scrutiny.

00:12:57.245 --> 00:13:02.155
Human rights campaigners and democracy advocates have accused him of striking

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:07.825
deals with gang leaders to stop the violence and of not having a long-term solution

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:13.275
to the reality that almost 2% of his country’s population is now incarcerated.

00:13:14.525 --> 00:13:20.795
The New York Times ran an article with the headline ‘El Salvador Decimated Its Ruthless Gangs.

00:13:20.835 --> 00:13:22.635
But at What Cost?’.

00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:28.405
The article began with a lot of what can only be described as positive outcomes:

00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:33.585
“Now, children play soccer late into the evening on fields that were gang turf.

00:13:34.205 --> 00:13:34.575
Ms.

00:13:34.575 --> 00:13:38.205
Inglés gathers soil for her plants next to an abandoned

00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:41.255
building that residents say was used for gang killings.

00:13:41.785 --> 00:13:43.295
Homicides plunged.

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:47.725
Extortion payments imposed by gangs on businesses and residents,

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:51.995
once an economy unto itself, also declined, analysts said.

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.165
“You can walk freely,” Ms.

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:54.870
Inglés said.

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:56.095
“So much has changed.”

00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:57.555
End quote.

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:05.005
All good so far, but the article, and many more like it, goes on to

00:14:05.015 --> 00:14:09.255
criticise the authoritarian tendencies of Bukele and his government.

00:14:10.165 --> 00:14:15.705
Mass arrests, filling the jails, the establishment of something not far off

00:14:15.725 --> 00:14:20.985
a police state, and the maltreatment of the prisoners locked up in jails.

00:14:22.225 --> 00:14:27.425
And they also criticise the long term plan, or rather the lack of one.

00:14:28.525 --> 00:14:30.675
What does he do, commentators ask?

00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:35.035
There is no public plan to release or rehabilitate the

00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:39.165
gang members, so do they simply rot in jail forever?

00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:43.935
If so, that is hardly a humane way to treat people

00:14:44.025 --> 00:14:46.985
who are still, at the end of the day, your citizens.

00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:52.965
He has also been criticised for subverting the democratic process.

00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:59.975
The constitution of El Salvador doesn’t allow for a president to serve a consequent

00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:06.165
second term in office, but when Bukele’s time as president was nearly up, he

00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:12.025
appointed new judges who reinterpreted the constitution to mean that a president

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:18.345
could run for a second term if they stepped back from the job for 6 months, which

00:15:18.555 --> 00:15:24.415
Bukele claimed he did, becoming “interim president” rather than full “president”.

00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:30.565
By brushing aside the constitution, he was subverting democracy and

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:35.675
dragging the country towards becoming a dictatorship, so his critics said.

00:15:37.095 --> 00:15:43.225
These criticisms tend to come from outside the borders of El Salvador, from abroad.

00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:51.315
Of course, ultimately, he is only answerable to his domestic audience, the people of El Salvador.

00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:58.175
And, after having supposedly stepped back from the Presidency for 6 months and

00:15:58.385 --> 00:16:04.495
reinterpreted the constitution, he was free to run again, to run for re-election.

00:16:05.775 --> 00:16:09.835
The people of El Salvador did have the chance to have their say.

00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:14.675
There was another presidential election earlier this year, in February

00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:22.065
of 2024, and Bukele won by an even greater margin than in 2019, claiming

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:28.125
85% of the vote, while the traditionally two largest parties got 6% each.

00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:34.945
In his home country, where it actually matters, Bukele is phenomenally popular.

00:16:35.665 --> 00:16:40.145
He has one of the highest approval ratings of a leader in the entire world,

00:16:40.565 --> 00:16:46.305
with between 90 and 95% of people in El Salvador approving of his leadership.

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:52.676
And to give you a point of comparison, the British Prime Minister, Rishi

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:59.085
Sunak, as of the time of recording has a popularity rating of a miserly 16%.

00:17:00.565 --> 00:17:06.065
For the foreign commentator who prides the democratic process above anything else,

00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:11.975
this is somewhat difficult to reconcile, as the people of El Salvador are evidently

00:17:11.985 --> 00:17:17.115
happy to support a more authoritarian government in exchange for public safety.

00:17:18.535 --> 00:17:20.015
And who can blame them?

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:25.285
Most people listening to this show are fortunate enough to not live

00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:28.965
in a country where 1 in every 1,000 people are murdered every year.

00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:35.081
But, if you did, and if finally someone managed to lock up the men

00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:40.491
who had terrorised, brutalised, extorted and freely murdered in their

00:17:40.501 --> 00:17:44.641
communities for decades, would your primary concern be their well-being?

00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:46.571
I imagine not.

00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:54.001
For the average voter in El Salvador, these gang members do not deserve any kind of favourable

00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:59.531
treatment, let them rot away behind bars, that’s preferable to releasing them and hoping that

00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:04.411
they will have somehow learned their lesson and will become upstanding and honest citizens.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.591
Bukele has proven that he can make the country safer for the average citizen,

00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:15.021
and if that is the primary concern for the people of the country, the

00:18:15.021 --> 00:18:19.321
most important thing is the outcome, not the way in which it is achieved.

00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:24.311
We started this episode by talking about Bukele’s decision

00:18:24.491 --> 00:18:28.081
to introduce Bitcoin as an official currency of El Salvador.

00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:36.321
This might be one of the things that he is best known for outside of the country, but according

00:18:36.321 --> 00:18:42.681
to most polls, whether El Salvador accepts Bitcoin or not, or whether Bukele chooses to buy

00:18:42.701 --> 00:18:48.641
some Bitcoin with national funds, is kind of immaterial to the average person in El Salvador.

00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:50.971
It is not a major concern.

00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:56.751
What regular voters want is security, they want the freedom to walk

00:18:56.771 --> 00:19:00.511
the streets without fearing being hit by a bullet or without being

00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:05.051
exploited by gangs for protection money, they want their communities back.

00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:08.821
And that is precisely what Bukele has done.

00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:12.161
But this is just the first step.

00:19:12.941 --> 00:19:16.091
With the gangs off the streets, it is time to build.

00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:19.111
And there is a lot of work to be done.

00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:24.831
The economy of El Salvador is still in poor shape, and growth

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.411
has been slow while the government focussed on locking up gangs.

00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:34.411
But there is little doubt that, with approval ratings of over 90% and

00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:39.041
freshly voted back in for another 5 years, the people of El Salvador

00:19:39.351 --> 00:19:43.981
feel that Nayib Bukele is their best chance of prosperity and security.

00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:49.181
Time will only tell if he remains as popular in 2029.

00:19:51.711 --> 00:19:55.221
Ok then, that is it for this episode on Nayib Bukele,

00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:57.831
the self-proclaimed “world’s coolest dictator”.

00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:01.881
As a quick reminder, this was part three of a three-part

00:20:01.881 --> 00:20:04.791
mini-series on the loose theme of Latin America.

00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:10.691
In part one, we talked about the collapse of Venezuela, and in part two, which was one of our

00:20:10.691 --> 00:20:15.861
member-only episodes, we talked about the battle between Wall Street and the country of Argentina.

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:20.531
Of course, you can listen to all of them independently, but hopefully

00:20:20.531 --> 00:20:23.931
they are a nice little trio on a similar but unrelated theme.

00:20:24.971 --> 00:20:29.411
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:30.101 --> 00:20:35.061
I’m Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I’ll catch you in the next episode.

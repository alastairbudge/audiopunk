Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:16.608
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:20.798
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:26.258
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a subject we

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:30.788
haven’t covered before, a subject that might make some people uncomfortable.

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:34.908
And that subject is porn, pornography.

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:40.748
Now, I should give you some kind of parental guidance warning,  in case you want to press pause.

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:47.393
In this episode we are going to talk about porn and the porn industry, but, if

00:00:47.393 --> 00:00:52.373
it changes your mind about whether to listen or not, it will be in no way sexual.

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:57.783
Instead, we are going to talk about porn and money, specifically,

00:00:57.973 --> 00:01:02.163
the business of the porn industry and how it deals with money.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.973
It’s a fascinating story that involves payment cards, secretive

00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:12.783
multimillionaires, the so-called “creator economy”, and lots and lots of money.

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:17.539
OK then, Porn and Big Money.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.179
On March 16th of 2023, a press release was sent out.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.059
The title of the press release started “ECP Announces Acquisition of MindGeek”

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.599
.
If I read you the start of the press release itself,

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.319
you’ll probably think it was slightly uninteresting.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.359
"Montreal, Quebec [March 16th, 2023] – Ethical Capital Partners [ECP], a private equity firm

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.749
managed by a multidisciplinary team with regulatory, law enforcement, public engagement and

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:02.579
finance experience, today announced that it has acquired MindGeek, a technology and media company."

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.149
Now, so far it reads like any other press release a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.869
business might put out after it has acquired another.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.109
Pretty boring.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.599
But then it gets a little more interesting.

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:22.579
“MindGeek, a technology and media company, owner of a large portfolio

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.913
of adult entertainment properties, including Pornhub, YouPorn,

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:35.269
Redtube, Brazzers, Men.com, Sean Cody, Trans Angels and Nutaku.”

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.129
Now, you might have heard of some of those names, you might not.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.419
Don’t worry, I’m not going to ask you.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.329
This list includes some of the most popular porn websites on the planet.

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:55.579
The first one on the list, Pornhub, is visited by 100 million people

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:01.849
every single day, and averages 100 billion videos watched every year.

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:10.169
To put that in perspective, it’s about 12.5 porn videos watched for every person on the planet.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.699
It’s one of the most popular websites in the world, by some

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.199
calculations it’s one of the top 10 most visited websites worldwide.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.949
It’s a big deal.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.459
And it’s only one of the many porn websites owned by this company, MindGeek.

00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:34.304
But, until very recently, nobody really knew anything about MindGeek.

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:39.624
It was a privately held company that operated in almost complete

00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:44.284
secrecy, making hundreds of millions of dollars every year, attracting

00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:49.384
over a hundred million people to its websites every single day.

00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:55.914
And in fact, even today, we don’t know a huge amount more about MindGeek,

00:03:56.374 --> 00:04:00.544
despite the power it exerts over much of the world’s population.

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:05.684
This episode isn’t going to be just about MindGeek, though.

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:12.104
In this episode we are going to look at the evolution of porn and money.

00:04:12.864 --> 00:04:19.014
We’ll see that MindGeek has an important role to play, but we’ll focus on three main stages.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:23.814
First, we’ll look at a brief history of the business of porn.

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:31.124
Then, we’ll look at how this entire business model was upended, devastated, by the internet.

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:37.744
And then we’ll look specifically at the problem of turning all this attention into money.

00:04:39.184 --> 00:04:42.214
So, let’s start with a brief history of porn.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:49.244
There’s evidence of sexual or erotic paintings going back thousands of years.

00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:56.584
The Kama Sutra was written in the third century AD, and depending on how prudish or

00:04:56.794 --> 00:05:02.844
open minded a society was, erotic works were more or less welcomed as the years went on.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.990
Fast forward to America in the late 1960s, there was a 15-year-period

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.840
from 1969 to 1984 that would go on to be called “The Golden Age of Porn”.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.180
Actors and actresses made good money, and what had previously been a smutty,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.710
hidden genre, became more acceptable and moved more into the mainstream.

00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.421
The business might have still been unusual and

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:38.751
controversial, but it was not particularly complicated.

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:45.432
Film studios paid actors and actresses to make a porn film, that film

00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:49.962
was put onto a video and sold in shops or shown at adult cinemas.

00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:55.062
It was basically Hollywood, but worse acting and fewer clothes.

00:05:56.302 --> 00:06:03.582
Then the internet arrived, and with it came both opportunities and challenges for the porn industry.

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:06.272
Firstly, the opportunity.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.142
Well, the opportunity was massive.

00:06:09.942 --> 00:06:16.052
The internet meant that anyone, anywhere, could watch porn on a computer without having to go

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:21.752
to a shop and go through the perhaps embarrassing encounter of buying it from another human.

00:06:23.012 --> 00:06:27.772
Porn studios could put up websites, allowing anyone anywhere in the

00:06:27.772 --> 00:06:33.722
world to consume their content instantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:38.705
But with this came two big challenges.

00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:43.295
Firstly, the challenge of how to make money from online

00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:47.815
porn, or specifically, how to accept online payments.

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:53.435
For most “normal” companies, this isn’t an issue, it's not a problem.

00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:58.625
There are lots of payment processors, and all you need to do is hook up

00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:03.985
your website and ta-da, anyone with a payment card can use it to pay you.

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:11.225
The problem is that most normal payment processors won’t deal with porn websites.

00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:18.085
There are plenty of reasons for this: firstly, there is a reputational risk.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:22.705
Payment companies simply don’t want their brands to be associated with an

00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:28.705
industry that is controversial at best and immoral and exploitative at worst.

00:07:30.225 --> 00:07:35.815
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the chargeback rate is higher.

00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:41.175
What this means is that there is a higher percentage of people who call

00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:45.315
their bank and say, “hey, I didn't make that payment, please block it”.

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:51.905
This hardly ever happens for, let’s say, a website that helps you improve your English,

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:56.745
because it’s not an embarrassing thing to pay for, you wouldn’t be embarrassed if your

00:07:56.745 --> 00:08:01.925
partner saw your bank statement and saw a transaction for Leonardo English Limited.

00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:03.655
Maybe you’d even be proud!

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:11.305
But if your partner looked at your bank statement and saw a charge for “pornography services

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:17.465
limited”, you can imagine that some people might prefer to say “someone stole my credit card,

00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:23.655
watch, I’ll call the bank right now” rather than admitting “actually that was, uh, that was me”.

00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:31.135
It costs the card processing company money every time this happens, so many of them

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:37.015
understandably prefer not to deal with porn businesses precisely because of this trouble.

00:08:38.175 --> 00:08:42.225
There are plenty of card processing companies that do deal with porn

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:46.695
companies, but the fees are higher, because of this increased risk.

00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:49.465
But, we haven’t finished yet.

00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:55.525
Then there are the all-powerful companies that sit between the payment processing

00:08:55.525 --> 00:09:01.055
companies and the customer’s bank: VISA and Mastercard, the two companies

00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:06.375
that control almost 85% of the payment cards in the United States, and are

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:10.905
responsible for something like 20 trillion dollars worth of spending worldwide.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:19.595
VISA and Mastercard have brands and reputations to protect, but they also have fees to collect.

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:25.665
They didn’t want to ban all purchases of adult content on the VISA and Mastercard

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:30.845
networks; they were happy to be associated with certain types of pornography but not

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:38.115
others, so what this led to was essentially VISA and Mastercard setting guidelines

00:09:38.435 --> 00:09:42.585
about the types of pornography that could be bought with its payment cards.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:49.575
We aren’t going to go into the explicit detail of this, but the less

00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:55.725
socially acceptable a sexual act is, the less likely VISA and Mastercard

00:09:55.725 --> 00:10:00.165
would be to allow their customers to buy content containing these acts.

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:09.085
Of course, VISA and Mastercard do not do this on a video by video basis, but the porn studios making

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:16.495
the pornographic content are aware, more or less, of what performers can and can’t do, so they

00:10:16.495 --> 00:10:23.195
ensure that their content plays by VISA and Mastercard’s rules otherwise they risk getting blocked.

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:28.775
So, the curious situation that this has created is that VISA and

00:10:28.775 --> 00:10:33.725
Mastercard became the de facto regulators of the porn industry.

00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:38.675
They don’t officially say what types of pornography can

00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:42.505
be made and they don't ban pornography from being made.

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:47.495
Technically they have no kind of oversight on the porn industry at all.

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:53.245
But they control what could be bought through their payment processing networks.

00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:59.455
And clearly, if porn can’t be bought with VISA and Mastercard cards, it’s

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:04.285
very hard to sell, meaning it’s less profitable to make it in the first place.

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:11.265
OK, so this was our first challenge that the internet brought along, the problem of how to

00:11:11.265 --> 00:11:17.415
actually take payments, and how VISA and Mastercard got caught up in the regulation of porn.

00:11:18.785 --> 00:11:24.975
This challenge was something that could be overcome; the porn studios just needed to play

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:31.025
by the rules, they needed to pay a bit more to process payments, but it was manageable.

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:37.105
The second challenge threatened to upturn the entire industry.

00:11:38.315 --> 00:11:44.315
This was, as you might have guessed, the arrival of what's called the tube sites,

00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:49.855
websites like PornHub and the others you heard mentioned at the start of the episode.

00:11:51.475 --> 00:11:55.225
The huge innovation by these websites was that they allowed

00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:59.635
anyone to upload their own content, their own videos.

00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:05.855
These could be amateur videos that the person had made, it was their own content.

00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:08.995
But this was a minority.

00:12:10.215 --> 00:12:16.305
In most cases, the videos uploaded were videos that had been made by the porn studios, and

00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:21.895
uploaded straight to the tube websites, without the consent of the studio that owned the copyright.

00:12:23.565 --> 00:12:28.745
And for a long time, the tube sites did little-to-no moderation.

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:34.335
They put up their hands and said, “hey, we’re just a content aggregator.

00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:38.745
If you can prove that it’s your content, send us a request and we’ll take it down”.

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:43.575
But with tens of thousands of hours of content being

00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:47.835
uploaded every single day, it was impossible to keep up.

00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:54.805
The result of this was that, by the late 2000s, porn studios found that

00:12:54.805 --> 00:12:58.695
practically all of their content was available on these tube sites.

00:13:00.025 --> 00:13:03.525
And, to make matters worse, the tube sites were

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:07.455
completely free, the viewers didn’t need to pay a penny.

00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:13.575
Clearly, from a viewer’s perspective, it was an attractive proposition.

00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:18.235
A website full of all the pornography someone could ever want, a

00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:22.965
lifetime of porn, all available for free at the click of a button.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:28.955
Yes, there are clearly huge societal consequences to this, many of

00:13:28.955 --> 00:13:33.005
which I’m sure will only become obvious in years to come, but we need

00:13:33.005 --> 00:13:37.535
to keep our focus here on the money, on the evolving business of porn.

00:13:39.095 --> 00:13:45.065
Suddenly, the tube sites had all of the power, they had all the eyeballs.

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:51.665
Initially, they weren’t particularly good at converting this attention into hard

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:58.145
cash, but starting in 2006, a German computer programmer called Fabian Thylmann

00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:02.655
sensed the potential of these tube sites, and bought up a load of different

00:14:02.704 --> 00:14:07.255
websites, getting the ball rolling on what would eventually become MindGeek.

00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:13.035
Now, bringing it back to the money again, Fabian Thylmann was one of the

00:14:13.045 --> 00:14:16.775
first people to understand the financial potential of the tube sites.

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:24.795
Yes, they were free for the user, but with so many people visiting them every day, there was

00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:30.225
a lot of potential to monetise them first through adverts and then through subscriptions.

00:14:31.784 --> 00:14:35.824
There were, of course, adverts for other types of porn websites, but

00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:40.744
there were adverts for adult products, gambling sites, and indeed

00:14:40.824 --> 00:14:45.812
all manner of products that were completely unrelated to vice at all.

00:14:47.114 --> 00:14:53.984
And with tens of millions of people visiting them every day, there was a lot of money to be made.

00:14:55.544 --> 00:15:02.104
Just quite how much money is somewhat unknown, but in 2018 MindGeek

00:15:02.274 --> 00:15:06.827
claimed that its revenue for the year had reached $460 million.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.384
Now, that is clearly a lot of money, but to put it in

00:15:11.384 --> 00:15:14.894
perspective, Netflix now makes that much every week.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:20.481
The counterargument is, of course, that Netflix pays tens of billions of dollars every year to

00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:26.641
create its own content or to licence it from movie studios, while MindGeek doesn’t pay anything.

00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:31.991
Anyway, “free” porn is big business, big business indeed.

00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:40.991
And it turned out that most of the biggest “free” porn sites were owned by MindGeek, which had

00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:46.845
secretly been bought by an incredibly secretive German multimillionaire called Bernd Bergmair.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:52.441
His ownership of the company, by the way, would only be revealed after

00:15:52.441 --> 00:15:57.076
an in depth investigation by the Financial Times in July of 2021.

00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:00.451
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:05.781
In late 2020, something happened that would cause huge problems to Bernd

00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:10.951
Bergmair, to MindGeek’s business, and indeed to the business of free porn.

00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:17.591
And this all comes down again to the unsexy but important business

00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:21.731
of payment processing, of how payments are made with payment cards.

00:16:23.256 --> 00:16:27.586
There were increasing stories in the news about videos of people that had been

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:32.896
uploaded to the tube sites without their consent, without their permission, and

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:38.706
stories of all sorts of very unsuitable content that had been uploaded to the sites.

00:16:40.203 --> 00:16:48.303
The New York Times ran a story in December 2020 about how PornHub allowed videos of underage

00:16:48.303 --> 00:16:55.283
children to be posted on its website, and told several stories about how videos of sexual

00:16:55.283 --> 00:17:00.803
abuse and all sorts of horrible things were not taken down by the site administrators.

00:17:02.223 --> 00:17:03.833
It was a shocking story.

00:17:04.813 --> 00:17:07.873
Doubtless lots of people read it over their morning coffee and

00:17:07.873 --> 00:17:11.253
thought, “this is terrible, someone should do something about it”.

00:17:12.723 --> 00:17:16.133
One person decided to actually do something about it.

00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:22.103
His name was Bill Ackman, and he was a billionaire investor,

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:25.913
which I guess makes doing things about things a bit easier.

00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:32.133
Ackman called up the CEOs of the payment companies and essentially said,

00:17:32.723 --> 00:17:36.873
“look, you’re making money from this website that has horrible content.

00:17:37.543 --> 00:17:38.073
Stop it”.

00:17:39.553 --> 00:17:43.803
And because he was a particularly powerful and influential investor,

00:17:44.183 --> 00:17:49.783
the CEOs listened and announced that they would no longer allow VISA and

00:17:49.783 --> 00:17:54.413
Mastercards cards to be used on MindGeek websites and their affiliates.

00:17:55.683 --> 00:18:00.013
As you might imagine, this spelled big trouble for MindGeek.

00:18:00.573 --> 00:18:03.963
People couldn’t pay for any MindGeek services, and

00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:07.433
advertisers weren’t able to pay their bills to MindGeek.

00:18:08.553 --> 00:18:12.253
Overnight it was cut off from the world’s card payment

00:18:12.253 --> 00:18:15.853
systems, its source of revenue dried up in an instant.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:23.140
It took action to remove some of its more controversial videos, removing 9 million videos

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.790
practically overnight, and taking the number of videos on the website down to 4 million.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.540
Obviously, that’s still a lot of porn, but it had an immediate impact;

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.060
its traffic, the number of people going to its website dropped by a third.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.240
And for a business that makes money by people coming to its website, clearly, that was problematic.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.240
But it wasn’t only MindGeek that was in trouble.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.070
VISA and Mastercard were too.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:01.490
See, a young lady took VISA and Mastercard to court, accusing the two payment processing

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:07.760
companies of profiting from a sexual video of her that was shared to PornHub without her consent.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:14.060
The case was eventually dismissed, but this really ruffled the feathers

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.020
of the two payment processing giants, and would have knock-on effects.

00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:23.183
And specifically, it would affect a company that doesn’t

00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:27.742
necessarily consider itself a porn company: OnlyFans.

00:19:28.564 --> 00:19:33.143
OnlyFans, in case you weren’t aware, is a website that calls itself

00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:37.813
“the social platform revolutionising creator and fan connections”.

00:19:38.733 --> 00:19:45.863
It was most famous for allowing people to share explicit content with their “fans” for a fee.

00:19:46.813 --> 00:19:53.146
To put that in plain English, men and women, but it was mainly women, could upload

00:19:53.373 --> 00:19:57.753
naked pictures and videos to the platform, and people could pay to see them.

00:19:58.893 --> 00:20:04.713
And in the summer of 2021, OnlyFans put out a statement saying that

00:20:04.723 --> 00:20:08.713
it would no longer accept sexually explicit content on its platform.

00:20:09.663 --> 00:20:14.673
It was somewhat of a shock, a bit like Disney saying that it wouldn’t make any

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:19.393
more cartoons or McDonald’s announcing that it would stop selling hamburgers.

00:20:20.123 --> 00:20:24.973
Sexually explicit content was the thing that had turned OnlyFans into

00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:30.303
something of a household name, so people started asking themselves why

00:20:30.543 --> 00:20:33.913
it would suddenly cut off what seemed to be the majority of its business.

00:20:35.483 --> 00:20:39.303
The answer to why it did this comes back to payments.

00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:45.723
Specifically, it was very afraid of being cut off by VISA and Mastercard,

00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:49.973
which were both somewhat traumatised by the MindGeek experience.

00:20:51.243 --> 00:20:57.793
Suddenly it seemed clear that VISA and Mastercard could be considered liable for content

00:20:57.813 --> 00:21:02.853
uploaded to porn websites, and that was an uncomfortable position for them to be in.

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:08.927
Now, OnlyFans has since gone back on this decision, but it was a

00:21:08.927 --> 00:21:12.507
sign of the power of the credit card companies on the adult industry.

00:21:13.847 --> 00:21:17.137
So, where does this leave the porn industry today?

00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:23.217
Clearly, the demand for pornography is going nowhere, there is little question of that.

00:21:24.257 --> 00:21:30.097
The question is about where the money goes, and how the flow of payments work.

00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:37.577
For porn to exist, someone needs to make it, and those people need to be paid

00:21:37.747 --> 00:21:42.147
for what I think most people would consider not a particularly desirable job.

00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:44.647
But who pays?

00:21:45.577 --> 00:21:50.557
In a pre-internet era, the studios could pay the actors, knowing full-well

00:21:50.557 --> 00:21:54.367
that they would make money from the sale of the videos and magazines.

00:21:55.556 --> 00:22:01.746
In the era of the tube websites, Porn 2.0 as it has been dubbed, who is the customer?

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:05.866
The person watching the porn is almost never paying,

00:22:06.216 --> 00:22:09.026
because of the proliferation of free porn websites.

00:22:09.776 --> 00:22:16.566
Some money comes from porn subscriptions, but VISA and Mastercard are increasingly wary of

00:22:16.566 --> 00:22:22.336
this, and it’s harder and harder for porn websites to take payments directly from customers.

00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:27.976
Then there are the advertisers, but several of these porn-focussed

00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:32.116
advertising networks have also been banned by VISA and Mastercard.

00:22:33.176 --> 00:22:36.746
Previously, companies wanting to advertise on porn websites would

00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:40.396
pay the porn websites with credit cards, but payments to some of the

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:44.616
biggest porn advertising websites are now banned by VISA and Mastercard.

00:22:45.986 --> 00:22:50.306
So, if it is being made so difficult by payment companies for

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:54.616
porn companies to make money, how can the porn industry survive?

00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:59.886
Well, the reality is that, even though it’s harder than ever for porn websites

00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:04.996
to actually get paid, the sheer amount of people who visit them means that the

00:23:05.006 --> 00:23:10.536
opportunity is still massive, and there are plenty of advertisers who are willing

00:23:10.536 --> 00:23:15.096
to do whatever it takes to get in front of the massive audiences on porn sites.

00:23:16.006 --> 00:23:21.956
As you’ll remember, there are 100 million people who visit PornHub every single day.

00:23:22.686 --> 00:23:25.346
Clearly, that’s a lot of people, a lot of eyeballs.

00:23:26.686 --> 00:23:31.016
And to think back to the start of the episode, MindGeek, the

00:23:31.146 --> 00:23:35.756
company that owns most of these porn websites, was recently sold.

00:23:37.136 --> 00:23:42.043
The acquisition of the business is somewhat confusing, and there are plenty

00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:46.543
of people who have raised questions about what actually happened there.

00:23:47.913 --> 00:23:50.953
Yes, there are the “official” reasons that were provided in

00:23:50.953 --> 00:23:54.733
the press release, but a lot of it smelled a little fishy.

00:23:56.113 --> 00:24:01.333
Firstly, the private equity fund that bought it is called Ethical

00:24:01.453 --> 00:24:05.993
Capital Partners, which is an odd name for a company that now controls

00:24:06.123 --> 00:24:10.403
the world’s supply of pornography, almost as if it was an inside joke.

00:24:11.343 --> 00:24:14.133
Secondly, there doesn’t seem to be much information

00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:18.433
about the fund, where it got the money to buy MindGeek.

00:24:19.113 --> 00:24:24.553
It must have been a significant amount of money, but whose money is anyone’s guess.

00:24:25.953 --> 00:24:32.223
Thirdly, the people running the fund, and thereby owning MindGeek, don’t seem to

00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:36.983
have much experience doing this at all, which has left people questioning whether

00:24:36.983 --> 00:24:42.623
it’s simply a front for someone else, a disguise for the real owner of Mindgeek.

00:24:44.023 --> 00:24:48.573
As a result, ultimately, only a tiny number of people

00:24:48.883 --> 00:24:52.333
know who owns and controls the world’s supply of porn.

00:24:53.723 --> 00:24:59.903
Now, no matter your opinions on the rights and wrongs of pornography, it exists.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:04.413
And it is incredibly popular, with some estimates suggesting

00:25:04.413 --> 00:25:08.723
that as much as 30% of internet traffic is pornography.

00:25:09.823 --> 00:25:16.173
And with this comes extreme power, the power to shape sexual habits and norms, the

00:25:16.173 --> 00:25:22.103
power to exploit and abuse, and the intimate knowledge of the browsing history and,

00:25:22.403 --> 00:25:27.313
therefore, sexual preferences of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people.

00:25:28.673 --> 00:25:32.183
For years, with this power also came the ability to

00:25:32.183 --> 00:25:35.723
print money, to generate hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:25:36.373 --> 00:25:40.933
Then, after some porn websites were cut off  from the payment processing

00:25:40.933 --> 00:25:45.543
networks, their ability to make money was dealt an almost lethal blow.

00:25:46.203 --> 00:25:49.223
They were on their knees, bloody and fighting for life.

00:25:50.473 --> 00:25:55.563
But the reality is that, because of its inherent nature, the porn industry

00:25:55.683 --> 00:26:00.313
has always had to  be creative, it’s always managed to find a way to survive.

00:26:01.573 --> 00:26:05.733
Something tells me that while there are still hundreds of millions of people who

00:26:05.743 --> 00:26:11.723
watch porn every single day, the porn industry will manage to find a way to get paid.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:20.474
OK then, is it for today's episode on porn and big money, and this exploration

00:26:20.614 --> 00:26:25.594
into how this popular but taboo, mysterious and secretive industry works.

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:29.564
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:34.834
Did you know about how interlinked VISA and Mastercard were with porn websites?

00:26:35.614 --> 00:26:38.854
Where do you think the responsibility starts and finishes?

00:26:39.424 --> 00:26:43.464
Are VISA and Mastercard responsible for payments made with its cards?

00:26:44.084 --> 00:26:47.184
Do you think the porn industry should be regulated by the government?

00:26:47.734 --> 00:26:52.374
Where should the line be drawn between personal liberty and public protection?

00:26:53.164 --> 00:26:56.664
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:12.881
by Leonardo English.

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:14.351
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:22.812
Today's episode is going to be very different to the normal ones, which is why it's a bit of a

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.612
bonus, extra one.

00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:31.092
It's not replacing our normal Tuesday and Friday episodes of weird and wonderful things about the

00:00:31.092 --> 00:00:37.422
world, it's just an additional one that I hope may be interesting, but for slightly different

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:38.052
reasons.

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:46.348
In today's episode, I want to tell you a bit about the mission of Leonardo English and of the

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:52.888
English Learning for Curious Minds podcast, where we have got so far, but then I also want to ask

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:54.298
for your help.

00:00:55.768 --> 00:01:04.228
Yes, I know that might sound weird, but I'll explain exactly why later on in the podcast and if you

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:08.548
wait until the end you'll hear what's in it for you.

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:16.192
As per usual, you can find the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:17.942
is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:24.172
To get the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast you don't even need to be a member of

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:30.172
Leonardo English, you can access all of the materials for the podcast without being a member, so

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:33.202
it's all free, no membership, no registration required.

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:41.452
And on the subject of transcripts if you haven't seen them already, we have just launched what I'm

00:01:41.452 --> 00:01:44.782
calling animated transcripts on the website.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.202
I think this is a really cool new feature.

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:56.062
So for people listening on the website, when you press play, the audio starts of course, but also

00:01:56.062 --> 00:01:59.092
the words appear across the screen when they're spoken.

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:08.422
It's a bit like subtitles, but even better as you can select a word and your browser will suggest

00:02:08.422 --> 00:02:09.772
the definition of it.

00:02:10.222 --> 00:02:15.963
So if you don't know a particular word, you can find the definition very easily, which I for one

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:17.013
think is pretty cool.

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:20.773
So go and check that out, that's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:28.588
For the regular listeners among you, you'll know that the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:36.928
tries to teach you weird and wonderful things about the world at the same time as helping you learn

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:37.588
English.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:42.058
The way we do this is on one level, pretty simple.

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:50.668
Find cool topics to talk about, do loads of research, condense it into between a 10 and 20 minute

00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:58.108
podcast, record it, edit it, create the transcript and key vocabulary, and then send it out into the

00:02:58.108 --> 00:02:59.878
ether, out into the world.

00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:08.196
We've been doing this now for just over two months and we're coming up to the 30th episode.

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:15.411
At least from what I can see, things are going quite well - we have listeners from all over the

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:22.611
world and members of Leonardo English from, I think it's around a dozen different countries now.

00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:30.651
So it seems at least that you are enjoying the show and that we're doing something right.

00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:39.987
But other than seeing that there are more and more people listening, I have got almost no idea of

00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:46.197
what we might be doing well, of what you like and what you don't like.

00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:55.499
As a language learner, myself and an English teacher and a curious mind, I know what I would find

00:03:55.499 --> 00:04:02.009
useful from a learning point of view, and I know the kinds of topics that interest me, but that's

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.579
just me.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.759
And rather than it being just me, I want to know what you want.

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:17.399
So what I want to do is to ask for help and feedback from you, but also to get to know you a little

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.699
bit.

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:25.889
I would love to know a bit about you, about your story learning English, about why you listen to the

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.829
podcast, what you like about it, but more importantly, what do you think we could be doing better?

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:41.829
I truly believe that it's only through working almost hand in hand with you, that people listening

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:46.419
to the show that I'll be able to create exactly what you want.

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:54.615
The good thing about this is that this podcast and Leonardo English, it's not some huge company,

00:04:54.615 --> 00:05:03.170
it's not Babbel or duolingo where you might send in some feedback and it gets added to a huge pile

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.720
and never sees the light of day.

00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:13.837
We're a small operation and people are always surprised when they email in and they get a near

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:16.117
immediate response directly from me.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.570
And at the podcast, we've already done things specifically because listeners and members said they

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.410
would like them.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.280
So the recent podcast about mistakes people make when they learn English, that was one that was

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.510
requested from someone, the podcast on soft power, that came out of a conversation with an early

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.220
member of Leonardo English.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.820
So what I'm saying is that people are already having an impact on the future of the podcast.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.330
And I'd love for you to have an impact too.

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:58.150
Of course, it's me that's asking for your help, but I also want to give you something in return.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.570
So here's what's in it for you.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.790
Firstly, and I think this is actually the coolest thing, is that you'll have a say in the future of

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.630
the podcast.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:18.160
You'll get to see which episodes are coming up next, you'll be able to shape the future and help

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.310
create the podcast that you actually want to listen to.

00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:27.137
You'll also get priority access to every new feature that we release.

00:06:27.437 --> 00:06:34.487
You'll get it before everyone else and you'll be able to feedback to make sure that we are building

00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:36.227
exactly what you want.

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:44.779
Also, if you send in your feedback about the podcast, your English learning story, I will personally

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:50.749
correct it into perfect native natural English if there are any mistakes.

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:56.479
So that's a bonus, sort of free English writing exercise.

00:06:57.358 --> 00:07:03.288
And finally, there are a few special bonuses that I'm not going to reveal here, but you can take my

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:05.238
word for it that they will be pretty cool.

00:07:05.673 --> 00:07:08.763
I know that sounds mysterious, but you'll just have to trust me.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:18.136
So I'd love for you to have a hand in shaping the future of the podcast, and I'd also just on a

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:20.446
human level, love to hear from you.

00:07:21.646 --> 00:07:29.146
So I'll put these links in the show notes, but you can just send us a message with 'feedback' in the

00:07:29.146 --> 00:07:30.946
title or in the body of the message.

00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:38.156
So you can do that either with good old fashioned email at hi@leonardoenglish.com H I

00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:42.646
@leonardoenglish.com or of course on Facebook or Instagram.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.518
I really am looking forward to hearing from you.

00:07:46.707 --> 00:07:49.941
Okay, this might have been a bit of a strange episode.

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:51.921
If it's strange, at least it's short.

00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:57.141
And don't worry, normal service will resume from the next one onwards.

00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:03.861
If you've got this far in the podcast, then I guess that you may be interested in getting in touch

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:04.821
and helping.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:10.181
So again, the email is, hi H I @leonardoenglish.com.

00:08:10.728 --> 00:08:17.863
I'll personally read and respond to every piece of feedback we get, and seeing your message arrive

00:08:17.913 --> 00:08:21.723
in my inbox will be like a little ray of light in my day.

00:08:22.913 --> 00:08:26.603
Okay then, that's my pleading over with - you know what to do.

00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:33.003
You've been listening to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:08:33.483 --> 00:08:38.313
I'm Alastair Budge and I will catch you in the next episode.

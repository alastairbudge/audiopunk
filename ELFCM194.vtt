Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:17.303
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:21.603
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:28.363
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Occupy Wall Street.

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:34.043
This episode will be released on the 17th of September 2021,

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:38.623
which is exactly 10 years after the demonstrations started.

00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:44.483
So, on this anniversary we are going to remind ourselves of exactly what

00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:48.253
happened, who was involved, and what were the protests were really about.

00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:54.033
Then, we’ll take a look at what effect they actually had, from discussing

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:58.233
what effect they had at that time through to what effect they have had

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:03.153
since then, and what effect, if any, they might have in the future.

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:07.214
Ok then, let's get started.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:15.424
If there is one thing that history teaches us, it’s that when power and money are overly

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:22.974
concentrated in the hands of a small minority, it is a fertile breeding ground for revolution.

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:31.384
And when this situation arises in a democracy, where the implicit social contract one enters

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:39.843
into is that everyone should have a fair chance at a good life, well it is a volatile situation.

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:44.913
10 years ago, the United States was in such a situation.

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:51.483
It was just coming out of what has been called the Great Recession, or the Financial Crisis.

00:01:52.213 --> 00:01:59.393
From 2007 to 2009 the US, as we know, had experienced a housing

00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:04.313
crisis, brought on by corporate greed and irresponsible lending.

00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:09.813
Between 10 and 14 million people lost their homes.

00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:12.903
Around 9 million people lost their jobs.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:17.613
Yet the bankers and corporate executives who were responsible for

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:22.203
much of the actions that caused the recession got off “scot-free”.

00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:27.383
Not only did they not go to prison, but they kept their jobs, kept

00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:31.713
their large salaries, and nothing really seemed to have changed.

00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:40.833
Barack Obama had been elected president in 2008 on a platform of change, with a message of hope.

00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:44.743
Yet for many, he had not delivered on this.

00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:50.433
US political commentators had increasingly started to raise the

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:56.603
issue of the rise of inequality, and the term the 1% had been coined.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:03.033
This term, of the 1%, referred to the wealth that was held by

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:07.513
the richest 1% of people in the country, the tiny minority.

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:12.713
It came to prominence in a June 2009 article written

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:16.453
by the Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz, where he wrote:

00:03:16.723 --> 00:03:20.643
“The upper 1 percent of Americans are now taking in

00:03:20.873 --> 00:03:24.193
nearly a quarter of the nation’s income every year.

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:30.443
In terms of wealth rather than income, the top 1 percent control 40 percent.

00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:33.703
Their lot in life has improved considerably.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:39.983
Twenty-five years ago, the corresponding figures were 12 percent and 33 percent.”

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:44.953
In short, the richest in society were getting even

00:03:44.963 --> 00:03:48.633
richer and more powerful, at the expense of the majority.

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:54.363
And elsewhere in the world there was a sense of revolution in the air.

00:03:54.883 --> 00:04:01.583
The Arab Spring had started in late 2010 and spread across much of the Arab world.

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:08.033
In early 2011 there was the anti-austerity movement in Spain, also known as “Los

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:13.243
indignados”, which no doubt the Spanish listeners will be all too familiar with.

00:04:13.723 --> 00:04:19.313
And even in London, not traditionally a hotbed of revolution, there were

00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:24.183
riots protesting the lack of economic opportunity and police corruption.

00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:29.923
So, this was the backdrop to what was to come in New York in

00:04:29.923 --> 00:04:35.253
September of 2011, with what would be called Occupy Wall Street.

00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:39.423
It might have become a movement that was all over the front

00:04:39.423 --> 00:04:44.213
pages of global newspapers, but it had humble beginnings.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:49.143
Indeed, it all came out of a conversation between two

00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:53.783
employees at a left-wing Canadian magazine called Adbusters.

00:04:54.953 --> 00:05:00.483
The idea was that they would design a poster, gather enough people together

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:06.053
in a public location in New York City, and protest against corporate greed.

00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:11.383
There wasn’t really a specific mission or purpose at the start.

00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:15.843
There wasn’t a demand, a specific policy, or something

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:18.623
that the creators of the movement wanted to happen.

00:05:18.993 --> 00:05:24.063
They were angry, they were disappointed, the system was not working for them,

00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:29.693
and it wasn’t working for tens, if not hundreds of millions of other Americans.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:36.583
The idea was to congregate in one place at a specified time, show the country

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:42.293
and the world that this was not ok, and see where things went from there.

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:51.713
And so, on the 17th of September 2011, exactly 10 years before this episode will be released, around

00:05:51.713 --> 00:05:58.593
200 people met in Zuccotti Park, a public square in the heart of New York’s financial district.

00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:05.113
Many turned up with posters with the movement’s slogan, “We are the

00:06:05.113 --> 00:06:11.383
99%”, obviously pitting themselves against the minority, the 1%.

00:06:12.426 --> 00:06:18.403
According to reports from people who were there, many didn’t really know what to expect.

00:06:18.913 --> 00:06:24.953
The movement may have been called “occupy”, but not everyone had the idea that they

00:06:24.953 --> 00:06:30.363
would actually continue to “occupy” the square for any longer than a few hours.

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:34.243
But others had more permanent ideas.

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:40.913
Some had brought sleeping bags, blankets, tents, and makeshift shelters, so that they

00:06:40.913 --> 00:06:46.273
could continue to “occupy” this square just a stone’s throw away from Wall Street..

00:06:47.163 --> 00:06:50.733
Although it wasn’t their first choice, the organisers had

00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:55.023
been clever in their choice of what square to “occupy”.

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:59.743
The square they had chosen, Zuccotti Park, was a privately owned

00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:03.973
park, it wasn’t owned by the city government, which meant the police

00:07:03.983 --> 00:07:08.883
couldn’t come and push them out unless the park’s owner requested it.

00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:14.473
This bought them some time, and meant that international newspapers very

00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:19.203
quickly started reporting on these protests at the heart of New York’s

00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:24.843
financial district, protesting at the sickness of the global capitalist system.

00:07:25.443 --> 00:07:28.493
But what were they actually protesting?

00:07:28.673 --> 00:07:29.923
What were their demands?

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.693
What did they want to change?

00:07:32.183 --> 00:07:37.243
Well, this is where it gets interesting, confusing, and one

00:07:37.293 --> 00:07:41.133
could say this is where things started to go a little wrong.

00:07:41.873 --> 00:07:45.383
They were protesting against….almost everything.

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:48.283
The entire system was rotten.

00:07:48.483 --> 00:07:55.343
The political system was so closely linked to corporate interests that democracy wasn’t working.

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:57.377
The rich were getting richer.

00:07:57.537 --> 00:08:02.887
Wages were too low to allow normal people to live a dignified life.

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:04.837
Healthcare was too expensive.

00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:07.217
Student debt was out of control.

00:08:07.547 --> 00:08:11.137
Global warming was this huge existential threat.

00:08:11.467 --> 00:08:15.197
And the situation was getting worse and worse.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:21.537
There was this general agreement that something had to be done, but no agreement

00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:27.467
about what it was, other than to scrap the entire system and start afresh.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.020
The democratic system was broken.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.500
Elected leaders were not acting in the interests of the people who

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.010
elected them, they were acting in the interests of their corporate donors.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:46.930
In the famous article in May of 2011, Stiglitz had written that most politicians are

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:53.930
already part of the 1% when they enter politics, they then work on behalf of the 1%

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.341
when they are in office, and when they leave they are given lucrative, well paying

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:05.501
jobs by the very corporate donors, the very 1%, they helped while they were in office.

00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:11.641
But while surveys at the time suggested that there was agreement among most Americans

00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:17.561
that inequality was getting out of control, and that bankers deserved to be punished

00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:22.581
for the financial crisis, there was not agreement about the fact that the entire

00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:28.451
system of Western capitalism and western democracy needed to be completely rethought.

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:33.121
What's more, Occupy Wall Street didn't have any real

00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:37.361
concrete demands, and it had no real leadership.

00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:43.101
Its supporters, and its organisers, pointed out that this was the entire point.

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:47.721
Representative democracy, where people elect individuals

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:51.191
to make decisions on their behalf, wasn't working.

00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:57.931
So Occupy Wall Street would have a different model of agreement by consensus, the group

00:09:58.001 --> 00:10:03.961
would decide, instead of a few individuals deciding on behalf of the group, or the movement.

00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:10.081
And in terms of its lack of concrete demands, it pointed out that it

00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:14.821
wasn't the place of protestors to figure out what the exact policy

00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:19.211
should be, but rather to suggest what the overall goal should be.

00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:25.692
And that goal was a fair society that worked for everyone, not for the 1%.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.571
To continue the story of what happened, for just short of two months

00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:36.241
people camped out in Zuccotti Park, this park near Wall Street.

00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:42.941
On November 15th the police finally came and cleared them away, because the owner of the

00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:48.631
park had complained that there was a health and fire safety risk to the protestors inside.

00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:55.781
And that was it, or at least that was the end of the first iteration of Occupy Wall Street.

00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:03.631
But during the 59 days that the protestors were in the park, what actually happened?

00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:05.681
What was actually going on?

00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:10.871
In the park itself, not a huge amount really.

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:15.421
There were marches outside the park, such as one over Brooklyn

00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:19.261
Bridge, and there were occasional confrontations with the police.

00:11:19.961 --> 00:11:25.061
The entire protest was quite poorly organised, which commentators

00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:28.551
have attributed to the fact that there was no real leadership.

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:35.481
For example, someone successfully managed to trick the organisers of Occupy Wall Street

00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:40.911
that the band Radiohead was coming to play in the square, in support of the movement.

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:46.591
The fact that Radiohead would be interested in doing this wasn’t surprising.

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:53.111
Radiohead was in New York at the time, and they have been outspoken about western capitalism.

00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:57.891
Unfortunately, it turned out to be a hoax, a complete lie.

00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:05.411
Lots of people converged on the square, hoping to see the band play but… they never came.

00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:11.251
For the critics of the movement, they asked how if Occupy Wall Street

00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:16.071
couldn’t even organise a simple concert, how should people take it seriously

00:12:16.261 --> 00:12:20.411
when it came to talking about overhauling the entire economic system?

00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:27.981
It was also heavily criticised for not actually being representative at all of the 99%,

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:33.941
of the majority of people in America, and not even representative of New York City.

00:12:34.771 --> 00:12:39.431
According to an article in the Huffington Post, two-thirds of those

00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:43.741
who described themselves as “actively involved” in Occupy Wall Street

00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:48.551
were white, while 80 percent had a bachelor’s degree or higher.

00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:53.221
Compare this to New York City, only one-third of the residents

00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:57.681
are white and about 34 percent have a bachelor’s degree or higher.

00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:02.851
Long story short, these protestors were claiming to represent

00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:06.361
the majority, but they weren’t representative themselves.

00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:13.141
This being said, the movement was incredibly effective in terms of furthering the

00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:20.351
idea of the 1% vs 99%, and of pushing this idea into the public consciousness.

00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:26.671
Barack Obama, who was up for reelection the following year, came out in support of the

00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:34.028
protestors, with the White House putting out a statement that it too is fighting for the 99%.

00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:37.181
To some, this was surprising.

00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:42.881
The White House was and still is the definition of the establishment, and

00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:47.621
for it to come out in support of an anti-establishment movement was...

00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:48.551
unexpected.

00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:52.891
But on the other hand the messaging of 1% vs.

00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:57.921
99% makes it very difficult for a politician to reject.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:05.511
When put like that, of course anyone, even if they are in the 1% themselves, as of course Barack

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:12.051
Obama and his White House staff were, has no option but to pledge support for the majority.

00:14:12.961 --> 00:14:19.571
In terms of other successes, or at least important legacies of Occupy Wall Street, there are several

00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:26.251
important issues that it raised 10 years ago that have seen important progress in American politics.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:30.461
Student debt, an increased minimum wage, environmental

00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:34.451
concerns, and medical debt, to give a few examples.

00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:39.521
To those of you who pay attention to American politics, you will know that

00:14:39.531 --> 00:14:44.321
these are all issues that Democratic politicians have campaigned on since.

00:14:45.261 --> 00:14:50.661
Before Occupy Wall Street, of course these issues were still just as important, but

00:14:50.871 --> 00:14:57.141
Occupy Wall Street did a huge amount to bring them further into the public consciousness.

00:14:58.301 --> 00:15:04.271
Debatably, the fact that they raised awareness of these kinds of issues paved a path

00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:09.681
for more left-wing politicians, people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

00:15:10.321 --> 00:15:15.111
In the first US presidential election after Barack Obama, would the Democratic

00:15:15.151 --> 00:15:19.521
party have had a self-professed “socialist” candidate get through to the

00:15:19.531 --> 00:15:24.961
last round, as Bernie Sanders did in 2016, without Occupy Wall Street?

00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:31.627
Very possibly, but the protests certainly did a lot to raise the profile

00:15:31.637 --> 00:15:35.947
of several of the issues that Bernie Sanders later campaigned on.

00:15:36.847 --> 00:15:41.347
But, the question still stands, has anything actually changed?

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:46.587
As we look at the 10 years since the protests, what is actually

00:15:46.687 --> 00:15:51.497
different, and can we trace any of this back to Occupy Wall Street?

00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:57.127
To the critics of the movement, they will no doubt say that it achieved nothing.

00:15:57.307 --> 00:16:03.507
That it was poorly organised, only consisted of over-educated white Americans sitting

00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:08.627
around talking in a park for a couple of months without proposing anything meaningful.

00:16:09.187 --> 00:16:13.127
Even taking a completely objective view, it has certainly

00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:17.947
not yet achieved the huge, seismic impact it set out to.

00:16:18.527 --> 00:16:23.257
Inequality has continued to rise, there has been very limited progress on

00:16:23.407 --> 00:16:28.577
things like student debt, global warming, medical debt and the minimum wage.

00:16:29.257 --> 00:16:35.391
But to the people who took part, and there are dozens of interviews and articles over the

00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:41.681
past 10 years saying a similar thing, it was an incredibly important movement that sowed

00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:48.211
the seeds for change, change that wasn’t to come immediately and might not even be seen

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:54.601
for years to come, but change that is inevitable, and needed now more than ever before.

00:16:55.531 --> 00:17:00.831
Many of the people involved in Occupy Wall Street have gone on to organise

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:06.521
grassroots movements, and to support progressive candidates in American politics.

00:17:07.051 --> 00:17:11.311
They have gone on to be involved with other movements such as Black

00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:15.441
Lives Matter, and will continue to be involved for years to come.

00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:20.321
For these people, perhaps it is too early, even 10 years

00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:24.421
on, to accurately assess the impact of Occupy Wall Street.

00:17:26.891 --> 00:17:31.421
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Occupy Wall Street.

00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:35.311
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:39.701
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:40.081 --> 00:17:44.231
For those of you who live in the United States, and especially if you

00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:48.941
were there in 2011, what was the reaction of your friends and colleagues?

00:17:49.071 --> 00:17:51.771
Where did Occupy Wall Street go wrong?

00:17:51.851 --> 00:17:53.311
What could have been different?

00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:56.221
Or do you think it is too early to tell?

00:17:56.601 --> 00:17:57.921
I would love to know.

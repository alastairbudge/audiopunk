Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.639
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:21.139
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:26.629
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Diego

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:31.769
Maradona, considered by many to be the best footballer that has ever lived.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:38.619
His is an amazing story, taking us from the slums of Buenos Aires through

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:43.499
to winning the World Cup, and scoring the best goal of the 20th century.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.319
But, while there are plenty of highs in the story of Maradona, it is also full of tragedy and highs

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:57.169
of a different kind, from a cripplying drug addiction to being banned from playing the game he

00:00:57.169 --> 00:01:04.839
loved, from being labelled the most hated man in Italy to his premature death at just 60 years old.

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.769
Although it is in many ways a tragedy, it is fascinating, so, I hope you’ll enjoy this episode.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.619

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:47.029
OK then, Diego Armando Maradona.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:54.289
It’s often said that the body of Diego Maradona contained two opposing characters.

00:01:55.279 --> 00:02:02.574
Diego,  the sweet, loving, caring boy with a naughty sense of humour and a deep love for his family.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.220
And Maradona, the larger-than-life character he played on the football pitch.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170
Our story starts with Diego.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.110
He was born in one of the poorests slums on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.140
Growing up he had no running water, no electricity, and his father would get up at 4am every

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.740
morning to go out to work, coming home and collapsing from exhaustion in front of his children.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.760
Diego was the fifth of seven children, and the first boy, arriving after four older sisters.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.670
From a young age, his footballing talents were apparent.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.540
He has this amazing ability to control the ball, almost as if it were an extension of his body.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.790
After being spotted by a talent scout when he was a

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.160
mere 8 years old, his life became dominated by football.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.456
When he was only 15, he was signed as a professional player by a club

00:03:12.536 --> 00:03:17.502
called Argentinos Juniors,  which also gave him an apartment to live in.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:25.485
From that day onwards he became the main breadwinner for his family, moving everyone into

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:32.405
the apartment with him, and with his entire family becoming reliant on the young Diego.

00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:39.321
For him, it must have been the most amazing feeling, of being able to care for your family,

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:46.801
to take them out of a terrible situation of absolute poverty and provide them with a nice roof

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:52.900
over their heads, and regular food on the table - two things that they had not known before.

00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:59.035
Aged 20, he signed for Boca Juniors, the club of his boyhood

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:03.065
dreams, rejecting higher-paying offers at other clubs.

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:09.165
And just a year and a half later he transferred to Barcelona, for the

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:16.420
then-record fee of £5 million, today’s equivalent of around €22 million.

00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:22.215
From a footballing perspective, he did quite well at Barcelona, helping the

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:29.155
club win the Copa Del Rey, and scoring an impressive 38 goals in 58 matches.

00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:35.205
But he later said that he never felt quite at home at Barcelona,

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:39.075
it wasn’t the right club, and it wasn’t the right city for him.

00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:43.505
This was a theme throughout Maradona’s life - he had

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.035
chosen to go to Boca Juniors, instead of River Plate.

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:54.165
Boca was the club that he had always wanted to play for, and it was the more working class team.

00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:56.845
River Plate wasn’t right.

00:04:57.305 --> 00:05:03.355
And neither was Barcelona, it was too clean, they had already been champions

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:08.765
multiple times - it wasn’t really an atmosphere that Maradona felt comfortable with.

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:14.425
He had grown up struggling, he had grown up as an underdog, and

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:19.885
to be suddenly catapulted into the elite didn’t feel quite right.

00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:26.181
The decision to leave Barcelona was actually made for him after a match with Athletico

00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:33.451
Bilbao, where Maradona was the ringleader of a huge physical fight between the two teams.

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:38.631
Naturally, everything was being broadcast to the nation, it was on

00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:44.141
TV, but the Spanish King, Juan Carlos I was also at the stadium.

00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:50.141
It was too much for Barcelona to be seen to be employing a street-fighter

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:55.471
from the slums of Buenos Aires, and it was clear that Maradona needed to go.

00:05:56.301 --> 00:06:01.521
By this time, he was considered by many to be the best football player in the world.

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:07.411
So the club he went to next was, from a footballing perspective at

00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:13.041
least, surprising, but when one thinks about the kind of club and place

00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:17.941
that Maradona felt comfortable in, it was completely unsurprising.

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:25.971
In June of 1984 he was transferred to Naples, for a then record-breaking

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:32.724
fee of 7 million pounds, today’s equivalent of something like €25 million.

00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:37.791
Naples wasn’t an obvious choice for the world’s best footballer.

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:42.571
The team had never won the Serie A, Italy’s version of the premier

00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:47.791
league, and they often languished in the bottom half of the table.

00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:53.501
What’s more, the club wasn’t rich, and there were question marks

00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:57.932
about where the club had actually got the money to buy Maradona.

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:02.855
Italian football had historically been dominated by clubs

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:08.045
from the north - AC Milan, Inter Milan, Juventus, and Roma.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:16.355
Naples was in the south of Italy, and there was–and still is I should say–a certain sense

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:22.085
that some people from the richer north of Italy look down at people from the poorer south.

00:07:23.395 --> 00:07:27.865
And football fans, Italian football fans in particular, are not known

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:32.475
for being particularly politically correct, or for holding back.

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:39.165
There are clips of opposing fans singing chants about Neapolitans suffering

00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:44.225
from cholera, suggesting that they should all be killed by the fire of

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:49.085
nearby Mt Vesuvius, and that they are so dirty that they need a wash.

00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:53.065
Naples at this time was a very poor city.

00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:59.665
It has suffered a terrible earthquake in 1980, it was in the grip of organised

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:05.415
crime, and it was chaotic compared to many other northern Italian cities.

00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:10.625
I should say, very quickly, that if you would like to learn more about Naples,

00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:16.385
and about a particular aspect of the city, the Camorra, then there is an entire

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:21.885
episode just on that, it’s Episode 75, you’ll find that exclusively on the website.

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:27.675
OK, going back to Naples, the football club was not doing too well,

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:33.157
the city was poor, it was hated by its richer northern neighbours.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:37.285
But Maradona immediately felt at home.

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:43.485
He knew what it was like to be looked down upon by the rich, he knew what it was like

00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:49.485
to be judged because of who you were, he relished the challenge of being the underdog.

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:57.745
When he arrived in Naples he was paraded around the stadium to 85,000 adoring fans.

00:08:58.365 --> 00:09:01.495
He loved the attention, and the fans loved him.

00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:07.455
There was a feeling that he had come to save the club, that he was there to help

00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:13.815
Naples regain its rightful place, and to teach its northern rivals a thing or two.

00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:18.525
In his first season at the club they finished 8th.

00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:22.935
Not a remarkable position, but a sign of things to come.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:29.915
The year after, they finished third, and the next year, the 1986-87 season,

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:36.218
Naples were  crowned champions for the first time, with Maradona as their captain.

00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:42.588
He was already a hero in the city, but leading the club to victory against

00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:48.958
the arrogant northern rivals propelled him to a status of a demi-god.

00:09:49.808 --> 00:09:56.518
There were murals all over the city, he was mobbed by adoring fans everywhere he went.

00:09:57.348 --> 00:10:02.413
As well as being a hero to the people of Naples,  he was a national hero in

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:09.263
Argentina after having led the national side to glory at the World Cup in 1986.

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:17.171
It was to be in this tournament, and within the course of 5 minutes, in the England vs.

00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:22.957
Argentina quarter final, that the world saw two of the most famous goals by Maradona.

00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:30.341
The first, in the 51st minute, was what’s now called the Hand of God goal.

00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:34.871
I imagine you will have seen this, but just in case you don’t know what

00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:39.815
I’m talking about, Maradona jumped up and hit the ball into the goal

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:43.895
with his hand, which you are obviously not allowed to do in football.

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:49.975
Then, just 5 minutes later, Maradona scored what has since been voted the

00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:55.438
best goal in the twentieth century, running half the way up the pitch, past

00:10:55.448 --> 00:10:59.958
four England players before shooting the ball past the England goalkeeper.

00:11:00.968 --> 00:11:07.688
This five minutes summarised what people love, and what people loathe, about Diego Maradona.

00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:12.518
On the one hand, he was a cheat, the first goal

00:11:12.598 --> 00:11:15.148
shouldn’t have counted, it shouldn’t have been allowed.

00:11:15.598 --> 00:11:20.658
But on the other hand he was an incredibly talented football player, capable

00:11:20.798 --> 00:11:26.278
of absolute magic, and there is no denying how fantastically skillful he was.

00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:32.228
The next World Cup, in 1990, four years later, was held in Italy.

00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:37.348
By this time, Maradona had a complicated relationship with Italy,

00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:41.948
or rather, Italians had a complicated relationship with Maradona.

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:48.078
People from Naples worshipped the ground he walked on, they absolutely loved him.

00:11:49.178 --> 00:11:53.068
For many people who weren’t from Naples, they hated him,

00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:56.908
because they considered him an arrogant pseudo-Neapolitan.

00:11:57.528 --> 00:12:05.038
Although he wasn’t from Naples, he was a fierce defender of the city, and was almost an adopted son.

00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:12.098
So, during the World Cup when Argentina were playing in other Italian cities,

00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:18.392
the Argentine national team were booed, they were taunted, because of Maradona.

00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:25.158
Maradona even recalled how, when Argentina played Cameroon at the San

00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:30.398
Siro stadium in Milan, the northern Italian fans supported Cameroon.

00:12:31.248 --> 00:12:36.538
Maradona joked that he had cured Italians of racism, as this was

00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:40.368
the first time that they had ever supported a team from Africa.

00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:46.777
Both Argentina and Italy progressed in the tournament, and they were to play

00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:52.847
each other at the San Paolo stadium the Naples stadium in the semi finals.

00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:58.076
This put many Neapolitan fans in a tough position.

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:03.266
Were they to support the national team, Italy, even though

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:07.246
they perhaps felt more allegiance to Maradona than to Italy?

00:13:08.296 --> 00:13:14.836
Or were they to stick by their city’s hero, despite him playing for the team of another country?

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:21.056
Maradona goaded the Italians on national TV when he was asked about

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:26.476
who Naples fans should support, saying that “Naples isn’t Italy”, and

00:13:26.726 --> 00:13:30.754
urging the fans to support Argentina, instead of the national team.

00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:36.224
Indeed, there were groups of Naples ultras, the serious

00:13:36.234 --> 00:13:40.014
hardcore fans, who did support Argentina in the match.

00:13:41.034 --> 00:13:45.594
Argentina won the game on penalties, knocking Italy out of the tournament.

00:13:46.074 --> 00:13:51.524
That World Cup didn’t end in glory for Argentina, as they lost to West Germany

00:13:51.534 --> 00:13:56.714
in the final, but this was the final nail in the coffin for Maradona in Italy.

00:13:57.324 --> 00:14:01.324
He had already been feeling like he wanted to leave Naples, and

00:14:01.544 --> 00:14:05.324
had been suffering from huge personal problems off the pitch.

00:14:06.544 --> 00:14:12.054
If you knew nothing about the life of Diego Maradona before 10 minutes ago, you might have

00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:18.674
thought this would be a rags to riches story of a loving boy who was a fantastic football player.

00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:23.515
But beneath the surface was huge personal tragedy.

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:29.125
Shortly after arriving in Naples, Maradona had fallen in with

00:14:29.145 --> 00:14:33.575
a bad crowd, the organised crime clan of the Giuliano family.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:41.515
This clan controlled much of an area of Naples called Forcella, right in the historical centre.

00:14:42.525 --> 00:14:47.255
Two of their principal streams of income, two of the main ways they

00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:52.625
made money, were prostitution and drugs, and Maradona was quickly

00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:57.975
swept up into a vicious web of cocaine addiction and prostitute use.

00:14:58.685 --> 00:15:01.345
This was an open secret in Naples.

00:15:01.717 --> 00:15:09.405
Maradona would play a game on Sunday, then go out for a large meal and essentially keep partying,

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:15.595
with drink, drugs and prostitutes, until Wednesday evening, then he would sober up, he would

00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:21.415
get all of the drugs and drink out of his system, and prepare for the game a few days later.

00:15:22.425 --> 00:15:28.757
While he was leading Naples and Argentina to victory on the pitch, off the pitch he was dealing

00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:35.277
with a full-blown cocaine addiction, and found himself indebted to this Neapolitan crime family.

00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:40.557
They provided him with drugs and prostitutes, they gave him gifts

00:15:40.637 --> 00:15:44.467
when he did favours for him, and they protected him from the police.

00:15:45.457 --> 00:15:50.237
But in return, he was owned by them, and had to do what they wanted.

00:15:51.237 --> 00:15:58.657
There is a surreal scene in an excellent Maradona documentary on HBO where Maradona, the

00:15:58.797 --> 00:16:04.277
most famous man in the city, and the most most talented footballer in the world, finds

00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:10.797
himself having to act as a chauffeur, as a taxi driver, to a Neapolitan crime boss.

00:16:11.797 --> 00:16:16.857
But there was a growing feeling within the Camorra that being associated

00:16:17.027 --> 00:16:21.997
with Maradona was bringing unwanted attention to their illegal activities.

00:16:23.097 --> 00:16:27.977
He might have been good for business - it was great to have him there at the opening

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:33.692
of a new restaurant or bar,  and it did a lot of good for their street reputation

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:39.932
to be seen as a friend of Diego Maradona - but they liked to operate in the shadows.

00:16:40.762 --> 00:16:44.142
And it was difficult to be in the shadows when you are

00:16:44.152 --> 00:16:47.162
hanging out with the most famous person in the city.

00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:52.752
What’s more, Maradona was hated in much of the rest of Italy.

00:16:53.592 --> 00:16:56.842
It wasn’t long before things were to catch up with him.

00:16:57.462 --> 00:17:01.282
There was a police wiretapping, a police secret recording,

00:17:01.602 --> 00:17:04.898
of him on the phone requesting drugs and prostitutes.

00:17:05.262 --> 00:17:11.002
Then, in 1991, after a match between Naples and Bari, he was drug tested.

00:17:11.772 --> 00:17:16.602
Naturally, they found traces of cocaine and he was banned for 15 months.

00:17:17.372 --> 00:17:21.402
It’s a miracle that he managed to escape this for so long, really.

00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:27.532
It was an open secret that he was on drugs throughout most of his time at Naples, but the

00:17:27.707 --> 00:17:34.342
Neapolitan team had a vested interest in hiding this from the authorities, so he presumably

00:17:34.342 --> 00:17:40.077
was given clean samples that he could switch with his dirty ones when he was drug tested.

00:17:41.287 --> 00:17:47.542
Almost immediately after being banned, he packed his bags and headed back to Argentina, alone,

00:17:47.712 --> 00:17:54.852
with no group of adoring fans, cast out by a city that had worshipped him, and sent back

00:17:54.852 --> 00:18:01.347
home in disgrace, a shadow of the bright-eyed boy who had arrived in Naples 7 years earlier.

00:18:02.606 --> 00:18:06.232
And those of you who are familiar with the later years

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:10.312
of Maradona will know that this was the start of the end.

00:18:10.872 --> 00:18:17.382
His playing career was filled with failing more and more drug tests, he was unable

00:18:17.412 --> 00:18:22.812
to conquer this crippling addiction that had plagued him since his days at Naples.

00:18:23.692 --> 00:18:28.772
Without the Camorra to protect him, he was also on the run from the Italian tax

00:18:28.882 --> 00:18:36.542
authorities, and he reportedly owed 37 million euros in unpaid taxes from his time in Italy.

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:41.052
On a personal level, his life was unravelling as well.

00:18:41.672 --> 00:18:46.392
He got divorced in 2004, and admitted that he had fathered

00:18:46.452 --> 00:18:51.002
a son with a different woman in Naples back in 1986.

00:18:52.062 --> 00:18:58.232
He continued to go in and out of rehab clinics, and put on huge amounts of weight.

00:18:59.052 --> 00:19:05.632
There’s a terribly sad interview from 2004 when he breaks down crying on

00:19:05.672 --> 00:19:10.222
Argentine national TV talking about his troubles overcoming drug addiction.

00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:14.992
And then last year, on the 25 November, he had a

00:19:14.992 --> 00:19:19.072
huge heart attack, and died, aged just 60 years old.

00:19:19.862 --> 00:19:23.992
The days after his death were filled with mixed reactions.

00:19:24.442 --> 00:19:30.082
Tears on the streets of Naples, and the decision to rename the club’s stadium after him.

00:19:31.082 --> 00:19:38.142
Meanwhile, in more northern, right-wing Italian newspapers, people were critical of his legacy.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:44.522
Il Giornale, a newspaper owned by the family of Silvio Berlusconi, who had been the

00:19:44.722 --> 00:19:52.152
owner of AC Milan, a fierce rival of Naples, called him a “cheat, drug addict, alcoholic,

00:19:52.342 --> 00:19:58.442
violent sexist with women, tax evader and communist: the worst of the worst of the worst.”

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:04.182
And a player from Juventus, a club from Turin in the north of Italy, claimed

00:20:04.352 --> 00:20:08.782
that Maradona would still be alive if he had played for Juventus, not Naples.

00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:14.112
From a footballing perspective at least, there is little doubt that Maradona

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:18.392
will go down in history as one of the greatest players to have ever lived.

00:20:19.482 --> 00:20:24.632
While players nowadays live in a bubble, spending their days training, and being

00:20:24.632 --> 00:20:30.262
careful of every single thing that they put into their body, it really is a miracle

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:37.132
that Maradona managed to achieve what he did while living the life of a 1980s rock star,

00:20:37.252 --> 00:20:43.252
smoking cigars, drinking heavily, having huge meals, and taking vast amounts of cocaine.

00:20:44.342 --> 00:20:51.832
But of course his story is a sad one, of a boy with everything ahead of him who was swallowed up and

00:20:51.872 --> 00:20:57.882
thrown out by a city and people that had adopted him, and that he loved back with his whole heart.

00:20:59.082 --> 00:21:03.522
Whatever one might think of the man, and of the story, it’s hard to deny,

00:21:03.702 --> 00:21:08.252
as the Neapolitan fans sing, that “There is only one Diego Maradona”.

00:21:11.422 --> 00:21:15.702
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Diego Armando Maradona.

00:21:16.132 --> 00:21:19.092
I hope it’s been a interesting one, that you’ve learned something

00:21:19.092 --> 00:21:23.422
new about this amazing man, and about his fantastic but tragic story.

00:21:24.212 --> 00:21:28.312
In case you missed it, this is actually the second episode about football this

00:21:28.312 --> 00:21:34.732
week, episode 145, which is available exclusively on the website, was all about when

00:21:34.732 --> 00:21:38.940
football became big business, so I’d definitely recommend checking that one out.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:45.770
And as I said earlier, if you want to learn more about the Camorra, then episode number 75 is

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:51.170
the one for you - it is all about the secret society that controls the Neapolitan underworld.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.030
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.020
For the Italians and the Argentines, I guess you might have particularly

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.600
strong views of Maradona, so I would love to know what you think.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:09.150

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.199
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.439
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:24.989
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.806
Superstitions, the belief that things are lucky or unlucky.

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:36.016
From the psychological reasons why we believe in superstitions and the

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:41.156
religious implications of believing in superstitions to the origins of

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:44.326
5 different superstitions, I think it’s going to be quite a fun one.

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:50.326
If you’re listening to this episode on the day it comes out, you might have noticed that

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:56.636
it’s Friday the 13th, which is considered unlucky in lots of different countries, and don’t

00:00:56.636 --> 00:01:01.696
worry, we’ll be talking about that as well, and why it’s not really that unlucky at all.

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:07.526
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:12.676
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:17.726
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:22.416

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.566
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.856
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:45.546
And final point, thank you to Jachym, an awesome member of Leonardo

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:48.576
English from the Czech Republic who requested this episode.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:49.686
I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:53.686
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:02:00.136
Superstitions are all around us, and no matter what country you’re from

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:05.666
you’ve probably been culturally exposed to superstitions all of your life,

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:10.886
even if they might not have immediately seemed to you like superstitions.

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:16.876
If you look in the dictionary, it will define superstition as something like:

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:21.566
“a belief or practice resulting from ignorance, fear of the unknown,

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:25.856
trust in magic or chance, or a false conception of causation”

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:27.186
Or

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:31.176
“belief that is not based on human reason or scientific

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:34.946
knowledge, but is connected with old ideas about magic”

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:40.986
Essentially it’s a belief in something that doesn’t make sense and is related to magic.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.556
Superstitions go back millennia, they go back thousands of

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:49.586
years, yet they are still believed by billions of people.

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:56.356
Indeed, 50% of Americans say that they’re superstitious, and three quarters of people

00:02:56.356 --> 00:03:02.386
in the UK say that they knock on wood, they do this 'knock knock', to avoid bad luck.

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:07.546
So if the dictionary basically says ‘it’s something that people

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:12.226
do because they are ignorant’, why is half the world doing it?

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:17.276
We’ll get to some of the psychological reasons for it in a minute, but

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:22.556
before that it’s good to understand a bit about the origins of superstitions,

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:28.046
because this will help us understand why they are so embedded in our culture.

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:36.086
The word superstition is thought to come from Latin, super-stare, to stand over, or to stand upon.

00:03:36.896 --> 00:03:44.386
Now, how that actually translates to the meaning of the word that we have now is a little unclear,

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:51.626
but it’s thought to have come from the idea of standing over something and being amazed at it.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:04:00.386
Back in Ancient Rome, being superstitious was used to describe people who were too afraid

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:06.486
of the Gods, and believed that there were certain things that they could do over and

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:12.176
above the normal things that people were supposed to do that would influence the future.

00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:16.976
The word ‘superstitio’ was to be contrasted with ‘religio’,

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:21.556
which was the normal, appropriate fear and belief in Gods.

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:27.096
If you think about it from a religious doctrinal point of view,

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:32.396
this idea that there are small, mundane things that people can do

00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:38.276
to influence their fate, and control the Gods is quite problematic.

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:46.246
World religions often have strict behavioural codes, things that people should and shouldn’t do,

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:55.186
and if there is another set of seemingly random things that people should and shouldn’t do and these

00:04:55.186 --> 00:05:01.846
can affect their fate, then that doesn’t really fit with the religion that that person is following.

00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:07.776
Indeed, the Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful.

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:13.816
If you believe that you can change your fate just by throwing salt over your

00:05:13.816 --> 00:05:20.516
shoulder or by not seeing a black cat, then logically it’s quite hard to reconcile

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:25.226
that with believing that there is an all-powerful God who controls your life.

00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:31.096
Superstition is actually right there in the Catechism of the Catholic Church,

00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:38.016
just above worshiping false gods, and is called a ‘perverse excess of religion’.

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:44.246
So you can understand, theologically at least, why superstition is problematic.

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:51.456
It’s at odds with the scriptures; logically both can’t exist at the same time and be true.

00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:58.536
In terms of where different superstitions come from, this is normally up for debate.

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:02.526
There are lots of possible explanations about where they

00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:06.056
come from, with some being more probable than others.

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:11.746
With all of them, they likely came from a time that something happened just before something

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:18.326
good or something bad, and culturally people started associating the thing that happened before

00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:23.886
to the thing that happened after, believing that the first event impacted the second one.

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:29.886
Interestingly, most superstitions predict that something bad is going to happen.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:37.036
There are of course a few that are linked to good luck, for example finding a four-leaved

00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:44.406
clover, a four-leafed little plant, or carrying a rabbit’s foot, but most are negative.

00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:47.323
It's interesting to think why this is.

00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:52.973
There’s an idea in psychology called Negativity Bias, which is the

00:06:52.973 --> 00:06:58.023
idea that we are more affected by negative events than positive events.

00:06:58.683 --> 00:07:05.053
If there are two events of equal intensity, of equal strength, one good and the

00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:10.443
other bad, then we feel the negative one more strongly than the positive one.

00:07:11.303 --> 00:07:17.323
So bringing this back to superstitions, if something good happens we might just think,

00:07:17.663 --> 00:07:23.293
well that’s good, whereas if something negative happens it might have a greater impact

00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:29.773
on us, we remember it more strongly, try to put a reason on why it happened, and

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:35.373
start engaging in behaviour that we believe might stop it happening in the future.

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:39.443
OK, so that’s a little explanation about some of the

00:07:39.443 --> 00:07:43.453
psychological reasons that people believe superstitions exist.

00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:47.473
Let’s get into some of the stories behind superstitions.

00:07:48.453 --> 00:07:53.833
We’re going to start with one that has a story I quite like, and that’s to do with umbrellas.

00:07:54.893 --> 00:07:59.333
Now, you’ve probably heard that you shouldn’t open an umbrella inside.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.783
Maybe you’ve just heard that you shouldn’t do it, but

00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:05.893
it’s also considered ‘bad luck’ in many countries.

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:07.883
Why, you might ask?

00:08:08.693 --> 00:08:12.613
There is a theory that it was to do with the ancient Egyptians

00:08:12.663 --> 00:08:16.703
and their sunshades, but this isn’t really believed by many.

00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:24.693
The real reason is thought to have actually come from much more recently, from Victorian England.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:28.623
England, as those of you who have visited the country will

00:08:28.623 --> 00:08:32.913
know, is a place where an umbrella comes in pretty handy.

00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:41.533
Umbrellas began to be more and more widespread in Victorian England, but they were big, heavy things

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:47.883
with dangerous spikes that could open quickly and without warning, injuring people around you.

00:08:49.013 --> 00:08:54.393
So presumably, when it was raining outside, people used to open their umbrellas

00:08:54.583 --> 00:09:01.103
inside, but children, family members and pets got hurt by these things opening

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:06.143
quickly and dangerously, and so it became bad luck to open them inside.

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:10.513
So there you go, the reason why you shouldn’t open an

00:09:10.513 --> 00:09:14.753
umbrella inside seems to actually be quite sensible.

00:09:15.853 --> 00:09:21.643
Our second superstition is to do with salt - when it’s unlucky, and when it’s lucky.

00:09:22.773 --> 00:09:27.233
Salt, as you may know, was a precious commodity throughout history.

00:09:28.213 --> 00:09:33.473
Linguistically its importance has left a mark, with the expression ‘not worth

00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:39.383
its salt’ meaning ‘not worth its cost’, and the word ‘salary’, the money you get

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:44.583
from a job, coming from the term for money Roman soldiers were given to buy salt.

00:09:45.743 --> 00:09:50.863
So, salt was important, and spilling salt, dropping salt

00:09:50.863 --> 00:09:54.863
on the ground accidentally, was considered very bad luck.

00:09:55.753 --> 00:09:58.863
You can see why spilling salt would be bad luck.

00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:05.093
It was expensive and precious, and so damaging it was obviously not something that you wanted to do.

00:10:05.723 --> 00:10:13.483
And going back to the year 3,500 BC it’s thought that the Ancient Sumerians decided

00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:18.993
that throwing a pinch of salt, a small amount of salt over their left shoulders

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:25.703
would be a way of nullifying, of canceling the bad luck caused by spilling the salt.

00:10:26.733 --> 00:10:31.263
This superstition has been continued though, and in Judeo-Christian

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:35.553
culture it’s also good luck to throw salt over your shoulder.

00:10:36.783 --> 00:10:43.423
The theory goes that Judas, the disciple that betrayed Jesus spilled salt, because

00:10:43.623 --> 00:10:49.853
he is portrayed doing so in Leonardo Da Vinci’s Last Supper, and so if you want

00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:54.643
to have good luck you should do the opposite of what someone very bad has done.

00:10:55.973 --> 00:11:00.063
It’s not clear whether you need to sweep it up after you’ve thrown it down though.

00:11:00.433 --> 00:11:07.213
I guess in the Renaissance, or in 3,500 BC sweeping the floors wasn’t quite so important.

00:11:08.113 --> 00:11:12.923
Our third superstition is one of the most popular superstitions, and

00:11:12.923 --> 00:11:16.843
that is something that three quarters of people in the UK say that

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:21.463
they do, and that’s to knock on, our touch, wood, 'knock knock'.

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:25.293
Now, I guess you know how this one works, you’ve probably

00:11:25.563 --> 00:11:28.253
seen people doing it, and you might even do it yourself.

00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:35.103
After saying something you touch wood either as a way of hoping that something you want

00:11:35.113 --> 00:11:39.703
to happen will happen, or of preventing something you don’t want to happen from happening.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.813
Where this comes from, though, is debated by historians.

00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:52.263
Some think it comes from when you would need to swear over a crucifix to promise something was true.

00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:58.633
If you were a true Christian you would never tempt fate by lying when

00:11:58.663 --> 00:12:03.543
touching the cross, and so tapping wood was a connection to this idea.

00:12:04.763 --> 00:12:09.653
There’s another idea that peasants in Europe would knock loudly on their

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:15.973
wooden doors to keep away evil spirits, and so the wood is to represent a door.

00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:23.273
There’s also the idea that both good and bad spirits live in trees, and so by

00:12:23.273 --> 00:12:28.013
tapping on a tree you could either get a good spirit to come out and help you

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:32.983
or you could keep a bad spirit in, to stop something bad happening to you.

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:39.973
There’s another theory that it actually came from a British children’s game where

00:12:40.373 --> 00:12:45.873
children would chase each other and could avoid being caught by touching a piece of wood.

00:12:47.043 --> 00:12:52.113
For this one it’s pretty unclear where it actually comes from - perhaps that’s

00:12:52.123 --> 00:12:56.943
one of the reasons that it is one of the most popular superstitions, that it just

00:12:57.113 --> 00:13:02.823
exists in popular culture for no clear reason, or at least, for disputed reasons.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:09.053
If there was a superstition and everyone knew for sure where it came from it

00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:14.603
would do some damage to its credibility, so perhaps that’s a reason that the ones

00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:20.073
with the most debated origins tend to be the ones that are most widely believed.

00:13:21.043 --> 00:13:27.033
Our next superstition, our fourth superstition is a linguistic one, and it’s the

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:33.123
reason that in English we say ‘bless you’ after someone sneezes, after they do ah-choo.

00:13:34.303 --> 00:13:39.303
This is thought to date back to the sixth century AD, and to have

00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:43.843
come from when there was a Great Plague raging through Europe.

00:13:44.993 --> 00:13:49.033
One of the ways in which the plague passed from one person to the other

00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:55.773
was through coughing and sneezing, and so Pope Gregory I declared that when

00:13:55.773 --> 00:14:00.483
someone sneezed you should say ‘bless you’ as a way of protecting them.

00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:05.723
I was a little surprised to find that this reportedly came from the pope,

00:14:06.123 --> 00:14:11.013
given the Catholic Church’s current view on superstition, and it does seem

00:14:11.023 --> 00:14:16.953
a little strange to think that doctrinally a person’s fate can be influenced

00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:22.293
by another person saying two words, but this is one of the main theories.

00:14:23.813 --> 00:14:31.183
Another theory is that when you sneeze your soul is separated from your body and so by saying

00:14:31.533 --> 00:14:37.163
‘God bless you’ it’s a way of stopping the devil from jumping in and stealing your soul.

00:14:37.923 --> 00:14:43.933
In your language I imagine you say a similar thing after someone sneezes because, well, sneezing

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:49.113
normally comes when you have a cold, a flu, or something like that, and you’re not in great health.

00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:56.473
So on one level it’s just a perfectly nice and reasonable thing to wish someone good health if they

00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:01.263
have just done something that indicates that they’re not in particularly great health right now.

00:15:02.703 --> 00:15:09.803
And our fifth and final superstition is two superstitions rolled into one, and it’s to do

00:15:09.803 --> 00:15:15.413
with Friday the 13th, or ‘today’ if you’re listening to this episode on the day it’s released.

00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:20.503
Before we go into this explanation, I should say that I hope you’re

00:15:20.513 --> 00:15:25.553
having a fantastic day, a better than normal day even, just to disprove

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:29.813
all of the superstitions about Friday the 13th being an unlucky day.

00:15:31.093 --> 00:15:32.813
Ok then, I’ve got that out of the way.

00:15:34.053 --> 00:15:39.833
So, there are a few theories about why the number 13 is considered so unlucky.

00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:49.623
The first centres around the idea of 12 being a complete number - there are 12 months of

00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:56.443
the year, 12 hours on a clock, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 signs of the zodiac, and so on.

00:15:57.053 --> 00:16:02.843
13 is an outsider, a number that detracts from the completeness of 12.

00:16:04.223 --> 00:16:09.293
There were, of course, also 13 people to sit at the table for the Last

00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:14.773
Supper, with Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, thought to be number 13.

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:23.113
And going further back to ancient Norse mythology there’s a story of 12 gods being invited

00:16:23.153 --> 00:16:31.393
to dine at Valhalla, a great hall in Viking heaven, and a thirteenth god crashing the party,

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:38.713
causing a huge fight, one of the good gods to die, and the world plunging into darkness.

00:16:39.983 --> 00:16:43.273
There’s even a word for fear of the number 13, it's "triskaidekaphobia".

00:16:45.503 --> 00:16:49.573
I guess you probably won’t need to use this one very much, but there you go.

00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:53.633
Triskaidekaphobia is a real problem though.

00:16:54.103 --> 00:17:01.003
Many buildings don’t have a thirteenth floor, most aeroplanes don’t have a 13th row, and it’s

00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:08.633
estimated that 10% of the US population, so that’s 30 million people, are afraid of the number 13.

00:17:10.003 --> 00:17:11.843
But why Friday, you might ask?

00:17:12.443 --> 00:17:15.623
Well, Friday isn’t a great day in the Bible.

00:17:16.053 --> 00:17:19.763
It was thought to be the day on which Eve offered Adam the

00:17:19.803 --> 00:17:23.763
forbidden fruit, eventually causing man’s fall from Eden.

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.853
It was also the day that Jesus was crucified.

00:17:28.183 --> 00:17:33.433
So when you combine the bad luck of the number 13 with the bad luck of Friday

00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:37.993
you are really getting into unlucky territory, so the superstition goes.

00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:45.360
But it wasn’t really until the horror film Friday 13th, in 1980, that there was this real

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.646
widespread idea that Friday 13th was a date where all sorts of terrible things happen.

00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:56.349
So is it actually that terrible, and should you keep

00:17:56.349 --> 00:18:00.582
a lookout tonight for all sorts of unlucky things?

00:18:00.582 --> 00:18:01.522
Well, no.

00:18:01.522 --> 00:18:09.453
Indeed, there was a Dutch study from 2008 that suggested that there are fewer car accidents, fewer

00:18:09.453 --> 00:18:17.683
fires, and fewer bad things that happen on Friday 13 than on a normal day, presumably because

00:18:17.913 --> 00:18:24.053
people are careful, or they just avoid activities that could be considered dangerous in any way.

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:28.673
So, if you are listening to this episode on Friday the 13th, I

00:18:28.673 --> 00:18:32.523
hope you’re having a marvelous day, full of good luck and joy.

00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:39.013
And if you’re listening to this episode and Friday the 13th has been and gone without

00:18:39.023 --> 00:18:44.543
you noticing any bad luck, congratulations, you’ve survived, and at least you now know a

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:49.583
little bit more about where this superstition, and superstitions in general, come from.

00:18:51.623 --> 00:18:56.323
OK then, that is it for today's episode on superstitions, how

00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:59.223
they work, where they come from, and why people believe them.

00:19:00.113 --> 00:19:04.333
I hope it’s shed some light on a few superstitions that you might

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:08.253
believe, might observe, or perhaps you think it’s all a load of rubbish.

00:19:09.203 --> 00:19:13.153
As always, either way I'd love to know what you thought of the episode.

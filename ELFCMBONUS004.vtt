Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:10.845
English.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:16.545
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to talk about pronunciation in English.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:24.955
It's a topic that comes up a lot, and today we are going to bust a lot of common myths, talk about

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:30.715
why pronunciation matters and about some of the things that you can do to improve your

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:31.435
pronunciation.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:38.420
Before we get right into the podcast, I just wanted to say that their world is obviously in a pretty

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.280
weird, scary place right now.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.060
You don't need another person telling you what to do so.

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:45.825
I'm not going to try to do so.

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:51.825
All I'll say is to thank you for continuing to listen to the podcast and I hope that you are keeping

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:52.275
well.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.189
And as this is a members-only podcast, I just want to thank you for your ongoing membership to

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.119
Leonardo English.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.804
You make all of this possible, and each one of you is the reason that I keep on doing this show.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:11.334
Okay then, that's our thank yous over with for today.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:13.884
Let's talk about pronunciation.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:23.124
Firstly, let's just clear up one thing that lots of people get wrong, and that's the difference

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:25.794
between pronunciation and accent.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:31.024
Before I explain this, just have a little think.

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.799
Do you know what the difference is between pronunciation and accent?

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:43.854
An accent is just a distinctive way of pronouncing words in a language.

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:50.394
It's normally associated with a particular country, area or social class.

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:58.434
Pronunciation, on the other hand, is similar to accent, but actually refers to the way in which

00:01:58.464 --> 00:02:01.614
certain individual sounds are produced.

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:09.897
When we talk about non-native English speakers and pronunciation, there's normally a right or a

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:16.227
series of right ways to pronounce a word, and there are also wrong ways to pronounce a word.

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:25.137
But with an accent, there are hundreds, thousands of different accents in English, and none of them

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:27.987
are any more right than any other.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.309
Just to give you an example of the difference between accent and pronunciation, we can take the

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.839
classic example of tomato, tomato, right?

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:45.789
People from different countries pronounce this word in different ways and they're both fine.

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.349
I would say tomato, someone from America would probably say tomato.

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:56.799
But pronouncing it for example, 'tomatoohh' is incorrect.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.269
That's bad pronunciation.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.889
The stress is in the wrong place.

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:07.873
In English, you can have a English accent, you can have an American, you can have a French accent, a

00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:11.593
Spanish accent, or an accent from anywhere in the world.

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:16.018
It doesn't mean that your pronunciation is bad, necessarily.

00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:23.338
It's perfectly possible to have a French accent, but to have almost perfect pronunciation in

00:03:23.338 --> 00:03:23.788
English.

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:30.581
Today we are talking about pronunciation, not specifically about accents.

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.501
So pronunciation is how you make different sounds.

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.341
It's about how the different sounds in a word are created.

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:47.231
The reason I explained the difference between accent and pronunciation is because lots of English

00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:53.141
learners get them confused, and this is actually a bit of a problem for two reasons.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:04:02.831
Firstly, on one hand, people think that having a French accent, a Spanish accent, whatever accent it

00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:10.841
might be, they think that is bad because it means you have bad pronunciation, but it doesn't at all.

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.041
Having a foreign accent is completely acceptable.

00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.811
It's part of your identity.

00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:18.431
It shows who you are.

00:04:19.016 --> 00:04:23.036
And speaking in English shouldn't be about hiding your true self.

00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:27.146
It shouldn't be about having a completely flat accent.

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:35.046
But on the other hand, there are some people who think that the fact that they are a non-native

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:42.686
speaker is an excuse or a reason rather to not try to improve their pronunciation.

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:50.108
They confuse accent with pronunciation, and the result is that they continue to pronounce words

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:56.588
incorrectly either because they just don't know that they're pronouncing them incorrectly or because

00:04:56.588 --> 00:05:01.028
they think it's not a problem and that it's just part of their identity.

00:05:02.748 --> 00:05:04.998
This, unfortunately, is a problem.

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:12.913
The reality is that anyone from any mother tongue can make any sound pattern they want.

00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:21.343
If you don't have any kind of speech defect or actually, even if you do, with enough practice and

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:25.033
enough work, you can pronounce any sound you want to.

00:05:27.163 --> 00:05:32.953
A child that's brought up in a Mandarin speaking household will speak with perfect pronunciation in

00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:39.833
Mandarin, and that exact child would speak with perfect Portuguese pronunciation if they were

00:05:39.853 --> 00:05:42.193
brought up in a Portuguese speaking household.

00:05:43.183 --> 00:05:49.368
We know that there's no biological reason, no physical reason, that we can't make certain sounds.

00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:58.028
But lots of people give up, or at least don't make the effort that they should when it comes to

00:05:58.028 --> 00:05:59.588
pronunciation in English.

00:06:01.358 --> 00:06:02.768
And here's why this is a problem.

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:11.168
Firstly, there have been multiple studies that have shown that the better your pronunciation, the

00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:14.408
more you'll be respected when you are speaking in English.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:22.818
There is subconscious bias from the point of view of the listener, so that people with worse

00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:27.618
pronunciation aren't respected and trusted by native speakers.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:33.528
At least they're not respected and trusted as much as native speakers are.

00:06:35.088 --> 00:06:42.078
Essentially, the more the person speaking sounds like the person who is listening, the more likely

00:06:42.108 --> 00:06:45.828
the listener is to trust the words of the speaker.

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:48.909
And this isn't just my opinion.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.909
There've been quite a few studies that have shown that this is the case.

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:59.379
There was a really interesting experiment on this relatively recently.

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:07.119
Researchers from the University of Chicago wanted to see whether people with stronger accents and

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:12.939
worst pronunciation were considered more or less trustworthy than native speakers.

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:25.369
So first, the researchers asked a group of 35 people to judge the truthfulness of simple statements,

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:34.009
things like "ants don't sleep", and "a giraffe can go without water longer than a camel can".

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:43.950
And these statements were read by people with various strong accents and bad pronunciation, people

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:53.340
whose mother tongue was Turkish, Korean, Polish, Austrian-German and Italian, as well as some native

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.270
English speakers.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.540
So these statements, they were the kinds of things where you think, "well, could be true, I'm not

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.260
really so sure".

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.940
Maybe ants don't sleep.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.600
Maybe a giraffe can go longer without water than a camel can.

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:15.380
The people listening were told that the speakers were just speaking already provided statements and

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.520
it wasn't their opinion.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:25.550
What the researchers found was that the statements of the native speakers were trusted much more

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:31.271
than the statements of those with the heavy accents and poor pronunciation, despite them saying

00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:33.011
exactly the same things.

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:41.781
So it makes a difference from the point of view of trust and of believability, but also from the

00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.421
point of view of commanding respect.

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:51.620
And making it easier for the person listening to you to understand what you're saying pronouncing

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:58.730
words in a correct way without a strong accent means that you are requiring the other person to do

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.510
less work.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:08.770
If someone is hard to understand, the other person often switches off, they lose concentration.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.190
I imagine that you have experienced this with foreigners speaking your mother tongue.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.800
It's quite easy to switch off, right?

00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:25.062
Speaking clearly and making it easy for the other person to understand just means that the

00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:32.707
conversation will be a lot more fluid and you'll avoid hearing the dreaded "excuse me, can you

00:09:32.707 --> 00:09:33.337
repeat that?"

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:41.727
So even though you might think that pronunciation doesn't make a huge difference, it really does.

00:09:42.986 --> 00:09:46.767
Maybe you already knew this and in that case, good for you.

00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:53.187
And if you didn't know that well, then we will shortly be talking about some tips on how you can

00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:54.207
improve your pronunciation.

00:09:55.508 --> 00:09:59.626
Let's talk now about why some people struggle with pronunciation.

00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:06.766
Then after that, we'll go over a few tips of things that you can do to improve your pronunciation.

00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:12.626
Firstly, pronunciation is formed of two parts.

00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:18.086
Number one is being able to actually hear and recognise sounds.

00:10:18.745 --> 00:10:24.173
If I say beach and bitch, can you hear the difference between those two words?

00:10:25.573 --> 00:10:28.543
I'll just say that again, beach and bitch.

00:10:30.703 --> 00:10:37.483
To a native English speaker it's easy to recognise the difference between the two, but for some

00:10:37.483 --> 00:10:44.413
people it's really hard, especially people whose native language is something like Spanish or

00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:45.163
Italian.

00:10:46.033 --> 00:10:52.333
I use the example of beach and bitch because it is something that lots of my Italian friends always

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:54.649
get wrong, and they also find it quite funny.

00:10:56.402 --> 00:11:01.877
Being able to recognise the difference between two different sounds is the first part.

00:11:02.927 --> 00:11:07.637
You should focus on this before focussing on actually reproducing the different sounds.

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:15.559
If you can't recognise the difference between two things, firstly, there's no way that you will be

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:18.079
able to reproduce those sounds yourself.

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:24.039
And secondly, it will be harder to understand others when you hear them being spoken.

00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:30.866
A really good thing to do here is to focus on what's called minimal pairs.

00:11:31.646 --> 00:11:39.926
So that's things like our classic example of bitch versus beach, disk or desk, fan or van and so on.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:47.701
Find the ones that you have trouble recognising and practice, practice, practice until you can not

00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:53.096
only recognise the difference, but that you can reproduce the sounds yourself.

00:11:56.056 --> 00:11:59.956
So we have moved onto the topic of actually making the sound.

00:12:01.436 --> 00:12:07.136
As I said, you should only focus on this when you are confident that you can understand the

00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:08.426
difference between the sounds.

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:16.441
Now, I'm not going to talk about particular sounds in English here as depending on what your mother

00:12:16.441 --> 00:12:20.581
tongue is, some sounds will be harder for you to make than others.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:26.572
So I'll just talk about a few resources and techniques that are pretty helpful.

00:12:27.682 --> 00:12:32.902
Some of these you may be aware of, some of them, well, you might not be.

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:41.917
Firstly, and this might sound really obvious, but Google Translate can actually be an excellent

00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:47.857
resource for quickly telling you if you are pronouncing a word correctly and showing you how to

00:12:47.857 --> 00:12:49.087
physically pronounce it.

00:12:50.797 --> 00:12:56.107
There's a function within Google Translate that allows you to hear how the word is spoken.

00:12:56.587 --> 00:13:02.497
You probably know about that, it's the little button that looks like a speaker But that's pretty

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:03.067
basic.

00:13:03.487 --> 00:13:07.777
So I'm going to let you into a trick that I imagine you may not have been aware of.

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:15.937
If you Google "how to pronounce", and then you add the word, so if you Google "how to pronounce

00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:19.627
elephant", you find some pretty cool functionality.

00:13:21.357 --> 00:13:22.317
You can try this now.

00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:28.647
So firstly, you can see the individual component parts of the word.

00:13:29.307 --> 00:13:33.847
In the example of elephant, it would be eh· luh· fnt.

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:35.907
This is pretty cool.

00:13:35.937 --> 00:13:41.277
It shows you where the stress is, so you know that it's not "eh leh fant".

00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:49.392
You can of course, also press a button to hear how it's pronounced in English, both in British and

00:13:49.392 --> 00:13:50.322
American English.

00:13:51.672 --> 00:13:58.392
Then it starts getting really cool so you can see a little video of where your lips should be, when

00:13:58.392 --> 00:14:01.452
you say each component part of the word.

00:14:02.412 --> 00:14:09.072
And where it gets even cooler is that Google will also allow you to check your pronunciation.

00:14:10.437 --> 00:14:17.517
You can record yourself saying a particular word and Google will tell you how well you did, it'll

00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:20.337
tell you where you went wrong if you made a mistake.

00:14:21.387 --> 00:14:27.148
Of course it's not perfect, it's a computer program, but it is a pretty cool feature.

00:14:28.438 --> 00:14:34.498
So Google is definitely your friend when it comes to easy to use pronunciation tools.

00:14:35.128 --> 00:14:37.768
You don't need to download an app or anything like that.

00:14:38.323 --> 00:14:42.853
Just go to google.com then type "how to pronounce", and then the word.

00:14:45.193 --> 00:14:51.913
Secondly, a fantastic thing that you can do to improve your pronunciation is something that you may

00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:57.103
well have heard me speaking about before, and that's something called shadowing.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:06.288
Shadowing is a pronunciation technique that involves you speaking out loud at the same time as a

00:15:06.288 --> 00:15:07.038
native speaker.

00:15:08.668 --> 00:15:15.508
You need to find a relatively short piece of audio, let's say something that's one to two minutes

00:15:15.508 --> 00:15:18.298
long and has a transcript provided.

00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:25.898
Then you should listen to it a few times to make sure that you understand what the speaker is saying

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:33.098
and to make sure that you know how to pronounce any tricky, any difficult words.

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:42.278
Then when you are confident that you can do this, you should actually speak out loud at the same

00:15:42.278 --> 00:15:44.498
time as the English speaker.

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:52.448
It will feel pretty strange to do at first, but after you've done it a few times it'll feel

00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:53.528
completely natural.

00:15:55.418 --> 00:16:00.758
It's one of the absolute best things that you can do to improve your pronunciation.

00:16:01.384 --> 00:16:07.714
You'll be speaking at exactly the same time as a native speaker, trying to pronounce words in

00:16:07.714 --> 00:16:15.574
exactly the same way as he or she is, and you'll soon find yourself naturally mimicking, naturally

00:16:15.604 --> 00:16:18.904
imitating, the pronunciation of the native speaker.

00:16:20.934 --> 00:16:25.314
You can, of course use any kind of listening resource to do this.

00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:32.274
As you know, all of the English Learning for Curious Minds podcasts come with a transcript for you

00:16:32.274 --> 00:16:36.924
to follow along with, or you could of course use the animating transcript.

00:16:38.201 --> 00:16:39.669
But it doesn't really matter.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:47.199
The important thing is that you try it, and I'd be really surprised if you tried it and didn't see

00:16:47.349 --> 00:16:49.959
pretty quick results with your own pronunciation.

00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:59.217
My third tip, which I wouldn't really even classify as a tip as it should just be common sense, is

00:16:59.217 --> 00:17:04.617
to make sure that with anything you're doing to improve your pronunciation, make sure you are

00:17:04.617 --> 00:17:06.417
listening to a native speaker.

00:17:07.817 --> 00:17:14.657
Why, I never understand why, when there are hundreds of millions of native speakers all across the

00:17:14.657 --> 00:17:21.377
world, I never understand why people would choose to listen to someone who wasn't a native speaker.

00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:30.857
Of course, it's completely understandable with in-person stuff where you may not always have native

00:17:30.857 --> 00:17:35.057
speaker teachers in your country, but in terms of online stuff?

00:17:35.747 --> 00:17:38.747
So make sure you're listening to native speakers.

00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:39.557
End of.

00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:47.251
And my fourth, or, it's really third I guess because tip number three should have been so obvious,

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:53.521
the fourth tip is what I call learn to love and appreciate your mouth.

00:17:54.836 --> 00:18:00.536
Obviously, the way you pronounce different words is based on where you position your lips, your

00:18:00.536 --> 00:18:02.576
tongue, and mouth more generally.

00:18:03.476 --> 00:18:09.566
You know this already, but lots of people don't pay the attention that they should do to the

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:12.146
position of their tongue and their lips.

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:20.576
There are tonnes of videos on YouTube with information on the position that your lips and tongue

00:18:20.576 --> 00:18:27.356
should be when you pronounce certain words and lots of pretty great resources if you just Google

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.066
"English pronunciation tips".

00:18:29.966 --> 00:18:37.151
So rather than giving you specific tips, I just want to advise you to, from a more general point of

00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:41.501
view, to really focus on the position of your lips and mouth.

00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:48.781
Pinpoint, discover, where you are making errors through listening to native speakers.

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:56.458
Practice through shadowing, and make sure that you are able to recreate the sounds correctly through

00:18:56.458 --> 00:19:00.058
becoming aware of the positioning of your own lips and tongue.

00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:07.952
And here comes the final bit, which I think is the most fun part, and that's to record yourself

00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:08.432
speaking.

00:19:09.062 --> 00:19:12.722
Listen back to it and try to see where you made mistakes.

00:19:14.712 --> 00:19:21.492
Let me start just by acknowledging the fact that people generally hate the sound of their own voice.

00:19:22.782 --> 00:19:25.062
I have to listen to my own voice a lot.

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:31.512
Recording and editing all of the episodes means that I've probably listened to my own voice in the

00:19:31.512 --> 00:19:35.382
past three months more than I had in the past 33 years.

00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:37.652
But you do get used to it.

00:19:38.632 --> 00:19:44.662
And from the point of view of improving your pronunciation, you need to get used to listening to the

00:19:44.662 --> 00:19:45.982
sound of your own voice.

00:19:47.692 --> 00:19:52.402
Listening to how you speak in English will do a few things for you.

00:19:53.752 --> 00:19:59.392
Firstly, for a lot of people, it will probably actually boost your confidence.

00:20:00.862 --> 00:20:08.327
Most people think that they are worse at speaking, and that they have worse pronunciation, than they

00:20:08.327 --> 00:20:09.137
actually do.

00:20:11.287 --> 00:20:14.567
So if you listen to yourself you'll realise you're not as bad as you think you are.

00:20:16.497 --> 00:20:23.307
Secondly, it'll mean that you understand better the words that you aren't pronouncing correctly.

00:20:24.787 --> 00:20:31.177
It's really hard when you are speaking to understand when you are pronouncing a word incorrectly

00:20:31.507 --> 00:20:32.457
right there and then.

00:20:32.977 --> 00:20:40.057
But when you are able to listen to yourself speaking and can do things like pause and rewind to

00:20:40.087 --> 00:20:42.337
listen again, it's a lot easier.

00:20:44.147 --> 00:20:50.682
You can obviously record yourself saying anything, but it's more useful if you can find something

00:20:50.772 --> 00:20:55.122
where you can compare your version to the version of a native speaker.

00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:59.741
It just means it's easier to see where you make mistakes.

00:21:00.966 --> 00:21:07.675
And like shadowing, you can use anything, but if you're listening to this podcast, what better place

00:21:07.675 --> 00:21:08.845
to start than this?

00:21:09.955 --> 00:21:16.575
I tell you what, and I guess this is a bit of a strange challenge, but if you want to record

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:25.155
yourself speaking any one of our podcasts out loud, this one or any of the other 40 or so, then

00:21:25.275 --> 00:21:28.545
record it, email in the recording.

00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:30.465
I'd love to hear how you get on.

00:21:31.305 --> 00:21:38.025
And obviously I'll give you some actionable feedback on what you can do to improve, unless it's

00:21:38.025 --> 00:21:42.990
perfect, of course, and then I'll just give you a bit of a virtual pat on the back.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:52.110
So there you go, if you're interested, record yourself speaking part of one of the podcasts, send it

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:58.590
in to HI - hi@leonardoenglish.com - and I will personally correct it and send it back to you.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.720
That's quite a fun challenge right?

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:02.940
Okay.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:09.480
In the interests of keeping this episode to a manageable time, we are going to leave it there for

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.030
today's episode on pronunciation.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:20.130
It is a fascinating area of English learning, one that's very interesting to me personally and one

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.070
that many English learners don't completely appreciate.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.610
So I hope that this episode has been useful.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.650

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.890
pronunciation.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.020

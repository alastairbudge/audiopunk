Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.130
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.240
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.330
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Marvel.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.960
It is one of the most successful entertainment brands in the world,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.990
and is behind SpiderMan, X-Men, The Incredible Hulk, and more.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.070
But, the journey to get there, like a Marvel movie, was all but

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.100
simple, and in this episode we are going to tell this story.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.730
It involves Hitler, patriotism, the creative process, a slightly tenuous reference

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.360
to a 19th century Frenchman, near bankruptcy and more, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.940
I should also say that this episode is a member request, so Rita, if

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.390
you are listening, thank you very much for this excellent suggestion.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.710
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about The Marvel Universe.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.440
In 1832, an overweight French 33-year-old had an idea.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.540
He had been writing books for the best part of a decade, but

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.320
they had not received the critical success he had hoped for.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.240
To be precise, one critic had referred to them as

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.256
“curiously, interestingly, almost enthrallingly bad."

00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:43.798
But all was about to change with the idea that the man had been struck by.

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:49.301
He would create a huge fictional world based in 19th century France.

00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:53.728
He would write stories about the characters that existed in this world.

00:01:54.428 --> 00:02:00.718
Each book would focus on the trials and tribulations of a different character, but there would be

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:07.008
some overlap - the main character in one book might be a minor character in another, and so on.

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:14.678
He ran to his sister’s apartment, declaring “I’m about to become a genius”, and he got to work.

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:21.098
In the next 18 years he would go on to write almost 100 books about this

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:26.658
fictional world, before dropping over and dying from a heart attack aged 51.

00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:34.972
The man was Honoré de Balzac, and his fictional world was La Comédie Humaine, the Human Comedy.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:42.557
Fast forward a few hundred years and anyone going to any cinema, almost anywhere

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:49.347
in the world, cannot but be bombarded with adverts to dive into another magical

00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:55.147
fictional world, The Marvel Universe, a world in which characters overlap, fight,

00:02:55.547 --> 00:03:00.617
work together,  interact with each other and influence each other’s stories.

00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:05.777
This, however, is about where the parallels stop.

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:11.577
Honoré de Balzac died poor and in debt; The Marvel

00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:16.377
Universe has raked in $30 billion from its movies alone.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:23.164
Balzac painted a powerful picture of a wide range of contemporary French society;

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:29.450
the Marvel Universe deals with a fantasy world of superhumans and supervillains.

00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:37.214
Balzac’s works are critically acclaimed, with novelists such as Emile Zola and Charles Dickens

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.074
crediting Balzac as being an influence on their work; Marvel, on the other hand, was called

00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:52.524
monotonous by Christian Bale, “not cinema” by Martin Scorsese, and “boring as shit” by Ridley Scott.

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:59.954
Some directors might not like them, but it is undeniable that Marvel films

00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:04.584
are incredibly popular and successful, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:09.584
franchise grossing more than twice the Star Wars franchise at the box office.

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:12.584
So, how did it all get started?

00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:19.454
Well, we have to go back to the period just before the outbreak of the Second World War.

00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:28.044
Superman was created in 1938, and followed shortly after by Batman, both in comic book form.

00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:35.964
Both of these were a raging success, and a magazine publisher called Martin

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:41.174
Goodman had seen this and decided, hey, I think I’d like a slice of that action.

00:04:42.544 --> 00:04:49.994
He started a company called Timely Publications, and in August of 1939 the company published

00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:56.784
its first comic book, called Marvel Comics, which starred a character called “The Human Torch”.

00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:02.914
Like Superman and Batman before it, it was an almost-immediate

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:06.664
success, selling 80,000 copies in its first edition.

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:13.464
It was a strong enough sign to Goodman, and he decided to go all-in, hiring

00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:18.613
full-time illustrators and artists to come up with stories and write the comic books.

00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:24.733
The Human Torch, their first character, was popular but this

00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:29.403
would be dwarfed by their 1940 creation, Captain America.

00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:36.831
Up until then, the characters in Marvel comics had fought imaginary fictional

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:42.171
supervillains, but the villain that Captain America was to be first pitted against

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:48.511
was no fictional supervillain; he was none other than the Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler.

00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:55.941
Indeed, if you look at the first Captain America comic, the front has Captain America, clad

00:05:55.941 --> 00:06:02.251
in the stars and stripes of the United States of America, punching Hitler hard in the face.

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:08.221
Now, this choice of villain was a clever one for several reasons.

00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:14.847
Firstly, the creators of Captain America were staunch interventionists,

00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:19.701
they wanted America to get involved in the fight against Hitler, so this

00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:24.081
was their way of putting forward their political views to their audience.

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:29.391
And secondly, it did wonders for magazine sales, as this Captain

00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:33.271
America character tapped into existing patriotic feelings.

00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:39.208
Long story short, it was a runaway success, and Captain

00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:43.988
America is to this day a character used in many Marvel movies.

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:49.658
The circulation of Marvel comic books continued to grow in the

00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:55.018
1940s and 1950s, but initially, the characters in the comics were

00:06:55.238 --> 00:06:59.928
relatively one dimensional, or two dimensional if we’re being generous.

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:03.568
Plots were simple: hero beats villain.

00:07:05.098 --> 00:07:09.318
As an American audience grew to tire of this kind of formula,

00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:13.468
Martin Goodman realised that something needed to change.

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:19.688
He gave one of his writers, Stan Lee, a brief to create a new group of superheroes.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:23.508
Stan Lee was planning on quitting the comic book world

00:07:23.578 --> 00:07:27.558
anyway, so he figured, why not, I’ll give it a shot.

00:07:28.718 --> 00:07:34.908
And it would be this decision, and Stan Lee’s execution of it, that would be an

00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:40.028
instrumental step in setting the course for the success that Marvel is today.

00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:44.318
Stan Lee’s genius was two-fold.

00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:50.808
Firstly, he created characters that were superhuman, they had powers that humans do

00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:57.968
not have, but they were also very human in terms of their flaws and personal problems.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.348
They argued with each other, they were jealous of each

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:05.428
other, they were human in their feelings, they had depth.

00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:11.408
The Fantastic Four were the first of these, but they would be followed by Spider Man

00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:18.848
and Hulk, all deeply flawed characters with human as well as superhuman characteristics.

00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:25.278
Not only did this make for better and more engaging stories, it also meant

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:30.548
that the comic books could be enjoyed and bought by adults as well as children.

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:37.618
And secondly, Stan Lee created an entirely new method of writing

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.838
comic books, and I think this is particularly interesting.

00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:48.938
Previously, the scriptwriter would create the entire dialogue, saying what happened

00:08:48.938 --> 00:08:55.408
and who said it, then they would pass the script to the illustrator, who would draw it.

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:59.988
Stan Lee decided to do things differently.

00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:07.114
Instead, he would think of an outline, a rough idea for the story, then

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:12.204
he would give this to the artist and the artist would draw out the scene.

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:17.984
Lee would then take the finished drawings and add the narrative afterwards.

00:09:19.574 --> 00:09:24.404
This way it not only allowed the artists to be properly involved in the

00:09:24.404 --> 00:09:29.214
creative process, but it was also a lot quicker to create a comic book.

00:09:30.514 --> 00:09:37.114
This all ushered in a new era for Marvel, the so-called “Silver Age” that went on

00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:42.634
throughout the 1960s and saw the creation of many of Marvel’s most popular characters.

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:48.254
Now, we need to jump forward a bit to the 1990s, as it’s

00:09:48.264 --> 00:09:51.634
here that we find things not going so well for Marvel.

00:09:53.164 --> 00:09:59.294
Marvel had, until then, made money primarily from comic book sales and merchandise.

00:10:00.084 --> 00:10:03.864
Sure, people bought comic books to read, enjoy and

00:10:04.164 --> 00:10:07.044
throw away, or leave in a pile in a corner of the room.

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:14.154
But there was another category of comic book buyer, someone who bought not one,

00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:21.074
not two, but perhaps 10 or 20 editions of a comic book, and kept them in pristine

00:10:21.074 --> 00:10:26.254
condition with the expressed intention of selling them later for a profit.

00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:34.794
See, comic book companies like Marvel had done a very good job at encouraging Americans that comic

00:10:34.794 --> 00:10:40.504
books could be great investments, because early editions could be sold later on for a profit.

00:10:41.494 --> 00:10:45.974
Indeed, there had been some cases where early editions of now popular

00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:49.484
Marvel comics had been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:10:50.654 --> 00:10:58.944
But people soon enough got wise to the fact that if 100,000 people or 200,000 people all held the

00:10:58.944 --> 00:11:05.198
same supposedly “valuable first edition” of a comic book, well it really wasn’t that valuable.

00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:12.538
And in the mid 1990s, this comic book bubble had started to burst.

00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:18.778
Sales were dropping, and Marvel executives hypothesised that it was because their

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:23.968
sales had been artificially inflated by people buying 20 copies of a comic book

00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:30.258
as an investment; now that same person bought one copy, or perhaps none at all.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:35.858
Combined with this, Marvel had made some poor investment decisions

00:11:36.038 --> 00:11:41.428
and as a result it was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1996.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:48.518
It was, kind of like a Marvel story, the low point, where it seems like there is no hope.

00:11:49.288 --> 00:11:54.758
The money had all gone, financial speculators were ready to pounce, and

00:11:54.968 --> 00:11:59.458
there seemed like there was no escape; the company was going to die.

00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:06.228
But, like a Marvel story again, Marvel managed to rise from the ashes.

00:12:07.738 --> 00:12:13.448
The rise was, if we can continue the phoenix rising from the ashes analogy, slow.

00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:19.718
The rise started with the complicated but important issue of intellectual property.

00:12:20.638 --> 00:12:25.088
Marvel had created, as you’ve heard, some incredibly popular comic book

00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:30.998
characters: Spider Man, Captain America, X-Men, The Fantastic Four, and so on.

00:12:32.338 --> 00:12:37.018
Given the collapse in the comic book industry in the mid 1990s, Marvel

00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:42.908
knew that it had to diversify, and one clear option here was movies.

00:12:43.676 --> 00:12:48.298
But Marvel was a comic book company, not a movie company.

00:12:49.588 --> 00:12:55.328
The new boss of Marvel, an Israeli called Avi Arad, sold the rights to some

00:12:55.328 --> 00:12:59.408
of its popular characters to movie studios, who would then make the movies.

00:13:00.148 --> 00:13:03.098
And these movies were a big success.

00:13:03.568 --> 00:13:11.788
Blade, in 1998, X-Men in 2000, and the Spider-Man movies from 2002 to 2007.

00:13:12.838 --> 00:13:20.298
They were a big success at the box office, but Marvel reportedly saw very little money from them.

00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:25.818
According to one report, Blade made $70 million dollars

00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:31.141
at the box office, but Marvel only saw $25,000 of that.

00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:37.581
Marvel was, essentially, renting the use of its characters to movie studios,

00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:41.711
who would then make vast amounts of money by using them in their movies.

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:46.111
And things might have continued this way had it not

00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:50.241
been for a 41-year-old talent agent called David Maisel.

00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:57.288
In 2003, he pitched the boss of Marvel Studios, Avi Arad, on an idea.

00:13:58.693 --> 00:14:04.123
Like Balzac back in 1830, Maisel had this idea of a

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:07.793
huge interconnected universe of Marvel characters.

00:14:08.323 --> 00:14:12.193
Instead of Marvel creating the characters and then licensing

00:14:12.193 --> 00:14:15.863
them to a movie studio, Marvel would be the movie studio.

00:14:17.203 --> 00:14:21.753
Arad had been looking for a solution anyway, and he was sold.

00:14:22.673 --> 00:14:29.693
He made Maisel the boss of a new unit of Marvel, called Marvel Studios, and told him to get to work.

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:36.063
As you might imagine, actually making a Marvel movie takes quite some time;

00:14:36.593 --> 00:14:42.363
it took a couple of years for Maisel to raise the $525 million from a bank to

00:14:42.363 --> 00:14:46.773
invest in the movies, and then he actually needed to make the movie itself.

00:14:48.232 --> 00:14:54.611
First, they needed to choose which movie to make, or rather, which character to make a movie out of.

00:14:55.141 --> 00:15:00.981
There were a lot to choose from, and according to one report the way they chose was by doing a

00:15:00.991 --> 00:15:06.731
load of focus groups with children and asking them which Marvel character they wanted to play with.

00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:10.381
The answer came back: Ironman.

00:15:11.041 --> 00:15:18.540
The children had spoken and the first movie to be made was indeed Ironman which came out in 2008.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:25.291
It was, as you may remember, an immediate hit, making $100 million dollars in

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:31.081
its opening weekend and just shy of $600 million dollars at the box office.

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:34.441
Marvel knew that it was on to something.

00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:39.541
It had this deep roster of characters that it could draw from, it could make

00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:44.531
movies about any of them, and could make hundreds of millions of dollars each time.

00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:50.639
And so it was that just after a year after releasing Ironman,

00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:54.541
the company was bought by Disney for $4 billion dollars.

00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.591
It's quite the turnaround for a company that had

00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.761
declared itself bankrupt a matter of 13 years before.

00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:06.031
And Disney certainly seems pretty happy with its decision to buy Marvel.

00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:14.401
It paid $4 billion but by the end of 2022 it had already made a reported $22.5 billion.

00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:21.441
Sure, Disney has been accused of milking the Marvel franchise for everything it is

00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:28.821
worth, putting out the same old tired and formulaic plotlines year after year, but the

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:34.831
reality is that people can still be relied on to queue up at the cinema and buy tickets.

00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:39.851
And, whether you are a fan or not, you have to admit that Marvel

00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:43.641
is very efficient at making movies that lots of people like.

00:16:44.101 --> 00:16:49.611
It has a huge fanbase, which it is very good at engaging with, it makes a particular type

00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:55.591
of film that is reassuringly familiar to its fans, it knows what works and what doesn’t.

00:16:57.071 --> 00:17:01.611
But, how long can this continue, that is what critics are asking, and

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:06.051
what people within Marvel and Disney have admitted to asking themselves.

00:17:07.061 --> 00:17:12.851
In July of 2023, the boss of Disney, Bob Iger, admitted that he wants to make

00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:18.001
fewer Marvel movies, saying that there were too many, the audience was getting

00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:24.471
tired of them, and the strategy he wants to follow is to have fewer, better movies,

00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:30.047
rather than releasing three every year, which Marvel has been doing since 2017.

00:17:31.481 --> 00:17:35.821
Now, like them or loathe them, the Marvel movies have had a

00:17:35.831 --> 00:17:39.661
huge impact on the world of cinema over the past 15 years or so.

00:17:40.441 --> 00:17:44.931
It has dominated the box office, sold tens of billions of dollars worth

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:49.271
of tickets, and introduced a new generation of children to a bunch

00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:52.851
of superheroes that might never have left the pages of a comic book.

00:17:53.901 --> 00:17:58.891
It might not be Balzac, but Marvel has provided entertainment and amusement

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:03.741
to hundreds of millions of people, and, if Disney has got anything to do

00:18:03.741 --> 00:18:08.591
with it, will continue to provide entertainment for many years to come.

00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:15.671
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Marvel Universe.

If so, what is the thing you love most about the movies?

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:34.141
Or are you certainly not a fan like Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese?

00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:36.601
And if so, why not?

00:18:37.031 --> 00:18:40.251

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:15.876
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:20.226
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:28.036
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Cognitive Dissonance, the idea that

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:33.646
you can believe one thing, but do something that is in complete contradiction to your beliefs.

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:37.566
We’ll talk about what cognitive dissonance actually

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:41.406
is, and about how and when the idea was first proposed.

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:46.716
Then we’ll then move on to talk about some of the actions that people take when

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:51.166
they have cognitive dissonance, how they try to overcome these contradictions.

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:56.126
And we’ll end by talking about what you can actually do about this,

00:00:56.176 --> 00:01:01.186
and how psychologists suggest people can get over this inconsistency

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:05.286
between what they believe to be right, and what they actually do.

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:10.996
This is actually a request from a member from France, a great guy called Thierry.

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.096
So, Thierry, I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:17.086
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:22.456
I remember being told as a kid that our brains are infinitely

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.976
more powerful than the most powerful computer in the world.

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:29.686
There’s probably a little bit of debate about whether

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:33.346
that is still true, but the idea really stuck with me.

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:42.416
Our brains contain an average of 86 billion neurons, and our capacity for reasoned, independent

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:47.986
thought is why we, humans, have evolved to be the most powerful species on the planet.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.076
But our brains aren’t perfect.

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:57.606
The imperfection we are talking about today is cognitive dissonance, the idea that we can

00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:03.866
know something, and behave in a way that is in complete contradiction to our knowledge.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:07.666
You might think that this sounds strange.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:15.726
Rational thinking means processing information and using that to make a rational, sensible decision.

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:21.636
If you need to cross a road, you look to see whether a car is coming.

00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:27.166
If there is no car coming, you take on that information and choose to cross the road.

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:31.596
If you see a car coming, you stay where you are, because, well, it

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:35.366
would be irrational to walk into the road if you might be hit by a car.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:41.076
Normally our brains are pretty good at processing this sort of information.

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:46.616
Indeed, with the example of walking into the road, it’s almost subconscious.

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:50.466
You don’t have to actively think every time you cross a road,

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:54.496
you just look and the decision is taken almost in the background.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.116
But, it doesn’t always work this way.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:01.596
Our brains can hold a piece of information about something, but

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:05.276
we behave in a way that is in contradiction to this information.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.649
This is called cognitive dissonance.

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:15.139
A classic example might be someone who knows that smoking is bad for them, that

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.339
there is evidence that it causes all sorts of diseases, but they do it anyway.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.959
Or someone who knows that flying on aeroplanes is damaging to

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.549
the environment and yet jets off for weekends away twice a month.

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:34.739
Or someone who is on a diet, and they decide to treat themselves

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.879
to a large burger and chips just as a treat, just this once.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.219
In all of these cases, the person acts in a way that is

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.229
contradictory to knowledge that they believe to be true.

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.959
Of course, people knowing one thing but behaving in a contradictory way is nothing

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.819
new, but the label of cognitive dissonance, and the study of this particular behaviour

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:06.919
was first proposed in 1957 by the American social psychologist Leon Festinger.

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.239
Festinger observed this behaviour all around him, perhaps even in

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.769
himself, and argued that human beings try to be as consistent as

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.879
possible in their lives, but often find that there is inconsistency.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.999
This inconsistency, Festinger argued, often causes physical

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:34.059
discomfort, it often makes you feel physically ill when you do it.

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:39.519
Until relatively recently I needed to fly very often for work.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.499
I would fly from Malta to London twice a month, so

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.949
that’s an average of about 12 hours flying every month.

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.119
But I am also very aware of the environmental impact of flying.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.789
I know that flying spews carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and that

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.749
flying less is an efficient way of lowering your carbon footprint.

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.759
Yet I still did it.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:07.559
Every time I got on a flight I felt a little bit physically ill.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.829
I wasn’t afraid of flying, but it was this conflict between what

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:16.509
I believed and what I did that was causing me physical discomfort.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:22.039
If I didn’t know, or didn’t believe, that flying had a negative

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.969
impact on the environment, no doubt I wouldn't have felt this way.

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.639
50 years ago I’m sure people didn’t, and if you don’t believe in the

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.849
environmental impact of flying I’m sure you don't feel this way either.

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:42.669
Festinger, the psychologist who originally proposed the theory of cognitive dissonance

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.329
noticed that humans feel different levels of discomfort, depending on two factors.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.719
Firstly, how important you feel your belief to be.

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:59.239
With my flight example, someone who was an environmental activist would evidently

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:03.929
feel different about flying to someone who had watched a few documentaries

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:07.799
and knew in the back of their mind that flying was bad for the environment.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.679
And the second factor is the number of inconsistent thoughts you have.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.199
Let’s take the example of someone who is offered alcohol, but drinking alcohol

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.539
is against their religion and in addition to that, they know that alcohol

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:29.009
has negative health consequences, and they know that they need to drive a car

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.919
later on that evening and that driving while drinking alcohol is dangerous.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:38.259
That’s a lot of reasons to not drink alcohol, a lot more than someone who,

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.419
for example, was aware of the long term health consequences of drinking

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:46.179
alcohol but it wasn’t against their religion and they didn’t need to drive.

00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:51.764
Festinger noticed that the level of cognitive dissonance, based on the two

00:06:51.764 --> 00:06:57.044
factors I’ve mentioned, led to differing levels of physical discomfort.

00:06:58.034 --> 00:07:01.364
So, the person in our first example would feel a lot

00:07:01.364 --> 00:07:04.384
more discomfort than the person in our second example.

00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:08.694
This might sound obvious, but the point is that cognitive

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:13.214
dissonance isn’t black and white, it exists in varying degrees.

00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:18.084
Where it starts to get even more interesting is what Festinger

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:22.694
noticed people do to try to avoid these feelings of discomfort.

00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:27.504
Nobody likes feeling uncomfortable, and when you do feel

00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:31.034
uncomfortable you take actions to avoid these feelings.

00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:37.644
Festinger proposed that humans have four ways of dealing with this discomfort.

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:40.834
Firstly, you can change your behaviour.

00:07:41.484 --> 00:07:45.274
You can say, right, I know this is bad, and I’m going to stop doing it.

00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:49.934
With the classic example of smoking, you would stop smoking.

00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:57.004
Secondly, you can justify your behaviour to make it fit the knowledge that you have.

00:07:58.354 --> 00:08:03.174
With our example of someone who smokes, that person might say “yes,

00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:07.694
I know smoking is bad for me, but I’m a vegetarian and I exercise 3

00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:12.134
times a week - smoking is my only vice, I’m otherwise really healthy”.

00:08:13.814 --> 00:08:18.754
Thirdly, you can justify the behaviour by adding new behaviours, you

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:22.984
can do something that you tell yourself compensates for the behaviour.

00:08:24.194 --> 00:08:30.274
Going back to our smoker, you can say “I’m going to quit drinking, or I’ll start going to the gym”.

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:35.874
This doesn’t change the fact that you know that smoking is bad, but you

00:08:35.874 --> 00:08:40.794
justify it by doing other things that you tell yourself reduce its impact.

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:49.024
And finally, you can either ignore or deny any information that is contradictory to your actions.

00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:54.994
Our smoker might say “well, there isn’t conclusive evidence that smoking causes lung cancer,

00:08:55.184 --> 00:08:59.594
there are lots of other factors and I just don’t believe it’s as bad as people say it is”.

00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:04.244
This fourth action is worth spending some more time discussing,

00:09:04.534 --> 00:09:07.764
because it leads to something called confirmation bias.

00:09:09.204 --> 00:09:12.774
This is the idea that we tend to only believe information

00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:16.214
that confirms something that we already believe to be true.

00:09:17.514 --> 00:09:23.704
Instead of approaching life from the perspective of, here’s the evidence, now what does this mean

00:09:23.714 --> 00:09:30.544
is true, it’s often tempting to approach things from the other way around, thinking ‘this is what

00:09:30.594 --> 00:09:35.534
I believe to be true’, now I’m going to surround myself with evidence that supports my belief.

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:41.384
In the era of social media, where you can surround yourself with people

00:09:41.384 --> 00:09:45.394
who think in exactly the same way as you, believe similar things,

00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:49.964
and consume the same kind of content, this is easier than ever to do.

00:09:50.964 --> 00:09:55.494
And the worst thing is that we normally don’t even know that we’re doing it - it’s

00:09:55.494 --> 00:10:01.434
just done ‘for us’ because platforms such as Facebook and Instagram show us content

00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:06.444
that we are more likely to believe is true, so we engage with it and stay on

00:10:06.444 --> 00:10:11.354
these platforms for longer, further reinforcing the beliefs that we already had.

00:10:12.584 --> 00:10:17.524
So, those are the four ways that Festinger proposed people deal with

00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:21.964
their cognitive dissonance - they either change their behaviour, they

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:27.264
justify it, they add new behaviours, or they ignore it altogether.

00:10:28.474 --> 00:10:32.704
Cognitive dissonance, Festinger said, doesn't just occur for actions you

00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:38.024
take now, it also happens when you consider an action you took in the past.

00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:45.884
It can be uncomfortable to feel like a decision you took in the past was incorrect, and people often

00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:52.514
justify their past decisions despite the fact that they are inconsistent with their current beliefs.

00:10:53.794 --> 00:10:57.954
An obvious example here is voting, and political elections.

00:10:59.204 --> 00:11:03.944
It’s very common for people to defend the actions of a politician that they

00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:09.434
voted for even if those actions are inconsistent with their current beliefs.

00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:15.694
Being wrong is an uncomfortable feeling for most people, and one way

00:11:15.714 --> 00:11:20.584
of reducing this discomfort, and minimising the impact of your decision

00:11:20.924 --> 00:11:25.464
is by defending the actions that you feel you had an impact in causing.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:31.764
I should stress that Festinger’s theory of Cognitive Dissonance doesn’t suggest that people

00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:37.734
are any less or more intelligent if they have instances in their life of cognitive dissonance.

00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:45.164
Indeed, he proposed it as an inherently human flaw, something that we all are guilty of doing.

00:11:46.474 --> 00:11:51.744
The most common example used for cognitive dissonance is smoking, because over a billion

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:56.804
people do it, and the vast majority of those people know that smoking isn’t good for them.

00:11:57.734 --> 00:12:01.674
But smokers aren’t of any higher or lower intelligence than

00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:05.624
anyone else, and if you smoke this is by no means a criticism.

00:12:06.284 --> 00:12:09.934
It is just that it is the world’s most evident example of

00:12:09.964 --> 00:12:13.374
cognitive dissonance, and one that is easy to recognise.

00:12:14.384 --> 00:12:16.824
So, what can we do about this?

00:12:16.844 --> 00:12:19.954
Is cognitive dissonance by default bad?

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:25.054
Well, it might be uncomfortable, especially if the inconsistency

00:12:25.234 --> 00:12:28.764
is either very strong or there are several inconsistencies.

00:12:29.884 --> 00:12:33.724
And while the simple answer might be to just to stop engaging

00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:38.064
in the behaviour, for most people this isn’t always realistic.

00:12:38.814 --> 00:12:40.644
We are only human, after all.

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:47.744
Most psychologists suggest that key to overcoming this dissonance, and making

00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:53.784
better, more rational decisions is to become more aware of these inconsistencies,

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:59.284
to not try to fight them, and certainly not to seek confirmation bias.

00:13:00.324 --> 00:13:07.744
Instead, understand that your decision making process is often imperfect, that we all have

00:13:07.914 --> 00:13:15.424
these perfectly human flaws, these inbuilt biases, and that we should evaluate every decision

00:13:15.704 --> 00:13:21.774
based on the evidence in front of us, rather than what we want to believe, and it is by

00:13:21.824 --> 00:13:26.614
doing this that you will have the best chance of making more rational, better decisions.

00:13:27.387 --> 00:13:30.495
And that is certainly something that we can all aspire to.

00:13:33.007 --> 00:13:36.747
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cognitive Dissonance,

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:40.797
the inconsistency between what we believe and what we do.

00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:45.007
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:13:45.857 --> 00:13:49.257
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:52.677
I’m not asking for examples of inconsistencies from your

00:13:52.677 --> 00:13:56.077
life, but I would love to know what you think about this idea.

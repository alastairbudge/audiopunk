Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.079
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.040
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.660
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about German supermarkets.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.080
From Stockholm to Seville, San Francisco to Shanghai, shoppers are flocking to two unlikely

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.909
places: ALDI and Lidl, German supermarkets which can trace their roots back to post-war Germany.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.710
So in this episode we are going to look at this phenomenon, ask ourselves where

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.290
these supermarkets come from, why they are so popular, how they manage to keep

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.000
their products so cheap, and why they are winning the supermarket wars in Britain.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.610
Ok then, let’s get right into it and talk about German supermarkets.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.690
Supermarkets are more than just a place to buy food; you

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.390
can tell a lot about a country by visiting a supermarket.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.970
How they are arranged, the kinds of products they stock, where they tend to be in a town or

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.899
city, these all offer a glimpse into the culture and values that are prevalent in a country.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.279
In British supermarkets, for example, you find a lot of ready-prepared food, you can find

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.060
a wide variety of ingredients from different cultures, and a strong emphasis on price.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.039
What does this tell us?

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.720
Well, perhaps it indicates that British people don’t put such a high value on cooking from scratch,

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.189
that Britain is a country with a wide variety of cultures and ethnicities, and that British

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.090
people are price sensitive shoppers, they don’t want to spend more than they absolutely must do.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.219
In French supermarkets, on the other hand, there’s often a strong focus on freshness

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.620
and local ingredients, as well as sections full of gourmet meats and cheeses.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.720
And of course, often an extensive selection of wine.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.199
If you knew nothing about French culture or French people, and you found yourself

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.109
in a Carrefour or Casino in Paris or Bordeaux, you could probably sense that this

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.700
is a country where people put a lot of value on the quality of their food, they

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.049
really enjoy eating and drinking, it is more than a mere source of nutrition.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.859
I recently moved to Sweden, and in Swedish supermarkets you find very little

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.880
of the gourmet meats and cheeses you might find in France, but there is a very

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.690
strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and eco-friendliness, indicating

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.730
that this is a country that places a strong importance on the environment.

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:06.210
There is also an absolutely massive selection of yoghurt, which I have no real explanation

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.019
for other than Swedish people clearly are very picky when it comes to their yoghurt.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.579
Anyway, the point is that supermarkets reflect the tastes and preferences of the local

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.220
population, and can be a fun and interesting way into getting an insight into the local culture.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.440
And supermarkets tend to be national chains, they are unlike a clothing

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.369
brand like Nike or even a fast food brand like McDonald’s, where the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.269
same or very similar products can be sold in Beijing as in Mexico City.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.560
For supermarkets, breaking into a new country is difficult because the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.170
supermarket needs to adjust to local preferences, habits, and values.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.280
You couldn’t just take a successful British supermarket,

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.070
let’s say, and recreate it in Paris or Madrid or Rome.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.609
It wouldn’t work, and British supermarkets have tried.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.630
The most popular supermarket chain in the UK, Tesco,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.050
opened supermarkets in both the United States and China.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:22.430
It even adapted its offering significantly in an attempt to woo American and Chinese shoppers.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.241
It didn’t work, and it was forced to retreat after burning through a whopping $3 billion.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.540
Some supermarkets have had more success in their international expansion,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.560
such as the French chain Carrefour, or the Swiss chain Coop, but

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.500
both have succeeded by offering a similar service to local players.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.690
Similar products in a similar style.

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:57.910
The subject of today’s episode, however, has succeeded in a completely different way, by

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.390
bringing a uniquely German model to a non-German market, and reaping huge benefits through it.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.469
Now, especially if you are listening to this in Europe, you will no

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.804
doubt be aware of the supermarkets we’re talking about: ALDI and Lidl.

00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:21.659
They both have around 12,000 stores each, and their home market of Germany

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.887
now only makes up a relatively small proportion of the total, around ⅓.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.110
ALDI and Lidl stores can be found in practically every European

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.890
country, as well as the United States, Australia and China.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.980
If you live in one of those countries, you may well live near an ALDI or Lidl.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.570
It might even be your supermarket of choice.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.440
Perhaps you are even listening to this episode while

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.530
wandering around an ALDI or a Lidl doing your shopping.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.580
As anyone who shops at these supermarkets will know, there are a few major

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.819
differences between ALDI and Lidl and most traditional supermarket chains.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.510
The first is the size.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.969
ALDI and Lidl tend to be smaller, with ALDIs in particular

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.909
being much smaller, typically around 1,000 metres squared.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.200
The selection of products on offer tends to be a lot smaller than traditional supermarkets, with

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:30.890
ALDI offering around 1,500 different items compared to around 31,000 in traditional supermarkets.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.300
So instead of there being 5 or 10 different options for tomato ketchup, let’s

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.790
say, with different brands and sizes of bottle, there might be just one or two.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.380
And these products probably have names that sound a bit familiar to you,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.619
they sound like brands that you have heard of, and the packaging is probably

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:59.399
pretty similar, but you look more closely and the name is slightly different.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.620
Walking around the supermarket you will probably notice that produce is stored in

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.710
the box in which it came, so there are no beautiful displays of apples or bananas,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.809
they are all still in the cardboard boxes in which they were packed, so you need

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:21.479
to fish into the box to take out your fruit or vegetables or whatever it is.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.809
Another difference is that you would probably struggle to find many employees

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.389
working in the store, and some stores can be run with as few as five employees.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.000
And all of these employees seem to be trained to do everything, so if you

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.110
ask to see the manager, you might find him or her mopping up some spilled

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.000
milk or stacking the shelves or even scanning products at the checkout till.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.869
Oh, and on that note, products tend to have much bigger

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:56.770
barcodes, so they are easier and quicker to scan.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.740
If you have never been to an ALDI or Lidl, or you live in a country where these supermarkets

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.010
don’t have a presence, you might well be thinking “Alastair, they don’t sound very good!”.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.160
But what would probably be a very pleasant surprise would be after the person

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.820
at the checkout has scanned all of your shopping basket and told you the price.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.590
Typically ALDI and Lidl are 15-20% cheaper than traditional

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.380
supermarkets, so there are considerable savings to be had.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.480
Now, you probably wouldn’t be surprised only when you see the final bill; as

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.099
you might expect, ALDI and Lidl make the low prices of their items very visible

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.850
throughout the supermarket, forever reminding you of the value you are getting.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.840
In particular, they offer incredibly low prices on so-called “reference

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:57.870
goods” or “benchmark items”, in the UK that’s things like a pint of milk

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.400
or a loaf of bread, products that people would typically know the price of.

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:09.410
These goods are often sold at cost price, or even at a loss, because

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.310
their low price can easily be compared to other supermarkets, so you think

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.039
“oh, a pint of milk at ALDI is 90p, I paid £1.20 the other day at Tesco”.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:25.470
And when this happens, it reinforces the idea in a consumer’s mind that

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.180
everything in the supermarket is similarly cheap, which it normally is..

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.389
In terms of how they manage to make the products so much cheaper, well there

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:41.380
are some things that you can see and some things that are less visible.

00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:47.720
Even with knowing little about how to run a supermarket, anyone who goes into

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.258
one of their stores can see just by walking around how costs are being cut.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:59.620
Everything we talked about just a few minutes ago, from the fact that goods are left in boxes

00:09:59.629 --> 00:10:04.320
for the shopper to unpack themselves to the fact that there are very few staff members working

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:10.920
there, this is purposefully designed so that the cost savings are very visible to the customer.

00:10:12.397 --> 00:10:16.587
The point is that everything in an ALDI or Lidl reminds

00:10:16.597 --> 00:10:20.197
you, the customer, that the price is going to be low.

00:10:21.177 --> 00:10:26.567
And you don’t mind that there is a more limited choice of products or that it’s hard to find

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:30.907
someone to tell you where the eggs are or that you have to remove a box to get to the tomatoes.

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:36.017
You don’t mind doing it because you understand that you will pay less.

00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:43.057
It’s a very similar sort of idea as why the low-cost airline Ryanair plants

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:47.937
stories in the press about how it might even charge people to use the toilet, or

00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:53.507
its social media teams jump on and embrace complaints about a lack of a good view.

00:10:54.247 --> 00:10:58.477
What they want people to remember is that the company has cut all

00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:03.777
possible costs, and is passing the savings on to you, as a consumer.

00:11:05.087 --> 00:11:10.047
And there are, of course, many cost saving mechanisms that are less visible.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:16.447
Because the supermarket chains are now so big and can order such large volumes,

00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:21.637
they can negotiate better prices with suppliers, which they pass on to consumers.

00:11:22.517 --> 00:11:25.627
The limited amount of products that they stock reduces

00:11:25.627 --> 00:11:28.617
complexity, thereby reducing operational costs.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:35.547
The fact that they have their own brand labels means they can reduce costs, and in some markets

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:41.917
they only accepted payment in cash, not card, so they didn’t have to pay payment processing fees.

00:11:43.207 --> 00:11:47.187
And the end result of all of this cost cutting is that they can

00:11:47.187 --> 00:11:51.767
afford to offer the lowest prices and still make a healthy profit.

00:11:53.283 --> 00:11:58.287
In the case of both ALDI and Lidl, going right back to their humble beginnings,

00:11:58.847 --> 00:12:04.917
this has always been their strategy: deliver good quality products at a low price.

00:12:06.337 --> 00:12:13.527
ALDI is a little older than Lidl, tracing its roots back to 1946 to Lidl’s 1973.

00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:21.117
The story of ALDI is also more interesting, as it was founded by two brothers who then split

00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:27.207
the company into two after a row over whether the supermarket would sell cigarettes or not.

00:12:28.327 --> 00:12:31.547
One brother thought it was a good idea, the other was

00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:34.717
concerned about theft if they started to stock cigarettes.

00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:39.927
And instead of coming to some agreement, the pair decided

00:12:40.047 --> 00:12:43.907
to take the nuclear option; they split the company into two.

00:12:45.128 --> 00:12:51.307
And they did so along geographical lines, so there was ALDI Nord in the

00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:55.637
northern half of Germany and ALDI Süd in the southern half of Germany.

00:12:56.537 --> 00:13:01.327
Same name, slightly different logo, similar but ever so slightly

00:13:01.327 --> 00:13:05.577
different product range, and two completely separate businesses.

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:13.267
It is a most unusual arrangement, but it seems to work, and the two rival companies have

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:18.227
divided the world into different regions so they are not forced to compete with each other.

00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:24.667
And as to their global aspirations, in the late 1980s and early

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:30.537
1990s both ALDI and Lidl started to expand beyond the German borders.

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:36.687
The first ALDI store in the UK opened in Birmingham on the 5th of April,

00:13:36.687 --> 00:13:42.477
1990, and there are now more than 1,000 stores across the country, making

00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:47.267
the UK one of the most important markets outside its home market of Germany.

00:13:48.617 --> 00:13:54.077
Lidl arrived in the UK just a few years later, in 1996, and

00:13:54.287 --> 00:13:58.877
now has a similar amount of stores, 960 at the last count.

00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:05.457
And both of these supermarkets have now taken a sizable bite out of the business of

00:14:05.457 --> 00:14:11.087
the established British supermarkets, companies like Tesco, Sainsbury’s and ASDA.

00:14:12.407 --> 00:14:17.137
Today, ALDI and Lidl are the fifth and sixth most popular supermarkets

00:14:17.137 --> 00:14:21.704
in the country, accounting for 10% and 8% of the market respectively.

00:14:22.584 --> 00:14:26.414
It is a similar story in most of the other European markets in which they

00:14:26.414 --> 00:14:31.510
have a presence, although not to quite as extreme an extent as in the UK.

00:14:32.765 --> 00:14:34.514
It wasn’t all plain sailing though.

00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:39.574
It took a long time for ALDI and Lidl to really break through in the UK

00:14:39.574 --> 00:14:44.174
market, and they spent a vast amount of money trying to get it right.

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:49.554
Initially they tried what had worked in Germany: competing

00:14:49.564 --> 00:14:53.894
on price alone, on a very limited selection of basic goods.

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:59.964
While this strategy had worked with the notoriously price-sensitive German supermarket

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:05.894
shopper, and worked with a particularly budget-conscious type of British consumer, to

00:15:05.894 --> 00:15:11.374
take a real chunk out of the British market, the German stores needed to attract the

00:15:11.384 --> 00:15:16.664
middle-class shopper who didn’t necessarily want to be seen in a bargain supermarket.

00:15:17.914 --> 00:15:21.624
And it was here that ALDI and Lidl did something

00:15:21.664 --> 00:15:25.114
clever to try to attract these more affluent consumers.

00:15:26.244 --> 00:15:29.344
They branched out into more premium items.

00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:36.144
From caviar to champagne to serrano ham, they started to stock a selection

00:15:36.354 --> 00:15:40.904
of so-called “premium” products at incredibly competitive prices.

00:15:42.354 --> 00:15:45.374
Soon enough, word started to spread.

00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:51.424
Whether it was a journalist or a forty-something business owner driving an Audi,

00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:56.844
people seemed to be pleasantly surprised by the quality of these premium products.

00:15:57.304 --> 00:16:01.144
It was something that they weren’t expecting, given the low price tag.

00:16:02.024 --> 00:16:08.214
Wines and champagne from ALDI have won awards, and their premium products tend

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:14.114
to be rated as highly or higher than similar items from traditional supermarkets,

00:16:14.554 --> 00:16:20.064
or even from more premium supermarkets such as Waitrose or Marks & Spencer.

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:27.904
Getting a bargain on a premium product at ALDI became a source of pride, a talking point

00:16:27.914 --> 00:16:33.894
for parents at the school gates, and looking at the BMWs and Mercedes parked in the

00:16:33.894 --> 00:16:39.994
car parks of Lidls and ALDIs, it is clear that they are doing a good job at attracting

00:16:39.994 --> 00:16:45.184
more affluent shoppers, people in search of premium products at a reasonable price.

00:16:45.984 --> 00:16:51.364
So, the German discount supermarkets had finally managed to achieve the impossible, to

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:56.544
get affluent British shoppers to poke their noses inside and see what it was all about.

00:16:58.144 --> 00:17:03.524
And when these shoppers came through the doors, perhaps after reading in a newspaper about an

00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:09.094
award-winning French wine from ALDI or hearing from a friend that Lidl was selling Canadian

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:16.404
lobsters for £4.99 a pop, they would be confronted with the magic of the supermarkets firsthand.

00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:21.964
Good quality products, overall, and very competitive prices.

00:17:22.614 --> 00:17:27.694
And lest I forget, there is another canny strategy that both stores

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:32.024
operate to bring bargain hunters to the store, week after week.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:38.984
As you may know, they both have an aisle in the middle where they sell non-food items.

00:17:39.824 --> 00:17:43.344
To quote the Lidl website, “Cruise down our Middle of

00:17:43.344 --> 00:17:46.934
Lidl aisle for household kit you never knew you needed.”

00:17:48.387 --> 00:17:54.177
In this part of the supermarket, which ALDI calls Special Buys and Lidl calls

00:17:54.357 --> 00:17:59.337
the Middle of Lidl, the supermarkets sell a time-limited selection of general

00:17:59.337 --> 00:18:04.937
household stuff at very low prices, with new products being offered every week.

00:18:05.977 --> 00:18:10.667
So the idea is that it brings people back to the store in search of

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:15.387
an amazing bargain on everything from frying pans to Christmas trees.

00:18:16.557 --> 00:18:22.677
When I was researching this episode, the main item on sale was a dog shade tent

00:18:22.957 --> 00:18:29.747
for the bargain price of £14.99, so I would imagine that, even for dog owners,

00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:34.617
that fits into the category of “household kit you never knew you needed”.

00:18:36.387 --> 00:18:42.997
This has, in the UK at least, become a cultural phenomenon of sorts, with online communities

00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:48.507
and social media groups dedicated to sharing and discussing the latest finds, and

00:18:48.517 --> 00:18:53.857
bringing people back into the shop, week after week, in the hope of snagging a bargain.

00:18:55.097 --> 00:18:59.387
All of this has combined to create a fearsome force.

00:19:00.017 --> 00:19:08.297
The discount retailers in the UK have an almost 20% market share, up from 0% thirty years ago.

00:19:09.297 --> 00:19:13.697
It is a similar story in the other markets in which ALDI and Lidl operate,

00:19:13.977 --> 00:19:18.927
although few have managed to catch up quite as fast as they have done in the UK.

00:19:20.067 --> 00:19:25.177
So, the story of these two German supermarkets is a fascinating one of

00:19:25.187 --> 00:19:30.267
national preferences, adapting to local tastes, and savvy business operations.

00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:34.877
And it reminds us about one fundamental human characteristic.

00:19:35.747 --> 00:19:40.667
For all of the differences and regional preferences, for all of the French’s commitment

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:46.317
to quality and the Swedes’ dedication to environmental sustainability, from Paris to Pisa,

00:19:46.707 --> 00:19:53.727
Palmplona to Philadelphia, there is one thing that unites us all: nobody can resist a bargain.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:20:00.097
OK then, that is it for today's episode on German supermarkets.

00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:04.737
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that even if you are a die-hard ALDI or

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:09.187
Lidl shopper, it has been fun to learn a little bit more about these supermarkets

00:20:09.437 --> 00:20:14.167
that are slowly but surely taking a chunk out of the global supermarket industry

00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:18.027
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:18.447 --> 00:20:20.307
Are you an ALDI or Lidl fan?

00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:23.267

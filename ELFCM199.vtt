Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.060
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.420
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.280
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.340
three-part mini series, this time on Art Theft.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.790
In today’s episode we are going to talk about some of the greatest art thefts of all

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.140
time, from what actually happened, who the thieves were, if indeed they were ever

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.920
caught, the reactions to the theft, and we will talk about some of the reasons why people

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.870
steal art, because it certainly isn’t always as simple as “they want to make money”.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.230
Then, in part two we are going to talk about the greatest, or at least most

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.850
prolific, art thief of all time, a Frenchman called Stephane Breitweiser.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.870
Between 1995 and 2001 he stole at least 236 different pieces of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.850
art from museums, estimated to be worth around a billion Euros.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.710
The strangest thing about it?

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.110
He didn’t seem interested in money in the slightest, and kept all of the art for himself.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.740
And then finally, in part three we will talk about what was until recently the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.510
biggest art theft of all time, of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.430
Shortly after midnight on St Patricks Day of 1990, two men dressed as policemen, complete with fake

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.340
moustaches, turned up at the museum saying they had come to investigate reports of a disturbance.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.130
They tied up the guards, and 81 minutes later they left the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.550
building with artwork valued at around $500 million dollars.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.690
The crime has still never properly been solved.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.710
So, I hope you’ll enjoy this mini-series.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.900
Let’s jump right into it.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.220
The first art theft in history is thought to have taken place in the year 1473.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.140
If you were a witness to it, it would have looked more like an act of piracy, because

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.170
it happened in the North Sea, and involved a sea captain from Danzig, in modern-day

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.720
Poland, boarding a ship en route to Italy, and taking the ship’s belongings.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.060
This included a triptych, a three-part painting of The Last Judgment

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.030
by Hans Memling, the first ever piece of art recorded as “stolen”.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.830
If you have listened to the last episode, on pirates, you will be familiar with the idea of a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.840
privateer, someone who was given special permission by the authorities to engage in acts of piracy.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.890
The art thief, or pirate, was a man called Paul Beneke,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.610
and he was acting on behalf of the Hanseatic League.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.180
He was a privateer.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.640
The ship was an English ship, the Hanseatic League was at war with England

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.810
at the time, and therefore this was considered to be a legitimate theft.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.820
The people who had commissioned the painting, who just so happened to be linked

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.060
to the Medici Bank, protested the theft, but to this day the painting has never

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.055
been returned to Italy, and currently hangs in the National Museum in Gdansk.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.190
This might be the first recorded art theft, but it’s unusual for

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.270
an art theft, because it was primarily an act of piracy, they took

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.400
other items as well, this piece of art was only just one of them.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.510
When it comes to “modern” art theft, or at least art theft in the past hundred

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.270
years, the reasons for the theft do not typically involve international piracy.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.340
They broadly fall into five different categories.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.740
Firstly, financial gain.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.380
People think they can steal works of art, sell them, and make money from them.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.760
Of course, you might be thinking, but there are some

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.750
serious complexities when it comes to stealing art to sell.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.510
You can’t steal a piece of art that is too well known,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.980
because it becomes too “hot”, and is very hard to get rid of.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.710
The police, galleries and insurance companies will offer large rewards for

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.930
information that can lead to the return of stolen art, so you have to be very

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.770
careful with who you tell that you have a piece of art available for sale.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.110
Secondly, the second category is, people who steal art as

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.070
a sort of insurance policy, a Get Out of Jail Free card.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.590
Often art thefts are organised by organised crime gangs for specifically this reason.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.950
If a criminal has a valuable piece of stolen art in their possession, and they are

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.820
caught by the police for a completely unrelated crime, drugs trafficking or murder,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.800
let’s say, they can offer to return the piece of art in return for immunity, in

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.030
return for their freedom, or at least in return for a reduced prison sentence.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.570
In many cases the police will offer immunity, or reduced sentences, for information that can

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:01.010
lead to the return of famous works of art, and organised criminals know this all too well.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.980
So, if you are familiar with the game of Monopoly, a stolen

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.210
work or art functions as a sort of Get Out of Jail Free card.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.670
Number three, our third reason, also includes organised crime gangs, and is

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.070
that stolen art is used as a substitute for money in drugs or weapons deals.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.630
A piece of stolen art, especially very famous stolen art, such as a Van Gogh,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.080
has a well-known value, millions, even tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:41.129
It can then be used as part of a drug deal traded between parties, instead of money.

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:46.879
Or, it is used as a collateral for a loan to buy drugs or weapons.

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:52.759
If you need, let’s say, $10 million dollars to pay for a drug shipment, you might

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:57.689
find someone who will lend you the money until you can pay them back, but they

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:02.389
will keep your stolen Van Gogh or Caravaggio until you pay them back in full.

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:09.549
Indeed, it is often during raids of drug gangs that high-profile stolen art is

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:15.079
discovered, indicating that this motive might be more common than most people think.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:22.469
Our fourth category is what we might call a sense of patriotism, or duty.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:28.189
These thefts are a little less common, but there are instances, as we will hear

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:34.089
about shortly, where someone believes a piece of art to have been stolen, or at

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:39.289
least not in its rightful place, and therefore steals it and returns it to its owner.

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:45.649
Of course, this is still theft, and even though the motive might be a little less

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:50.269
terrible than the previous ones, it still most certainly still counts as theft.

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:56.009
There is also the related category of stealing artwork from another country for

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:02.259
supposed cultural reasons, for example the Elgin Marbles that were taken from Greece

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:08.009
and now sit in the British Museum, but luckily this is not so much an issue anymore.

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:13.679
And our final, fifth category is what we might call “personal theft”,

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:19.309
theft because someone wants to enjoy a piece of art all to themselves.

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:25.209
This might take the form of an art thief being commissioned to steal a particular

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:30.109
piece of art for someone else, or in the case of Stephane Breitweiser, as

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:34.959
we’ll hear about in part two, of the collector doing the stealing himself.

00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:41.505
This has the advantage of fewer people typically being involved, because you aren’t

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:46.615
trying to negotiate with other people, but the end result is the same - a piece of

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:52.385
art has been taken from its rightful owner, and is essentially removed from society.

00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:59.915
So, there we have the main reasons why art is stolen, and who benefits from it.

00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:04.875
With this in mind, let’s look at some of the greatest,

00:09:04.915 --> 00:09:09.335
most famous, and most interesting art thefts of all time.

00:09:10.155 --> 00:09:16.825
On a quick linguistic note, a word often used for art theft is a “heist”.

00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:22.185
It’s a strange word, because it only really applies to robberies

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:27.475
of very valuable things, such as art, jewels, or money from a bank.

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:34.265
It’s usually used for violent robberies, but a heist doesn’t always have to involve violence.

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:44.204
Ok then, our first heist, and this is definitely a heist, was in Paris’s Musée Marmottan, in 1985.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:54.086
On October 27th of 1985, shortly after the museum had opened, two men, acting perfectly

00:09:54.086 --> 00:10:00.226
normally, walked up to the museum’s front desk, bought tickets, and went inside.

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:06.666
The museum was by no means full, but there were plenty of other visitors inside.

00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:13.436
Because it was open to the public, the alarm system had been disconnected - it

00:10:13.436 --> 00:10:17.536
was only turned on during the evening, when the museum was empty.

00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:20.886
There were guards and plenty of visitors during the day,

00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:24.136
so there was no need to keep the alarm system turned on.

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:32.566
All of a sudden the men pulled out guns, and forced the guards and 40 visitors to the floor.

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:39.686
At least three other men burst in, and in the next five minutes the men proceeded to

00:10:39.716 --> 00:10:46.416
meticulously, very carefully, remove 9 of the 100 masterpieces on the museum’s walls.

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:51.116
According to eye witnesses, they knew exactly what they were

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:55.546
doing, and only removed the most valuable paintings in the museum.

00:10:56.826 --> 00:10:57.736
What did they steal?

00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:02.586
5 Monets, including one called Impression, Sunrise, the

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:06.016
painting that gave its name to the Impressionist movement.

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:14.316
The art world waited anxiously for clues as to their whereabouts, but it wasn’t until five years

00:11:14.346 --> 00:11:21.216
later, in 1990, in a villa on the Mediterranean island of Corsica that the paintings were found.

00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:27.046
It seems that the thieves had been unable to successfully sell the paintings,

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:32.156
they were simply too hot, too famous, for any art dealer to take them.

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:39.896
Our second heist is really two for the price of one, it’s about a work of art that has been

00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:46.436
stolen twice, or at least two versions of it have been stolen on two different occasions.

00:11:47.236 --> 00:11:52.386
You probably know the painting, you've probably seen Edvard Munch's The Scream.

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:58.726
Munch actually did four versions of the work, two in paint and two in pastel.

00:11:59.346 --> 00:12:02.276
Both of the paint versions have been stolen.

00:12:03.016 --> 00:12:08.366
The first version was stolen in 1994 from the National Art Museum in

00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:14.426
Oslo, just before Norway was set to host the 1994 Winter Olympics.

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:18.146
The painting had been moved to the ground floor.

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:23.916
Munch was Norway’s most famous artist, and The Scream his most famous work.

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:29.306
In a time when tourists would be flocking to Oslo, it was only right

00:12:29.536 --> 00:12:33.556
that this masterpiece should be seen by as many people as possible.

00:12:34.446 --> 00:12:37.316
The gallery’s security team protested.

00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:43.786
The ground floor is always the least secure place in a gallery, as it’s accessible from

00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:50.976
the street, it’s busy, and it’s easy to make a swift getaway, to rush out to a car quickly.

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:54.736
The security experts proved to have been right.

00:12:54.736 --> 00:13:02.426
At 6:30 in the morning of 12th February, 1994, two men placed a ladder against

00:13:02.436 --> 00:13:08.346
the wall, climbed up to the window, smashed it, climbed into the room and 50

00:13:08.356 --> 00:13:13.296
seconds later they were climbing down the ladder with The Scream under their arms.

00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:19.246
They even had the time, and perhaps the audacity, to leave a postcard

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:23.476
in the gallery with the message, “Thanks for the poor security.”

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:28.786
Because it was such a famous painting–and would therefore be impossible

00:13:28.796 --> 00:13:33.446
to sell on the black market–and at such an important time for Norway,

00:13:33.726 --> 00:13:38.006
it was assumed that someone was trying to make a political point.

00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:44.586
Anti-abortion activists claimed it was them, and that they would return the

00:13:44.586 --> 00:13:51.046
painting in exchange for being able to show an anti-abortion advert on Norwegian TV.

00:13:51.986 --> 00:13:55.956
This turned out to be a complete lie, they weren’t involved at all.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.716
The real thieves were eventually found after a police trap.

00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:07.556
They had tried to demand a million dollars in ransom from the gallery, but it was refused.

00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:15.976
Undercover detectives pretended to be art dealers interested in buying the work for $250,000.

00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:21.466
The thieves took the bait, and they were arrested one month after the theft.

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:26.096
The second Scream theft, of a different Scream, by

00:14:26.096 --> 00:14:30.406
the way, was a lot more brazen, a lot more violent.

00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:35.496
It happened 10 years later, this time from the Munch Museum in Oslo.

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:41.716
Men rushed into the museum’s floor with machine guns, threatening to shoot the staff.

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:47.096
Minutes later they had escaped with two Munch paintings: The Scream and Madonna.

00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:51.126
Luckily the paintings were recovered a couple of years later,

00:14:51.346 --> 00:14:55.436
but there still isn’t clarity on exactly why they were stolen.

00:14:56.626 --> 00:15:01.636
Again, they would have been far too famous to sell on the black market, and the current

00:15:01.646 --> 00:15:07.466
theories about the reason they were taken are to be used as a ransom, so they could

00:15:07.576 --> 00:15:15.456
extort money, perhaps as collateral for drugs or weapons deals, or even to distract the

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:21.106
Norwegian police from the investigation of the murder of a Norwegian police officer.

00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:26.118
It seems that The Scream just isn’t a very lucky piece of art.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.208
Our third art heist was in Mexico, and just goes to show that you don’t

00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:37.928
need to be a professional art thief to end up in a list of great art thefts.

00:15:38.928 --> 00:15:43.168
The location for this theft was Mexico’s National

00:15:43.168 --> 00:15:46.618
Museum of Anthropology and History, in Mexico City.

00:15:47.828 --> 00:15:54.248
On Christmas Eve of 1985, while the museum guards were drunk, 124

00:15:54.248 --> 00:15:59.978
Mayan, Aztec, Miztec, and Zapotec artefacts were stolen from the museum.

00:16:00.638 --> 00:16:04.848
The alarm system was faulty, and so the guards didn’t

00:16:04.848 --> 00:16:08.308
realise these artefacts were gone until too late.

00:16:08.878 --> 00:16:14.268
These artefacts were priceless, irreplaceable pieces of Mexican history.

00:16:15.605 --> 00:16:20.318
El Universal newspaper had a headline reading, ″Whoever ordered

00:16:20.318 --> 00:16:24.908
the robbery of the Anthropology Museum robbed from us all″.

00:16:25.238 --> 00:16:27.518
It was a theft from the nation.

00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:30.018
Fingers were soon pointed.

00:16:30.318 --> 00:16:33.538
Were the CIA or the FBI involved?

00:16:33.728 --> 00:16:38.238
Who could possibly have ordered such a theft not just from the museum,

00:16:38.238 --> 00:16:42.618
but from the country of Mexico, a theft from the Mexican people?

00:16:43.278 --> 00:16:47.138
Bags were searched at the airport, foreign museum curators were

00:16:47.138 --> 00:16:51.278
told to keep a lookout for these goods, and the hunt was on.

00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:57.268
Three and a half years later, the culprits, the guilty people were discovered.

00:16:58.088 --> 00:17:04.138
It wasn’t a foreign government, a sophisticated criminal gang or a professional art thief.

00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:08.878
The thieves were two young men, two university dropouts.

00:17:09.448 --> 00:17:16.268
They had reportedly visited the museum 50 times, made detailed plans of the building,

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:22.888
and then climbed over the fence, crawled through an air conditioning duct, the tunnel

00:17:22.998 --> 00:17:29.178
that pumps air through a very large building, and escaped with these invaluable goods.

00:17:29.978 --> 00:17:33.213
They had tried to sell the items for as much as $1

00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:37.088
billion dollars to drug cartels, but never managed.

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:40.768
They were caught three and a half years later, and

00:17:40.778 --> 00:17:43.918
fortunately most of the artefacts have been returned.

00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:48.808
Now, our fourth and penultimate theft is interesting

00:17:48.918 --> 00:17:52.848
not just for the theft, but for what happened after it.

00:17:53.688 --> 00:17:57.258
It involves paintings by the English artist J.

00:17:57.268 --> 00:17:57.438
M.

00:17:57.438 --> 00:17:57.818
W.

00:17:57.818 --> 00:18:05.108
Turner, a Romantic painter best known for his landscapes and expressive pictures of the sea.

00:18:06.278 --> 00:18:10.288
These paintings were normally kept at London’s Tate Gallery.

00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:19.158
In 1994, two Turner paintings were on loan at the Schirn Kunsthalle gallery in Frankfurt, Germany.

00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:25.898
After the gallery closed for the day, three men had remained behind, hidden in the gallery.

00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:30.798
When the gallery opened the following morning, the Turners were gone.

00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:38.318
Fortunately, these paintings were insured by the Tate Gallery for the sum of £24 million.

00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:43.598
This meant that if they were stolen or destroyed, the insurance

00:18:43.598 --> 00:18:48.028
company would pay The Tate £24 million as compensation.

00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:56.518
So, when there was no sign of the paintings, and all police avenues had been exhausted, The

00:18:56.518 --> 00:19:04.048
Tate received £24 million, around €30 million Euros, as compensation from the insurance company.

00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:10.058
The Tate got the money, but relinquished the ownership rights to the paintings.

00:19:10.838 --> 00:19:16.528
This meant that if the paintings were found, the insurance company would be able to sell them.

00:19:17.768 --> 00:19:22.668
The insurance company offered a $250,000 reward for the

00:19:22.668 --> 00:19:26.348
paintings, but to no avail, there was no sign of it.

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:33.278
But, where it gets interesting is that four years later The Tate bought

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:38.408
back the rights to the paintings from the insurance company for £8 million.

00:19:40.338 --> 00:19:45.048
The gallery believed that one day the paintings would be rediscovered,

00:19:45.278 --> 00:19:49.218
and if and when they were rediscovered, it wanted them back.

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:55.398
It had already received the £24 million as compensation for the

00:19:55.398 --> 00:20:00.148
loss, so it used part of this compensation to buy back the rights.

00:20:01.228 --> 00:20:06.108
The thieves were caught and sent to prison in 1999, but they had

00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:10.358
disposed of the paintings, they were now being held by someone else.

00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:17.448
The Tate ended up being contacted by a German lawyer, who said that he could arrange for

00:20:17.448 --> 00:20:23.968
the return of the paintings for 10 million Deutschmarks, about €5 million Euros at the time.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.988
Eight and a half years after the theft, after extensive

00:20:29.058 --> 00:20:32.508
secret negotiations, the paintings were finally returned.

00:20:33.658 --> 00:20:38.008
The Tate had to pay around €5 million Euros to get the paintings back,

00:20:38.158 --> 00:20:43.238
but given that it had received a payment of £24 million, The Tate

00:20:43.238 --> 00:20:47.798
Gallery ended up actually making quite a lot of money from the sale.

00:20:48.728 --> 00:20:53.048
When you take into account the money it made from investments on the

00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:57.458
insurance payout and the increase in the value of the Turner paintings,

00:20:57.588 --> 00:21:02.878
it’s estimated that the gallery made almost €50 million from the theft.

00:21:04.058 --> 00:21:07.988
You certainly don’t think about art galleries making money

00:21:08.028 --> 00:21:11.818
when they are robbed, but in this case The Tate certainly did.

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:19.565
Ok then, our fifth and final theft is of a painting that you will definitely have heard of.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:24.435
The Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda to the Italian and Spanish listeners.

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:30.695
You may well know that today The Mona Lisa hangs in the Louvre gallery in Paris.

00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:35.855
It is safe and sound, and is visited by 30,000 people every single day.

00:21:36.765 --> 00:21:40.895
It’s one of the most famous paintings in the world, and part

00:21:40.945 --> 00:21:44.955
of its fame actually comes from the fact that it was stolen.

00:21:45.975 --> 00:21:49.855
The theft happened 110 years ago, in 1911.

00:21:50.585 --> 00:21:55.895
An Italian handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia had been hired to work at the Louvre.

00:21:56.645 --> 00:22:03.045
His main job was creating glass protective coverings for paintings, such as the Mona Lisa.

00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:12.495
At 7am on Monday 21st August, 1911, he entered the museum through the workman’s entrance.

00:22:13.075 --> 00:22:16.835
The museum was closed to the public on a Monday, but

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:20.545
there was nothing unusual about museum staff entering.

00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:26.465
Indeed, Mondays were when you could get work done without disrupting the public.

00:22:27.265 --> 00:22:32.525
But Peruggia had not come to work, he had come to steal.

00:22:33.495 --> 00:22:38.055
He made his way to the room where the Mona Lisa was, took it out of its

00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:44.335
frame, wrapped it under his white worker’s coat, and simply left the building.

00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:49.675
The theft wasn’t even discovered until 24 hours later.

00:22:50.355 --> 00:22:56.695
Multiple workers had seen that the Mona Lisa wasn’t in its frame, but this was nothing

00:22:56.755 --> 00:23:03.705
unusual - paintings were taken away for restoration, study, or taken out on loan to other

00:23:03.705 --> 00:23:10.335
galleries all the time, and people assumed that this was what had happened to the Mona Lisa.

00:23:11.395 --> 00:23:17.415
Of course, there were no alarms, no CCTV, or any of the technology that we have today.

00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:22.595
When the theft was discovered, it was all over the newspapers, and

00:23:22.755 --> 00:23:26.955
really propelled The Mona Lisa to the fame that it enjoys today.

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:32.315
If it had never been stolen, it would have been significantly less famous.

00:23:33.435 --> 00:23:34.645
The hunt was on.

00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:36.095
Where was the Mona Lisa?

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:41.215
Had it been taken to the UK, to Italy, even to the United States?

00:23:41.915 --> 00:23:47.565
In fact, for almost the entire time it was stolen, the Mona Lisa never left Paris.

00:23:48.365 --> 00:23:52.805
Peruggia kept it in his apartment, first in a cupboard, then

00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:57.085
under the cooker, then even in a trunk with a fake bottom.

00:23:57.665 --> 00:24:00.895
He had tried to sell it multiple times, but the

00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:04.575
world’s eyes were on it, and no dealers would take it.

00:24:05.525 --> 00:24:09.865
Eventually he contacted an art dealer in Florence, claiming that

00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:14.135
he wanted to bring this priceless work of art back to Italy.

00:24:14.755 --> 00:24:19.735
It was a work by Leonardo Da Vinci, one of Italy’s best known painters, and

00:24:19.855 --> 00:24:24.665
he said he wanted to bring it back to the country where it deserved to be.

00:24:25.675 --> 00:24:30.629
He set up a meeting with the Florentine art dealer, who had

00:24:30.629 --> 00:24:34.179
brought along the curator of the Uffizi gallery in Florence.

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:40.059
When Peruggia produced the painting during the meeting, the police were promptly called.

00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:45.479
Peruggia was arrested, and unlike the Hans Memling triptych, the

00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:50.029
first recorded stolen piece of art that still hasn’t been returned to

00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:54.389
its rightful owner, the Mona Lisa was safely returned to The Louvre.

00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:02.419
OK then, there we have it, five of the greatest art thefts of all time.

00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:07.539
The Impressionist masterpieces from the Musée Marmottan in Paris, the double

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:12.839
theft of the two Screams, the Mexican amateur thieves who pulled off one

00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:18.149
of the biggest thefts of all time, the two Turners and the example of how

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:22.309
being robbed can actually make you money, and of course the Mona Lisa.

00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:29.169
As a reminder, this is part one of a three-part series, in parts two and three we will be

00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:35.129
going deeper into the stories of both the greatest, or at least most prolific, art thief

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:41.139
of all time, Stéphane Breitweiser, and the greatest, or perhaps just most intriguing,

00:25:41.429 --> 00:25:46.649
art theft of all time, the robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:51.029
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:55.819
In particular, I’d love to know your thoughts on the severity of art theft.

00:25:56.319 --> 00:26:00.559
It’s often considered a victimless crime, and art

00:26:00.569 --> 00:26:04.819
thieves tend to get relatively short prison sentences.

00:26:05.169 --> 00:26:07.489
But is it really victimless?

00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:14.609
Are we, the public, the normal people, actually the victims of it, because these pieces are removed

00:26:14.619 --> 00:26:21.069
from public display, and if so, what should be done about the criminals who commit these crimes?

00:26:21.629 --> 00:26:23.099
I would love to get your thoughts.

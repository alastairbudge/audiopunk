Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:16.892
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:21.122
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:26.322
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:31.290
mini-series, this time about a lady called Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:36.442
She was a journalist who was brutally assassinated 5 years ago this

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:41.412
month on a countryside road in a small Mediterranean island called Malta.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:47.772
It’s a story that brings together corruption, money laundering, crooked politicians,

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:54.162
bribery, bad policemen, casinos, passports, energy supplies, tax havens, fake

00:00:54.192 --> 00:01:00.772
government jobs, hitmen, gambling, and at the centre of it all, one fearless woman.

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:07.512
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll learn more about the setting for this story, the tiny and

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:13.882
unusual country of Malta, as well as who Daphne was and who might possibly have wanted her dead.

00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:19.592
Then in part two, we’ll look at how the investigation progressed, or how it didn’t

00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:24.762
progress, who was implicated in the assassination, how close it got to the top

00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:29.262
of the Maltese political establishment, and how it brought down a Prime Minister.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:34.712
And in part three, our final part, we’ll find out who confessed to the

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:39.862
murder, what’s happening next, and ask ourselves whether the person, or

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:44.352
people, who really orchestrated it all will ever be brought to justice.

00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:49.827
OK then, Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:57.887
Shortly after lunch, on October 16th, 2017, a 52-year-old woman

00:01:58.107 --> 00:02:02.417
left her house in the countryside village of Bidnija, in Malta.

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:09.217
She said goodbye to her adult son, who continued working on his laptop in the house.

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:15.073
She strolled down to her car, a rental, a Peugeot 108.

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.197
She got into the car, ready to drive off.

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:23.587
Little did she know that up on a hill nearby a middle

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:27.267
aged man was watching her through his binoculars.

00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:32.657
When he saw her heading towards the car, he made a phone call to his brother.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:35.317
The call didn’t last long.

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:42.767
The brother was only a few kilometres away, out on a little boat next to Valletta, the capital,

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:48.597
which had been given the prestigious award of being the European Capital of Culture that year.

00:02:50.077 --> 00:02:54.577
To the left of the small boat, only a few hundred metres away, were

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:59.167
multi-million Euro yachts owned by some of the wealthiest people in the world.

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:03.807
To the right, up on the raised capital of Valletta, was the Office

00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:07.667
of the Prime Minister, the centre of Maltese political power.

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:11.537
The man on the boat tapped his phone.

00:03:12.907 --> 00:03:17.807
Seconds later, back at the car, there was a huge explosion.

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:23.587
The vehicle was blown to smithereens, the woman inside killed instantly.

00:03:24.317 --> 00:03:29.497
After hearing the explosion, the woman’s son rushed outside to see what had happened.

00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:33.717
His worst fears were confirmed as he found parts of his mother’s

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:37.527
dead body strewn around the wreckage of the smouldering vehicle.

00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:43.707
It would be an event that would change everything, or perhaps, would change nothing.

00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:49.937
For the name of the woman at the centre of our story was Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:54.757
She was one of, if not the most famous journalists in the country.

00:03:55.907 --> 00:04:01.237
Her blog was one of the most popular websites in Malta, with Maltese people firing

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:05.627
up her website first thing in the morning to catch up on the latest stories.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:11.157
So, if you can for a minute, imagine the most well-known

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:15.127
journalist in your country being blown up by a car bomb.

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:18.517
It would be a huge shock, right?

00:04:18.827 --> 00:04:23.547
An assault on the freedom of the press, a direct attack on the truth.

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:29.187
But Malta is not like other countries, so what I want to do in this first

00:04:29.187 --> 00:04:33.907
episode is to give you a little bit of background to this country, as it

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:39.587
will, I hope, help explain but certainly not excuse the events of this story.

00:04:40.357 --> 00:04:46.497
This story is, as regular listeners may realise, more personal than many of the others.

00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:50.877
Malta is the country that I’ve called home for almost 6 years now.

00:04:51.347 --> 00:04:55.647
I was a close follower of Daphne while she was alive, and I have been

00:04:55.647 --> 00:05:01.177
following this story closely ever since that fateful day in October of 2017.

00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:06.197
Your first question might be, where exactly is Malta?

00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:09.907
Well, it is an island in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:15.487
Imagine Sicily, the island at the very bottom of Italy, put your finger

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:20.577
in the middle of it, then go directly south 100km and you’ll hit Malta.

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:27.437
But you could easily miss it, because it is very small, absolutely tiny.

00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:35.077
The island of Malta itself is only 246 km squared, and the entire country,

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:41.427
which consists of two other smaller islands, is only 316km squared.

00:05:42.477 --> 00:05:49.357
To put that in perspective, the Metropolitan area of London is 8,382 kilometres

00:05:49.357 --> 00:05:55.277
squared, so you could fit almost 27 Maltas inside Metropolitan London.

00:05:56.357 --> 00:05:59.497
Why is this important for our story, you might ask?

00:06:00.007 --> 00:06:03.807
Well, the nature of a small place, especially a small

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:07.147
island, is that there are tighter connections between people.

00:06:07.707 --> 00:06:09.097
Everyone knows everyone.

00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:13.377
The world of politics is closely intertwined with the

00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:16.707
world of business, the judicial system and the police.

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:23.787
There is only one real university on the island, so you have a situation where a

00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:28.517
large proportion of the people who will go on to the highest positions in politics,

00:06:28.647 --> 00:06:33.587
in business, in the legal system, and in public administration, the people who

00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:38.577
control the goings on of the country, they all know each other and have often

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:43.327
grown up together, gone to the same schools and gone to the same university.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.777
On one level, lovely.

00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:48.727
You can do business with your friends and you have a

00:06:48.737 --> 00:06:53.027
much closer-knit society than exists in larger countries.

00:06:53.787 --> 00:07:01.337
But this clearly means that the system is rife for corruption, for a politician doing a favour

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:06.587
for their wife’s cousin, for someone to pass a driving test because they have connections

00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:12.907
to a minister, or for a police officer turning a blind eye to their brother’s misbehaviour.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:16.487
Or much worse, as we’ll find out.

00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:23.237
But more than this, the nature of a small place means that if you get on the wrong side

00:07:23.237 --> 00:07:30.567
of, if you upset, important and powerful people, then your life can be made very difficult.

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:37.767
Daphne Caruana Galizia was perhaps the ultimate example of both of these aspects.

00:07:38.797 --> 00:07:44.977
Not only did she make it her life’s work to shine a light on the corruption, cronyism and

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:51.877
rent-seeking that she saw going on in Maltese politics, but she suffered a near constant stream

00:07:51.907 --> 00:07:58.177
of attacks from people in positions of power in Maltese society, making her life very difficult.

00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:02.967
So, let me tell you a little bit about this amazing lady, to

00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:07.107
give you an idea about who might have wanted her dead, and why.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:13.387
She started her career as a journalist at Malta’s main newspaper, The Times

00:08:13.387 --> 00:08:18.157
of Malta, where she was the country’s first female columnist, before she

00:08:18.157 --> 00:08:22.757
broke away and started at another newspaper called The Malta Independent.

00:08:23.497 --> 00:08:29.527
And in 2008 she went fully independent, launching a blog called Running

00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:33.687
Commentary, which swiftly became the most popular source of news in

00:08:33.687 --> 00:08:38.967
the entire country, regularly getting over 400,000 daily visitors.

00:08:40.097 --> 00:08:46.327
As a point of reference, Malta’s population at the time was just over 400,000 people, so

00:08:46.587 --> 00:08:53.237
imagine every single adult in Malta, plus a good chunk of people outside the country reading

00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:59.927
her writing every single day and this gives you some idea of the kind of influence she had.

00:09:00.817 --> 00:09:02.547
So, what did she write about?

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:04.327
Corruption, essentially.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:09.647
And if you are thinking that there surely couldn’t be enough material for her to have a

00:09:09.827 --> 00:09:16.197
full time job writing about corruption in such a tiny country, you would be sorely mistaken.

00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:22.197
She could barely keep up with all of the dodgy dealings that were going on, and practically every

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:28.157
day was full of a new scandal or suggestion of corruption by someone in a position of power.

00:09:29.347 --> 00:09:32.147
There were a few major areas of interest for her.

00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:38.837
Firstly, in 2013 Malta launched what it called its “Citizenship by

00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:42.807
Investment” programme, where wealthy people can invest a certain

00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:47.827
amount of money, around a million Euros, and become a Maltese citizen.

00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:55.617
Essentially, people from non-EU countries could buy Maltese citizenship, and get an EU passport.

00:09:56.907 --> 00:10:03.297
Secondly, after Malta joined the EU, in 2004, it became a hub for online gambling

00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:08.697
companies, which were attracted by Malta’s very low tax rates and ability to give

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:13.347
out gambling licences that were recognised in the rest of the European Union.

00:10:14.287 --> 00:10:20.127
Today, this tiny, tiny island is home to about 10% of the global online

00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:24.397
gambling industry, which has had the effect of bringing a huge amount of

00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:30.437
money into what is essentially a tiny dry rock in the middle of the sea, and

00:10:30.607 --> 00:10:35.397
turning what was not a very wealthy country at all into one flooded with money.

00:10:36.547 --> 00:10:42.167
And thirdly, and not completely unrelated to the previous two points, Malta

00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:46.867
had developed a financial services and banking industry that was often

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:51.057
prepared to accept clients that would not be accepted in other countries.

00:10:51.927 --> 00:10:56.877
That’s perhaps a polite way of putting it - a more sceptical perspective

00:10:57.047 --> 00:11:01.017
would be that it had become an excellent place for everyone from

00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:05.917
Mexican drug cartels to Russian oligarchs to launder their money.

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:11.867
In Daphne’s own words, “Malta is 17 miles by nine and

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:15.627
flooded with cocaine, corruption, and filthy money”.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:22.727
In an eerie premonition, a spooky foreshadowing, cocaine, corruption

00:11:22.947 --> 00:11:27.647
and filthy money would all come out in her own murder investigation.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:34.707
And while the Maltese government pointed to increasing salaries, booming property prices,

00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:40.527
and everyone getting richer, Daphne was prepared to look where other journalists were not.

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:47.727
She alleged that the minister of the economy had visited a brothel, that he had used prostitutes,

00:11:47.947 --> 00:11:53.467
that the leader of the opposition party was getting rich from a prostitution business in London,

00:11:53.927 --> 00:12:00.357
practically every day there was a new seedy and nasty, scandal that was reported on her blog.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:05.877
As you might imagine, because she was pointing the finger at the country’s most

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:11.957
powerful men, and I’m afraid it was almost exclusively men, she was targeted.

00:12:13.157 --> 00:12:17.407
There were frequent claims of libel, that she had written untrue stories

00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:22.167
about people, she was taken to court and sued by those she accused.

00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:28.297
And what’s more, she was frequently attacked and harassed by members of the public.

00:12:29.497 --> 00:12:35.117
Why would members of the public feel so strongly about her attacks on politicians, you might ask?

00:12:35.507 --> 00:12:40.887
Well, to answer this question it’s useful to talk very briefly about Maltese politics.

00:12:41.617 --> 00:12:46.787
The political situation in Malta is dominated by two parties, the

00:12:46.937 --> 00:12:52.157
Nationalist party, which was in power until 2013, and the Labour

00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:57.417
party, which won the 2013 election and has been in power ever since.

00:12:58.517 --> 00:13:04.127
Politicians from both parties were the subject of her attacks, but–given

00:13:04.147 --> 00:13:08.437
it has presided over the era in which the greatest scandals took place–her

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:12.327
greatest attacks were directed towards members of the Labour party.

00:13:13.277 --> 00:13:19.517
And the point to underline about Maltese politics is that it is incredibly tribal, people

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:25.237
are incredibly passionate about it, almost more like football teams than political parties.

00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:33.247
There are strong Labour or Nationalist areas or families, and the amount of “floating voters”,

00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:39.297
people who are undecided, is significantly lower than it tends to be in other countries.

00:13:40.497 --> 00:13:46.857
So, much like how a die-hard football fan might feel if their team lost or someone attacked them,

00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:53.197
for some people Daphne’s attacks on “their” politicians were like attacks on them personally.

00:13:53.997 --> 00:13:55.597
And they fought back.

00:13:56.397 --> 00:13:59.737
Daphne, and her family, were subject to near constant

00:13:59.787 --> 00:14:03.067
attacks before the final attack that took her life.

00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:09.117
Other than the legal attacks, her house was set on fire, she would constantly

00:14:09.127 --> 00:14:14.877
have people driving past her house and shouting vile insults, one of her dogs

00:14:15.027 --> 00:14:20.137
had its throat slit and another one was poisoned, she would receive text messages

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:25.407
and letters with death threats, it was a near-constant intimidation campaign.

00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:27.807
But she didn’t stop.

00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:32.737
And the allegations of corruption that she made became more and more serious.

00:14:33.477 --> 00:14:38.097
Yes, the minister of the economy going to a brothel, visiting prostitutes,

00:14:38.117 --> 00:14:42.457
is bad, but it was nothing compared to what she was to discover.

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:50.157
After the Panama Papers were released in 2016, she claimed that she had discovered

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:55.277
damning information about two very senior members of the Maltese government.

00:14:56.257 --> 00:15:01.607
The first was Konrad Mizzi, a man who had been both the Minister of Energy and the

00:15:01.607 --> 00:15:05.837
Minister of Health, before being transferred to the Office of the Prime Minister.

00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:11.127
The second was a man called Keith Schembri, a Maltese businessman

00:15:11.157 --> 00:15:14.917
and childhood friend of Joseph Muscat, the Prime Minister.

00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:19.237
Schembri now held the position of the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:21.727
What did Daphne claim?

00:15:22.507 --> 00:15:27.527
That shortly after the Labour party had been elected to power, both men had

00:15:27.567 --> 00:15:32.677
opened up offshore bank accounts and companies in New Zealand and Panama.

00:15:34.087 --> 00:15:35.450
Why would they do that?

00:15:35.607 --> 00:15:39.447
Well, the implication was that they were to secretly store

00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:43.297
money that the two politicians would be receiving as bribes.

00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:48.707
What’s more, she would go on to claim that none other than the Prime Minister’s

00:15:48.717 --> 00:15:54.257
wife was the owner of a company in Panama, with the implicit suggestion that

00:15:54.277 --> 00:15:58.427
this would be used to accept money without it being linked to the Prime Minister.

00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:02.267
This was in April of 2017.

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:07.967
Although the Prime Minister and his wife would vigorously deny it, in the

00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:12.207
already corruption-tolerant country of Malta, it was quite the allegation.

00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:20.977
An early general election was called, in June of 2017, and the Labour party, the party at the

00:16:20.977 --> 00:16:27.787
centre of all of these outrageous corruption allegations, was re-elected in a resounding majority.

00:16:28.797 --> 00:16:33.297
It was, to some, a sign that either the Labour voting population

00:16:33.487 --> 00:16:37.307
didn’t believe the allegations, or they simply didn’t care about them.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:41.577
But this did not deter Daphne in the slightest.

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:48.407
If anything, it was an even greater reason to keep pushing, to keep on searching for the truth.

00:16:49.887 --> 00:16:55.377
It would be a search that would end, tragically on the afternoon of October 16th.

00:16:57.117 --> 00:17:01.367
Her last post on her blog was titled “That crook Schembri

00:17:01.727 --> 00:17:05.267
was in court today, pleading that he is not a crook”.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:10.657
A crook, by the way, means a bad, dishonest person, a criminal.

00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:17.267
And ominously, the last sentence of the last article that she

00:17:17.267 --> 00:17:21.897
would ever write read “there are crooks everywhere you look now.

00:17:22.357 --> 00:17:24.447
The situation is desperate”.

00:17:25.907 --> 00:17:33.307
She hit publish, the article went live on the blog, and just 30 minutes later one of these

00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:40.487
crooks pressed a button on a phone, detonating a massive bomb and silencing Daphne forever.

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:46.597
As we will find out in the next episode, although the bomb might have silenced

00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:52.547
Daphne the journalist, it would unravel a web of scandal, put a black mark on Malta’s

00:17:52.547 --> 00:17:57.357
international reputation, bring down the prime minister and several of his closest

00:17:57.387 --> 00:18:03.444
allies, and it would certainly not silence the message of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:18:05.972 --> 00:18:10.812
OK then, that is it for today's episode, part one of this three-part

00:18:10.812 --> 00:18:14.162
mini-series on the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:18:14.762 --> 00:18:20.712
Next up, in part two, we will look at how the investigation unravelled, look at what Daphne

00:18:20.712 --> 00:18:25.842
had discovered, look how the very corruption she was investigating got in the way of the

00:18:25.842 --> 00:18:31.458
investigation of her own murder, who has been accused and charged with her killing, and why.

00:18:32.428 --> 00:18:37.648
Then in part three, the final part, we’ll look at what has happened since then, the

00:18:37.648 --> 00:18:43.898
trials, the revelations, and see who, if anyone, has actually been brought to justice.

00:18:44.808 --> 00:18:48.288
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:48.588 --> 00:18:49.638
Have you been to Malta?

00:18:50.038 --> 00:18:53.918
It’s a place that lots of people visit to learn English, so I wonder,

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:57.788
if you have been here, did you know that it had this dark underbelly?

00:18:58.578 --> 00:19:03.088
Why do you think that this culture of corruption and rent-seeking is so

00:19:03.348 --> 00:19:07.278
pervasive in small islands, and what do you think could be done to stop it?

00:19:07.718 --> 00:19:11.808

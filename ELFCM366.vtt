Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.790
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.850
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.749
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.299
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.450
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.520
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.220
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.890
are talking about a disorganised

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.060
bunch of criminals that evolved into

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.590
a well-run criminal empire, making

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.590
billions of dollars in the process.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.890
A violent force that murdered, extorted,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.679
intimidated, and stole to get what they

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.480
wanted, but also wielded enough political

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.260
power to influence elections, control

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.029
entire industries, and even change policy.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.429
I am talking, of course, about the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.369
Five Families of New York - the city’s

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.549
Italian-American criminal underworld.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.650
There is a lot to talk about so we are

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.559
going to split this into two parts.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.630
Today's episode will look at

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.730
the early years, the infighting,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.979
and the modernisation of

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.789
the Italian-American mafia.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.070
In part-two, we’ll look at the business

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.520
of the Five Families, their cultural

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.450
significance, and their downfall.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.139
OK then, let’s get into it and

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.029
talk about The Five Families

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.929
and the business of crime.

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.379
On the afternoon of the 15th of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.212
April, 1931, an armoured car pulled

00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:32.449
up outside the Nuova Villa Tammaro

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:35.312
restaurant in Coney Island, New York.

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.632
Two bodyguards got out, and then a

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:41.835
third smaller, chubbier man followed.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.485
His name was Giuseppe Masseria.

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:48.415
He made his way to a table at

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:49.785
the back of the restaurant,

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.165
where a man was already waiting.

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:56.185
The restaurant was quiet that afternoon.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.135
There was nobody else around.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.515
Masseria sat down at the table

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:04.555
and ordered some bread, wine and

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.497
coffee, but this man, Giuseppe

00:02:07.497 --> 00:02:10.695
Masseria, was no ordinary customer.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.825
He was known all over New York

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:16.439
City as "Joe the Boss" Masseria.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.229
He was the head of the

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.669
Genovese crime family.

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.069
And the man waiting at the table

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.714
was one of his lieutenants, a man

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:28.444
called Charles ‘Lucky Luciano’.

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:31.544
Their food arrived, and the

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:33.494
restaurant’s owner quietly told

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:35.364
his staff to stay in the kitchen,

00:02:35.724 --> 00:02:38.114
and that he was ‘going for a walk.’

00:02:39.374 --> 00:02:42.484
A while later at around 3pm, as

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:44.854
Joe the Boss played an after-lunch

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.436
game of cards, Luciano excused

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:49.422
himself and went to the bathroom.

00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:51.222
“I gotta take a leak”.

00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:55.592
Then, a group of men came up behind

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.672
Masseria and shot him several times

00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:01.312
in the back, and once in the head.

00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:04.872
His body flopped forward onto the

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:07.302
table, and then fell onto the floor.

00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:11.462
The men left behind their guns, hats,

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:14.322
and coats and jumped into a getaway

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:17.032
car, with tyres screeching on the road.

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.052
Joe the Boss was dead.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:22.312
A pool of blood leaked

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:23.862
across the restaurant floor.

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:27.622
In Masseria’s bloodied hand was

00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:30.682
the Ace of Spades - the death card.

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:33.532
Though it's likely that one of the

00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.032
gunmen planted, or put, the card

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:37.852
there to make some kind of point,

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:40.862
or send a message, some believe that

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:42.982
Masseria was holding the death card

00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:45.322
at the very moment he was killed.

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:49.212
Nobody was ever convicted of the murder,

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:52.642
and there were, of course, no witnesses.

00:03:53.852 --> 00:03:57.549
But in those days, back in 1931,

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:00.612
murders like this had become normal.

00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:03.832
“Joe The Boss” was just another

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:06.742
statistic, another hit, as wise

00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:08.652
guys say, in an ongoing war.

00:04:09.972 --> 00:04:12.992
Dozens of these murders, of these very

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:15.392
public executions, had been going on

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:18.202
across New York during a bloody war

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:20.552
between competing factions of the

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.902
city’s Italian criminal underworld.

00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:26.462
But Masseria’s death was also

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:28.842
significant for another reason.

00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:32.702
Lucky Luciano, the young man sitting

00:04:32.702 --> 00:04:34.612
with him  at the table that afternoon,

00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:36.942
his former lieutenant that excused

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:39.282
himself to go to the bathroom, had

00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:43.102
betrayed his boss and organised the hit.

00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:46.172
And this treacherous

00:04:46.222 --> 00:04:48.372
young man had big plans.

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:51.482
He wanted to end the war and create

00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:53.772
the framework for a professional

00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:56.322
criminal empire, an empire that would

00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:59.722
be called The Five Families of New York.

00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:03.712
Now, before we get into all the wise

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:06.312
guys and gangsters getting ‘whacked’,

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:08.512
as they say, meaning killed, let’s

00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:10.832
start with a little historical context.

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:14.822
For this, we need to travel back across

00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:17.762
the Atlantic Ocean not just to Italy, but

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:21.112
to a very specific part of Italy: Sicily.

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:23.492
Now, in case you don’t know

00:05:23.492 --> 00:05:25.432
where it is, Sicily is an

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.202
island in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:30.222
If you think of Italy like a foot kicking

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:32.622
a football, Sicily is the football.

00:05:33.712 --> 00:05:36.072
And Sicily is where it all began.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:39.482
Due to its strategic location between

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:41.962
Africa and Europe, over the years

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:44.062
Sicily had been invaded by the

00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:46.432
French, the Romans, the Spanish,

00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:48.652
the Arabs and even the Phoenicians.

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:52.132
And in order to defend against

00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:53.652
whoever was the invader of the

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:56.192
day, the local population had for

00:05:56.192 --> 00:05:58.742
hundreds of years organised themselves

00:05:58.882 --> 00:06:00.682
into groups to defend their land.

00:06:01.982 --> 00:06:04.662
By the 19th century these small

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:07.412
gangs had become known as ‘mafie’,

00:06:07.852 --> 00:06:10.952
and they charged landowners money in

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:13.292
return for ‘protection’ - it was a

00:06:13.482 --> 00:06:15.462
very common mafia method of making

00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.628
money, as we will see in New York

00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:19.528
a little bit later in the episode.

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:23.428
As a quick side note, this word,

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:26.658
“mafia”, is believed by historians to

00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:29.338
come from a colloquial, an informal,

00:06:29.488 --> 00:06:32.218
Sicilian-Arabic phrase that roughly

00:06:32.218 --> 00:06:34.828
means ‘acting as a protector against

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.288
the arrogance of the powerful.’

00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:40.648
Over the decades these groups grew

00:06:40.658 --> 00:06:43.268
in strength and size, exerting more

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:44.858
and more influence on the island,

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.818
and after Sicily became part of Italy

00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:51.558
in 1861 these groups even cooperated

00:06:51.628 --> 00:06:53.408
with the government to keep other,

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:56.088
rival groups in check, under control.

00:06:57.678 --> 00:07:00.308
In return, the authorities turned a

00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:02.808
blind eye, they ignored the Sicilian

00:07:02.808 --> 00:07:05.218
mafia’s own criminal activities, which

00:07:05.298 --> 00:07:07.158
were quite extensive by this point.

00:07:08.508 --> 00:07:10.358
The government had intended for these

00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:13.438
sorts of deals to be short-term fixes for

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:15.938
the instability threatening the country,

00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:18.558
but as the 19th century progressed,

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.818
the Sicilian mafia began using its

00:07:20.828 --> 00:07:23.768
muscle, or power, to influence politics,

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:26.468
business and even the Catholic church.

00:07:27.138 --> 00:07:29.438
So, by the late 19th century, the

00:07:29.438 --> 00:07:31.668
mafia was a force to be reckoned with.

00:07:33.048 --> 00:07:35.708
This period also coincided with

00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:38.218
a period of mass emigration from

00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:41.278
Italy, in particular Sicily, across

00:07:41.318 --> 00:07:43.228
the Atlantic to the United States.

00:07:44.468 --> 00:07:47.505
From the 1880s to the 1920s, over

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:50.178
20 million immigrants arrived

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.735
in the United States looking for

00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:53.348
their slice of the American dream.

00:07:54.068 --> 00:07:56.658
A large chunk of these were Italians.

00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:00.608
In the 1890s, 600,000 Italians

00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:02.498
came to the United States and

00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:06.228
by 1920 over 4 million had come.

00:08:07.498 --> 00:08:09.498
Lots of Italians came from

00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:11.038
southern Italy - places like

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.408
Napoli, Calabria, and Campania.

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:15.648
And of course, from Sicily.

00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:19.106
Many of them settled in the Mulberry

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:21.476
area of Manhattan, and the neighbourhood

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:23.936
was home to so many Italians that it

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:26.166
quickly became known as ‘Little Italy.’

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.196
The Italians arriving in New York

00:08:29.336 --> 00:08:30.876
at the turn of the twentieth-century

00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:33.906
generally stayed together, ate Italian

00:08:33.906 --> 00:08:36.956
food, spoke Italian, and lived together.

00:08:38.066 --> 00:08:40.636
They were, by and large, treated by the

00:08:40.636 --> 00:08:43.886
local population as second-class citizens,

00:08:44.026 --> 00:08:47.066
only able to get low-level, manual jobs.

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:50.216
But America was the land of

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:52.446
opportunity, and there were plenty

00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:54.706
of enterprising young men who sensed

00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:57.546
new possibilities, even if those

00:08:57.576 --> 00:08:59.576
possibilities were highly illegal.

00:09:00.876 --> 00:09:03.466
And this criminality is believed to have

00:09:03.466 --> 00:09:06.676
started in a fairly unorganised, petty

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:09.067
way, far from the tightly-controlled

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:11.501
criminal empire that Lucky Luciano would

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:13.441
preside over several decades later.

00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:16.711
At the beginning, there were various

00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:18.641
loosely connected Italian gangs

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.441
constantly warring with Irish and

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:24.081
Jewish gangs but also with one another.

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.411
Historians believe that the first of

00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:30.161
these was the Morello gang, a group

00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:32.601
of Sicilian criminals that operated in

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:34.351
the Harlem neighbourhood of New York

00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.201
around the turn of the 20th century.

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:40.341
They made their money mainly by making

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.071
counterfeit currency - that is, making

00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.891
fake money - and also in construction.

00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:48.691
They also owned grocery stores

00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.991
and restaurants, and made money by

00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:52.731
intimidating their rivals out of

00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:54.911
business or demanding protection money

00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:57.121
from them, as their forefathers had

00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:59.281
done back in Sicily decades before.

00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:02.371
The Morello gang was led by Giuseppe

00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:05.231
Morello, a Sicilian known as

00:10:05.231 --> 00:10:07.431
the ‘Clutch hand’ because of his

00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:09.841
deformed, one-fingered hand that

00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.391
rivals said looked like a claw.

00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:15.801
In the early-1900s, Morello teamed

00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:18.301
up with another Sicilian, Ignazio

00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:21.431
‘the Wolf’ Lupo, and the two began

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.961
asserting their dominance in New

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:25.061
York by murdering their opponents.

00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.941
Morello quickly rose to power, and

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.861
by 1902 he had established himself

00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:33.791
as the leader of the Sicilians in

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:35.761
New York when he allegedly ordered

00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:38.341
the murder of a Brooklyn rival called

00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:41.251
Giuseppe Catania, who, Morello felt,

00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:43.461
“talked too much when he was drunk.”

00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:46.271
Catania’s body was later found

00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:48.481
stuffed into a barrel, which was

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.141
a method of disposal that the

00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:51.971
Morello gang would become known for.

00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:56.551
By 1905, Morello was generally thought

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:59.761
to be capo de tutti capi, or ‘boss of all

00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:03.201
bosses’, but in 1910 he was convicted of

00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:05.731
counterfeiting, of creating fake money,

00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.621
and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:12.941
This gang, the Morello gang, created

00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:15.381
the early model of the Italian-American

00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:17.921
mafia and it is generally thought to be

00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:20.661
the first Italian-American mafia family.

00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:24.871
But they were far from having a monopoly

00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:26.651
on the New York criminal underworld.

00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:29.501
They were constantly jostling for power

00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:31.721
with other organised criminal gangs,

00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:34.281
often with origins in other areas

00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:36.901
of southern Italy, namely Naples and

00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:39.901
Calabria, regions with their own organised

00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:41.871
criminal systems - the Camorra, in

00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:44.118
Naples, and the ‘Ndrangheta, in Calabria.

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.221
And throughout the 1920s they

00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:49.571
warred with each other, betrayed one

00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:52.411
another, and many even switched sides.

00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:56.311
By the late 1920s, things

00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:57.501
were coming to a head.

00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:00.381
The Prohibition Era, which had

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.261
started in 1920, had been great for

00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:05.421
business, as the alcohol trade was

00:12:05.421 --> 00:12:06.961
strictly controlled by criminals.

00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:09.611
But it had also cost a lot of

00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:12.141
lives, as organised criminals vied

00:12:12.321 --> 00:12:14.463
for control of bootlegged alcohol.

00:12:15.913 --> 00:12:17.805
There were many disparate, separate

00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:19.765
groups, all fighting one another.

00:12:20.565 --> 00:12:22.765
So how did these different groups

00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:24.515
of disorganised murderers and

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:27.354
criminals end up in a highly-regulated

00:12:27.384 --> 00:12:30.154
organisation with hierarchies and rules?

00:12:31.004 --> 00:12:32.794
Well, as with most things that

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.144
concern the mafia, it all started

00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:37.664
with war, a war that would become

00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:39.734
known as the Castellammarese War.

00:12:40.834 --> 00:12:42.914
In fact, we’ve already heard a

00:12:42.914 --> 00:12:45.024
bit about the Castellammarese War.

00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:48.564
We certainly heard how it ended in

00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:50.464
the introduction to this episode,

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:53.094
with the execution of Joe The Boss.

00:12:54.194 --> 00:12:57.944
This war, which lasted from February

00:12:58.004 --> 00:13:01.994
in 1930 to April of 1931, is viewed

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:04.214
by most as the beginning of the New

00:13:04.214 --> 00:13:06.844
York mob as we know it, transforming

00:13:06.844 --> 00:13:09.334
it from a group of divided, warring

00:13:09.374 --> 00:13:11.664
criminal factions into an organised

00:13:11.714 --> 00:13:14.064
crime syndicate run like a business.

00:13:15.284 --> 00:13:18.104
By 1930, the Italian underworld

00:13:18.124 --> 00:13:20.704
in New York had two main factions

00:13:20.824 --> 00:13:22.274
- both of which were Sicilian.

00:13:23.314 --> 00:13:26.064
One group was led by “Joe the Boss”

00:13:26.064 --> 00:13:28.944
Masseria, who largely kept his gang to

00:13:28.944 --> 00:13:31.214
other Sicilians and southern Italians.

00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:33.194
This group was called

00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:34.134
the Masseria faction.

00:13:35.544 --> 00:13:37.924
The other group was called the Maranzano

00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:40.404
faction, and was led by a man called

00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:43.464
Salvatore Maranzano, who was himself

00:13:43.704 --> 00:13:45.724
being advised by another powerful

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:48.374
figure called Don Vito Ferro who was

00:13:48.484 --> 00:13:50.634
pulling the strings from back in Sicily.

00:13:51.804 --> 00:13:54.284
So, what was this war all about?

00:13:54.894 --> 00:13:57.124
Well, on the surface of it, it was

00:13:57.124 --> 00:14:00.054
about money and power, like most wars.

00:14:00.824 --> 00:14:03.234
Maranzano declared war on Masseria,

00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:06.134
there was bloodshed as bullets flew

00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:08.064
through the streets of New York.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:11.384
But beneath the surface it

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.154
was about competing visions

00:14:13.344 --> 00:14:15.084
of what the mafia should be.

00:14:16.104 --> 00:14:19.424
These visions weren’t split by region or

00:14:19.424 --> 00:14:22.364
by faction, but tended to be split down

00:14:22.374 --> 00:14:25.334
generational lines, it was a case of

00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:27.954
the younger versus the older generation.

00:14:29.404 --> 00:14:33.024
By 1930 many mafia members in New York

00:14:33.224 --> 00:14:36.094
were born in, or at least grew up in,

00:14:36.314 --> 00:14:38.454
the United States, and they wanted

00:14:38.454 --> 00:14:40.814
to modernise and change the business.

00:14:41.444 --> 00:14:43.824
They were American, born and bred.

00:14:45.034 --> 00:14:48.054
The other half, referred to by the younger

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.844
generation as ‘Moustache Petes’, were

00:14:50.854 --> 00:14:54.344
born and raised in Italy, and cared more

00:14:54.374 --> 00:14:56.764
about tradition and the Sicilian way

00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:59.614
of doing things, preferring to not do

00:14:59.614 --> 00:15:01.604
business with Americans, if they could.

00:15:03.044 --> 00:15:06.074
This generational divide was so deep

00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:08.534
that it led to one man betraying

00:15:08.544 --> 00:15:10.564
his boss to try to get his way.

00:15:12.074 --> 00:15:14.414
This man was, as you may

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.994
remember, Charles “Lucky” Luciano.

00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:20.734
Sure, Luciano might not have been born in

00:15:20.744 --> 00:15:23.624
New York, he was born in Sicily, but his

00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:26.404
family emigrated to the US when he was 8.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.274
He was Italian by birth and by blood, but

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:32.944
he had an American vision of the future.

00:15:34.254 --> 00:15:35.844
So, what did he do?

00:15:36.594 --> 00:15:39.684
He betrayed his boss, Masseria, and

00:15:39.684 --> 00:15:42.194
secretly negotiated with Maranzano.

00:15:43.384 --> 00:15:46.824
His boss, Masseria, was a “moustache

00:15:46.854 --> 00:15:49.934
Pete”, and Luciano believed that even

00:15:49.984 --> 00:15:52.924
if his side won the war, Masseria’s

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.414
old-fashioned values would get in

00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:57.114
the way of growing the business.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.234
Luciano’s proposal to

00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:01.844
Maranzano was simple.

00:16:02.644 --> 00:16:05.124
Let me kill Masseria, and

00:16:05.124 --> 00:16:06.634
take his place at the top.

00:16:07.164 --> 00:16:08.834
I will then make peace,

00:16:09.114 --> 00:16:10.674
and the war will stop.

00:16:12.254 --> 00:16:14.784
And this takes us to the Coney

00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:16.534
Island restaurant we heard about

00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:17.854
at the start of the episode.

00:16:19.223 --> 00:16:21.334
Masseria was out of the picture.

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:24.954
And it wouldn’t be long in fact before

00:16:24.954 --> 00:16:27.914
Lucky Luciano gave Maranzano the same

00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:30.534
treatment, continuing his treacherous ways

00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:32.854
and having him killed a few months later.

00:16:34.424 --> 00:16:37.804
With both Masseria and Maranzano out of

00:16:37.804 --> 00:16:40.224
the picture, Luciano called a meeting of

00:16:40.224 --> 00:16:42.954
crime bosses from across the country and

00:16:43.024 --> 00:16:45.674
organised what he called “The Commission”.

00:16:47.124 --> 00:16:49.304
The Commission put the top crime

00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:51.044
families from around the United

00:16:51.114 --> 00:16:53.874
States into a single organisation,

00:16:54.384 --> 00:16:56.794
known as La Cosa Nostra, which was

00:16:56.794 --> 00:16:59.934
run less like a gang but more like a

00:16:59.974 --> 00:17:02.464
business with a board and a chairman.

00:17:03.726 --> 00:17:06.134
At the meeting, a national crime

00:17:06.154 --> 00:17:08.914
framework was agreed that incorporated

00:17:08.914 --> 00:17:11.634
the New York families plus Al Capone’s

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.424
Chicago family and Italian-American

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:17.404
mobsters from Buffalo, upstate New York.

00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:20.854
As New York dominated the criminal

00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:23.344
underworld, the meeting also formally

00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:26.134
established New York’s Five Families.

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.154
They were then known as the

00:17:29.154 --> 00:17:33.004
Luciano, Bonanno, Profaci, Mangano,

00:17:33.284 --> 00:17:35.064
and Gagliano crime families.

00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:38.494
The stage was set for these Five

00:17:38.504 --> 00:17:41.284
Families to extract literally billions

00:17:41.284 --> 00:17:43.194
of dollars from the American economy,

00:17:43.554 --> 00:17:45.564
controlling everything from construction

00:17:45.824 --> 00:17:48.624
to prostitution to gambling to politics.

00:17:49.581 --> 00:17:52.001
Luciano might not have known it at

00:17:52.001 --> 00:17:54.132
the time, but he had just created

00:17:54.382 --> 00:17:56.732
very possibly the most successful

00:17:56.982 --> 00:17:59.002
criminal enterprise in history.

00:18:01.678 --> 00:18:03.828
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:06.238
episode on the history and creation

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.258
of the Five Families of New York.

00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:10.858
As a reminder, this episode is going

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:12.758
to be followed by another one where we

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:15.088
go deep into the actual business of the

00:18:15.088 --> 00:18:16.972
Five Families, look at how they made

00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:19.082
their money, and why it wasn’t to last.

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.272
As always, I would love to know

00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:22.612
what you thought about this episode.

00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:24.542
Why do you think stories about the

00:18:24.542 --> 00:18:26.802
American mafia are so alluring?

00:18:27.392 --> 00:18:29.822
For the Italians among you, how do

00:18:29.822 --> 00:18:31.972
you feel about this global obsession

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:33.732
with the Italian-American mafia?

00:18:34.202 --> 00:18:35.962
I would love to know, so let’s

00:18:35.962 --> 00:18:37.242
get this discussion started.

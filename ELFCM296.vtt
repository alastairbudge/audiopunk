Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:16.579
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories,   and learn weird and

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.689
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.529
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about one

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.219
of the most infamous terrorists of the modern era, Osama bin Laden.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.049
No doubt you know the name Osama bin Laden, you know exactly what he

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:39.199
looks like, and know that he was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.609
But in this episode, we are going to go a little deeper, we are going to try to

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.009
go beyond the headlines and ask the question of who actually was Osama bin Laden.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:54.499
What experiences or beliefs shaped his world view, what did

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.329
he actually want, and did he achieve what he set out to do?

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.640
OK then, Osama bin Laden.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.301
Our story starts in March of 1957.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.110
In Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, a baby boy takes his first breath.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.296
He is given the name of Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden.

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:25.026
His father was a construction magnate, a wealthy businessman in the construction industry.

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:32.146
His father did not come from wealth, he was born in a poor family in Yemen, but had

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:37.716
travelled to Saudi Arabia as a young man and made his fortune in the construction industry.

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:45.156
Not only did Osama bin Laden’s father have a lot of money, he had a lot of wives and children.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:50.386
Osama bin Laden was thought to be his 17th child, and

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:54.916
he went on to have 52 children from 11 different wives.

00:01:56.373 --> 00:02:02.423
Shortly after Osama bin Laden was born, his parents divorced, and he went to live with his mother.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:08.713
This was no doubt an important event in the young man’s life, but it would be followed

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:14.843
by an even more important one, his father’s death, when the boy was a mere 10 years old.

00:02:16.043 --> 00:02:20.813
This is believed to have brought the young boy further towards religion, and

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:25.743
he would spend an increasing amount of time praying and studying the Koran.

00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:31.443
While most of his brothers went on to study abroad, in Europe

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:35.603
and in the United States, Osama bin Laden stayed in Saudi Arabia.

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:41.693
It’s perhaps hard to imagine that a man who would become the world’s most famous

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:46.573
terrorist would spend much time at university lecture halls listening to professors

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:52.413
talking about balance sheets and profit margins, but Osama bin Laden did go to

00:02:52.413 --> 00:02:58.203
university, remaining in Saudi Arabia, where he studied economics and business.

00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:04.583
It’s not clear whether he actually graduated, whether he actually completed the

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:10.263
course, but he clearly learned some valuable skills that would come in handy later on.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:18.108
And when he left university in 1979, his initial plan was to join the family

00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:22.768
business, which, let’s remember, is a multibillion dollar construction company.

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:30.218
Bin Laden was clearly intelligent, and he had a obvious route to great riches and

00:03:30.238 --> 00:03:35.348
power simply by doing what was expected of him and joining the family business.

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:40.438
As we know, this was not the route he chose.

00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:46.538
Now, let’s take a step back for a minute to understand what’s happening in

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:52.168
the world at this time, as the events of the late 1970s will cause the life of

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:57.502
Osama bin Laden, and you could argue modern history, to take a different path.

00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:06.918
Culminating in February of 1979, the Iranian revolution overthrew the more Western Shah of Iran.

00:04:07.698 --> 00:04:13.398
Our Iranian listeners will know all too well what this meant for the country, but in short it meant

00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:19.508
the creation of an Islamic Republic ruled by the all-powerful Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:25.975
To Osama bin Laden, this was a sign of an Islamic movement overthrowing

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:31.405
a more Western and liberal one, and offered a glimpse of opportunity.

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:40.234
And later that year, on Christmas Eve of 1979, Soviet forces rolled into Afghanistan,

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:47.404
kickstarting a conflict that would last 10 years and cost an estimated million lives.

00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:54.074
In an effort to defend Afghanistan from the Soviets, Islamic fighters from all over the

00:04:54.074 --> 00:05:00.324
Arab world, also known as mujahideen, travelled to the country to support the resistance.

00:05:01.404 --> 00:05:05.054
One was the subject of today’s episode, Osama bin Laden.

00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:10.224
It’s thought that he first travelled to Pakistan, where he used

00:05:10.224 --> 00:05:14.234
his money and his knowledge of business and administration to help

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:19.294
organise training camps and work on the logistics of the resistance.

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:27.284
Later, he would travel to Afghanistan itself, and make a name for himself as a fearless

00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:33.124
fighter, someone who would fight on the frontline and show absolutely no fear of death.

00:05:34.484 --> 00:05:39.924
Although he would later be painted by the West as a fearful coward who hid

00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:45.714
in caves, his battlefield experience in Afghanistan in the 1980s suggested

00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:50.344
to his followers that this was not the case, and that he was no coward.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:57.724
Indeed, bin Laden seemed completely unafraid of dying, as he believed dying fighting

00:05:57.894 --> 00:06:03.362
in this holy war would be a surefire route to heaven, even telling his followers

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:09.674
that one day in Afghanistan was like 1,000 days of praying in an ordinary mosque.

00:06:10.794 --> 00:06:15.574
And in Afghanistan, bin Laden and the mujahideen were far from the

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:19.504
only people who wanted the Soviets defeated and out of the country.

00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:25.344
The other powerful force that was fighting the Soviets, albeit indirectly,

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:29.634
was the one that would become bin Laden’s next target, the United States.

00:06:30.954 --> 00:06:35.764
The CIA, the American intelligence agency, provided billions of

00:06:35.764 --> 00:06:39.854
dollars of weapons and aid to the resistance fighters in Afghanistan.

00:06:40.924 --> 00:06:45.974
This, remember, was just one of the many proxy wars in the Cold War,

00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:50.184
with the United States supporting whoever was fighting the Soviets.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:57.014
Some people have claimed that the CIA actually provided Osama bin Laden and the so-called

00:06:57.014 --> 00:07:03.674
mujahadeen, the freedom fighters, with cash and weapons directly, although this has been disputed.

00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:10.344
In any case, Afghanistan lived up to its nickname as being the “graveyard

00:07:10.374 --> 00:07:15.814
of empires”, and in February of 1989, Soviet forces had left the country.

00:07:16.964 --> 00:07:20.734
Later that year, the Berlin Wall fell, and within two

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:23.894
years the entire Soviet Union would have collapsed.

00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:28.594
But at the same time, another conflict was brewing.

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:34.684
And while the Soviet-Afghan war might have provided Osama bin Laden with the perfect training

00:07:34.694 --> 00:07:40.064
ground for a life as the head of a global terrorist organisation, and the opportunity

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:45.904
to make his name for himself, the events of 1990 would provide him with the reason.

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:53.134
And that reason would come on August 2nd of 1990, when Sadam Hussein’s

00:07:53.154 --> 00:07:58.454
Iraqi forces rolled into Iraq’s tiny but oil-rich neighbour, Kuwait.

00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:04.194
Within a couple of days, Kuwait had fallen, and Sadam

00:08:04.194 --> 00:08:08.274
Hussein declared that Kuwait was the 19th province of Iraq.

00:08:09.774 --> 00:08:16.554
Now, as a quick reminder of Middle Eastern geography, Iraq is directly north of Saudi Arabia,

00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:23.224
and Kuwait is located to the southeast of Iraq, sandwiched between Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

00:08:24.134 --> 00:08:28.913
So, Kuwait was taken, and there was the very real fear that Sadam

00:08:28.913 --> 00:08:33.003
Hussein might direct his forces south and take Saudi Arabia.

00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:40.393
Osama bin Laden offered his services to the Saudi rulers, the House of Saud, promising that

00:08:40.393 --> 00:08:45.683
his soldiers and money could help defend Saudi Arabia in the event of an Iraqi invasion.

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:51.833
By this time, Osama bin Laden had made quite a reputation as a fearless

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:56.313
fighter, and had developed a strong reputation and network in the area.

00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.663
But the Saudis refused.

00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:05.595
Instead, they allowed American forces to use Saudi Arabia as a launchpad

00:09:05.703 --> 00:09:09.893
for an invasion of Kuwait, in what would be called the First Gulf War.

00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:15.283
This incensed Osama bin Laden, it drove him mad.

00:09:16.053 --> 00:09:21.833
And the reason for it, according to commentators, has little to do with the belief that the

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:28.463
United States is inferior or that Western culture is incompatible with Islam, it actually

00:09:28.463 --> 00:09:34.413
comes from his belief that there should only be one religion in Saudi Arabia, Islam.

00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:39.913
Bin Laden would later teach his followers that the Prophet Mohammed, on his

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:44.403
deathbed, said that there should only ever be one religion in Saudi Arabia.

00:09:45.373 --> 00:09:50.173
By allowing Western troops into Saudi Arabia, no matter whether the intentions

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:55.613
were to fight Sadam Hussein, and defend Saudi Arabia, this was going directly

00:09:55.633 --> 00:10:00.123
against the wishes of the prophet, at least in Osama bin Laden’s interpretation.

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:08.733
So, Osama bin Laden set out on his lifelong mission to get US troops out of the Middle East.

00:10:09.873 --> 00:10:16.363
On this mission, it’s hard to argue that he succeeded, as there is no individual in history

00:10:16.663 --> 00:10:21.443
who has done more to increase the Western presence in the Middle East than Osama bin Laden.

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.626
We’ll come on to discuss this more in a minute.

00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:28.256
So, what did this mean in practice?

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:34.936
It meant the build up of the group Al Qaeda, the group that had grown out of the Soviet-Afghan war.

00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:42.286
From 1992 to 1996, Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda were based

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:46.126
in Sudan, after the Islamist coup d’état in the country.

00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:51.466
He had been forced to leave Saudi Arabia after criticising the regime,

00:10:51.606 --> 00:10:56.692
and his Saudi passport and citizenship were taken away in 1994.

00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:02.740
Although one could perhaps trace his path to global terrorism back to when

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:08.408
he was a much younger man, it was in the 1990s, when he was in his mid 30s,

00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:14.238
when he made the transition from regional nuisance to global terrorist threat.

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:21.898
Al Qaeda, the terrorist group he was head of, continued to grow, and with it, the attacks.

00:11:22.918 --> 00:11:25.978
The first attack that he is believed to have been involved

00:11:25.978 --> 00:11:30.341
with came in 1992, in  Aden, the capital of Yemen.

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:37.731
But it wouldn’t be until 1998, with the twin bombings of the US embassies in Dar es Salaam

00:11:37.841 --> 00:11:45.871
and Nairobi, that his face became known the world over, and in June of 1999 the FBI would

00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:52.381
decide that he was such a threat that his name would be put on its list of Ten Most Wanted.

00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:57.671
As you might imagine, he was never removed from this list alive.

00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:00.251
So, back to our story.

00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:05.651
Osama bin Laden is now one of the world’s most wanted men, and has had to move

00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:11.131
out of Sudan, now to Afghanistan, the one country that will actually take him.

00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:17.591
He is head of a terrorist group that has carried out attacks across Africa and the Middle East.

00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:23.491
We know this for sure, but what was not clear to everyone was “why”.

00:12:25.021 --> 00:12:30.141
The simplistic answer that was plastered all over American cable TV was that

00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:34.761
he hated American freedoms, but it was slightly more complicated than that.

00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:42.511
The rare pieces of evidence that we have of Osama bin Laden suggest a man fixated

00:12:42.711 --> 00:12:48.841
on one thing, one goal: removing the Western military presence from the Middle East.

00:12:49.881 --> 00:12:53.641
He even said this in an interview with CNN, perhaps the

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:58.007
most famous American news network, which took place in 1997.

00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:04.201
Perhaps ominously, when asked “what are your future plans”, he responded

00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:07.861
“you’ll see them and hear about them in the media, god willing”.

00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:16.351
Four years later, on September 11th of 2001, the world saw the culmination of his plan, as

00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:21.971
two planes struck the World Trade Center in New York, and another crashed into the Pentagon.

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:28.031
2,977 people in total were killed, making Osama bin

00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:31.711
Laden responsible for the deadliest attack on US soil.

00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:38.951
The objective, let’s remember, was to push the United States out of the Middle East,

00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:43.761
to frighten the United States government into removing its troops from Saudi Arabia.

00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:50.451
Osama bin Laden thought there would be widespread opposition to entering a

00:13:50.451 --> 00:13:55.181
foreign conflict, and he remembered the public opposition to the war in Vietnam.

00:13:56.351 --> 00:14:00.311
Although Osama bin Laden was clearly an intelligent man

00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:04.901
in many ways, this was a huge miscalculation on his part.

00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:12.714
Not only did the 9/11 attacks result in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan and subsequent

00:14:12.944 --> 00:14:17.364
20-year occupation of the country, which had strong domestic support initially,

00:14:17.364 --> 00:14:22.504
let's remember, but they also made him the highest profile criminal in the world.

00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:29.964
There was a $25 million bounty placed on his head, a reward for his capture,

00:14:30.294 --> 00:14:35.354
and soon it became incredibly hard for him to control his group’s activities.

00:14:36.504 --> 00:14:42.264
For obvious reasons, it’s hard to know exactly what he was doing and where he was in the

00:14:42.264 --> 00:14:47.584
period immediately after the 9/11 attacks - we are talking about the world’s most wanted man

00:14:47.584 --> 00:14:53.404
here - but American intelligence services believe that he spent most of the following years

00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:59.764
moving from safehouse to safehouse in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

00:15:01.224 --> 00:15:06.920
Now, you probably know how this story ends, or rather, how the life of Osama Bin Laden ends.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:16.470
The United States did manage to track him down, to find him, and on May 2nd of 2011, just

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:22.210
after one o’ clock in the morning, a helicopter with an elite team of US forces descended

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:29.140
on a compound in Abbottabad, in Pakistan, where they found, shot and killed Osama bin Laden.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.510
This much you probably know already, but what is more interesting

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.420
to dwell on, to talk about, is what was discovered during the raid.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.330
In the compound where bin Laden was hiding, the US forces discovered a treasure trove

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:53.660
of information, hard drives containing 470,000 different files that give us some

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:59.880
indication of what bin Laden had been doing, and help us to understand bin Laden the man.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.140
So, what do they tell us?

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:09.660
Firstly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, given how wanted he was, he was

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.860
incredibly cut off from Al Qaeda, the group he was nominally in charge of.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:21.690
He had no internet or telephone line, and was only able to communicate with people via letters.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.091
And clearly, if you’re trying to run what is essentially a multinational

00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:31.481
21st century business, this makes communication very difficult.

00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:37.111
Secondly, and despite how difficult it was to communicate

00:16:37.111 --> 00:16:41.302
with the outside world, he was a serious micromanager.

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:45.491
He obsessed over details, and would leave nothing up to chance.

00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:52.551
He would send letters to trusted associates, but these would be handwritten, then scanned and

00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:58.641
put onto an encrypted flash drive and taken, physically, to whoever needed to receive them.

00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:05.275
Thirdly, and this is in stark contrast to many portrayals of

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:09.735
him, he did seem to put great trust in his wives and daughters.

00:17:10.515 --> 00:17:13.805
He is thought to have married five times, and at the

00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:17.345
time of his death he was found with three of his wives.

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:26.465
These three were all highly intelligent women, all with PhDs, doctorate qualifications, and the

00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:33.197
files found at his house show that he turned to them for advice on a wide variety of matters.

00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:36.135
And it was a similar case with his daughters.

00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:41.725
The fourth thing, which is related to the third point actually, because it was

00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:46.675
a frequent topic of conversation between him and his wives, is how troubled he

00:17:46.675 --> 00:17:52.810
was by the Arab Spring, the revolutions in the Arab world that started in 2010.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.500
Now, why was he disturbed by this, you might ask?

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.710
You might have thought that it presented an opportunity, as

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.690
corrupt rulers were being toppled, were being overturned.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.240
Indeed, bin Laden did write that the chaos could present

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.340
an opportunity for Al Qaeda thoughts and ideas to spread.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:21.260
But, more importantly, it seemed that he wasn’t sure where the Arab Spring left Al Qaeda.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:28.710
If Western-backed regimes could be toppled peacefully, or at least relatively peacefully

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:34.700
compared to bombings and the deaths of Muslim civilians, then what was the role of Al Qaeda?

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.660
Where did it fit in?

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.490
He was also concerned that instability in the region would mean that US forces

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.090
would move in, which was exactly the thing that he had always fought against.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.920
Clearly, he had reason to be fearful.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:59.680
The United States has left Afghanistan, but there are still reported to be between 45,000 and 65,000

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:05.590
American troops in the Middle East, split between Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.370
Of course, it’s perfectly acceptable to debate whether these troops

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.030
should be there, but the reality is that bin Laden thought that attacking

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.640
the US would get them out, and in fact it did exactly the opposite.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.820
And his legacy is, well, it’s complicated of course.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.630
On the one hand Al Qaeda is thankfully now significantly weakened, although

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.380
there are some commentators who suggest a newly Taliban-controlled Afghanistan

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.640
will give it more breathing room, and allow it to build up strength.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:47.130
On the other hand, he became the poster boy for Islamic terrorism, a hero

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.700
and icon, someone whose name attacks could be carried out on behalf of.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:59.800
When he was killed, although his body was quickly disposed of at sea, he became a martyr

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:06.100
for jihadists, someone who gave up his huge family riches and wealth in his “holy quest”.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.670
Let's be clear though, he was a violent terrorist, someone who was not

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.890
afraid of killing men, women and children, muslims and non-muslims alike.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.970
There is no excusing or denying that, and one must underline that he

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:26.060
was directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, and

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.620
indirectly perhaps responsible for hundreds or thousands times more.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:37.820
But to portray him as merely a simple cave-dwelling Western-hating terrorist is

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:43.050
to somewhat miss the point, and to only scrape the surface of the complicated

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:48.000
ideology and legacy of Osama bin Laden, the world’s most wanted man.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.650
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Osama bin Laden.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.180
I hope it's been an interesting one, and even though I’m sure you

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.160
knew a bit about him before, that you've learnt something new.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.430
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.556
Do you remember where you were when you first found out about Osama bin Laden?

00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:13.877
What do you think his medium and long term legacy will be?

00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:19.427
How do you think historians will look back on his impact on stability in the Middle East?

00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:23.037
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:17.011
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:21.381
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:28.581
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Magical Legacy of Harry Potter.

00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:36.021
This is a follow-up to our last episode where we looked at JK Rowling’s battle to publish the books,

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:42.031
so if you want to press pause and go and listen to that one first, then I’d recommend doing so.

00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:47.081
In this episode we’re going to talk about how and why Harry Potter

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:51.321
changed the world, and look at the legacy that the books, and its

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:56.111
author, have left on children’s publishing, fan culture, and on Britain.

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.171
OK then, let’s jump right into it.

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:06.541
The first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter & The Philosopher’s Stone, was

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:13.401
published 25 years ago this year, on June 26th of 1997 to be precise.

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:20.991
It’s no exaggeration to say that the world is a different place for it, and I think you’d be

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:26.961
hard pressed to deny that the world is a better place thanks to JK Rowling and Harry Potter.

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:32.741
Right, let’s start with the impact it has had on the world of children’s publishing.

00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:41.001
As you’ll remember from the last episode, JK Rowling had to fight hard to find a publisher for the

00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:47.801
first Harry Potter book, and was rejected by 12 publishers before finding one that accepted it.

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:52.261
The book was very different from other children’s books.

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:58.161
It was long, it was full of lots of detail, it was too dark for children, it was set in a

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:04.211
boarding school, which is a type of school that only a tiny proportion of British children go to.

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:10.081
Put simply, the adults in charge of choosing which children’s books to publish

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:14.661
thought it wouldn’t appeal to children, they thought children wouldn't like it.

00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:21.951
This all changed after an actual child, an 8-year-old daughter of one of the publishers,

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:27.701
read some of it, and reported back to her father that the book was wonderful.

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:31.771
Of course, lots and lots of children do love it.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:37.661
They loved it when it first came out, and the appeal of Harry Potter hasn’t died out.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.521
25 years after the first one was published, the Harry Potter books are

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:49.141
still among the top sellers for its publishing house, Bloomsbury, and in

00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:56.221
2021 sales of the Harry Potter books actually jumped 7%, they went up 7%.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.791
If you’ve read the Harry Potter books, you’ll know that they are timeless, the magical

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:10.221
world is one that a 10-year-old in 2022 can be as captivated by as a 10-year-old in 1997.

00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:16.421
Looking at the legacy of the books, the impact that the books had on

00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:20.731
children’s publishing was unprecedented - it had never happened before.

00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:27.551
The books showed publishers that children’s literature wasn’t an afterthought, it wasn’t something

00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:33.961
that was basic, banal, and would always be less profitable and interesting than adult literature.

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:39.631
The fact that Harry Potter was complicated, it was long, it was full of detail

00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:44.551
and intricate descriptions, this showed publishers that children wouldn’t

00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:49.841
necessarily be put off, they wouldn’t be discouraged, by this level of detail.

00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.951
Indeed, they loved it.

00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.731
As such, publishers were more willing to publish longer and more detailed

00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:02.291
children’s books, blurring the lines between what is a children’s book and

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:08.582
what’s an adult book, and ultimately giving children better options for fiction.

00:04:09.472 --> 00:04:13.432
The result of this has been, perhaps unsurprisingly, that

00:04:13.442 --> 00:04:17.092
Harry Potter has been excellent news for children’s literacy.

00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:22.602
Even after the films came out, meaning that children didn’t necessarily need

00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:27.172
to read the books to engage with the story, there have been numerous studies

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:32.282
suggesting that it has had positive effects on both the amount of children

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:36.282
that read for pleasure, and the amount of reading that they were doing.

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:40.572
In other words, the books got more children reading.

00:04:41.222 --> 00:04:45.072
As kids started talking about Harry Potter in the playground

00:04:45.072 --> 00:04:48.842
or after a school holiday, other kids wanted to read it.

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:56.712
And for many kids, at over 600 pages, the last Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly

00:04:56.712 --> 00:05:02.492
Hallows would have been the longest book they would ever have read, and shown that actually

00:05:02.532 --> 00:05:08.872
yes, reading can be a huge amount of fun and long books don’t have to be intimidating.

00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:14.412
Perhaps it is too much to say that Harry Potter gave birth to a new,

00:05:14.612 --> 00:05:20.152
reinvigorated generation of young readers, but it certainly was the gateway

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:24.392
to reading that many might not have had, had it not been for JK Rowling.

00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:32.462
Secondly, in terms of the cultural impact of Harry Potter, it brought “fan culture” mainstream.

00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:38.492
If you are from somewhere like Korea or Japan, or you’ve spent much time

00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:42.792
in these countries, you will know that there is quite a mainstream culture

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:48.602
of fandom, of people being obsessed with fantasy games and literature.

00:05:49.412 --> 00:05:54.192
Until Harry Potter, in much of the US and in the UK

00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:57.872
at least, this was a relatively marginalised thing.

00:05:58.522 --> 00:06:03.482
Sure, kids might dress up as Star Wars or Star Trek characters,

00:06:03.702 --> 00:06:08.752
but certainly for teenagers it was quite an outsider thing to do.

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:14.162
Kids might be teased by their classmates as being geeky, or

00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:17.982
weird for being so obsessed with these fictional characters.

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:24.592
Harry Potter, and the way it was published sequentially, in order, opened

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:30.102
the doors for this type of fan culture to become accepted and mainstream.

00:06:31.072 --> 00:06:34.642
As a reminder, the Harry Potter books were published over a

00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:39.102
period of 10 years, with one coming out every one or two years.

00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:44.002
The first was published in 1997, and the last, Harry

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:47.492
Potter and the Deathly Hallows, published in 2007.

00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:52.542
There were midnight release parties when the next book would be released.

00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:57.482
Kids would queue up with their parents outside the bookshop, eager to

00:06:57.482 --> 00:07:02.432
pick up a copy of the latest book, run home and read it as quickly as

00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:07.272
possible and find out where fortune would lead this young wizard next.

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:13.912
Many people, and I would include myself in this category, as I was 10 when the first

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:20.252
Harry Potter came out, many people grew up with the books, and grew up with Harry.

00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:26.312
Although the story of Harry Potter is, of course, set in a completely different and

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:32.912
magical world, the emotions that Harry feels, and the struggles he goes through to

00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:38.722
find his place in the world are ones that children all over the world could relate to.

00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:46.332
Friendships, love, rivalries, disappointment, joy, these are all deeply human things

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:51.982
that kids around the world were experiencing at the same time as their magical hero.

00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:59.582
Not only that, but the series also notably touches on real-world issues like prejudice

00:07:59.622 --> 00:08:05.602
and inequality, introducing kids to subjects that they might not have encountered before.

00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:11.402
Even in the wizarding world not all witches and wizards are treated equally;

00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:17.332
those with non-magical relations, for example, are called ‘mudbloods’ — which,

00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:22.522
in the books, is treated as something like a slur, a nasty word for something.

00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:29.402
As the Harry Potter books continued to have a more and more profound impact on culture.

00:08:30.024 --> 00:08:37.191
Inevitably a brighter spotlight started to shine on the woman who created the story, JK Rowling.

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:43.966
Even really by the time the second book was published, JK Rowling had become a celebrity.

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:48.926
And by the time the last book was out, she was a multi-millionaire

00:08:48.936 --> 00:08:52.706
and probably the most famous living author in the world.

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:57.406
This fame and success didn’t sit well with her.

00:08:57.656 --> 00:09:01.963
She didn’t seem to like it, and was much more comfortable away from the

00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:06.773
cameras and crowds than attending awards ceremonies or giving interviews.

00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:13.573
As with any successful work of fiction, whether that’s a book, a film, or even a

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:19.093
song, people want to know about the process of creating it, and they also want to

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:23.943
know things that might not have been revealed in the book, or have been obvious.

00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:27.103
Why did Harry make certain choices?

00:09:27.273 --> 00:09:29.753
What did characters truly believe?

00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:33.993
When JK Rowling revealed her answers to some of these

00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:37.633
questions, they weren’t always well received by the public.

00:09:38.383 --> 00:09:43.513
For example, after the final book in the series had been released, she revealed

00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:49.053
that the character Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, was gay.

00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:54.533
While many people felt this was something to celebrate, providing

00:09:54.673 --> 00:09:59.623
much-needed representation in the literary world, others criticised the

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:03.893
fact that Rowling never included this information in the books themselves.

00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:08.073
Similarly, you may have heard that she has got into trouble

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:13.013
recently for a perceived lack of sympathy for the trans community.

00:10:13.673 --> 00:10:18.453
Long story short, she tweeted in support of a university lecturer

00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:23.533
who was sacked for her gender-critical views, writing that people

00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:27.553
shouldn’t be forced out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:34.913
Now, this tweet was perceived by many trans groups as endorsing transphobia,

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:40.863
and there has been something of a backlash against JK Rowling in certain corners

00:10:40.863 --> 00:10:46.393
of the internet, even culminating in Vladimir Putin comparing the treatment of

00:10:46.393 --> 00:10:51.543
Russia after the invasion of Ukraine to Rowling’s treatment after her comments.

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:58.673
For someone who appears to despise fame and prefer life out of the limelight you can

00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:03.953
imagine it must have been quite the shock to find yourself being compared to Vladimir

00:11:03.953 --> 00:11:10.593
Putin, and of course JK Rowling publicly rejected the comparison shortly after it was made.

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:15.183
Now, let’s just pause and take stock for a minute.

00:11:15.803 --> 00:11:20.383
We’ve talked about the impact that the book had on the world of children’s publishing,

00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:25.473
in encouraging children to read because the stories were just so captivating.

00:11:25.943 --> 00:11:29.763
We’ve talked about the impact that the books have had on fan culture,

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:34.493
and on normalising being obsessed with magic and fantasy worlds.

00:11:35.243 --> 00:11:41.023
We’ve also talked about how this legacy has been affected, to a certain degree, by what the

00:11:41.053 --> 00:11:46.963
creator of this magic world has made publicly known, through her revelation that Dumbledore

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:53.173
was gay and her comments that were considered to be offensive and unsupportive to trans people.

00:11:53.993 --> 00:11:58.573
Evidently, when you sell over half a billion books, and there are literally

00:11:58.753 --> 00:12:04.003
university courses on your books, it’s inevitable that you won’t please everyone.

00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:09.563
Critics of JK Rowling say that the fame has gone to her head - that the more

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:14.373
she talks about Harry Potter, the more she drags the story through the mud,

00:12:14.493 --> 00:12:19.340
and that the best thing she can do for Harry Potter is to keep quiet about it.

00:12:20.353 --> 00:12:25.753
Indeed, the actor who played Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe, said, “If you found

00:12:25.783 --> 00:12:30.933
anything in these stories that resonated with you and helped you at any time in

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:36.383
your life — then that is between you and the book that you read, and it is sacred."

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:43.063
One final important legacy of Harry Potter, and this is particularly true for

00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:48.793
the film adaptations, is on the impact that it had on Britain’s soft power.

00:12:49.983 --> 00:12:54.873
After the success of the books, JK Rowling had huge Hollywood studios

00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:59.093
offering to pay her vast amounts of money for the rights to the films.

00:13:00.173 --> 00:13:04.113
While some authors would have gladly accepted these fat

00:13:04.173 --> 00:13:08.733
cheques and handed over creative control, JK Rowling didn’t.

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:13.103
She was worried that Harry Potter would be Americanised, with

00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:17.913
American actors, and adapted to suit American cultural norms.

00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:21.813
In short, she was worried that the story would be turned

00:13:21.823 --> 00:13:24.773
into something very different to how she imagined it.

00:13:25.913 --> 00:13:31.173
Her conditions for the movie versions were that she would have tight control over the

00:13:31.183 --> 00:13:36.743
script, and that they would all be filmed in Britain with British or Irish actors.

00:13:37.913 --> 00:13:40.813
And the impact of this was huge.

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:44.933
There were no American actors allowed, meaning that one of the most

00:13:44.943 --> 00:13:50.803
successful film franchises in the 21st century was a uniquely British affair.

00:13:52.023 --> 00:13:54.633
The hundreds of millions of people who have seen the

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:58.633
films have watched a very British take on a fantasy world.

00:13:59.363 --> 00:14:03.163
This is thought to have brought in countless millions of pounds as

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:08.323
tourists flock to Britain, in part to have a sense of this mysterious

00:14:08.323 --> 00:14:12.183
world they have seen in the films or read about in the books.

00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:18.563
And on a purely economic level the fact that these hugely successful films

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:23.733
were made in the UK proved to many across the pond, in the United States,

00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:27.573
that you don’t need to be in Hollywood to make a Hollywood blockbuster.

00:14:28.383 --> 00:14:33.803
Now, to end this exploration of the magical world of Harry Potter, I wanted to share some

00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:39.203
fun and interesting facts about the books and films that you may not have been aware of.

00:14:39.883 --> 00:14:43.283
For example, did you know that the film production team

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:47.523
spent months training the Hogwarts owls to carry letters?

00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:54.473
Or that Rupert Grint, the actor cast as Ron Weasley, performed a rap for his audition?

00:14:55.743 --> 00:14:59.583
On a linguistic level, the translators had quite a job

00:14:59.603 --> 00:15:03.283
ahead of them when it came to internationalising the books.

00:15:03.923 --> 00:15:10.418
You might remember the Master of Potions, who in the English version is called Severus Snape.

00:15:10.973 --> 00:15:16.193
In French he’s called Severus Rogue, meaning proud or haughty.

00:15:16.903 --> 00:15:24.473
Similarly, in Italian he becomes Severus Piton, which sounds more like “python”, a snake.

00:15:25.413 --> 00:15:29.453
And the book didn’t only need to be translated from English to other

00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:34.583
languages, it needed to be translated from British English to American English.

00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:41.553
The title of the original version was “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”, but when

00:15:41.563 --> 00:15:47.593
it was published in the United States the publisher thought that “philosopher” wouldn’t be so

00:15:47.773 --> 00:15:54.503
compelling to American children, so changed it to “Sorcerer”, which is another word for a magician.

00:15:55.213 --> 00:15:58.763
If you ask me, it’s a much worse title, but I am

00:15:58.793 --> 00:16:01.823
approaching this from the point of view of British English.

00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:07.543
The final thing I would like to say is that I think Harry Potter is a great choice

00:16:07.543 --> 00:16:12.783
to read for intermediate and above English learners, so for someone like you.

00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:17.453
It doesn’t matter whether you have read it before in your own language or not.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:22.963
Pick up a copy in English, perhaps even on a Kindle so you can easily

00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:27.523
look up harder words, and jump into this magical English world.

00:16:28.323 --> 00:16:31.463
Sure, there will be pointless magical words that you

00:16:31.463 --> 00:16:34.533
might not understand, but that’s all part of the fun.

00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:40.133
At the end of the day, it’s hard to deny the impact of Harry Potter.

00:16:40.563 --> 00:16:45.573
With over 500 million copies sold of the books, countless millions of

00:16:45.573 --> 00:16:50.663
young minds being inspired, and billions of hours of fun coming from

00:16:50.663 --> 00:16:56.397
the imagination of one young woman, it’s a truly magical legacy indeed.

00:16:58.237 --> 00:17:04.837
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Magical Legacy of Harry Potter, and with that

00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:10.897
comes the end of this little exploration of the writing and legacy of the Harry Potter books.

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:14.867
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:15.357 --> 00:17:20.727
If you have read the Harry Potter series, how do you think it affected you, and in what way?

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:24.707
If you haven’t read it, or if you have read it and thought it

00:17:24.707 --> 00:17:28.487
wasn’t very good, what was it about it that didn’t get you excited?

00:17:29.057 --> 00:17:32.937
And, given that you may have read a non-English version, are

00:17:32.987 --> 00:17:36.437
there any amazing translations of the names in your language?

00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:39.517
And if you have read it in English, did you enjoy it?

00:17:40.337 --> 00:17:43.837
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

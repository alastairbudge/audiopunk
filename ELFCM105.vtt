Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:15.482
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:19.972
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:27.672
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about coffee, a drink that hundreds

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:32.992
of millions of people drink every day, and that you might even be enjoying right now.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:38.472
We’ll talk about where coffee comes from, how it started getting popular,

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:43.412
and follow its journey to where it is today, one of the world’s most popular

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:48.302
drinks, and the second most valuable commodity in the world, behind oil.

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:54.942
So, feel free to press pause and make yourself a cup, if you don’t have one in front of you already.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:59.372
Otherwise, let’s get started, and talk about coffee.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.862
Let’s start with some statistics, because you know that coffee

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:08.082
is popular, but you might not know just quite how popular it is.

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:15.632
Every day around 2.25 billion cups of coffee are drunk, which is over

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:20.482
a million and a half every minute, and 30 thousand every single second.

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:28.472
It’s the third most popular drink in the world, after bottled water and tea, and were it not for

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:33.842
the amount of tea drunk in China and India, it would be the world’s second most popular drink.

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:37.722
So, it’s very popular, but you knew this already.

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:44.702
What you might not know is the story of where it came from, and how it came to be so popular.

00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:49.032
The story of the discovery of coffee is, like the

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:52.512
discovery of many things we now take for granted, debated.

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:58.072
We’ll probably never know for sure exactly how and when it

00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:02.062
was first discovered, but here are some of the main theories.

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:11.372
They all have a similar theme - someone either eats a coffee bean, or roasts and boils one, feels

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:16.752
the effect of the caffeine on the body, gets very excited and the rest is history, as they say.

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:24.792
The first theory involves an Ethiopian goat herder, a goat farmer, a man called Kaldi.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:30.352
In the 9th century he noticed that his goats were eating

00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:34.462
these bright red berries from a tree he hadn’t noticed before.

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:41.542
The goats became very energetic and overexcited, so Kaldi thought, that’s strange.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:46.162
He went and told the monks at a local monastery.

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:50.642
They went to collect the beans, roasted them and boiled them

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:54.972
in water, and ta-da, that was the first ever cup of coffee.

00:02:56.212 --> 00:03:01.412
The monks drank this drink and found that it kept them awake during

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:04.952
the night, when they were praying, and it quickly took off from there.

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:14.052
Another story involves a Morrocan mystic, a wise man, and is a similar idea, apart from

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:20.862
you swap the goats for birds, and this mystic just decides to try the berries himself.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:27.702
There’s even a story that the Prophet Mohammed was feeling ill one day and the angel

00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:32.862
Gabriel gave him a black potion, a black drink, and he immediately felt better.

00:03:33.732 --> 00:03:39.202
Indeed, he didn’t just have a little rush and feel a little bit better, he felt so good that

00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:45.992
that very same day he fought forty knights on horses and he then had sex with forty virgins.

00:03:46.882 --> 00:03:51.912
While these stories might all be apocryphal, they might not be completely

00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:58.692
true, coffee was certainly discovered in or around the Arabian peninsula - some

00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:03.302
people say Yemen, but if you ask an Eithiopean they would say Ethiopia.

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:09.362
By the 15th century it was being grown in large parts of the Arabian peninsula.

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:16.732
It was taken up to Egypt, to Persia, and Syria and Turkey, and there was a growing culture

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:23.322
of coffee houses, where men would go to drink coffee, socialise, and listen to music.

00:04:24.112 --> 00:04:29.752
Given the annual pilgrimages that muslims would make to Mecca, which was a centre

00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:34.422
of coffee consumption, knowledge of this wonderful drink started to spread.

00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:41.152
It was called, and no doubt I'm going to mispronounce this, but qahwah in Arabic.

00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:46.722
This word is thought to come from the word for ‘to lack hunger’, which

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:50.702
sounds quite sensible, given that this is one of the effects of caffeine.

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:56.872
From the word qahwah in Arabic came the word kahve in Turkish, then

00:04:56.952 --> 00:05:01.622
koffie in Dutch, and that’s where our word ‘coffee’ comes from in English.

00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:06.582
To the Arabic speaking, the Turkish speaking and the Dutch

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:10.092
speaking listeners, apologies if I've mispronounced those words.

00:05:11.302 --> 00:05:17.702
Coffee drinking, and what I guess we can call coffee culture started to grow in the Middle East,

00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:24.612
but it wasn’t until the 16th century that coffee really started its journey of global domination.

00:05:25.812 --> 00:05:28.722
The Ottomans had conquered large parts of the Arabian

00:05:28.722 --> 00:05:33.012
peninsula, and coffee had become a staple of Ottoman culture.

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:38.522
It was a social drink, and the fact that it wasn’t alcoholic meant

00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:42.582
that its consumption could be promoted, even by religious leaders.

00:05:43.362 --> 00:05:47.342
As the Ottomans started to trade with Europe, this wonderful

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:50.622
bean was an obvious thing to sell to the Europeans.

00:05:51.782 --> 00:05:56.272
However the very first arrival of coffee in Europe wasn’t actually

00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:01.762
believed to have come from Ottoman traders, but actually Ottoman prisoners.

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:08.992
In the year 1565 the Ottomans tried to attack the small island of Malta,

00:06:09.472 --> 00:06:14.152
which was then the home of the Knights of St John, a religious order.

00:06:15.402 --> 00:06:21.442
They failed to capture it, and the Turks that didn’t manage to escape were taken prisoner.

00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:27.682
The knights of Malta noticed that these prisoners were preparing a particular

00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:33.612
drink by mixing this dark powder together with sugar and water, and they

00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:38.352
thought, well that looks interesting, and decided to try it for themselves.

00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:44.582
Indeed, even today Maltese traditional coffee is very similar

00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:48.872
to the Turkish style, and has different spices added to it.

00:06:50.052 --> 00:06:56.252
Coffee might have first arrived in Malta, but its proper arrival to Europe came when

00:06:56.302 --> 00:07:03.942
Ottoman traders took it to the great trading port of Venice, in Italy, around the year 1615.

00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:10.892
The Venetians weren’t immediately sure what to make of this drink, and were suspicious

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:17.022
of its effect, even calling it the ‘bitter invention of Satan’, of the devil.

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:21.942
There was huge debate about whether this drink should be allowed,

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:26.732
and so it was taken to the pope, Clement the Eighth to decide.

00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:31.192
He said that he wouldn't be able to make a decision about

00:07:31.192 --> 00:07:35.342
the fate of coffee if he hadn’t tasted it himself firsthand.

00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:41.622
This seems a little bit of a strange thing for a pope to do, if you ask me, but Pope Clement

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:47.602
VIII decided that he needed to taste this bitter invention of Satan to see for himself.

00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:54.422
He took a sip of this new, black concoction, and decided he liked it.

00:07:55.232 --> 00:08:00.946
Coffee was ok, it wasn’t an invention of Satan, and he gave it his papal blessing.

00:08:02.436 --> 00:08:06.686
Indeed, he reportedly declared ‘this devil’s drink is

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:10.696
so delicious we should cheat the devil by baptising it’.

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:18.036
Initially it was actually used mainly for medicinal purposes, for curing all

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:24.256
manner of different sicknesses, and was mainly sold by apothecaries, by chemists.

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:29.376
Coffee started to flow further north into Europe, and this

00:08:29.636 --> 00:08:34.156
spawned, this created, the culture of the European coffee house.

00:08:34.786 --> 00:08:38.836
Coffee houses sprung up over the great cities of Europe.

00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:42.606
They weren’t just places to drink coffee, but to

00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:46.986
exchange ideas, to discuss philosophy, and to learn.

00:08:48.346 --> 00:08:52.506
Indeed, in Britain they were even given the nickname of ‘penny

00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:56.816
universities’, because for the cost of 1 penny, which was the cost of

00:08:56.816 --> 00:09:01.546
the cup of coffee, you could go and learn from some of the great minds.

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:06.946
These coffee houses would normally have a long table, so you would

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:12.026
go in, pay your 1 penny, and sit and discuss ideas with strangers.

00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:19.506
It’s probably no coincidence that the Enlightenment overlapped with the boom in coffee houses.

00:09:20.256 --> 00:09:24.846
The coffee house provided a public place for people to discuss

00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:29.366
ideas; beforehand this didn’t really exist in the same way.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:35.466
Coffee became the ‘go-to’ drink both for the morning, and for business.

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:44.076
Previously people drank beer in the morning, and would go to taverns, to pubs, to conduct business.

00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:49.456
The invention of the coffee house meant that you could drink coffee

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:53.626
in the morning at the start of the working day, and also go back to

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:57.876
the coffeehouse to meet with other merchants or business contacts.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:02.846
So it’s no surprise that people became a lot more productive.

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:09.676
I guess if you used to drink a few pints of beer to start the day, then drink beer throughout

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:15.386
the day you’d probably feel a bit more productive if you switched the beer to coffee.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:22.166
Coffee was brought to North America by the British in the mid 17th century, but

00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:27.036
it was still produced thousands of kilometres away, in the Arabian peninsula.

00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:30.266
This made it prohibitively expensive.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:37.496
Then, in the year 1723 a young French officer took the first little coffee

00:10:37.496 --> 00:10:42.786
plant from Paris all the way to Martinique, in the Caribbean, and it’s

00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:48.066
from this little plant that 18 million coffee trees grew in Martinique.

00:10:49.234 --> 00:10:53.124
Coffee plants were transported to the other French colonies in the

00:10:53.124 --> 00:10:58.154
Caribbean, and French Guiana became a hub for coffee production.

00:10:59.004 --> 00:11:02.554
This berry was becoming so popular, but the French

00:11:02.734 --> 00:11:05.544
didn’t want to share their coffee trees with anyone.

00:11:06.224 --> 00:11:10.914
They knew that if another nearby country got a coffee tree then they

00:11:10.914 --> 00:11:14.984
could then build up a coffee plantation and compete with the French.

00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:20.644
They weren’t to hold their monopoly on coffee production in the Americas for long though.

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:28.114
In 1727 a Brazilian soldier was sent to French Guiana on a mission to get coffee tree

00:11:28.294 --> 00:11:35.044
saplings, baby coffee trees, so he could them take back to Brazil to create coffee plantations.

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:40.504
Obviously the French wouldn’t give them to him, so he needed to get creative.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:46.144
Legend has it that he seduced the wife of the French governor,

00:11:46.524 --> 00:11:50.664
and when he left she gave him a large bouquet of flowers.

00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:56.551
Hidden inside the bouquet was a load of coffee tree seeds, which he took

00:11:56.561 --> 00:12:01.411
back to Brazil, and that was how the coffee industry got started in Brazil.

00:12:02.001 --> 00:12:06.531
Back in North America, coffee was getting more and more popular, and it could

00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:11.061
now be imported from the Caribbean, it didn’t have to be brought all the way

00:12:11.071 --> 00:12:15.721
from the Arabian peninsula, which naturally helped make it more affordable.

00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:21.991
But tea was still the more popular drink until an event that changed

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:26.231
the course of history, at least the course of coffee history, forever.

00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:36.131
In 1773 King George III of Britain passed something called the Tea Act, which gave favourable

00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:43.601
terms to British tea merchants, and required American tea importers to pay heavy taxes.

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:50.101
This caused protests and riots, which you may know as the Boston Tea Party.

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:54.931
After this even drinking tea in America was viewed as

00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:59.951
unpatriotic, and the trajectory of coffee changed forever.

00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:05.701
Coffee production increased dramatically, which was enabled by the

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:11.231
capturing and enslavement of millions of Africans who toiled on these

00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:16.101
plantations so that Americans and Europeans could enjoy their coffee.

00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:23.081
Coffee has a complicated relationship with slavery, in that the early coffee trade was

00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:29.661
enabled by slave labour, and there are often reports of people, and even children, now

00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:34.461
working as modern day slaves on plantations in different coffee-producing countries.

00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:39.991
Of course, the situation now is very different to how it was in the

00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:45.041
mid 19th century, and consumers are becoming more discerning, wanting

00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:49.281
responsibly sourced coffee, but it is still very much an issue.

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:54.841
Today, coffee remains a major export for dozens of countries around the world.

00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:59.581
Brazil, from that bunch of flowers with coffee seeds hidden at the

00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:04.581
bottom, has grown into the world’s biggest coffee producer, exporting $5

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:09.931
billion worth of coffee every year, or almost 16% of the world’s total.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:15.371
It’s down from its lofty heights of producing over 50% of the

00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:19.061
world’s coffee, but it’s still the largest by a long margin.

00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:25.251
And in terms of coffee consumption, of coffee drinking, the countries that

00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:29.821
are top of the list of the world’s most avid coffee drinkers may surprise you.

00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:35.251
It’s not anywhere in the Arabian peninsula, it’s not the Italians or the Brazilians.

00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:40.291
They’re nowhere close, and indeed it might surprise you that coffee

00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:45.671
consumption in coffee-producing countries actually tends to be very low.

00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:51.941
The top of the table is dominated by Northern European countries - the Netherlands,

00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:56.711
Finland, Sweden, and Norway, which obviously can’t produce their own coffee.

00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:02.811
We probably need another whole episode on the production of coffee, and how it

00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:09.011
gets from growing on a tree in Colombia, Brazil, Vietnam, or Ethiopia, to being

00:15:09.011 --> 00:15:14.141
served at your favourite coffee shop, but it’s quite a unique product in that it

00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:20.641
is produced mainly by small farmers, of whom there are around 25 million worldwide.

00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:26.671
Harvesting coffee is a manual process, it can’t be completely done with

00:15:26.921 --> 00:15:31.721
agricultural machinery, and this has meant that coffee farming hasn’t

00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:36.461
been dominated by huge farms in the same way as other crops have.

00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:42.461
So it’s a pretty amazing thing to think that this small bean has become

00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:47.811
the world’s most popular drug, consumed by hundreds of millions of

00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.911
people every day, and providing employment for 25 million small farmers.

00:15:54.071 --> 00:15:59.241
And it all came, perhaps, from a man looking at some overexcited goats.

00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:06.391
OK then, there you go, that is a quick look at the history of coffee, and how

00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:11.681
it went from, potentially, being miraculously discovered by an Ethiopian goat

00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:17.621

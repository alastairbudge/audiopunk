Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:15.482
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:19.972
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:27.672
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about coffee, a drink that hundreds

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:32.992
of millions of people drink every day, and that you might even be enjoying right now.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:38.472
We’ll talk about where coffee comes from, how it started getting popular,

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:43.412
and follow its journey to where it is today, one of the world’s most popular

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:48.302
drinks, and the second most valuable commodity in the world, behind oil.

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:54.942
So, feel free to press pause and make yourself a cup, if you don’t have one in front of you already.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:59.372
Otherwise, let’s get started, and talk about coffee.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.862
Let’s start with some statistics, because you know that coffee

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:08.082
is popular, but you might not know just quite how popular it is.

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:15.632
Every day around 2.25 billion cups of coffee are drunk, which is over

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:20.482
a million and a half every minute, and 30 thousand every single second.

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:28.472
It’s the third most popular drink in the world, after bottled water and tea, and were it not for

00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:33.842
the amount of tea drunk in China and India, it would be the world’s second most popular drink.

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:37.722
So, it’s very popular, but you knew this already.

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:44.702
What you might not know is the story of where it came from, and how it came to be so popular.

00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:49.032
The story of the discovery of coffee is, like the

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:52.512
discovery of many things we now take for granted, debated.

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:58.072
We’ll probably never know for sure exactly how and when it

00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:02.062
was first discovered, but here are some of the main theories.

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:11.372
They all have a similar theme - someone either eats a coffee bean, or roasts and boils one, feels

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:16.752
the effect of the caffeine on the body, gets very excited and the rest is history, as they say.

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:24.792
The first theory involves an Ethiopian goat herder, a goat farmer, a man called Kaldi.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:30.352
In the 9th century he noticed that his goats were eating

00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:34.462
these bright red berries from a tree he hadn’t noticed before.

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:41.542
The goats became very energetic and overexcited, so Kaldi thought, that’s strange.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:46.162
He went and told the monks at a local monastery.

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:50.642
They went to collect the beans, roasted them and boiled them

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:54.972
in water, and ta-da, that was the first ever cup of coffee.

00:02:56.212 --> 00:03:01.412
The monks drank this drink and found that it kept them awake during

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:04.952
the night, when they were praying, and it quickly took off from there.

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:14.052
Another story involves a Morrocan mystic, a wise man, and is a similar idea, apart from

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:20.862
you swap the goats for birds, and this mystic just decides to try the berries himself.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:26.532
While these stories might all be apocryphal, they might not be completely

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:33.312
true, coffee was certainly discovered in or around the Arabian peninsula - some

00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:37.922
people say Yemen, but if you ask an Eithiopean they would say Ethiopia.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:43.982
By the 15th century it was being grown in large parts of the Arabian peninsula.

00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:51.352
It was taken up to Egypt, to Persia, and Syria and Turkey, and there was a growing culture

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:57.942
of coffee houses, where men would go to drink coffee, socialise, and listen to music.

00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:04.372
Given the annual pilgrimages that muslims would make to Mecca, which was a centre

00:04:04.402 --> 00:04:09.042
of coffee consumption, knowledge of this wonderful drink started to spread.

00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:15.772
It was called, and no doubt I'm going to mispronounce this, but qahwah in Arabic.

00:04:16.462 --> 00:04:21.342
This word is thought to come from the word for ‘to lack hunger’, which

00:04:21.372 --> 00:04:25.322
sounds quite sensible, given that this is one of the effects of caffeine.

00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:31.492
From the word qahwah in Arabic came the word kahve in Turkish, then

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:36.242
koffie in Dutch, and that’s where our word ‘coffee’ comes from in English.

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:41.202
To the Arabic speaking, the Turkish speaking and the Dutch

00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:44.712
speaking listeners, apologies if I've mispronounced those words.

00:04:45.922 --> 00:04:52.322
Coffee drinking, and what I guess we can call coffee culture started to grow in the Middle East,

00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:59.232
but it wasn’t until the 16th century that coffee really started its journey of global domination.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:03.342
The Ottomans had conquered large parts of the Arabian

00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:07.632
peninsula, and coffee had become a staple of Ottoman culture.

00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:13.142
It was a social drink, and the fact that it wasn’t alcoholic meant

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:17.202
that its consumption could be promoted, even by religious leaders.

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:21.962
As the Ottomans started to trade with Europe, this wonderful

00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:25.242
bean was an obvious thing to sell to the Europeans.

00:05:26.402 --> 00:05:30.892
However the very first arrival of coffee in Europe wasn’t actually

00:05:30.892 --> 00:05:36.382
believed to have come from Ottoman traders, but actually Ottoman prisoners.

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:43.612
In the year 1565 the Ottomans tried to attack the small island of Malta,

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:48.772
which was then the home of the Knights of St John, a religious order.

00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:56.062
They failed to capture it, and the Turks that didn’t manage to escape were taken prisoner.

00:05:57.122 --> 00:06:02.302
The knights of Malta noticed that these prisoners were preparing a particular

00:06:02.302 --> 00:06:08.232
drink by mixing this dark powder together with sugar and water, and they

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:12.972
thought, well that looks interesting, and decided to try it for themselves.

00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:19.202
Indeed, even today Maltese traditional coffee is very similar

00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:23.492
to the Turkish style, and has different spices added to it.

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:30.872
Coffee might have first arrived in Malta, but its proper arrival to Europe came when

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:38.562
Ottoman traders took it to the great trading port of Venice, in Italy, around the year 1615.

00:06:39.652 --> 00:06:45.512
The Venetians weren’t immediately sure what to make of this drink, and were suspicious

00:06:45.752 --> 00:06:51.642
of its effect, even calling it the ‘bitter invention of Satan’, of the devil.

00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:56.562
There was huge debate about whether this drink should be allowed,

00:06:57.002 --> 00:07:01.352
and so it was taken to the pope, Clement the Eighth to decide.

00:07:02.352 --> 00:07:05.812
He said that he wouldn't be able to make a decision about

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:09.962
the fate of coffee if he hadn’t tasted it himself firsthand.

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:16.242
This seems a little bit of a strange thing for a pope to do, if you ask me, but Pope Clement

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:22.222
VIII decided that he needed to taste this bitter invention of Satan to see for himself.

00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:29.042
He took a sip of this new, black concoction, and decided he liked it.

00:07:29.852 --> 00:07:35.565
Coffee was ok, it wasn’t an invention of Satan, and he gave it his papal blessing.

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:41.305
Indeed, he reportedly declared ‘this devil’s drink is

00:07:41.415 --> 00:07:45.315
so delicious we should cheat the devil by baptising it’.

00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:52.655
Initially it was actually used mainly for medicinal purposes, for curing all

00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:58.875
manner of different sicknesses, and was mainly sold by apothecaries, by chemists.

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:03.995
Coffee started to flow further north into Europe, and this

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:08.775
spawned, this created, the culture of the European coffee house.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:13.455
Coffee houses sprung up over the great cities of Europe.

00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:17.225
They weren’t just places to drink coffee, but to

00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:21.605
exchange ideas, to discuss philosophy, and to learn.

00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:27.125
Indeed, in Britain they were even given the nickname of ‘penny

00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:31.435
universities’, because for the cost of 1 penny, which was the cost of

00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:36.165
the cup of coffee, you could go and learn from some of the great minds.

00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:41.565
These coffee houses would normally have a long table, so you would

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:46.645
go in, pay your 1 penny, and sit and discuss ideas with strangers.

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:54.125
It’s probably no coincidence that the Enlightenment overlapped with the boom in coffee houses.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:59.465
The coffee house provided a public place for people to discuss

00:08:59.465 --> 00:09:03.985
ideas; beforehand this didn’t really exist in the same way.

00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:10.085
Coffee became the ‘go-to’ drink both for the morning, and for business.

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:18.695
Previously people drank beer in the morning, and would go to taverns, to pubs, to conduct business.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:24.075
The invention of the coffee house meant that you could drink coffee

00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:28.245
in the morning at the start of the working day, and also go back to

00:09:28.245 --> 00:09:32.495
the coffeehouse to meet with other merchants or business contacts.

00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:37.465
So it’s no surprise that people became a lot more productive.

00:09:38.485 --> 00:09:44.295
I guess if you used to drink a few pints of beer to start the day, then drink beer throughout

00:09:44.305 --> 00:09:50.005
the day you’d probably feel a bit more productive if you switched the beer to coffee.

00:09:51.435 --> 00:09:56.785
Coffee was brought to North America by the British in the mid 17th century, but

00:09:57.105 --> 00:10:01.655
it was still produced thousands of kilometres away, in the Arabian peninsula.

00:10:02.795 --> 00:10:04.885
This made it prohibitively expensive.

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:12.115
Then, in the year 1723 a young French officer took the first little coffee

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:17.405
plant from Paris all the way to Martinique, in the Caribbean, and it’s

00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:22.685
from this little plant that 18 million coffee trees grew in Martinique.

00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:27.743
Coffee plants were transported to the other French colonies in the

00:10:27.743 --> 00:10:32.773
Caribbean, and French Guiana became a hub for coffee production.

00:10:33.623 --> 00:10:37.173
This berry was becoming so popular, but the French

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:40.163
didn’t want to share their coffee trees with anyone.

00:10:40.843 --> 00:10:45.533
They knew that if another nearby country got a coffee tree then they

00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:49.603
could then build up a coffee plantation and compete with the French.

00:10:50.993 --> 00:10:55.263
They weren’t to hold their monopoly on coffee production in the Americas for long though.

00:10:56.083 --> 00:11:02.733
In 1727 a Brazilian soldier was sent to French Guiana on a mission to get coffee tree

00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:09.663
saplings, baby coffee trees, so he could them take back to Brazil to create coffee plantations.

00:11:10.813 --> 00:11:15.123
Obviously the French wouldn’t give them to him, so he needed to get creative.

00:11:16.353 --> 00:11:20.763
Legend has it that he seduced the wife of the French governor,

00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:25.283
and when he left she gave him a large bouquet of flowers.

00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:31.171
Hidden inside the bouquet was a load of coffee tree seeds, which he took

00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:36.031
back to Brazil, and that was how the coffee industry got started in Brazil.

00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:41.151
Back in North America, coffee was getting more and more popular, and it could

00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:45.681
now be imported from the Caribbean, it didn’t have to be brought all the way

00:11:45.691 --> 00:11:50.341
from the Arabian peninsula, which naturally helped make it more affordable.

00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:56.611
But tea was still the more popular drink until an event that changed

00:11:56.611 --> 00:12:00.851
the course of history, at least the course of coffee history, forever.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:10.751
In 1773 King George III of Britain passed something called the Tea Act, which gave favourable

00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:18.221
terms to British tea merchants, and required American tea importers to pay heavy taxes.

00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:24.721
This caused protests and riots, which you may know as the Boston Tea Party.

00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:29.551
After this even drinking tea in America was viewed as

00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:34.571
unpatriotic, and the trajectory of coffee changed forever.

00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:40.321
Coffee production increased dramatically, which was enabled by the

00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:45.851
capturing and enslavement of millions of Africans who toiled on these

00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:50.721
plantations so that Americans and Europeans could enjoy their coffee.

00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:57.701
Coffee has a complicated relationship with slavery, in that the early coffee trade was

00:12:57.801 --> 00:13:04.281
enabled by slave labour, and there are often reports of people, and even children, now

00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:09.081
working as modern day slaves on plantations in different coffee-producing countries.

00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:14.611
Of course, the situation now is very different to how it was in the

00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:19.661
mid 19th century, and consumers are becoming more discerning, wanting

00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:23.901
responsibly sourced coffee, but it is still very much an issue.

00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:29.461
Today, coffee remains a major export for dozens of countries around the world.

00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:34.201
Brazil, from that bunch of flowers with coffee seeds hidden at the

00:13:34.201 --> 00:13:39.201
bottom, has grown into the world’s biggest coffee producer, exporting $5

00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:44.551
billion worth of coffee every year, or almost 16% of the world’s total.

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:49.991
It’s down from its lofty heights of producing over 50% of the

00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:53.681
world’s coffee, but it’s still the largest by a long margin.

00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:59.871
And in terms of coffee consumption, of coffee drinking, the countries that

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:04.441
are top of the list of the world’s most avid coffee drinkers may surprise you.

00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:09.871
It’s not anywhere in the Arabian peninsula, it’s not the Italians or the Brazilians.

00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:14.911
They’re nowhere close, and indeed it might surprise you that coffee

00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:20.291
consumption in coffee-producing countries actually tends to be very low.

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:26.561
The top of the table is dominated by Northern European countries - the Netherlands,

00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:31.331
Finland, Sweden, and Norway, which obviously can’t produce their own coffee.

00:14:32.481 --> 00:14:37.431
We probably need another whole episode on the production of coffee, and how it

00:14:37.431 --> 00:14:43.631
gets from growing on a tree in Colombia, Brazil, Vietnam, or Ethiopia, to being

00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:48.761
served at your favourite coffee shop, but it’s quite a unique product in that it

00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:55.261
is produced mainly by small farmers, of whom there are around 25 million worldwide.

00:14:56.321 --> 00:15:01.291
Harvesting coffee is a manual process, it can’t be completely done with

00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:06.341
agricultural machinery, and this has meant that coffee farming hasn’t

00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:11.081
been dominated by huge farms in the same way as other crops have.

00:15:12.121 --> 00:15:17.081
So it’s a pretty amazing thing to think that this small bean has become

00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:22.431
the world’s most popular drug, consumed by hundreds of millions of

00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:27.531
people every day, and providing employment for 25 million small farmers.

00:15:28.691 --> 00:15:33.861
And it all came, perhaps, from a man looking at some overexcited goats.

00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:41.011
OK then, there you go, that is a quick look at the history of coffee, and how

00:15:41.011 --> 00:15:46.301
it went from, potentially, being miraculously discovered by an Ethiopian goat

00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:52.241
herder to being tasted by a pope, then making a treacherous journey across the

00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:56.931
Atlantic to its current position as one of the world’s most popular drinks.

00:15:57.761 --> 00:16:01.231
It’s a fascinating story, and one with which you can

00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:03.631
impress the next person you’re having coffee with.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:15.832
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:19.619
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.669
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three, our final part, of our

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.719
three-part mini-series on the sensitive but important topic of slavery.

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:32.869
In case you missed them, in part one we talked about slavery in

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:36.889
the ancient world, ranging from Mesopotamia to Ancient Egypt.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.009
And in part two,  we talked about the transatlantic slave trade, the 400 or so-year period where

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.709
millions of slaves were transported from Africa to toil and suffer on plantations in the Americas.

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.749
And in today’s episode, we are going to explore slavery

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.809
in the modern world, slavery that still exists today.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.349
It is an uncomfortable subject, but it is important, and the scale of it might just surprise you.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:08.476
OK then, modern slavery.

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:14.226
So far in this mini-series, we’ve talked about slavery in

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:17.586
the ancient world and during the transatlantic slave trade.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:23.566
From the Ancient Egyptians to the plantations of Brazil, humans have enslaved

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:28.776
one another and forced their fellows to give up their freedom and work for free,

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:34.036
often doing the most backbreaking and soul-sucking labour until they drop dead.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:41.356
But then, as if by magic, this dark stain on humanity started to disappear.

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:46.626
Starting in the late 18th century, countries around the world

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:51.546
started to wake up to the horror and inhumanity of this trade.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:58.116
The independent republic of Vermont was the first state to ban it, in 1777.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:04.686
France followed in 1794, during the French Revolution, but it was

00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:10.376
then reinstated by Napoleon, only to be banned outright in 1848.

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:17.166
By the start of the 21st century, it was illegal in almost every country, and

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:22.116
when the Islamic Republic of Mauritania officially criminalised slavery in

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:28.046
2007, astonishingly, it was officially banned in every country in the world.

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:35.816
And when we think about slaves, or if you were to stop someone on the street and ask them

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:42.206
when they thought the historical period with the most slaves was, I would imagine many

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:48.496
people might say the 17th or 18th century, the height of the transatlantic slave trade.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:54.136
We hear of the ships packed to the brim with people ripped from their villages in Africa

00:02:54.486 --> 00:03:00.526
and sent to toil away in the tobacco or sugar plantations of the Caribbean or Brazil.

00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:08.316
As you’ll know, this was a truly terrible period, with millions of people displaced and killed,

00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:15.046
the profits from their labour being turned into lavish houses in the Americas and back in Europe.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:22.816
However, the unfortunate reality is that this wasn’t the period of history with the most slaves.

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:29.516
That ugly prize goes to right now, today, the 21st century.

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:35.786
In 2021, according to the Global Slavery Index, there were an

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:41.226
estimated 50 million people worldwide living in conditions of slavery.

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:49.226
This has actually been increasing, it’s up by 10 million people since 2016.

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:56.783
To put this in perspective, there were an estimated 12 to 15 million people in total who

00:03:56.783 --> 00:04:02.943
were transported during the transatlantic slave trade, and that was over almost 400 years.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.363
Now, of course, we need to add some context here.

00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:11.673
Modern slavery is different to the slavery of the 18th century.

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:15.673
It does not involve state-sponsored slave traders and ships

00:04:15.683 --> 00:04:19.233
sailing across the oceans packed with people clapped in irons.

00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:22.803
To quote the Global Slavery Index again:

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:27.253
“Modern slavery takes many forms and is known by many names.

00:04:27.753 --> 00:04:32.943
Essentially, it refers to situations of exploitation that a person cannot

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:37.673
refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, or deception.

00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:42.863
Modern slavery includes forced labour, forced or servile marriage,

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:47.633
debt bondage, forced commercial sexual exploitation, human trafficking,

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:51.533
slavery-like practices, and the sale and exploitation of children.

00:04:52.773 --> 00:04:57.973
In all its forms, it is the removal of a person’s freedom — their freedom to accept or

00:04:57.973 --> 00:05:02.943
refuse a job, their freedom to leave one employer for another, or their freedom to decide

00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:09.163
if, when, and whom they marry — in order to exploit them for personal or financial gain.”

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:10.483
End quote.

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:17.530
In other words, the definition of “slavery” is somewhat broader than the one

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.070
used to refer to slaves in antiquity or during the transatlantic slave trade,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.200
so it is not a like-for-like comparison, but there are still an estimated 50

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.800
million people who are not free, who are controlled and exploited by someone else.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.911
It is a huge number, if this were a country, it would be

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:44.101
the 30th largest country in the world, bigger than Spain.

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.971
So, in this episode, we are going to try to unpack what's going on:

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:55.224
how, when slavery is now banned globally, is it a bigger industry

00:05:55.224 --> 00:06:00.084
than ever before, generating profits of 150 billion dollars annually?

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.730
Let’s start with some statistics about where this “modern slavery” is taking place.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.670
The easy answer to that is actually “everywhere”, it is far more widespread than slavery

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.420
was during the transatlantic slave trade, where it was concentrated in the Americas.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.370
But as you might imagine, some countries are much worse than others.

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:30.997
The ten countries with the highest prevalence of modern slavery are,

00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:37.777
in order: North Korea, Eritrea, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye,

00:06:37.977 --> 00:06:42.707
Tajikistan, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Afghanistan, and Kuwait.

00:06:44.307 --> 00:06:48.347
By prevalence, this is calculated as the percentage

00:06:48.397 --> 00:06:51.597
of the total population that is enslaved in some way.

00:06:52.847 --> 00:07:00.087
In the case of North Korea, it is a staggering number, 104 out of every 1,000 people, so 10% of

00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:05.717
the population, which is so high because of the number of people imprisoned in forced labour camps.

00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:11.417
But even going to number four on the list, Saudi Arabia, there is

00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:16.267
an estimated 2% of the population that is living in modern slavery.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:22.666
You can probably already see some themes from that list: limited protections for

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:28.146
civil liberties, high levels of human rights abuse, and countries in or close to

00:07:28.146 --> 00:07:33.876
volatile regions which are marred by political instability, war and authoritarianism.

00:07:35.316 --> 00:07:41.056
These countries are often home to large numbers of vulnerable people, people who might

00:07:41.056 --> 00:07:47.116
be fleeing war, persecution or famine and are most likely to be forced into slavery.

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:53.286
Now, that was the list ordered by the percentage of the total population

00:07:53.326 --> 00:07:58.576
that is enslaved, as per the definition of modern slavery, but if we were

00:07:58.576 --> 00:08:03.036
to look at the total number of slaves, we get a slightly different list.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:10.346
Number one is India, followed by China, then North Korea, Pakistan, Russia,

00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:17.316
Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey, Bangladesh and even the United States, where

00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:22.272
there are an estimated 1.1  million people living in “modern slavery”.

00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:30.412
Added together, the total global population of “modern slaves” gets to almost 50

00:08:30.412 --> 00:08:36.622
million, and, as you can see, modern slavery exists in practically every country.

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:42.522
In terms of the different categories of “modern slaves”, the definition is

00:08:42.532 --> 00:08:47.772
broader than it was a few hundred years ago, so what defines a modern slave?

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.672
There are a few categories.

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:56.302
First, bonded labour, so people who are forced into working

00:08:56.332 --> 00:09:00.382
for someone else to pay off a debt and have no option to leave.

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:04.112
This is one of the most common forms of modern slavery.

00:09:05.622 --> 00:09:09.462
Secondly, so-called domestic servitude, which is when

00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:12.952
someone is employed in a house but is unable to leave.

00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:21.712
Thirdly, sexual exploitation, when people, typically women, are forced into prostitution.

00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:29.662
And finally forced marriage, when people, again typically women, and more often than

00:09:29.662 --> 00:09:34.953
not young girls, are forced into a marriage with someone that they did not consent to.

00:09:36.132 --> 00:09:41.662
Of course, these are somewhat loose categories, and have overlaps: bonded

00:09:41.662 --> 00:09:47.142
labour can take the form of sexual exploitation, forced marriage can result in

00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:52.342
domestic servitude, and so on, but these are useful categories to think about

00:09:52.352 --> 00:09:56.372
the different types of people who are classified as suffering modern slavery.

00:09:57.912 --> 00:10:02.652
Now, as to the question of why modern slavery is thriving, despite

00:10:02.652 --> 00:10:06.072
its illegality, let’s take a look at some of the root causes.

00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:13.282
Firstly, a combination of a global population boom and the persistence of poverty

00:10:13.652 --> 00:10:17.772
has meant that more people than ever before are living in extreme poverty.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:23.652
Yes, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty in

00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:27.832
places like India and China, but hundreds of millions more are still

00:10:27.832 --> 00:10:31.962
left behind, and susceptible to falling into the trap of slavery.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:37.952
To be precise, according to the World Bank, 8.5% of the world’s

00:10:37.952 --> 00:10:44.002
population lives in extreme poverty, or over 680 million people.

00:10:45.952 --> 00:10:51.932
For these people, eager to find any way to escape from this dire situation, it's easy

00:10:51.932 --> 00:10:57.422
to understand how they might be tricked into an offer of a better future, only to find

00:10:57.422 --> 00:11:02.502
out that it ends up being one of lifetime bondage, where they are trapped in a country

00:11:02.732 --> 00:11:08.022
far away from their own, forced to work from dawn to dusk, with no way of leaving.

00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:13.362
Let me give you one example of this that you might not have heard of before.

00:11:14.802 --> 00:11:19.632
I’m currently recording this episode from the small Mediterranean island of Malta.

00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:25.512
Millions of people come here every year for sun, sand,

00:11:25.512 --> 00:11:28.052
and other hedonistic pleasures the island offers.

00:11:28.802 --> 00:11:32.592
Others come to learn English, while others for its low taxes.

00:11:33.462 --> 00:11:37.992
The country is also a hub for online gambling companies, it has long been a

00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:44.282
laundromat for organised criminals, and in 2014 the country started selling its

00:11:44.342 --> 00:11:49.332
passports to ultra-wealthy individuals who wanted a safe place to store their money.

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:57.552
These slightly dubious activities have led to billions of Euros flooding into the tiny country,

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:04.152
and a subsequent economic boom, which has brought prosperity to many citizens of Malta.

00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:09.932
Go into any cafe in Malta and eavesdrop on a conversation, listen to what the

00:12:09.932 --> 00:12:13.962
people next to you are talking about: you’ll find people talking about building

00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:18.252
and renting out apartments, how they are buying and selling garages, and so on.

00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:24.292
Many Maltese people have grown very wealthy in a very short period of time.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:32.202
The problem is that Malta is a very small country, with only 400,000 or so Maltese citizens.

00:12:33.112 --> 00:12:38.362
It doesn’t have enough people who are willing to do hard manual jobs, building

00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:42.992
apartment blocks, cleaning the streets, or working as delivery people, the

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:46.642
kind of jobs that are necessary to sustain the country’s economic growth

00:12:46.952 --> 00:12:51.852
and appetite for greater profits but are typically hard and poorly paid.

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:57.992
So the country has “imported” tens of thousands of people from

00:12:58.342 --> 00:13:03.132
developing countries, primarily Indian, Filipino and Nepalese.

00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:10.532
There has been much talk in the Maltese media over the past few years of “modern-day slavery” in

00:13:10.532 --> 00:13:17.446
Malta, where people from countries like India or Pakistan have paid an agent often thousands of

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:24.476
Euros for a work permit to come to Malta, been promised a salary of two thousand Euros or so, and

00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:30.366
been told that they can live like a king, only to find that when they arrive here the salary is

00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:35.586
a fraction of what they were told, they are forced to live in an apartment with 40 other people,

00:13:35.956 --> 00:13:41.516
and work 18 hours a day only to pay off their debt to the agent that sold them the work permit.

00:13:43.026 --> 00:13:48.126
Now, for the absence of doubt, this is clearly not the same as the slavery

00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:52.486
endured by people captured in Africa and then transported to the plantations

00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:58.506
in the 17th century, but by the modern definition, it is slavery nonetheless.

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:03.789
In some cases, the working conditions and the treatment of the vulnerable

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:08.709
by the powerful really aren't so far from the slavery of the 17th century.

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:15.279
In September of 2021, a woman going down a country road in the north of

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:19.779
Malta stopped to help an injured man she saw on the side of the road.

00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:26.459
There was a Ghanaian man lying on the floor under the midday sun, in agony.

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:31.699
When she approached him he was crying out for help, repeating,

00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:34.519
“I don't want to die, I don't want to go to prison”.

00:14:35.859 --> 00:14:39.449
She called an ambulance, and the man was whisked away to hospital.

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:45.959
The man, whose name was Jaiteh Lamin, had a broken back, and two broken arms.

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:53.439
He was unable to move, and had been trying to drag himself off the road using his broken arms.

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:57.979
He initially told the police that he had been hit by

00:14:57.979 --> 00:15:02.019
a car, but later admitted that this wasn’t the truth.

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:07.489
He had been working on a construction site and had fallen from the second floor.

00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:12.959
After he had fallen, and clearly suffered a horrific accident,

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:15.759
his boss had told him that he was taking him to hospital.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:23.559
But, after driving a short distance, and finding a piece of countryside road with no passing

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:30.439
cars, his boss stopped the van and threw his worker out of the door, leaving him to writhe around

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:37.139
in agony in the scorching midday sun, and warning him not to tell anyone what had happened.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:42.426
Fortunately, the injured man was found by a passerby and

00:15:42.636 --> 00:15:45.726
brought to hospital, where he eventually revealed the truth.

00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:52.976
There was a criminal investigation into his boss, and all sorts of irregularities were found,

00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:59.646
such as he didn’t have any safety equipment, wasn’t being paid properly, and the work was illegal.

00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:07.196
Still, to date there is no evidence that any criminal proceedings have taken place against

00:16:07.206 --> 00:16:13.236
the boss or the company, the company is still in business and proudly boasting on social media

00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:19.706
about new developments and making handsome profits, its crooked boss still seemingly walking

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:26.016
free and counting the zeros on his bank balance, while Jaiteh Lamin is left with chronic pain.

00:16:27.176 --> 00:16:29.426
And this is in the European Union.

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:34.616
Sure, it might be different from the slavery of the past, but it

00:16:34.616 --> 00:16:38.976
is slavery nonetheless, as per the definition of modern slavery.

00:16:40.536 --> 00:16:45.836
As you would expect, there are all manner of legal frameworks and agreements that are aimed

00:16:45.846 --> 00:16:53.836
at combating modern slavery in all forms: EU laws, UN conventions, and national laws, but the

00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:59.136
grim reality is that it is an increasing problem in practically every country in the world.

00:17:00.216 --> 00:17:04.706
The economic incentives exist to keep marginalised people in conditions

00:17:04.746 --> 00:17:09.476
akin to slavery, and in too many countries, even countries you might not

00:17:09.476 --> 00:17:13.656
expect, there are not strong enough incentives to do anything about it.

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:19.636
So, to wrap up this episode, this short exploration of modern

00:17:19.636 --> 00:17:24.356
slavery, and also this three-part mini-series, one thing is clear.

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:30.946
The face of slavery has morphed over the centuries, from the shackles of ancient

00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:36.676
servitude to the brutal inhumanity of the transatlantic slave trade, and now to the

00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:41.306
different forms of modern slavery that lurk in the shadows of our global society.

00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:47.146
Despite the monumental shifts in laws and ethics, the scourge

00:17:47.146 --> 00:17:51.586
of slavery, so it seems, has adapted rather than vanished.

00:17:52.986 --> 00:17:59.086
As we've seen in this episode, modern slavery, though often less visible, is not less real.

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:03.716
It's a global problem that transcends borders, cultures,

00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:06.806
and economies, a way to exploit the most vulnerable.

00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:12.946
From a construction worker in the EU to a child bride in a distant land,

00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:19.556
the chains may be metaphorical, but in many cases they are no less binding.

00:18:22.006 --> 00:18:26.016
OK then, that is it for today's episode on modern slavery, and

00:18:26.136 --> 00:18:29.716
with that comes an end to this sensitive but important mini-series.

00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:33.776
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new about

00:18:33.776 --> 00:18:38.456
this dark chapter on humanity, that unfortunately remains open to this very day.

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:43.861
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:49.691
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

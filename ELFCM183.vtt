Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:17.117
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.927
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:29.417
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be tackling a big question, that of population growth.

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:35.287
We are going to be asking ourselves whether there are too many people in the world?

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:38.867
And if indeed that is the case, does it matter?

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:43.657
What will some of the implications be, for us personally, for

00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:47.127
our children and their children, and for the world we live in?

00:00:47.877 --> 00:00:54.957
These are, to state the obvious, some big, important questions, so let’s get cracking right away.

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:59.657
In this episode we’ll start by outlining some numbers, to

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.937
emphasise how the world’s population has grown over time.

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:08.897
Then, we’ll talk a little bit about some of the reasons that

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:13.437
people are scared by population growth, both now and historically.

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:18.187
Then we'll talk about what most experts think the future of the

00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:23.567
world’s population will look like, and why having 10 billion people on

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:27.747
Earth might not actually be as scary as you might think it would be.

00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:32.507
Let’s start with some numbers, because we are indeed talking

00:01:32.537 --> 00:01:35.837
about the number of people that exist on planet Earth.

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:44.687
Homo Sapiens, us, you and I, are thought to have arrived on Earth about 200,000 years ago.

00:01:45.457 --> 00:01:51.727
The world population hit 1 billion people in around 1800, so it took

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:57.497
more or less 200,000 years for us to go from zero to a billion people.

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:07.717
The next billion took 127 years, then 32 years, then 15, then 13, then 12, and

00:02:07.847 --> 00:02:14.987
it took another 12 years for us to reach 7 billion people on earth in 2011.

00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:22.017
The population at the moment, in 2021, is just under 8 billion.

00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:28.847
And although most academics believe that it will continue to grow for the majority of the

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:35.977
next century, it is thought that it will stabilise at somewhere between 10 and 12 billion

00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:42.937
towards the end of the 21st century, double the population in the year that I was born, 1987.

00:02:43.907 --> 00:02:49.197
Throughout history there have been concerns that there are too many people on the planet,

00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:57.127
that there is a natural ceiling, and the Earth simply can’t sustain the human population.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:04.607
There is evidence of this concern right back in Carthage, in the second century AD, but

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:11.817
the most famous critic of population growth came in late 18th century Britain, with an

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:18.217
article called “An Essay On The Principle of Population”, by a scholar named Robert Malthus.

00:03:19.107 --> 00:03:27.105
This was published in 1798, shortly before the world had welcomed its billionth inhabitant.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:32.207
Malthus proposed that population growth happens more quickly

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:36.797
than the ability of a society to increase its food production.

00:03:37.537 --> 00:03:43.707
Therefore societies lose the ability to feed everyone, there is famine,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:49.827
war and death, and the population returns to its normal, correct size.

00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:56.297
Malthus has remained popular ever since, yet his theory proved to

00:03:56.297 --> 00:04:00.697
be completely wrong, at least for the period he was writing in.

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:06.717
Malthus failed to predict the Industrial Revolution, which came shortly

00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:13.487
afterwards, and resulted in huge improvements in mankind’s ability to feed itself.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:18.957
There is an entire episode on The Industrial Revolution if you’re interested, it’s

00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:25.357
episode 150, and I’m sure you know a lot of this already, but long story short,

00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:31.257
industrial improvements meant that food suddenly became much easier to produce.

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:37.267
The population was growing faster than ever before, but society’s ability

00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:42.747
to feed itself was improving faster than the population was growing, meaning

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:47.607
that in fact the opposite of what Malthus had suggested was happening.

00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:54.387
Indeed now, when there have never been more people on Earth, there has never been a smaller

00:04:54.447 --> 00:05:01.067
percentage of the population involved in agriculture, involved in actually producing food.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:07.667
So, from the point of view of the world collapsing in famine and war at

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:12.517
1 billion people, that certainly didn’t happen, luckily for all of us.

00:05:13.427 --> 00:05:17.707
The world’s population has continued to grow, it is up almost

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:22.827
eightfold, an increase of 8 times since Malthus’ gloomy prediction.

00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:28.447
But there are still those that predict that the world cannot sustain

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:32.967
itself, or rather, the world has no problem sustaining itself, the

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:37.767
problem comes from the amount of humans on the planet that destabilise it.

00:05:38.907 --> 00:05:45.027
In 1968 Paul Ehrlich, an economist at Stanford University, was to follow in

00:05:45.027 --> 00:05:51.057
Malthus’s footsteps, when he published a book with the title “The Population Bomb”.

00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:58.747
The first sentence of the book read “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.”

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:04.977
Ehrlich proposed that the world was too crowded, that there were too many people,

00:06:05.377 --> 00:06:12.177
and that we were on a fast train towards mass starvation caused by overpopulation.

00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:19.727
And you will no doubt have seen gloomy headlines, prophetic news stories, about population

00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:25.677
growth, and how we have to do something about it in order to guarantee our survival.

00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:32.177
But there are also plenty of academics and scientists who say that 10 billion

00:06:32.177 --> 00:06:37.657
people is nothing to worry about, and that the world’s population growth

00:06:37.687 --> 00:06:42.557
is already slowing fast enough, and that it will naturally come to a stop.

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:47.577
And ultimately, that we don’t need to worry about population growth at all.

00:06:48.297 --> 00:06:49.217
Who is right?

00:06:50.207 --> 00:06:53.037
Let’s start with where both sides agree.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:59.657
There is no doubt that an increased population puts increasing pressure on the environment.

00:07:00.037 --> 00:07:06.027
People use resources, there are a finite amount of resources on planet Earth, and the

00:07:06.027 --> 00:07:11.897
more people you have, the more difficult it is to make sure there is enough to go around.

00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:16.877
That “enough” can be food, it can be water, it can be clean air.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:22.557
And of course, depending on where you are in the world, you have different concerns,

00:07:22.697 --> 00:07:28.477
and it is almost always those living in poorer countries that get a worse deal.

00:07:29.237 --> 00:07:33.677
Both sides also agree that population growth is slowing.

00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:37.407
This is an undeniable fact - it is slowing.

00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:45.087
Despite sensationalist headlines about how population growth is out of control, it really isn’t.

00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:47.677
In percentage terms, growth is slowing.

00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:55.197
It peaked at around 2% in the late 1960s, it was at its highest in the

00:07:55.197 --> 00:08:01.717
late 1960s, and is now down to 1.05%, and has been reducing every year.

00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:06.287
So while the world population is still growing, it is

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:10.247
growing more slowly than any time in recent memory.

00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:13.257
And the growth is unequal.

00:08:13.687 --> 00:08:20.297
Countries like Niger, in west Africa, have been growing at just under 4% a year, while the

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:27.167
population of countries like Japan is actually shrinking - there are fewer people every year.

00:08:28.187 --> 00:08:34.532
Indeed, the entire Sub-Saharan region is growing at around 2.7% a year, versus

00:08:34.687 --> 00:08:42.850
1.2% for South East Asia, 0.9% for Latin America and just 0.1% in Europe.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:50.049
If it continues at this rate, the population of Africa is set to double by

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:56.549
2050, at around 2.5 billion, or more than a quarter of the world’s population.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:04.351
And this is in a region that contains some of the poorest countries in the world, so some economists

00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:11.794
are predicting huge tragedy in the region, as the population booms but is unable to feed itself.

00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:17.564
Others point out that this level of population growth is nothing to be

00:09:17.564 --> 00:09:21.994
concerned about, and is completely normal in any developing country.

00:09:22.564 --> 00:09:28.044
They show that we have the history of every developed country to go by, and

00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:33.674
that there is a clear pattern which can be divided into four broad stages.

00:09:34.534 --> 00:09:41.384
The first stage is of high rates of child mortality, of children dying, and therefore

00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:48.004
parents want to have as many children as possible to ensure that they have enough to survive.

00:09:48.729 --> 00:09:53.319
For much of human history, until there was proper medicine and access to

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:58.999
clean water, this was how people lived, they never got past this first stage.

00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:04.719
The second stage involves improved living conditions, including better

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:10.089
access to healthcare and sanitation, therefore child mortality decreases,

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:15.639
and more children survive, leading the population to increase dramatically.

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:21.389
The third stage is that families realise that they don’t have to continue

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:25.912
to have lots of children, because most are surviving, so there are fewer

00:10:25.942 --> 00:10:30.882
births, fewer children are born, and population growth starts to slow.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:38.512
And the fourth stage is full stabilisation, it’s what most developed countries are currently in now.

00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:44.432
We’ve seen this happen in every single developed country - there are no exceptions.

00:10:44.882 --> 00:10:51.222
Birth rates are high, and they decrease as living conditions in a country increase.

00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:57.395
This is one of the reasons that both sides of the “what to do about population growth”

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:05.055
debate agree that one of the highest impact things that can be done to reduce the speed of

00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:11.545
population growth is help poorer countries improve their healthcare and education systems.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:18.905
While not everyone agrees on the best way to do that, all of the data suggests that

00:11:18.915 --> 00:11:24.945
by doing things like increasing literacy rates, especially female literacy rates,

00:11:25.245 --> 00:11:31.285
improving healthcare, and educating people about contraception will lead to a

00:11:31.285 --> 00:11:36.585
reduction in the number of children, and therefore a slowing in population growth.

00:11:37.015 --> 00:11:43.465
And as the number of children per woman drops worldwide, the theory goes that it will

00:11:43.465 --> 00:11:50.065
stabilise somewhere around 2 children per woman, which is what’s called the “replacement rate”.

00:11:50.775 --> 00:11:56.035
For a population to remain at a similar size, and if you assume that as

00:11:56.035 --> 00:12:02.095
many people immigrate to a country as emigrate from it, each woman needs

00:12:02.095 --> 00:12:07.045
to have two children on average for the population to remain the same size.

00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:11.985
So, if this is the case, if there aren’t more children

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:16.135
being born globally, why is the population still increasing?

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:21.325
Well, quite simply it is because people are living for longer.

00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:28.005
We used to think of our society as a sort of pyramid structure, with lots of children

00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:33.145
at the bottom, and fewer and fewer people as you got up to the top of the pyramid.

00:12:34.013 --> 00:12:37.467
In most developed countries, society doesn’t look

00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:41.167
like a pyramid any more, and looks more like a tower.

00:12:41.897 --> 00:12:47.447
Indeed, in some countries it is starting to look like an inverted pyramid,

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:52.797
an upside down pyramid, as there are more older people than younger people.

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:58.577
So, coming back to where the rest of the population growth is coming from,

00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:03.207
it is mainly going to come from children who are already born, who will

00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:08.057
continue to live a much longer life than their parents and grandparents.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:14.227
If you think about our old pyramid structure, instead of the number

00:13:14.247 --> 00:13:19.127
of bricks reducing as you go up, it will remain more or less the same.

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:25.173
That is where the population growth is coming from, not there being many more children being born.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.198
Globally, there are the same amount of children being born, more

00:13:30.198 --> 00:13:33.968
or less, but they are just being born in different countries.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.703
In developing countries the birth rate is still relatively high, but

00:13:39.913 --> 00:13:44.913
this is offset by people in the developed world having fewer children.

00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:50.003
So, yes the world population is still growing slowly, but no

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:54.103
it seems unlikely that it’s going to continue to grow forever.

00:13:54.973 --> 00:13:58.373
Ok then, you might be thinking, does this mean that

00:13:58.373 --> 00:14:01.523
we simply don’t have to worry about population growth?

00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:08.933
Were Malthus, Ehrlich, and anyone talking about the dangers of population growth simply...wrong?

00:14:09.853 --> 00:14:14.993
Well, they weren’t 100% wrong, and of course, an increased population

00:14:15.003 --> 00:14:19.823
means greater strain, greater pressure on the world’s resources.

00:14:20.433 --> 00:14:23.643
But what does this actually mean to me and to you?

00:14:23.953 --> 00:14:29.283
What can we actually do about it, if indeed there is anything that should be done?

00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:35.872
There are only two ways of reducing population size - by reducing how

00:14:35.872 --> 00:14:40.132
long people live, and stopping babies from being born in the first place.

00:14:41.012 --> 00:14:45.242
In terms of the former, of reducing how long people live,

00:14:45.382 --> 00:14:48.682
thankfully nobody seems to be suggesting anything like that.

00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:52.252
We all seem to agree that we should do everything we

00:14:52.252 --> 00:14:55.632
can to allow people to live for as long as possible.

00:14:56.452 --> 00:15:02.432
And in terms of stopping babies from being born, at least in the majority of the developed world

00:15:02.442 --> 00:15:09.402
now nobody seems to be proposing anything quite so radical as a limit on the number of children

00:15:09.402 --> 00:15:16.182
a couple can have, like the one-child-policy that was in place in China, and there seems to be an

00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:22.312
agreement that it isn’t right to stop women from having the amount of children that they want to.

00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:27.432
Indeed, there is a limited amount that any government can do, that

00:15:27.432 --> 00:15:32.012
a government can impose on its citizens, to slow population growth.

00:15:32.842 --> 00:15:37.222
But not all pressure has to come from above, and sometimes

00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:41.462
pressure comes from below, from the individuals in society.

00:15:42.082 --> 00:15:46.552
There is a growing segment of people in the West advocating

00:15:46.552 --> 00:15:49.772
for people to reduce the number of children they have.

00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:56.192
Here is activist Alexandra Paul, who made her name as an actress

00:15:56.222 --> 00:16:00.902
in Baywatch, describing how she sees the current world situation:

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:05.611
And all of this made sense when it was important for us to procreate for our

00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:14.712
survival, but now for our survival, we have to not procreate and we have to change and

00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:20.412
rewire our biology and our culture to recognize the benefits of a one-child family.

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:22.822
Because right now, mostly what we see as the negatives.

00:16:23.873 --> 00:16:29.263
There are frequent articles about people who have taken the decision not to have

00:16:29.263 --> 00:16:35.513
children because of a fear of overpopulation, and of the child’s environmental impact.

00:16:36.113 --> 00:16:42.613
There’s even a movement in the UK called BirthStrike, essentially couples going on

00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:48.493
strike against having children because of the environmental footprint that a person has.

00:16:49.483 --> 00:16:54.083
Of course, a child, like an adult, has an environmental footprint.

00:16:54.873 --> 00:17:02.363
It’s estimated at just under 60 tonnes of CO2 per year for someone in the developed world.

00:17:03.093 --> 00:17:08.403
To put that in perspective, a child’s annual carbon footprint is the equivalent

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:16.403
of around 37 transatlantic flights or 73 people switching to a meat-free diet.

00:17:17.573 --> 00:17:23.743
While this is not to question what was no doubt a difficult personal decision that these couples

00:17:23.753 --> 00:17:29.613
have taken, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the calculations aren’t quite correct.

00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:36.903
A child born in 2021 will, over the course of its lifetime, most likely produce

00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:43.523
significantly fewer carbon emissions than a child born 50 years ago, as there simply

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:50.283
won’t be fossil fuels for them to burn, petrol cars won’t exist, and in fact the carbon

00:17:50.283 --> 00:17:55.973
footprint of future generations is predicted to be significantly lower than ours.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:18:02.923
Clearly, having one child will result in a greater environmental impact than having zero

00:18:02.923 --> 00:18:09.773
children, but the point is that the impact will actually be a lot smaller than many people think.

00:18:10.663 --> 00:18:15.933
And when it comes to the question of population growth, and of the planet having

00:18:15.943 --> 00:18:22.023
enough space both for people to live in and enough food for everyone to eat, most

00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:27.613
scientists are in agreement that there is certainly enough space and food for everyone,

00:18:27.863 --> 00:18:33.263
it is just a question of distribution, of getting food to the people who need it.

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:41.193
You have probably heard statistics such as about 30-40% of all of the food in the United States

00:18:41.223 --> 00:18:47.813
is wasted, or that around a billion and a half tonnes of food is wasted every year globally.

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:53.133
The world currently produces more than enough food to satisfy everyone’s

00:18:53.413 --> 00:18:58.553
caloric needs, to feed everyone on the planet, it just turns out that the

00:18:58.863 --> 00:19:03.903
current economic system is not very efficient at distributing it to the people

00:19:03.903 --> 00:19:08.363
who need it, or you could even say that it’s too efficient for its own good.

00:19:09.223 --> 00:19:12.563
And in terms of whether there is enough space for

00:19:12.593 --> 00:19:15.613
everyone to live, that’s an easy question to answer.

00:19:15.913 --> 00:19:16.923
Most definitely.

00:19:17.653 --> 00:19:24.773
In fact, you could fit 11.5 billion people into Italy if they all lived as New Yorkers

00:19:24.773 --> 00:19:30.503
did, if the population density was as high as it currently is in New York City.

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:36.123
Of course, this doesn’t factor in all of the land that is required to produce

00:19:36.123 --> 00:19:42.103
food, goods and so on, and I’m not suggesting that we all move into one Italian

00:19:42.113 --> 00:19:47.143
mega-city, but the point is that the world isn’t going to run out of space for

00:19:47.143 --> 00:19:53.143
people to exist, it is that our society may have to adapt to different living styles.

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:58.783
So, to wrap things up, when it comes to population, is there

00:19:58.793 --> 00:20:02.523
really a problem of there being too many people in the world?

00:20:03.223 --> 00:20:09.363
It certainly seems that there isn’t a problem with the number of people, and most developed

00:20:09.393 --> 00:20:14.683
countries are certainly doing everything they can to encourage people to have more children.

00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:20.943
From giving out grants, economic incentives to parents through subsidising

00:20:20.963 --> 00:20:25.633
childcare and providing free schooling, countries all over the world

00:20:25.823 --> 00:20:30.013
are busy encouraging their populations to continue to multiply.

00:20:30.703 --> 00:20:34.703
If there were some great problem inherent with population

00:20:34.703 --> 00:20:38.143
growth then these policies would make little sense.

00:20:39.123 --> 00:20:44.023
And indeed, if a government wanted to discourage its citizens from

00:20:44.023 --> 00:20:48.453
having children, then making having children even more expensive than

00:20:48.453 --> 00:20:52.683
it currently is would be a very quick and effective way of doing so.

00:20:53.533 --> 00:20:59.433
So, the world is changing, there are more people than ever before living on Earth.

00:21:00.313 --> 00:21:06.293
Indeed, one in fifteen people who have ever set foot on Earth are alive today.

00:21:07.253 --> 00:21:11.973
Certainly, there are all sorts of demographic and societal changes

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:17.723
that await us, from how to care for an ageing population to how to make

00:21:17.723 --> 00:21:21.623
sure that food is distributed to the places where it is needed most.

00:21:22.193 --> 00:21:26.233
But is population growth itself anything to be worried about?

00:21:26.963 --> 00:21:31.443
Do you believe that there is some Malthusian catastrophe waiting

00:21:31.443 --> 00:21:35.833
to happen, a population bomb is ticking, ready to explode?

00:21:36.543 --> 00:21:40.173
Or do you believe that we should carry on as normal,

00:21:40.353 --> 00:21:43.763
and the global economy will find a way of adapting?

00:21:44.643 --> 00:21:47.463
I’m sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

00:21:48.313 --> 00:21:54.823
No matter what you think, and what side of the population question you believe is right, it

00:21:54.823 --> 00:22:00.163
is undeniable that the world is going to be a very different place at the end of this century.

00:22:00.763 --> 00:22:04.023
But whether that’s a world that you or I would look

00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:07.633
forward to living in is a different question altogether.

00:22:09.853 --> 00:22:15.053
OK then, that is it for today's episode on global population growth.

00:22:15.423 --> 00:22:19.163
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:22:19.323 --> 00:22:23.133
that it may have made you think about things in a slightly different way.

00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:27.943
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:28.403 --> 00:22:32.333
I think this is a topic that we can all have an opinion on, and I’m

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:36.943
sure that it’s a subject that invites particularly strong opinions.

00:22:37.383 --> 00:22:39.873
So, let’s get the discussion started.

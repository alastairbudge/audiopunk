Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.675
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.725
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.675
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:28.255
about the time Wall Street took on the nation of Argentina.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:33.985
It is a fascinating story that gets one thinking about morality, finance, the rule

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:39.145
of law, and the rights and wrongs of how some people get spectacularly wealthy.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:45.675
So, let’s get right into it, and talk about the battle between Wall Street and Argentina.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:52.725
Paul Singer does not look like someone that most people would be afraid of.

00:00:53.405 --> 00:01:00.405
He is softly-spoken, small, slight, with short hair, a well-trimmed beard and glasses.

00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:05.215
He looks like someone you might encounter in a university or library,

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:09.635
perhaps a man you might bump into accidentally and help pick up a

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:13.655
pile of textbooks off the floor while you both apologise profusely.

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:19.545
But this man, Paul Singer, has been called the “world’s most

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:24.625
feared investor”, a “vulture lord” and a “blood sucker”.

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:31.365
He is the founder of a company called Elliott Management, a normally publicity-shy hedge

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:37.645
fund that shot into the public eye for its 15-year-battle with the government of Argentina.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:43.935
A hedge fund, if you are unfamiliar with the term, is a kind of investment

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:49.075
company that takes money from investors and then invests in anything, really.

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:55.885
It might buy shares in a company that it thinks are undervalued, it might “short” shares in

00:01:55.885 --> 00:02:01.815
a company that it thinks is overvalued, meaning it makes money if the share price goes down.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:08.225
It might buy or sell gold, oil, coffee beans, all sorts of financial

00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:12.825
instruments that will mean it finishes the year with more money than it started.

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:18.295
And many hedge funds end up finishing each year with a lot

00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:21.375
more money than they started, they make a lot of money.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:27.735
You have probably heard stories about hedge fund managers who have made billions of dollars betting

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:33.065
on things as varied as the housing market crashing through to the price of a stock going up.

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:40.665
What you might not have heard about, however, is a hedge fund going to war against a country,

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:47.195
and that’s what we’ll talk about today, the battle between Elliott Management and Argentina.

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:54.205
To understand how this can even happen, why a New York financier would even have anything to do

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:59.975
with a sovereign South American nation, we need to talk a bit about how countries pay for stuff.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:07.195
Countries need to provide services to their citizens: schools, hospitals, new roads,

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:12.615
bridges, pensions, all of the sorts of things that you need to have a functioning state.

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.585
Countries need money to pay for all of this.

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:21.165
The principal way that most countries make money is by taxing their citizens.

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:26.785
We all pay tax, some people pay more tax than others, but the idea is that the government

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:33.055
collects taxes from its citizens and this money is spent on services that these citizens need.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:36.315
However, it is rarely that simple.

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:43.355
Most governments spend more than they collect, so they need to borrow money to fill the gap.

00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:48.145
One way in which a country can do this is to issue things called

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:53.035
bonds, which are a type of debt, sovereign debt to be precise.

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:59.785
Investors buy these bonds, which means they become the owners of the debt.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:05.415
And they collect interest payments as a fee for providing this service.

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:11.705
Investors like sovereign debt because it is typically considered “safe”.

00:04:12.205 --> 00:04:16.295
It’s not like lending money to a risky small business, you’re lending money to

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:21.855
a country, and a country can’t exactly run and hide, it can’t escape its debts.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:24.485
Well, that’s in theory at least.

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:30.985
What often happens, has happened throughout history and happened particularly frequently

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:37.395
with developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s, was that a country would take on too

00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:43.555
much debt, it would borrow too much, and then not be able to make its interest payments.

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:50.075
Under a growing mountain of debt, countries would negotiate with their bondholders

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:56.405
to reduce it, for example, offering to repay 30 cents of every $1 owed.

00:04:57.385 --> 00:05:01.455
Often, the bondholders would accept this offer, especially if

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:05.605
the alternative was getting 0 cents, losing all of their money.

00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:13.725
In other cases, if it looked like a country was going to default on its debt, if it simply wasn’t

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:20.705
going to pay it back, the owners of the bonds would often sell them at a loss to other investors,

00:05:21.145 --> 00:05:28.905
selling them for 10 or 20 cents on the dollar, because, after all, 10 cents is better than 0 cents.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:34.455
Now, we don’t want to get too bogged down in financial details here,

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:39.375
but the reason to give this background is that this entire story is

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:43.925
about financial details, the whole story revolves around this concept.

00:05:45.398 --> 00:05:52.298
Paul Singer was an investor in this kind of sovereign debt, but in particular, he

00:05:52.298 --> 00:05:56.678
looked for countries that looked like they were going to default on their debts,

00:05:57.048 --> 00:06:02.128
so that he could snap up their debt at rock bottom prices from other investors.

00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:07.538
He first did this with the South American nation of Peru.

00:06:08.588 --> 00:06:16.508
In 1996, Singer paid $11 million for $58 million of Peruvian debt.

00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:22.673
Peru had defaulted on this debt, saying that it was unable to pay it,

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:26.528
which is why the holder of the debt was happy to cash out of its position.

00:06:27.698 --> 00:06:33.198
But Singer thought he would be able to get the money from the Peruvian government.

00:06:33.908 --> 00:06:38.238
He thought he could pay $11 million, and force the

00:06:38.238 --> 00:06:43.298
government of Peru to pay him back the entire $58 million.

00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:48.558
Long story short, it took a while, but he did.

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:53.098
He strongarmed the country into agreeing to pay him the entire

00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:58.038
value, netting him a 500% return on his initial investment.

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:04.258
It was a strategy that he would later repeat in Congo as well as other countries,

00:07:04.618 --> 00:07:10.148
countries which pleaded that they did not have the financial resources to repay, they were

00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:16.668
poor and underdeveloped, and it was morally reprehensible for them to divert money that

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:21.958
would otherwise have gone to schools and hospitals to an already ultra wealthy American.

00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:25.058
Paul Singer didn’t care.

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:29.888
He had trained as a lawyer, he wasn’t running a charity, he had legally

00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:34.578
bought the debt, and he was there to collect what was rightfully his.

00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:40.948
Legally, he was right, and this became a cornerstone of his investment

00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:46.048
strategy: buy up the debt of distressed companies or countries on the

00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:51.248
cheap and then pressure and sue them into paying him back the full amount.

00:07:52.748 --> 00:07:55.798
It turned out that this strategy of zooming in on

00:07:55.798 --> 00:07:59.238
distressed developing countries was immensely profitable.

00:08:00.558 --> 00:08:05.208
But for his most profitable trade, or at least his most profitable

00:08:05.498 --> 00:08:09.248
public trade of this kind, we need to talk about Argentina.

00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:14.568
As you may know, almost since it gained its independence from Spain

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:20.398
in 1816, the Argentine economy has been characterised by periods of

00:08:20.488 --> 00:08:25.718
boom and bust, of great prosperity and of great economic hardship.

00:08:27.088 --> 00:08:32.588
Jumping forward to the period we’re talking about in this story, the 1990s were a period

00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:38.788
of high inflation in Argentina, as well as a huge increase in public and private debt.

00:08:39.788 --> 00:08:45.378
Because Argentina was not a particularly reliable debtor, the interest rates that

00:08:45.378 --> 00:08:51.048
it had to pay were high, to compensate investors for the risk that they were taking.

00:08:52.178 --> 00:08:57.348
This was followed by a recession in the late 1990s, with widespread

00:08:57.388 --> 00:09:02.828
unemployment and seven out of ten Argentine children living in poverty.

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:09.588
With no clear way to grow out of this recession, and drowning under the

00:09:09.628 --> 00:09:15.638
ever increasing interest payments on its debt, in 2001 Argentina defaulted

00:09:15.648 --> 00:09:21.768
on almost $100 billion of sovereign debt, saying, “sorry, we can’t pay”.

00:09:22.918 --> 00:09:27.908
The Argentine economy had been severely mismanaged, and instead of paying

00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:32.768
off external creditors, Argentina decided to pay for essential services

00:09:32.768 --> 00:09:37.068
for its citizens, you know, hospitals, schools, all that kind of stuff.

00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:42.328
This began a period of negotiation with its creditors, with Argentine

00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:46.458
officials and economists trying to get their creditors to accept a

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:51.578
haircut on their debt, to accept a reduction in the amount that was owed.

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:58.399
And these creditors weren’t just large banks or other countries, it included millions

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:04.149
of retail investors, private citizens, who had been encouraged to buy Argentine

00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:10.029
debt as a safe investment because, after all, it was a safe investment, right?

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:11.889
It wasn’t.

00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:19.092
As the Argentine economy started to slowly recover, the country was able to issue new debt,

00:10:19.522 --> 00:10:26.572
and original creditors could swap their defaulted debt for this new debt at a much lower price,

00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:35.442
so if they held $100 of Argentine debt before, they might be able to swap this for $20 or $30.

00:10:36.232 --> 00:10:39.552
A big loss, yes, but better than getting nothing.

00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:47.942
And almost all, around 93% of its creditors had accepted Argentina’s terms.

00:10:49.662 --> 00:10:53.292
Paul Singer had been watching all of this happen, and

00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:57.442
sensed his opportunity, like a shark he had smelled blood.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:04.022
He had swooped in and bought up a load of Argentine debt at a significantly reduced

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:10.682
price, and as the crisis deepened, he continued to buy up more and more debt.

00:11:12.032 --> 00:11:18.209
All in all, he ended up spending somewhere between $100 and $200 million

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:24.380
on Argentine debt, debt which had a face value of over $2 billion.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:29.572
Almost all the other creditors were accepting the deal

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:33.292
Argentina was proposing - we’ll exchange your debt for new debt.

00:11:33.612 --> 00:11:37.182
You’ll have to take a reduction in its value, but we will pay you.

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:45.202
Singer did not accept, and began a 15-year economic war against the country.

00:11:46.552 --> 00:11:52.352
It started, as these things do, with strongly-worded letters from Singer’s lawyers.

00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:59.042
When this didn’t work, Singer took to fighting Argentina in the law courts.

00:12:00.432 --> 00:12:04.142
Now, your first question might be “what law courts?”

00:12:04.832 --> 00:12:07.052
Singer was an American citizen.

00:12:07.642 --> 00:12:14.012
And technically it wasn’t him, it was his fund, Elliott Management, that owned the debt, or to

00:12:14.012 --> 00:12:21.452
get even more technical, it was a Cayman Islands vehicle called NML Capital Limited, but it’s all

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:27.237
pretty much the same thing, and for the sake of this episode I’ll use the terms interchangeably.

00:12:28.572 --> 00:12:33.952
And Singer, or Elliott Management, was up against the nation of Argentina.

00:12:34.902 --> 00:12:39.222
There is no such global court that settles these kinds of disputes,

00:12:39.672 --> 00:12:44.892
but Argentina had issued the bonds, the debt, in New York.

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:52.072
This was a good idea when they did it, because New York is a global financial centre

00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:57.572
and would mean that Argentina had better access to investors and that the country could

00:12:57.572 --> 00:13:03.012
borrow more money at a better rate than if they had offered the bonds in Buenos Aires.

00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:07.312
But it meant that bonds fell under US law.

00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:13.002
So, Elliot Management took Argentina to court, and

00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:17.372
the case lasted 10 years, a mammoth amount of time.

00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:23.912
During this period, Singer and his lawyers went to extraordinary lengths

00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:29.022
to try to seize possession of Argentine assets around the globe, from

00:13:29.232 --> 00:13:34.672
pension funds to aeroplanes, precious books to a Space-X satellite slot.

00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:41.102
There were even rumours of Argentine works of art not being loaned to foreign

00:13:41.102 --> 00:13:46.142
collections out of fear that Singer would get wind of it and try to seize them.

00:13:47.372 --> 00:13:54.122
Singer wouldn’t be there himself with a baseball bat, of course, his muscle was legal, not physical.

00:13:55.452 --> 00:14:00.802
His tactic was typically to find out when there was any Argentine asset that

00:14:00.822 --> 00:14:07.262
was outside Argentina, and sue to seize that asset in a local law court.

00:14:08.762 --> 00:14:14.202
Probably the most famous of these is one that you may have heard of, and one that was of

00:14:14.242 --> 00:14:20.052
great embarrassment to Argentina and its then president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:27.932
In October of 2012, an Argentine ship was docked in a port in Ghana,

00:14:28.282 --> 00:14:34.112
in Africa, and the Ghanese judge ruled that it should be impounded and

00:14:34.122 --> 00:14:39.112
handed over to Elliot Management, to Paul Singer’s New York hedge fund.

00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:45.952
When Argentina got wind of this, Argentine diplomats reportedly rushed to

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:51.172
hire the top lawyer in Ghana, but when they managed to track him down, they

00:14:51.172 --> 00:14:55.142
were disappointed to find out that he had already been hired by Singer.

00:14:56.452 --> 00:15:04.582
After a tense few days, with 220 Argentinians on board refusing to disembark the ship, but the ship

00:15:04.582 --> 00:15:10.712
not being allowed to leave Ghana, eventually the case was dismissed and the ship was free to go.

00:15:12.342 --> 00:15:14.812
The case was, of course, symbolic.

00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:21.222
Elliott Management didn’t want the boat, and it was only worth a fraction of the value of

00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:28.382
the debt, but the purpose was to send a message: we are not going anywhere, and we will

00:15:28.382 --> 00:15:34.212
continue to haunt you and embarrass you around the globe until you pay us what we want.

00:15:35.482 --> 00:15:42.132
The boat was released, but just a month later, in November of 2012 a New York judge

00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:48.032
ruled in the hedge fund’s favour, ordering Argentina to pay the full value of its debt.

00:15:49.392 --> 00:15:55.702
The judge said, and I’m quoting directly, “Argentina owes this and owes it now."

00:15:56.872 --> 00:16:01.502
The Argentine government appealed the decision, saying it was not fair.

00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:05.012
The appeal was dismissed, it was turned down.

00:16:06.042 --> 00:16:12.162
But the South American nation continued to hold out, saying it would not be taken hostage by

00:16:12.162 --> 00:16:18.502
these vulture financiers who had bought this debt for no reason other than to bring Argentina

00:16:18.502 --> 00:16:24.572
to its knees and force it to pay, and make hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:29.032
So, legally, what could Argentina do?

00:16:30.062 --> 00:16:35.492
Of course, it could simply not pay, which is what it continued doing for several years.

00:16:36.782 --> 00:16:41.602
After all, there was no global financial legal system that was going to force it

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:47.462
to pay, it couldn’t be fined or sent to prison, it was a nation state after all.

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:54.282
But continuing to not pay would mean that the country couldn’t raise any more debt in New York,

00:16:54.672 --> 00:17:01.462
so by continuing to hold out against Singer, it was choking off its ability to raise new debt.

00:17:02.972 --> 00:17:07.735
Unfortunately, there was not much of a choice, but the Argentine president,

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:12.232
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, was proud and not willing to give in.

00:17:13.212 --> 00:17:17.042
It would take a change in Argentine leadership for things to change.

00:17:17.812 --> 00:17:24.302
In 2015, when Fernandez de Kirchner left office, she was replaced by a more

00:17:24.352 --> 00:17:28.992
business-minded President who was keen to put this financial mess behind him.

00:17:30.122 --> 00:17:37.092
In the end, Argentina agreed to pay up, a total of $2.4 billion to Elliott

00:17:37.162 --> 00:17:43.912
Management, meaning that Paul Singer’s fund made over $2 billion from Argentina.

00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:51.192
Now, you might well be listening to this story and thinking “that’s completely immoral, a

00:17:51.402 --> 00:17:56.392
billionaire squeezing every last drop of money out of a country that is already in trouble”.

00:17:57.362 --> 00:18:00.482
Or you might be thinking, “well, it is the law”.

00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:08.482
To take Paul Singer’s side of view for a minute, he has stated that his company, and other similar

00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:14.762
so-called “vulture funds”, are providing an important service, and making countries accountable.

00:18:15.822 --> 00:18:21.022
After all, a debt is a debt, and if a country thinks that they can

00:18:21.062 --> 00:18:26.232
borrow money and then not repay it, then not only is this not right

00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:30.922
but it will cause disruption and distrust in the financial system.

00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:37.462
Or to quote one spokesman for Elliott Management, "Debt relief advocates should

00:18:37.462 --> 00:18:43.092
recognize that the beneficiaries of debt relief are often corrupt or incompetent regimes

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:48.062
that squander their nations' assets and then cry poverty to avoid legitimate debts.

00:18:48.392 --> 00:18:52.932
This cycle must be broken for countries to achieve economic development."

00:18:53.572 --> 00:18:54.172
End quote.

00:18:55.192 --> 00:18:59.702
Or to translate that into plain English, “strange as it might seem, we

00:18:59.702 --> 00:19:03.652
are actually helping the people of these supposedly indebted countries”

00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:10.512
But for those who think that this is grossly immoral, sure, there are certainly

00:19:10.512 --> 00:19:14.112
ways to make money that would probably make you sleep better at night.

00:19:14.972 --> 00:19:19.902
After all, $2.4 billion is money that could otherwise have gone to the people of

00:19:19.902 --> 00:19:26.112
Argentina, it’s just over $50 for every man, woman and child in Argentina that

00:19:26.112 --> 00:19:30.342
has instead gone into the pockets of some of the wealthiest people in the world.

00:19:31.932 --> 00:19:36.800
Paul Singer has an estimated fortune of over $6 billion.

00:19:37.482 --> 00:19:43.342
If he lived in Argentina, he would be the richest person in the country, so surely he doesn’t need

00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:49.632
to go about buying up debt from distressed countries and extorting them until they meet his demands?

00:19:50.912 --> 00:19:55.382
If there’s one thing that’s clear from all of this, it’s that in the case of Paul

00:19:55.392 --> 00:20:00.762
Singer, the kind of professorial, friendly-looking man with the grey hair, trimmed

00:20:00.772 --> 00:20:05.672
beard and round glasses, it’s that you should never judge a book by its cover.

00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:11.612
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Wall Street vs.

00:20:11.642 --> 00:20:14.862
Argentina, Paul Singer and Elliott Management’s battle

00:20:15.002 --> 00:20:18.032
to wrestle billions from the Latin American nation.

00:20:18.862 --> 00:20:23.702
We've got lots of South American listeners, so I wonder…did you know something of this story?

00:20:24.192 --> 00:20:27.322
What do you think of the rights and wrongs of what Singer did?

00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:30.942
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

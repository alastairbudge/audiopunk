Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:15.786
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:19.726
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.226 --> 00:00:25.776
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part-two of our mini-series on the Trojan Horse scandal,

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:31.636
the alleged Islamic plot to infiltrate British schools and radicalise students from within.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:36.935
I should say that if you haven’t listened to part one yet, please press pause and

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:41.416
listen to that, as we are going to pick up directly where we left off last time.

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:45.466
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:55.636
As you’ll remember, in November of 2013 a mystery letter arrived at Birmingham City Council claiming

00:00:55.786 --> 00:01:02.636
that there was a conspiracy to infiltrate British schools and instil hardline Islamic values.

00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:08.776
It alleged the plot was already underway in Birmingham, would spread to other

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:14.876
British cities, and included banning sex education classes, inviting anti-western

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:20.536
speakers into the schools, and even forcing students to attend Friday prayers.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:27.436
When the letter leaked to the press a few months later, the story quickly became a national

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:34.196
scandal and paranoia spread around the country about Islamic conspiracies and Jihadi terror plots.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.316
British schools, it seemed, were under attack.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:45.906
But as you may remember, we left the last episode on a bit of a cliffhanger, a big question.

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:48.606
What if it wasn’t true?

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.396
What if the letter was a fake?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:59.646
Picking up where we left off, by mid-2014, with Britain’s newspapers stuffed full

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:05.426
of scandalous stories about the plot, people demanded answers, and there were

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:10.946
several official investigations into what had been dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse”.

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:18.016
Britain’s Department for Education, OFSTED, which is Britain’s school standards body,

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:22.796
you might remember, and Birmingham City Council all looked into the allegations.

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:28.786
And they didn’t just investigate schools in Birmingham, or the schools named in the

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:36.036
letter, but schools in Luton, Bradford and parts of east London, areas with large Muslim

00:02:36.036 --> 00:02:41.796
populations, and areas, I should stress, that had nothing to do with the original letter.

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:49.146
In Birmingham, which was the focus of the investigations, OFSTED investigated

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:54.194
more than 20 schools they suspected could have been vulnerable to radical Islam.

00:02:55.594 --> 00:03:03.674
The investigators went in for emergency inspections, and In May of 2014 all five

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:09.384
Birmingham schools named in the letter had their official ratings downgraded significantly.

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:16.674
All five were put into what is known as ‘special measures’ - the lowest possible rating.

00:03:17.454 --> 00:03:22.304
Essentially, they were doing very badly and needed urgent attention.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:24.754
That was the official verdict.

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:29.414
Why, you might ask, when we’d already established that

00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:32.734
students’ exam results had improved significantly?

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:37.654
Well, this school regulator gives marks to schools

00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:41.694
based on all sorts of criteria, not just exam results.

00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:48.984
And what they found, the inspectors believed, was cause for serious concern.

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.864
Among the reasons given for these sudden downgrades were that the schools

00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:59.964
didn’t educate students enough about religions other than Islam, didn’t provide

00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:04.614
adequate sex education classes, prevented boys and girls from socialising

00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:10.204
and even segregated some classes, keeping male and female students apart.

00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:16.704
One of the schools at the centre of the controversy, Park View, went from being

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:22.164
rated as ‘outstanding’ to the lowest possible rating despite being the first school

00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:26.684
in the country to be scored ‘outstanding’ under new criteria just two years before.

00:04:28.124 --> 00:04:31.794
If you remember the name “Park View”, yes, that’s the school where

00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:35.964
Tahir Alam, the supposed mastermind of the plot, was governor.

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:42.364
Alam and a number of other teachers and governors were suspended from

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:47.724
teaching, and during the initial media frenzy some reports suggested that

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:52.264
as many as 100 teachers in Birmingham alone were involved in this plot.

00:04:53.724 --> 00:05:00.351
Operation Trojan Horse was, according to the British media at least, a huge conspiracy.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:06.651
But it was the job of the government to find out whether this was really true.

00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:14.871
Was there really some wider conspiracy, a real “Trojan Horse Plot”, or was it simply a case of

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:19.841
some teachers implementing some socially conservative policies that they shouldn’t have done?

00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:25.771
The man tasked with the job of finding out, or at least the man in charge

00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:30.311
of everyone who was tasked with the job, was a man called Michael Gove.

00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:35.661
He was the Secretary for Education at the time, essentially the Minister for

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:41.251
Education, the top official in the country responsible for education and schools.

00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:46.901
Now, we need to talk about Michael Gove, because he is one of the main

00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:52.231
reasons that some have said that this investigation was doomed from the start,

00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:57.411
and that it was more like a witch hunt rather than an impartial inquiry.

00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:05.571
Even before the Trojan Horse affair, Gove had long had an interest, let’s say, in Islam.

00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:12.601
Following the terror attacks in London in 2005, he wrote a book in which he suggested

00:06:12.781 --> 00:06:18.151
that Muslims were more prone to violence and radicalisation than other religions.

00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:25.781
To quote the book directly, Gove wrote that “The west faces a challenge to its values,

00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:32.411
culture and freedom as profound in its way as the threat posed by fascism and communism.”

00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:40.321
He made his views clear from the outset, and was described by one journalist as the, and I’m

00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:46.331
quoting directly, ‘unsung commander in chief of the Islamophobes inside the Conservative Party’.

00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:53.531
This is the man who led the investigation into Operation Trojan Horse; the man who

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:58.161
updated the Prime Minister, British parliament and media throughout the entire scandal.

00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.361
A sceptic might rightly say that he would struggle to

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:05.641
have a completely objective assessment of the matter.

00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:12.711
Crucially, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Gove thought the educational

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:18.321
investigations didn’t go far enough and he asked for a former counter-terrorism

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:22.891
expert, a man named Peter Clarke, to lead another investigation.

00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:27.895
Gove's message was clear: the Trojan Horse affair was not an

00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:32.695
educational issue but a problem of terrorism and extremism.

00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:40.725
Gove had long suspected this of British-Muslims, and now he had the evidence: the letter.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:48.488
But as I alluded to, or mentioned, in part-one, almost immediately after

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:52.704
the letter first leaked many people, including members of Birmingham City

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:58.694
Council, were sceptical of its authenticity, they didn’t think it was real.

00:08:00.174 --> 00:08:02.564
There were a number of issues with the letter.

00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:05.514
Why was there no date, for example?

00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:07.574
Why was it anonymous?

00:08:07.864 --> 00:08:10.494
Why was only part of the letter photocopied?

00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:17.444
And why, many people asked, did the letter seem like a caricature of Islamist extremism?

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:22.824
In fact, it's even thought that Michael Gove was warned by members of

00:08:22.824 --> 00:08:27.254
Birmingham City Council about their doubts surrounding the authenticity

00:08:27.454 --> 00:08:31.584
of the mystery letter, but he ordered the investigation nonetheless.

00:08:33.224 --> 00:08:36.231
So, what did the investigations actually find?

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:42.341
Well, the report, which was released later in 2014, concluded that there

00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:47.781
was, and I’m quoting directly, "no evidence of terrorism, radicalisation

00:08:48.091 --> 00:08:51.641
or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham.”

00:08:52.861 --> 00:08:59.271
However, the report did find, and again I'm quoting directly, "evidence that there are a

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:04.716
number of people, associated with each other and    in positions of influence in schools

00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:11.526
and governing bodies, who espouse, sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views.”

00:09:12.556 --> 00:09:17.796
They found some offensive and conservative WhatsApp messages between Muslim teachers in Birmingham,

00:09:18.196 --> 00:09:25.066
particularly around homosexuality, but there was no evidence of any kind of planned conspiracy.

00:09:26.116 --> 00:09:32.396
In fact, despite all the horror stories and scaremongering about subversive Islamic school

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:39.606
plots, four separate investigations couldn’t find any evidence of a wider organised plot

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:46.156
And as time went on, the number of alleged conspirators, which had

00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:50.296
been as many as 100 in initial newspaper reports, began to drop.

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:57.606
Soon the number was 50, and by 2015, only 15 people faced charges.

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:02.486
And crucially, none of them were charged under terror or

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:06.746
extremism charges, but for ‘undue religious influence’.

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:14.086
These cases were eventually thrown out, they were dismissed in 2017, and

00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:19.096
in the end only one teacher, the former headteacher of one of the primary

00:10:19.096 --> 00:10:22.476
schools named in the letter, had any actual charges made against him.

00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:30.506
After all the media frenzy and social panic, just one person was charged and it wasn’t for

00:10:30.516 --> 00:10:36.856
any kind of terror or extremism offence - nothing even close to what the letter alleged.

00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:42.806
So, what was the impact, the legacy, of this whole affair?

00:10:44.146 --> 00:10:50.816
Firstly, and despite all the investigations finding no evidence of a plot, Operation Trojan Horse

00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:58.146
has since been used as justification to ‘beef up’, or increase, Britain’s counter-extremism agenda.

00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:05.526
The ‘Prevent’ strategy, which is linked with Britain’ anti-terror laws, requires teachers

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:11.366
to be vigilant of and report any evidence of what they believe to be ‘radicalisation.’

00:11:12.966 --> 00:11:19.866
In terms of the impact on race relations, and multiculturalism, it was a huge step back.

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:26.206
The media spent months writing stories about this Trojan Horse plot, and there was

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:31.396
significantly less time spent reporting on the fact that there wasn’t actually a plot at all.

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:37.414
To many British muslims, it seemed like the government was determined to find

00:11:37.424 --> 00:11:42.764
evidence of an extremist plot in British schools, and when there was no evidence

00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:47.664
of any such plot, the government sort of shrugged its shoulders and moved on.

00:11:48.384 --> 00:11:50.404
But the damage was done.

00:11:51.894 --> 00:11:56.454
And for people like Tahir Alam, who was accused of “undermining

00:11:56.464 --> 00:12:01.424
fundamental British values,” their careers and reputations were ruined.

00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:07.568
As of the time of making this episode, Alam is still banned from having any

00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:12.168
involvement with schools in Britain, and his contribution to the Alum Rock

00:12:12.178 --> 00:12:16.858
community and academic turnaround at Park View have long been forgotten.

00:12:18.068 --> 00:12:22.188
Most of the schools named in the Trojan Horse letter have been renamed

00:12:22.318 --> 00:12:26.638
and had a complete overhaul of the governing boards and teaching staff.

00:12:27.628 --> 00:12:32.948
It didn’t really matter if no evidence of a wider plot was found, the idea of

00:12:32.948 --> 00:12:38.718
Islamic extremism in British schools just felt right for certain people, and the

00:12:38.718 --> 00:12:44.158
schools needed to be rebranded and injected with some so-called ‘British values’.

00:12:45.238 --> 00:12:51.448
Now, this Trojan Horse Scandal was big news at the time in the UK, as you've heard,

00:12:51.498 --> 00:12:56.708
but it wouldn’t be until almost a decade later, when it gained a global audience,

00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:01.618
with the release of a podcast series about it called “The Trojan Horse Affair”.

00:13:02.778 --> 00:13:09.048
This 2022 series, which was produced jointly between media powerhouses Serial

00:13:09.218 --> 00:13:13.868
and the New York Times, is a seriously in-depth investigation which tries to

00:13:13.868 --> 00:13:19.428
figure out exactly what happened and, crucially, who wrote the mystery letter.

00:13:20.658 --> 00:13:26.348
In fact, this podcast series ended up opening up the scandal again, and, as

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:31.338
sometimes happens, the two reporters actually became characters in the story.

00:13:32.088 --> 00:13:35.048
So, it’s worth talking about this podcast briefly.

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:38.908
And of course, if you would like to listen to this entire series yourself,

00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:43.048
you can find it on any podcast player - it’s called "The Trojan Horse Affair”.

00:13:44.288 --> 00:13:49.548
Now, this podcast’s main concern isn’t about the rights and wrongs of the

00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:55.068
schools, its main objective is figuring out who wrote the Trojan Horse letter.

00:13:56.268 --> 00:14:00.978
After all, the scandal was started by this letter, this letter is the

00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:06.048
only “proof” that exists, so it does seem like a sensible place to start.

00:14:07.498 --> 00:14:13.018
This podcast starts with the point of view that the letter was certainly fake, which

00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:16.948
is a point of view that is held by pretty much every media outlet that has looked

00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:23.188
into it, but the podcast tries to answer the question of “who sent it and why?”

00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:27.898
Was it some anti-Islamic teacher or member of the public?

00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:30.301
Was it an enemy of Tahir Alam?

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:36.388
A prankster, a joker, someone who didn’t know what kind of trouble they would have unleashed?

00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:41.638
The conclusion this podcast comes to, or its hypothesis at

00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:45.938
least, is actually less interesting, it's more boring, than that.

00:14:47.338 --> 00:14:52.378
Their theory, and I must say that there is some evidence for this, is that the

00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:57.168
letter was written and sent by a headteacher from another Birmingham school.

00:14:58.088 --> 00:14:59.388
Why, you might ask?

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:05.838
Their suggestion is that there was a legal dispute between a headteacher and her teaching

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:11.428
assistants, and that creating another scandal would distract from the legal dispute.

00:15:12.618 --> 00:15:17.132
If that is indeed the truth, then it is quite undramatic.

00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:23.088
There was no Islamic conspiracy in the first place, and in fact, there was

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:27.665
no anti-Islamic conspiracy behind the letter, it was simply a case of a

00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:31.785
headteacher having some personal difficulties that she wanted to go away.

00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:37.225
Now, this podcast series, as you may know, was hugely

00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:41.075
popular, but it did have its fair share of critics.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:49.135
Many say that the podcast is one-sided, and ignores the homophobia and sexism present in

00:15:49.135 --> 00:15:54.945
Birmingham schools in order to defend Tahir Alam, who speaks at length with the journalists.

00:15:55.765 --> 00:16:00.075
It has also been criticised in the British press for ‘cherry picking’

00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:03.955
facts that support their theory, that is, only selecting some

00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:07.565
evidence and ignoring other pieces of evidence that contradict it.

00:16:08.765 --> 00:16:14.935
Michael Gove, the former Secretary of Education, roundly rejected the podcast and described

00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:21.205
the two journalists, one of whom is a British-Pakistani from Birmingham, as ‘useful idiots’.

00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:28.935
And the show was criticised by some listeners for having a boring, uneventful ending.

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:35.135
The reporters never managed to definitively prove who wrote the letter, or why.

00:16:36.055 --> 00:16:43.295
Yes, it provides some suggestions, but it never manages to come to any neat, clever conclusion.

00:16:44.495 --> 00:16:50.205
And you might rightly criticise me, and this episode, this mini-series for

00:16:50.205 --> 00:16:56.305
finishing in a similarly uneventful way, without any real conclusions or answers.

00:16:57.435 --> 00:17:00.845
But what I do want to leave you with are some questions and

00:17:01.055 --> 00:17:05.975
reflections on what this entire scandal, this story, left behind.

00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:11.335
What’s the real story, or meaning, behind so-called Operation Trojan

00:17:11.335 --> 00:17:15.985
Horse and what does it tell us about British society more broadly?

00:17:16.965 --> 00:17:22.775
Almost ten years later, the Trojan Horse affair is still one of the most divisive episodes in

00:17:22.805 --> 00:17:28.865
Britain’s long process of social integration, multiculturalism, and relationship with Islam.

00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:34.585
Even if no evidence of a plot was found, for people who wanted to

00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:39.345
believe that there was, this entire scandal symbolised the failures

00:17:39.515 --> 00:17:44.115
of British multiculturalism and dangers of radical Islam in society.

00:17:45.495 --> 00:17:50.635
Regardless of the evidence, to some people, Muslims plotting to take over

00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:55.235
British institutions just sounded right, it played into what they wanted

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:59.792
to believe, even if the investigations didn't find any evidence of this.

00:18:01.342 --> 00:18:07.862
For others, the whole thing was a media-generated moral panic and represents how

00:18:07.872 --> 00:18:12.482
British Muslims, and the British-Pakistani community in particular, are viewed.

00:18:13.772 --> 00:18:20.832
And despite the letter almost certainly being fake, it was too late - the damage was already done.

00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:27.882
Now, were there Muslim teachers in majority Muslim areas of Birmingham who held,

00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:32.622
and perhaps even encouraged socially conservative views with their students?

00:18:33.542 --> 00:18:38.952
It seems that this is almost certainly true, and there was little evidence to hide this.

00:18:39.862 --> 00:18:43.872
Were certain school governors like Tahir Alam targeting

00:18:43.882 --> 00:18:46.652
Muslim teachers for his Muslim-majority schools?

00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:51.302
Certainly, he admits as much; it was part of his entire

00:18:51.342 --> 00:18:55.312
educational philosophy, and it seemed to have very good results.

00:18:56.862 --> 00:19:01.012
That is something entirely different to a conspiracy to infiltrate British

00:19:01.152 --> 00:19:06.022
schools, but it did leave some people asking some important questions.

00:19:07.082 --> 00:19:13.592
If making cultural changes to a school lead to better academic outcomes, should these be acceptable?

00:19:14.462 --> 00:19:16.442
Where should the line be drawn?

00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:23.242
What are “British” values, are there any “British” values, should these be taught in

00:19:23.242 --> 00:19:28.172
schools, especially schools where most pupils come from a different cultural background?

00:19:29.152 --> 00:19:33.822
How should a school in a multicultural society be run, according to the

00:19:33.992 --> 00:19:38.602
religious customs of most of its pupils, or without any religion at all?

00:19:40.142 --> 00:19:47.422
These are some big questions, and despite the huge media frenzy, the tens of thousands

00:19:47.422 --> 00:19:52.582
of hours spent on investigations into the scandal, and the millions of words printed

00:19:52.582 --> 00:19:58.642
about it, it seems like we are not all that much closer to agreeing on any answers.

00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:05.961
Ok then, that is it for part two of this mini-series on the Trojan Horse

00:20:05.961 --> 00:20:10.831
affair, a complicated scandal that all started with a mystery letter but

00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:14.821
became a frenzied debate about Islam and social integration in Britain.

00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:19.481
I should say, as a final message, that if you think this sounds like

00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:22.691
an interesting story, and you would like to listen to 8 more hours

00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:25.781
about it, then you can listen to the Serial podcast I mentioned.

00:20:26.301 --> 00:20:31.001
It is a good listen, although some of the accents are quite tricky to understand.

00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:37.651
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode and this mini-series in general.

00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:40.721
What do you think about this entire affair?

00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:46.101
How do you think people would have reacted in your country, if there had been a similar scandal?

00:20:46.941 --> 00:20:52.011
Have you already listened to the Serial podcast about this, and if so what did you think?

00:20:52.741 --> 00:20:56.171
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.480
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.520
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.840
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
It’s a part of the Atlantic Ocean that some people believe is exceptionally

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.220
dangerous for ships, planes, and anything that ventures into it.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.059
So today we are going to lift the curtain.

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:51.401
We’ll explain what it is, what people think has happened there, why people

00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:57.211
think it happened, and then we’ll explain what other, perhaps more reputable,

00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:02.591
more believe people, think actually goes on in the Bermuda Triangle.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:07.681
OK then, without further ado, let’s get right into it.

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:17.221
If you imagine the Atlantic Ocean, and draw a line from Florida to almost the middle of

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:25.032
the ocean, to the island of Bermuda, then down towards Puerto Rico, this forms a triangle,

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:33.082
and it covers an area of anything from 1 million to 4 million square kilometres of ocean.

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:40.382
And until relatively recently, nobody really thought much of it.

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:47.222
It was just a piece of the ocean like any other, but in the past 50 years or so,

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:54.312
it has developed a reputation as being a dangerous, treacherous part of the ocean

00:01:54.732 --> 00:02:00.272
that has caused the disappearance and deaths of multiple ships and aeroplanes.

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:05.682
It was popularised with the help of a best-selling book

00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:10.862
called The Bermuda Triangle, by a man called Charles Berlitz.

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:18.112
If you recognise the name Berlitz, this author, Charles Berlitz was actually

00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:24.582
the grandson of Maximillian Berlitz, the founder of the famous language schools.

00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:31.122
Charles Berlitz did have a pretty strange upbringing, and it’s interesting to

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:36.542
mention this quickly because it does relate to language learning and is quite fun.

00:02:37.482 --> 00:02:43.672
So by the time he was a teenager, Charles Berlitz could speak 8 languages fluently.

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:48.462
This wasn’t because he was forced to study, or because

00:02:48.482 --> 00:02:52.652
the Berlitz family had some amazing gift for languages.

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:58.652
But rather that his father insisted that every relative and

00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:02.922
servant in his house spoke to him in a different language.

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:10.062
His mother spoke to him in French, his father spoke to him in German, his grandfather

00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:16.792
spoke to him in Russian, and his cousins and nannies would speak to him in Spanish.

00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:24.872
You can imagine that must have been very confusing for a little baby, and Berlitz later

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:31.062
said in an interview that he just thought every person had a different way of speaking.

00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:33.252
Amazing, right?

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:37.032
As someone who is trying to bring up a little trilingual

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:40.342
baby at the moment, it’s awesome to hear stories like this.

00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:47.252
Getting back to the Bermuda Triangle, Berlitz was clearly a sensationalist, and

00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:53.568
his book on the Bermuda Triangle told the stories of unsolved mysteries, suggesting

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:59.708
possible reasons for the disappearances of ships and planes in this area of the ocean.

00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:06.888
These reasons included alien abductions, and that the ancient city of

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:12.988
Atlantis is beneath the Bermuda Triangle, and sucks ships and planes down.

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:21.438
Now, these theories may sound hard to believe to you or me, but the book captured

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:27.608
people’s attention, and sold 20 million copies in 30 different languages.

00:04:29.028 --> 00:04:35.238
Before we pass judgment on whether it was indeed aliens, Atlantis, or

00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:39.448
something else that caused the disappearance of these ships and planes,

00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:45.588
let’s tell their stories because they are, if nothing else, intriguing.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:52.588
Our first mysterious story is of a ship called the USS Cyclops.

00:04:54.068 --> 00:05:03.308
The Cyclops left Rio de Janeiro on the 16th of February, 1918, carrying over 10,000 tonnes of

00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:09.788
something called manganese ore, a type of chemical used to make weapons, amongst other things.

00:05:10.898 --> 00:05:16.978
The ship arrived at the island of Barbados, and then set off towards the United States.

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.788
But it never arrived.

00:05:20.168 --> 00:05:24.988
It completely disappeared, never even sending a message to

00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:29.798
shore, or any kind of radio signal that it was in trouble.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:38.588
It just vanished, this huge, massive ship, along with its crew of 309 people.

00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:44.538
To this day, it remains the largest single loss of life in the

00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:49.688
US navy that isn’t directly related to fighting, to combat.

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:58.617
And weirdly enough, two of the sister ships of the USS Cyclops also were lost in the North

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:05.707
Atlantic decades later, during World War II, while they were carrying the same kind of material.

00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:12.377
Now, there are obviously lots of things that could have happened here, from the most

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:18.507
plausible explanation that the ship was just carrying too much, it was too heavy, and

00:06:18.527 --> 00:06:25.727
it sank, or it was pushed over by a large wave, or even that it was sunk by the enemy.

00:06:27.297 --> 00:06:32.227
But, to Berlitz, and to those who believe in the mystery of

00:06:32.227 --> 00:06:37.147
the Bermuda Triangle, the story of the USS Cyclops is strange.

00:06:38.227 --> 00:06:43.137
Why would a seemingly functioning ship just disappear like that?

00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:47.427
Why was there no signal to say that it was in trouble?

00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:52.527
To the conspiracy theorist, there are some unanswered questions.

00:06:54.107 --> 00:07:00.637
Moving on, our second incident that is often used as evidence for the mysterious

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:06.177
powers of the Bermuda Triangle involves a ship called the Ellen Austin.

00:07:07.647 --> 00:07:15.517
The story goes that around 1880, the large passenger ship, Ellen Austin left for

00:07:15.517 --> 00:07:21.111
New York from Liverpool, full of people looking to seek a new life in America.

00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:27.521
A few weeks into the trip, the captain saw another ship in the distance.

00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:33.181
He looked through his binoculars, but the ship seemed abandoned.

00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:40.881
He thought, well that’s strange, but was cautious about getting any closer.

00:07:41.237 --> 00:07:48.101
It could be a pirate trick, and his focus should be on sailing onwards to New York.

00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:55.611
After a few days, and with this mysterious abandoned ship still floating near

00:07:55.611 --> 00:08:01.071
them, he ordered a small crew, a small group of men, to go and check it out.

00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:05.701
So they took a small boat, boarded the larger one,

00:08:06.001 --> 00:08:09.471
and sure enough, they found it completely abandoned.

00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:19.561
This abandoned boat had a large amount of mahogany, a valuable wood, still onboard, so the captain

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:26.471
decided to keep the boat, and he could sell the wood for a profit when they got to New York.

00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:35.148
The crew that had got onto the deserted ship remained there, and the two ships sailed on together.

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:41.938
But shortly after, there was a huge storm, and the two boats got separated.

00:08:43.408 --> 00:08:47.398
After a few days, the mystery boat reappeared in the

00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:51.888
distance, and the captain ordered his men to sail towards it.

00:08:53.468 --> 00:08:57.868
But as they got closer, they saw that there was nobody on the boat.

00:08:58.908 --> 00:09:00.368
It was abandoned again.

00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:06.788
The captain was understandably reluctant to send more men

00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:11.268
to the boat, but he was persuaded to do so by his crew.

00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:16.598
Another group of men got on a smaller boat, and they went out

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.888
to the mystery ship, got on board, and took control of it.

00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:27.548
They then had this mystery ship under control, and the two ships set off together again.

00:09:29.088 --> 00:09:33.708
A few days later, a dense fog descended upon the two

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:38.248
ships, and the captain lost sight of the other ship.

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:43.678
The only thing that reassured him that the ship was still there

00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:48.658
was a bell that was ringing, so they could hear each other.

00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:56.998
But the ringing of the bell grew fainter and fainter, and then it just disappeared.

00:09:58.418 --> 00:10:03.818
The fog lifted, but this mystery ship was nowhere to be seen.

00:10:04.828 --> 00:10:09.168
It had just disappeared, with the group of men still on it.

00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:18.298
Now, if this story sounds too mysterious and weird to be true, it’s probably because it is.

00:10:19.188 --> 00:10:26.558
Researchers have looked into it and there are a load of factual inaccuracies, from the fact

00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:32.418
that the route from Liverpool to New York wouldn’t have taken you near the Bermuda Triangle,

00:10:32.888 --> 00:10:39.778
through to the fact that official documents don’t have any record of any crew going missing.

00:10:41.148 --> 00:10:47.048
So there are a lot of problems with that story, but it remains an attractive story,

00:10:47.508 --> 00:10:52.838
and you can understand how it is tempting to believe it, despite the fact that

00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:57.638
there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there isn’t much truth to it at all.

00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:04.858
Another story that is often cited to demonstrate the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle,

00:11:05.138 --> 00:11:10.698
despite the fact that where this incident took place is the other side of the Atlantic

00:11:10.718 --> 00:11:16.508
Ocean from the Bermuda Triangle, is the story of a ship called the Mary Celeste.

00:11:17.988 --> 00:11:24.468
On the 4th of December, 1872, this ship was found just off

00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:28.728
the coast of the Azores, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:11:30.268 --> 00:11:37.418
It had set off a few weeks before, from New York, and was on the way to Genoa, in Italy.

00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:41.228
There had been seven people on the ship.

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:48.618
An experienced captain, called Benjamin Briggs, as well as his wife and two-year-old daughter.

00:11:50.058 --> 00:11:56.798
The ship had been carrying a lot of pure alcohol, in barrels deep inside the ship.

00:11:58.388 --> 00:12:03.678
When it was found, the Mary Celeste was still in pretty ok condition.

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:10.758
A little bit of damage, but nothing more than was normal for a ship crossing a stormy ocean.

00:12:12.188 --> 00:12:17.328
However, the crew, the people on board were nowhere to be seen.

00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:22.758
The lifeboat, the small boat that you would use to

00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:26.388
escape from a ship if there’s a problem, was gone.

00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:29.228
Disappeared, nowhere in sight.

00:12:30.698 --> 00:12:37.198
And Captain Benjamin Briggs, his family, and the lifeboat, have never been found.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.318
This case puzzled everyone who looked at it.

00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:49.116
Why would an experienced captain abandon his ship, when it was in perfectly good condition?

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:51.786
Especially in the middle of the ocean.

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:59.216
The ship had enough food and drink to last 6 months, and was a very safe place to be.

00:13:00.136 --> 00:13:04.396
It made absolutely no sense, and people obviously tried

00:13:04.406 --> 00:13:07.766
to find explanations for what could have happened.

00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:15.816
Was the ship attacked by pirates, and they had killed the crew and then disappeared?

00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:21.136
That didn’t seem plausible, because there were still a lot of

00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:25.906
valuables left onboard, and these would have been taken by the pirates.

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:30.886
Was it some kind of trick by Briggs, the captain?

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:37.796
Had he formed a plot with the captain of the other boat, the one that found the Mary

00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:44.036
Celeste, and they would share the compensation money from the insurance company?

00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:50.196
That seemed improbable, not very likely, and in any

00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:53.916
case, where would Briggs and his family have gone?

00:13:55.496 --> 00:14:01.626
Or was it something more paranormal, some huge sea squid,

00:14:02.016 --> 00:14:05.806
a monster that had taken the captain and his family?

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:13.606
Obviously, that is quite far-fetched, and nobody really took these theories seriously.

00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:20.826
What seems clear is that something must have happened that was frightening enough to

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:28.676
cause Briggs to abandon the ship, but to this day, we will likely never know what it was.

00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:37.106
There are all sorts of stories like this, of unexplained mysteries of ships disappearing in

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:44.056
and around this part of the Atlantic, and people like Charles Berlitz have suggested that

00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:49.656
there is something mysterious and dangerous about this area, about the Bermuda Triangle.

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:54.266
So, is there any truth to it at all?

00:14:55.236 --> 00:15:02.996
The reality is that ships do go missing in the Bermuda Triangle, but, statistically,

00:15:02.996 --> 00:15:08.916
they don’t go missing any more in the Bermuda Triangle than anywhere else in the world.

00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:22.552
Lloyds of London, the large insurance market, has said that statistically, there is no

00:15:16.552 --> 00:15:23.280
higher risk of a ship sinking in the Bermuda Triangle than anywhere else in the world.

00:15:23.326 --> 00:15:29.916
It’s a very busy part of the ocean, with thousands of ships passing through it at any time.

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:36.426
It’s also an area that is prone to bad weather, hurricanes,

00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:41.736
huge waves, and tornadoes, which makes sailing difficult.

00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:48.177
And if a ship does capsize, if it does fall over and sink to the

00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:53.317
bottom, then there are some incredibly deep parts of the ocean.

00:15:54.157 --> 00:15:58.827
Indeed, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean, a place

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:02.427
called the Milwaukee Depth, is in the Bermuda Triangle.

00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:10.697
It’s over 8,000 metres deep, almost as far below the surface as Mount Everest is tall.

00:16:11.917 --> 00:16:16.267
So if a ship does capsize and fall to the bottom of

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:19.527
the ocean, it will probably never be found again.

00:16:20.977 --> 00:16:26.517
So, with all this in mind, it’s unfortunate, but certainly not

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:31.967
unexpected, that some ships will just disappear in the Bermuda Triangle.

00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:38.807
But we as humans don’t like not understanding stuff.

00:16:39.277 --> 00:16:45.807
And the idea that something could just disappear and there’s probably a logical reason but we

00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:52.897
will never know what it is, this is something that we are not good at processing, so this causes

00:16:52.897 --> 00:17:01.207
us to latch on to other ideas, we prefer to believe that there must be some other explanation.

00:17:02.697 --> 00:17:09.567
We did an episode last month on QAnon, and there was one a few months ago on Conspiracy Theories.

00:17:10.317 --> 00:17:12.947
If you’ve listened to these two, you’ll

00:17:12.947 --> 00:17:16.717
know that we, as humans, are just awful

00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:17.927
with uncertainty.

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:22.737
We seek meaning in everything, and we radically

00:17:22.757 --> 00:17:26.987
misunderstand the role of probability and statistics.

00:17:27.837 --> 00:17:30.827
We mistake correlation for causality.

00:17:31.277 --> 00:17:36.817
We see that ships have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle, and believe that

00:17:36.827 --> 00:17:41.497
there must be something weird and supernatural about that part of the ocean,

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:47.567
instead of looking at the facts that it’s a very large area, with lots of ships

00:17:47.627 --> 00:17:52.807
and frequent bad weather and it’s probably quite likely that some will disappear.

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:58.157
It’s like looking at a road map of a country and saying

00:17:58.167 --> 00:18:01.817
that all the car accidents seem to happen on the roads.

00:18:02.507 --> 00:18:05.337
Of course they do, because that’s where the cars are.

00:18:06.557 --> 00:18:12.317
Or, there was a map I saw the other day from someone putting out a theory

00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:17.637
that the 5G network was causing the Coronavirus in the United States.

00:18:18.067 --> 00:18:20.667
They showed two maps of the United States.

00:18:21.007 --> 00:18:25.207
One with the new Coronavirus cases, as dots on the map.

00:18:25.667 --> 00:18:29.757
And the other one with where the 5G network was being put down.

00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:34.427
They were almost exactly the same, and this was being

00:18:34.437 --> 00:18:39.847
used to show, conclusively that 5G causes the Coronavirus.

00:18:41.017 --> 00:18:47.017
However, these dots, these marks on the map were just towns and cities.

00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:53.617
The map would have looked almost exactly the same if instead of 5G masts,

00:18:53.857 --> 00:18:59.737
you put McDonalds, or traffic lights, or coffee cups, or almost anything.

00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:07.407
So, if you were looking for The Mystery of The Bermuda Triangle, I’m sorry to disappoint you.

00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:14.357
Any serious scientist, researcher, and most serious people agree

00:19:14.577 --> 00:19:17.837
that there is nothing particularly mysterious going on there.

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:24.267
Yes, there are many stories of ships disappearing that we can’t explain.

00:19:25.277 --> 00:19:30.957
But explaining that with sea monsters, Atlantis, or aliens

00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:35.147
abducting sailors does seem like a little bit of a stretch.

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:42.137
The grandfather of this paranormal theory, Charles Berlitz, certainly has a lot to answer for.

00:19:43.437 --> 00:19:48.657
His stories of the paranormal activities in the Bermuda Triangle do make

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:54.037
for excellent stories, but at the end of the day he should definitely be

00:19:54.037 --> 00:19:58.807
placed in the ‘fiction’ section of the bookshop, not the ‘geography’ one.

00:20:01.297 --> 00:20:04.777
OK then, that is it for The Bermuda Triangle.

00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:10.627
If you were in two minds about whether The Bermuda Triangle was actually any more

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:15.687
dangerous than any other part of the world, I hope that this has put your mind at rest.

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:20.787

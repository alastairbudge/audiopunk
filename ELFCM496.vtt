Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.320
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.619
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.930
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about British politics.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.930
As you probably know, just over a month ago there was a general election in the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.220
United Kingdom, which resulted in a new government and a new Prime Minister.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.470
So in this episode, we are going to talk about what this means, who the new Prime Minister is, what

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.614
are some of the greatest challenges facing him and his party, what might lie in store for the United

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:55.783
Kingdom, and we’ll even learn the meaning and political implications of the unusual acronym, NIMBY.

00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:59.804
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.494
results and consequences of the UK general election.

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:08.324
You might remember an episode from a couple of months ago

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:12.634
where we talked about the then-upcoming UK general election.

00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:17.614
The Prime Minister at the time, Rishi Sunak, had decided to call

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:22.101
a surprise general election, which was to be held on July 4th.

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:26.574
Many people, myself included, wondered why.

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:29.444
It seemed like a strange decision.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:37.274
It was a gamble, the Conservatives had awful approval ratings, and it seemed highly unlikely

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:42.634
that Rishi Sunak and his party, The Conservatives, would be able to hold on to power.

00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:49.224
In fact, all of the polls suggested that it would lead to a catastrophic defeat.

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:52.514
And these polls were correct.

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:57.554
As the results came in it was clear that the British people had

00:01:57.564 --> 00:02:02.634
voted the Conservatives out of power, and Labour gained a majority.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:08.249
The UK would have a new Prime Minister in the form of Keir Starmer,

00:02:08.474 --> 00:02:13.824
and Labour would be back in power after 14 years in opposition.

00:02:14.924 --> 00:02:19.604
Now, we are not going to talk too much about the results of the election here,

00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:25.874
but rather focus on the proposed policies of Keir Starmer and the Labour Party.

00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:32.484
Before we do that, though, we need a little bit of background which I hope will help

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:39.374
you understand why Labour won, and why the Labour Party has the focusses that it has.

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:45.751
A good clue for this can be found in the title of the Labour Party manifesto.

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:51.018
In fact, the title is only one word: Change.

00:02:52.258 --> 00:02:57.578
Now, of course, change is always a key theme of any election; any

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:01.958
politician who is not in power always campaigns on a message of

00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.908
change, because they are asking the public to vote for precisely that.

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:11.938
But in the case of British politics, it was especially important.

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:18.748
The Conservative Party, or the Tory Party as it is more commonly known, had been

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:26.198
in power since 2010, and despite its promises to be careful stewards of the British

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:32.368
economy, British living standards and real wages have stagnated, they have not grown.

00:03:33.398 --> 00:03:38.088
In fact, across large parts of the country, many people felt

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:43.838
like life had got worse under the Tories, and enough was enough.

00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:51.308
What’s more, there was scandal on scandal, the Conservatives had gone through five different

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:57.418
Prime Ministers, and many commentators were saying that they had wrecked the British economy and

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:03.908
put their cronies–their friends, family and associates–above the interests of the British people.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:10.928
For many people, anything was better than another 5 years of Conservative government.

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:19.348
Given this, Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, had a relatively easy path to power.

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:25.148
He didn’t need to be particularly charismatic, he didn’t need any huge or

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:31.468
revolutionary policy ideas, he needed to present himself as a serious and capable

00:04:31.468 --> 00:04:37.918
individual, and most importantly, a breath of fresh air compared to the Tories.

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.008
The election was his to lose.

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:48.018
Now, let me tell you a little bit about Keir Starmer himself before we get into his policies.

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:55.338
As opposed to recent Conservative Prime Ministers such as David Cameron, Boris Johnson and

00:04:55.498 --> 00:05:02.238
most recently Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer did not go to an elite, expensive, private school.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:07.662
He had a normal, middle-class upbringing, the child of a nurse and a toolmaker,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.548
which he spoke about extensively during the election campaign to portray himself

00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:17.988
as a man of the people, unlike his Tory counterpart, Rishi Sunak, who is a former

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:22.948
Goldman Sachs banker and is married to the daughter of an Indian multi-billionaire.

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:28.592
Although Keir Starmer was active in politics from a young age, joining

00:05:28.592 --> 00:05:32.732
the Labour Party at the age of 16, he didn’t go straight into politics.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:39.542
After graduating from Oxford University he became a human rights lawyer before switching to

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:45.042
becoming a public prosecutor, prosecuting people accused of crimes on behalf of the state.

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:53.142
And he only entered politics relatively late in life, in 2015 at the age of 53.

00:05:54.492 --> 00:05:58.032
As to his character, well, he has made it part of

00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:01.932
his public persona to keep a relatively low profile.

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:08.782
He presents himself as an honest, serious and trustworthy man, a capable

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:12.832
operator who will get on with the job of running the country rather

00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:17.192
than spending his time campaigning or doing interviews or press shows.

00:06:18.582 --> 00:06:24.602
And this is a key part of his appeal after the chaos of 14 years of the Conservatives.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:30.462
So, what are the big challenges that lie ahead for Britain, and what

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:33.992
does Keir Starmer and the Labour Party propose to do about them?

00:06:34.802 --> 00:06:41.712
Well, to go back to the manifesto again, there are six key items on the “first steps” for change.

00:06:42.582 --> 00:06:45.462
Number one: Deliver economic stability

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.082
Number two: Cut NHS waiting times.

00:06:49.722 --> 00:06:52.622
NHS is short for the National Health Service.

00:06:53.482 --> 00:06:57.122
Number three: Launch a new Border Security Command

00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:00.192
Number four: Set up Great British Energy

00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:04.192
Number five: Crack down on antisocial behaviour.

00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:09.532
And the final one: Recruitt 6,500 new teachers, paid

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:12.942
for by removing tax breaks on private school fees.

00:07:14.242 --> 00:07:19.362
Now, we aren’t going to go into each of these policies one by one, but it

00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:23.502
gives you some sense of the overall vision the Labour party has for Britain.

00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:28.902
It touches on lots of key concerns for British voters: the economy,

00:07:29.152 --> 00:07:34.702
the NHS, immigration, energy prices, policing and education.

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:40.302
As you may know, the Labour Party is traditionally left of centre,

00:07:40.612 --> 00:07:44.952
and for much of its time in opposition, under the leadership of Ed

00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:49.262
Milliband and then Jeremy Corbyn, it was significantly left-wing.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:56.822
Keir Starmer has brought the party back towards the centre, and as you can see, his

00:07:56.822 --> 00:08:02.212
Labour Party is more about fairness and equality than drastic wealth distribution.

00:08:02.942 --> 00:08:07.552
Yes, there is the removal of a tax break on private schools, but during

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:11.562
the election campaign he promised to not raise taxes on companies

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:16.002
nor will he increase income or consumption taxes on individuals.

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:22.342
His proposal to the British public is that the country can invest in things like the NHS and

00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:28.872
increased border security primarily through economic growth and sensible good governance.

00:08:30.222 --> 00:08:36.982
The Tory government was such a mess, he says, it chased vanity projects such as sending asylum

00:08:36.982 --> 00:08:42.992
seekers to Rwanda, that simply by sticking to good governance and delivering economic growth

00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:48.642
the country will be able to get back on its feet and pay for new programmes and services.

00:08:50.032 --> 00:08:53.472
This being said, his government is likely to be the most

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:58.212
interventionist government in recent history, certainly in my lifetime.

00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:05.392
By interventionist, I mean involved in areas of society and the economy that other governments

00:09:05.602 --> 00:09:11.232
either outsourced to the private sector or just didn’t get involved in in the first place.

00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:16.902
He has plans to renationalise part of the British railways, he wants to

00:09:16.902 --> 00:09:21.612
create a national British energy organisation, he wants the state to be more

00:09:21.632 --> 00:09:25.905
involved than it was under previous Conservative and Labour governments.

00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:31.785
Starmer’s view is that the free market alone can’t be relied on to deliver

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:36.625
economic growth and prosperity, and that limited government intervention is

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:41.375
required to make sure that the benefits of economic growth are felt by all.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:47.205
Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in his housing policy.

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:55.995
Now, as some background, like in many countries, the UK has a dire housing shortage.

00:09:56.495 --> 00:10:01.345
The country simply doesn’t build enough homes to keep up with rising demand.

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:05.395
And as anyone who has ever taken an economics class

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:09.885
will know, if demand outstrips supply, prices rise.

00:10:11.035 --> 00:10:17.985
And in the UK the cost of housing has increased dramatically, making it harder and harder for young

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:23.675
people to get on the property ladder, which is the term we use to mean buying your first house.

00:10:25.155 --> 00:10:30.715
When the Conservatives came into power, in May of 2010, the average house

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:39.127
price in the UK was £170,000, but last year it reached almost £300,000.

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:49.890
Or to give you the figures in Euros, the average house price went from around €195,000 to €350,000.

00:10:51.165 --> 00:10:53.945
And this is the UK average.

00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:58.575
In some parts of the country, they have increased by an even greater margin.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:04.715
And this has not been followed by an increase in wages, in average salaries.

00:11:05.955 --> 00:11:11.615
What this has led to is an entire generation of young British people for whom house

00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:17.495
ownership is a pipe dream, something that will be impossible to achieve without a large

00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:22.655
amount of help from their parents, and they end up stuck in a cycle of ever-increasing

00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:28.335
rent and never being able to save enough to put down a deposit on their own property.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:35.115
The Conservative government did pledge to tackle the problem and vowed to get the number

00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:42.135
of new homes built each year up to 300,000, but the most they managed was 250,000.

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:44.915
It just isn’t enough to meet demand.

00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:52.495
And this isn’t because of laziness or incompetence or a lack of homebuilding companies.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.825
It is a question of regulation.

00:11:55.925 --> 00:12:00.435
Like in most countries, the UK has some pretty strict

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:03.965
laws and regulations about where houses can be built.

00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:09.795
Fair enough, you might think, someone can’t just buy a plot of land next

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:14.075
to a picturesque river or forest and decide to put up a block of flats.

00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:19.865
However the regulations are so strict that it is difficult for any land

00:12:20.035 --> 00:12:24.985
to be greenlighted for new housing developments, and the result is that

00:12:24.985 --> 00:12:28.815
housebuilders aren’t able to build enough houses to meet the demand.

00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:34.275
As part of his election campaign, Keir Starmer promised that his government

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:39.395
would build 1.5 million homes during its 5-year term in government.

00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:44.655
What’s more, a good proportion of these houses will be earmarked as

00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:49.065
affordable housing, to be made available for people on lower incomes.

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:55.155
And to clarify, the state isn’t building these houses itself, what the

00:12:55.155 --> 00:13:00.155
Labour Party is pledging is to eliminate or at least loosen planning

00:13:00.185 --> 00:13:04.575
regulations so that housing can be built in areas where it was previously not.

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:09.005
Now, this sounds perfectly sensible in practice.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:14.445
The UK’s housing shortage is undeniable, and there is plenty of room to build.

00:13:15.109 --> 00:13:17.655
But not everyone is so keen.

00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:21.565
And it’s here that I’d like to introduce you to an acronym.

00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:30.895
It is NIMBY - NIMBY - and it stands for “not in my back yard”.

00:13:32.105 --> 00:13:35.885
It is used to describe people who like the idea of something

00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:41.015
happening in general but they don’t want it to happen close to them.

00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:47.905
Some political commentators have pointed out that this ambitious goal of 1.5 million

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:53.385
new homes might have won Labour some new voters, people whose children might be

00:13:53.385 --> 00:13:57.385
struggling to get on to the property ladder, or just people who know about the UK

00:13:57.405 --> 00:14:02.475
housing shortage and understand that building more houses is “the right thing to do”.

00:14:03.365 --> 00:14:07.695
But they sort of assume that these houses would be built somewhere

00:14:07.705 --> 00:14:12.175
else, not something that disturbs them or affects their house price.

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:18.175
And when they get a leaflet through their letterbox announcing that the field next door will

00:14:18.175 --> 00:14:23.365
be turned into a new housing development or even that they hear the sound of diggers and

00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:29.175
bulldozers moving in across the road, well they might not be so happy with Keir Starmer.

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:35.457
And another related element to NIMBYism is to do with taxes.

00:14:36.807 --> 00:14:42.267
Labour has promised to increase public spending, but during the election

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:47.547
campaign, Keir Starmer pledged to not increase taxes on working people.

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:52.887
As to where the extra money to pay for the additional public spending would come from,

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:59.017
the Labour Party has remained quite tight-lipped, not saying too much on the subject.

00:14:59.657 --> 00:15:02.697
It is widely believed that the Labour Party will raise

00:15:02.697 --> 00:15:05.967
taxes later this year, principally targeting the wealthy.

00:15:06.987 --> 00:15:11.217
Of course, the money needs to come from somewhere, and throughout the election

00:15:11.217 --> 00:15:16.397
campaign one of Rishi Sunak’s main messages about why someone should vote for the

00:15:16.397 --> 00:15:22.727
Conservatives, not Labour, was that “a vote for Labour will mean paying more taxes”.

00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:29.017
And, probably just like in your country, people like the idea of better public

00:15:29.017 --> 00:15:33.747
services and more government spending but they don’t want to pay for it themselves.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.837
In other words, it needs to come from someone else’s taxes.

00:15:39.157 --> 00:15:46.627
And if or when some Labour voters see that the number on their paycheck is a little smaller or

00:15:46.777 --> 00:15:52.957
that their tax bill is bigger than the previous year’s, well only the most upstanding citizens

00:15:52.997 --> 00:15:57.917
will think “no problem, that’s the price we all need to pay for better public services”.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.267
Now, moving on to the next and final point.

00:16:02.737 --> 00:16:08.267
I know that many of you will be listening to this somewhere in Europe, so you might be

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:13.567
curious about what Keir Starmer thinks about the EU, what the Labour Party’s victory

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:19.197
means for you, or at least what it might mean for the UK’s relationship with Europe.

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:26.187
Keir Starmer voted to remain in the EU, he was pro-European Union.

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:33.507
This doesn’t mean that the UK is now going to rejoin the EU, or even have a referendum

00:16:33.657 --> 00:16:39.607
on whether to do so, but Keir Starmer has pledged to work more closely with European

00:16:39.617 --> 00:16:45.867
leaders and try to fix what he sees as messy deals left by the Conservatives.

00:16:46.967 --> 00:16:52.787
What may well happen, commentators have speculated, is that there will be some small elements of

00:16:52.827 --> 00:16:59.937
EU membership that might be reintroduced, such as a deal that allows young people from EU countries

00:17:00.177 --> 00:17:05.987
to come to the UK to live for up to 4 years, and young British people to do the same thing in

00:17:05.987 --> 00:17:11.947
Europe, but this is conjecture at this point, nothing like this has been formally announced.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:17.767
What is certain, though is that from the perspective of proximity with

00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:22.067
Europe, the victory of the Labour Party is a positive development.

00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:29.052
So, to wrap things up, Britain has a new Prime Minister, in the form of Keir Starmer.

00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:33.097
The Conservatives are out, the Labour Party is in.

00:17:33.897 --> 00:17:37.997
The Labour Party has a large mandate from the British public, it won

00:17:37.997 --> 00:17:42.147
by a large margin and it has a comfortable majority in parliament.

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:46.267
As Keir Starmer wrote shortly after becoming Prime

00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:50.217
Minister, “Rebuilding our country will not happen overnight.

00:17:50.617 --> 00:17:56.217
The challenges we face require determined, patient work and serious solutions”.

00:17:57.367 --> 00:18:03.657
He has five years to knuckle down and, as he says, get the country back on its feet.

00:18:04.357 --> 00:18:09.267
And he has tens of millions of people hoping he’ll be able to manage it.

00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:16.167
OK then, that is it for today's episode on what’s next for the new Labour government.

00:18:16.557 --> 00:18:20.607
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that even if you aren’t a close political

00:18:20.607 --> 00:18:24.927
watcher or a follower of British politics, well that you've learnt something new.

00:18:25.787 --> 00:18:28.687
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:29.137 --> 00:18:30.317
Do you live in the UK?

00:18:30.727 --> 00:18:34.387
If so, what do you think about Keir Starmer and the Labour Party?

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.167
Do you think he is focussing on the right things?

00:18:37.787 --> 00:18:41.337
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

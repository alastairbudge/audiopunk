Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:17.362
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:21.712
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:29.662
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Thomas Edison, the famous inventor.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:35.252
This is actually going to be part one of a three-part series about

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:39.292
the electrification of the United States in the late 19th century.

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:45.702
Today it’s Edison, next up we’ll talk about the War of the Currents, a battle

00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:50.852
in which Edison played a vital role, and finally we’ll have an episode on

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:57.172
Nikola Tesla, the visionary genius best known for inventing the AC motor.

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:02.962
OK then, let’s get this electric mini-series cracking and

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:07.022
learn about the man who started it all, Thomas Edison.

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:13.742
If you ask 100 people in America who is the world’s most famous inventor,

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:19.348
there will be one name you are guaranteed to hear: Thomas Edison.

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:26.788
With a record number of 1,093 registered patents, Edison was

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.878
certainly one of the most prolific inventors of all time.

00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:38.488
But the question we will try to answer in this episode, or at least give you the information

00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:44.338
so that you can answer it yourself, is whether he was the greatest inventor in the world.

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:51.058
Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in Ohio.

00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:53.748
He was the youngest of seven children.

00:01:54.688 --> 00:02:01.408
In 1854, the family moved to Michigan for a better life, where Edison’s

00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:07.418
father found work in the timber industry, transforming trees into usable wood.

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:12.611
As a young boy Thomas Edison did not do very well at school,

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.581
and he was considered slow and even stupid by his teachers.

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:23.271
Indeed, he only went to school for a few months before his mother, a

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:28.291
retired school teacher, decided to teach him at home instead, believing

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:32.641
she would be able to help the young boy better than the teachers could.

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:39.071
While Edison’s intelligence is unquestionable, it appears that

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:43.771
he wasn’t suited to methods used in formal education at the time.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:50.531
From an early age, Edison displayed an intense interest in all

00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:55.401
things mechanical, as well as an early eye on how to make money.

00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:03.091
These will be two traits, two characteristics, that will serve him well later on in life.

00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.091
In fact, they served him well from childhood.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:15.711
When he was just 12 he got his first job selling confectionery and newspapers on board a train.

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:22.641
With this money, Edison would buy equipment for his electrical and chemical experiments.

00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:29.831
He even set up a small laboratory and printing press in the train’s luggage wagon.

00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:36.651
The newspaper he printed and sold was the first ever newspaper to be printed on a train.

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:44.681
Clearly, the young Edison had plenty of potential and this was despite losing most of

00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:50.611
his sense of hearing by his 12th birthday, most probably after having got scarlet fever.

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:58.911
Later on in life, he would refer to his hearing loss as being more of an asset than a

00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:05.381
disability, allowing him to concentrate more completely on his work with fewer distractions.

00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:11.328
In 1862, when he was 15, an important event would

00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:14.628
help to change the course of Edison’s life forever.

00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:20.268
He picked up and saved a three-year old child from the railway

00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:24.038
tracks where he was about to be run over by a freight train.

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:28.738
The child’s grateful father, who worked at the station,

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:33.528
offered to teach Edison railway telegraphy as a reward.

00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:39.028
The railway telegraph system allowed train operations to be

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:43.668
controlled by sending electric telegraph signals through wires.

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:50.248
The electrical telegraph was what’s called a point-to-point messaging system.

00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:57.338
Telegraph operators would spell out text messages in Morse code - a series

00:04:57.348 --> 00:05:02.118
of dots and dashes that were assigned to each letter of the alphabet.

00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:07.658
Learning telegraphy was an important springboard for Edison.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:12.858
He went on to take numerous telegraphy jobs working from city to

00:05:12.858 --> 00:05:17.878
city, including working in the Western Union office in Boston, where

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.128
he would listen out for messages on the Associated Press news wire.

00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:27.938
However, Edison did not really focus much on his telegraph work,

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:32.258
preferring to spend his time reading and conducting experiments.

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:39.788
He was actually sacked from Western Union after he spilled sulfuric acid from a lead-acid

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:44.788
battery that he was working on while he was on duty, while he was meant to be working.

00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:51.638
The acid dripped through the floorboards and onto his boss's desk in the room below.

00:05:52.778 --> 00:05:56.358
After leaving Western Union, Edison decided to devote

00:05:56.368 --> 00:05:59.918
himself entirely to his experiments and studies.

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:07.038
In 1869, he obtained his very first patent and learned an invaluable lesson.

00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:13.458
Edison’s first patent was for his invention of the electric vote recorder.

00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:21.058
This recorder allowed politicians to cast their votes on laws via an electrical device.

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:26.518
This device would automatically keep count of how many votes had been made

00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:32.188
for and against a motion, saving many hours spent voting and counting.

00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:38.638
It might sound like a good idea, but when he tried to get politicians to use it,

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:45.238
they didn’t even want to try, and the invention was a complete flop, it went nowhere.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:53.878
Edison swore to himself that from now on, he would not waste anymore time inventing things that

00:06:53.878 --> 00:07:01.108
people simply didn't want, and instead, he would focus on things that he knew people needed.

00:07:02.138 --> 00:07:08.338
But in order to move on with his inventions, Edison needed cash, he needed money.

00:07:09.048 --> 00:07:16.158
He moved to New York and was put up by a fellow telegrapher and inventor friend, Franklin Pope.

00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:22.398
When Edison fixed a broken machine for Pope, he was given a job managing

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:26.668
and improving the printer machines at the Gold Indicator Company.

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:32.178
During this period, Edison formed numerous partnerships and was

00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:35.988
involved in multiple projects all relating to the telegraph.

00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:43.858
Most notably, he set up an electrical engineering and invention company, Pope, Edison & Co

00:07:44.098 --> 00:07:50.308
and formed the American Telegraph Works, looking to develop an automatic telegraph system.

00:07:51.628 --> 00:08:00.538
Then, in 1874, when he was 27, Edison got his first big break, his first big financial success.

00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:04.318
He had invented the quadruplex telegraph.

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:09.558
This type of telegraph allowed two signals to be sent in

00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:14.288
each direction, so four messages to be sent at the same time.

00:08:15.218 --> 00:08:22.118
Now, for you and me it might be hard to imagine a world in which communication was this difficult,

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:29.578
and where being able to send dots along an electrical wire was such a groundbreaking achievement.

00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:37.498
You probably have a smartphone, you can send messages to anyone, anywhere, at any time.

00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:45.068
And not just text messages - you can send long text, pictures, video, audio.

00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:49.228
We can do anything, and indeed there are an estimated

00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:53.908
100 billion messages sent on WhatsApp every single day.

00:08:55.158 --> 00:09:03.148
But when Edison was growing up, sending just one series of beeps was complicated and expensive.

00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:09.168
And that was Edison’s opportunity, that was where there was money to be made.

00:09:09.998 --> 00:09:15.468
This first invention, the quadruplex telegraph, was important because it

00:09:15.498 --> 00:09:20.458
allowed telegraph companies to increase their efficiency and productivity.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.842
Edison sold the rights to his invention to Western Union

00:09:26.022 --> 00:09:32.002
and pocketed $10,000, today’s equivalent of around $200,000.

00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:42.142
Another invention, what he called the electric pen, followed hot on the quadruplex’s heels in 1875.

00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:48.932
Now, you might be wondering what an “electric pen” was, and why we don’t all use them today.

00:09:49.662 --> 00:09:57.152
The electric pen was actually a basic, early, but not very effective version of the photocopier.

00:09:58.002 --> 00:10:05.132
It did seem like magic, though, and was just the start of Edison’s prolific career as an inventor.

00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:13.552
Indeed, Edison was the first person to take the idea of being an inventor to a completely new level.

00:10:14.232 --> 00:10:22.662
He wanted to industrialise the process of invention, and in 1876 he set up an “invention

00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:29.802
factory” - his innovative research and development facility, called the Menlo Park Laboratory.

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:37.932
There, Edison employed a large team of people who carried out research under his direction.

00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:44.902
The idea was to churn out, to produce, a constant supply of new

00:10:44.902 --> 00:10:50.582
inventions in all manner of fields, with Edison very much at the helm.

00:10:51.612 --> 00:10:56.412
Reportedly his vision was for the laboratory to make one minor

00:10:56.582 --> 00:11:01.062
breakthrough every 10 days and a major breakthrough once a month.

00:11:02.222 --> 00:11:07.122
Edison was legally credited with most of the lab’s inventions, it was

00:11:07.132 --> 00:11:12.152
his name on the patents, even though it was certainly a team effort, it

00:11:12.152 --> 00:11:17.062
was literally an invention factory, but only one man took the credit.

00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:23.002
This approach to invention was extremely novel for the era.

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:29.762
If you compare Edison’s approach to that of solitary geniuses, such as Nikola

00:11:29.762 --> 00:11:35.282
Tesla, who mainly worked alone, you can see why Edison’s more business-like

00:11:35.282 --> 00:11:40.532
approach to invention was more productive and ultimately financially successful.

00:11:42.052 --> 00:11:45.872
We’re doing to be going deep into the life of Nikola Tesla in a couple

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:51.472
of episodes’ time, in episode 259, so keep your eyes peeled for that one.

00:11:52.832 --> 00:11:58.222
What Edison managed to do was turn invention into a career, turn

00:11:58.222 --> 00:12:04.122
the career of inventor into a glamorous and desirable one, and in so

00:12:04.122 --> 00:12:09.002
doing, turned himself into the country’s first celebrity inventor.

00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:15.862
Critics, mainly afterwards but even to a certain extent at the time, remarked

00:12:15.892 --> 00:12:20.612
that Edison was taking a lot of credit for inventing things that he didn’t

00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:25.192
actually invent, that he didn’t actually have all that much to do with.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:32.082
In many cases, Edison and his many companies were essentially refining and

00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:37.852
perfecting already discovered inventions, taking new technologies and improving

00:12:37.912 --> 00:12:43.222
upon them to come up with working items that were both affordable and desirable.

00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:48.702
This doesn’t mean that Edison did not come up with his very own inventions too.

00:12:49.642 --> 00:12:51.552
Also, he had his failures.

00:12:51.922 --> 00:12:56.692
But it’s safe to say that for the most part Edison and his employees at

00:12:56.692 --> 00:13:02.352
Menlo Park worked to improve rather than completely invent from scratch.

00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:08.252
Rather than making an exhaustive chronological overview of Edsion’s

00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:12.402
many, many inventions, I’m going to focus upon some of the most

00:13:12.422 --> 00:13:16.812
important ones, as well as a couple of failures, just for good measure.

00:13:17.682 --> 00:13:21.452
After all, being successful is as much about how you

00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:24.372
deal with your setbacks as well as your achievements.

00:13:25.592 --> 00:13:32.492
Aside from improvement to the telegraph system, Edison made headway in improving the telephone, as

00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:39.072
well as inventing something called the phonograph - a type of early recording and playback device.

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:45.192
Edison’s phonograph, which he released in 1877 when he was

00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:49.892
only 30 years old, made the young man a celebrity overnight.

00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:56.642
While the phonograph itself had limitations, the fact that Edison was able to record

00:13:56.882 --> 00:14:03.122
and playback his own voice with it was almost bordering on magic for most people.

00:14:04.172 --> 00:14:08.272
The phonograph earned Edison the nickname, “The Wizard of

00:14:08.272 --> 00:14:12.992
Menlo Park”, and the Washington Post labelled him a “genius”.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.402
But his most important invention was still to come.

00:14:18.132 --> 00:14:22.962
When you think of Thomas Edison, perhaps you think of the man who invented the light bulb.

00:14:23.632 --> 00:14:30.212
Now strictly speaking, he didn’t actually invent the light bulb, rather he improved upon

00:14:30.262 --> 00:14:36.902
previous versions to create a better model that was also commercially and economically viable.

00:14:38.624 --> 00:14:59.254
Unlike previous light bulbs, Edison's light bulb was the first one that

00:14:59.254 --> 00:15:02.111
was long-lasting enough to make it a practical choice for widespread use.

00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:02.555
But he wasn’t content with just inventing the light bulb.

00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:02.692
He wanted to create and control the electrical system that would power these lights.

00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:05.419
However, while Edison’s light bulb was a resounding success, his

00:15:05.719 --> 00:15:10.279
electrical distribution system came up against stiff competition.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:17.029
This battle to dominate the electricity distribution market would become known

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:22.299
as the “War of the Currents”, a topic we’ll cover in detail in the next episode.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:29.769
This “war” pitted Edison, with his firm belief in something called DC supply,

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:36.799
against George Westinghouse, amongst others, who advocated for the use of AC current.

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:44.389
In short, Edison’s DC supply system had several disadvantages compared to AC.

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:51.559
Mainly, AC could travel further, so it was more suitable for supplying the vast

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:57.039
majority of customers and it didn’t require power plants on every street corner.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:04.709
Edison’s DC system was really only practical in very densely populated areas, and he

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:11.299
eventually lost the battle for his DC system to be the standard electrical system in America.

00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:18.539
Now, as I said, we’ll cover this in great detail in the next episode, but this “War of

00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:24.424
the Currents” was a pivotal period where Edison’s true character really comes to light.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:34.439
He was a fierce competitor, not afraid to play dirty and smear his rivals, and this unwillingness

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:40.779
to give in or admit defeat would eventually result in his losing control of his company.

00:16:41.729 --> 00:16:48.029
In other areas, when Edison got it wrong, he wasn’t afraid to make a quick U-turn.

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:55.749
For example, his short-lived foray into the toy market, when he created talking dolls.

00:16:56.409 --> 00:17:02.399
Edison created smaller versions of his phonograph and placed them inside dolls.

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:06.139
However, the end results didn’t go to plan.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.689
The dolls’ mechanisms were too fragile, they broke easily, and

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:16.069
Edison had to take them off the market after a few short weeks.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:22.769
Now, it’s hard to be the most prolific inventor in the world if you spend too much time

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:28.699
sitting around chatting to your friends, and for all of the potential criticisms one could

00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:34.509
make of Thomas Edison, you can’t say that he didn’t have a pretty formidable work ethic.

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:40.799
He would work long hours at his laboratory and often stay up into the night, working away.

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:45.679
One of his most famous quotes refers to his invention of the

00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:50.319
electric light bulb, which reportedly took him 10,000 attempts.

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:54.549
He said: “I have not failed 10,000 times.

00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:56.249
I have not failed once.

00:17:56.669 --> 00:18:01.479
I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work.

00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:07.429
When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work.”

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:14.129
This gives us some insight into Edison’s mind and what made him so successful.

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:20.199
Unlike some geniuses with flashes of inspiration, such as Nikola

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:25.899
Tesla, Edison was not afraid to plod away meticulously at his projects.

00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:32.529
This work ethic might have provided the country, and indeed the world, with

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:37.789
some important inventions, but it certainly didn’t lead to a happy family life.

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:45.049
He had a wife and a family, but his long days and nights at his laboratory, indeed often

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:51.739
sleeping at the laboratory, meant that he rarely saw his family, and his first wife died

00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:58.879
of unknown causes, thought to be linked to stress and loneliness, before her 30th birthday.

00:18:59.989 --> 00:19:06.339
Following his first wife’s death, Edison continued to miss both lunch and dinner at home with

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:12.609
his second wife and family, and continued to work long hours even right into his final days.

00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:16.629
In short, he was a complete workaholic.

00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:22.169
He even invented his own technique of power napping, a technique

00:19:22.309 --> 00:19:26.349
that he used to spend less time sleeping and more working.

00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:34.079
Edison would hold a heavy object in his hands and try to fall asleep while he was holding it.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:41.959
As he nodded off, as he started to fall asleep, the object would crash to the floor waking him up.

00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:49.169
Edison believed that the simple act of falling asleep very briefly would revive him,

00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:55.129
allowing him to jump back into action, inspired and ready to start working again.

00:19:56.259 --> 00:20:03.009
Aside from doggedly working away at his inventions and seeking inspiration in strange ways,

00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:09.939
Edison also used all means available to ensure that his business ventures succeeded, including

00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:16.609
mergers, and taking a lot of legal action and when necessary discrediting his rivals.

00:20:17.547 --> 00:20:21.557
So, was Thomas Edison the greatest inventor in the world?

00:20:22.047 --> 00:20:24.367
He was certainly one of the most prolific.

00:20:24.947 --> 00:20:28.527
What’s more, he was also one of the most business-minded.

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:33.307
Unlike many other inventors of his time, notably Nikola

00:20:33.307 --> 00:20:38.257
Tesla who died penniless and in debt, Edison died a rich man.

00:20:39.487 --> 00:20:44.847
Upon his death in 1931, he left a $31 million estate,

00:20:45.127 --> 00:20:49.517
estimated at approximately €500 million in today’s money.

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:57.557
Now, in the era of oligarchs and billionaires, €500 million might not sound like

00:20:57.737 --> 00:21:02.547
that much, but it would have made him one of the richest men in the country.

00:21:03.587 --> 00:21:09.867
Setting up his Menlo Park Laboratory or so called “invention factory” was certainly an

00:21:09.897 --> 00:21:16.147
inspirational and highly innovative venture that helped Edison to rise ahead of his rivals.

00:21:17.047 --> 00:21:21.957
Throughout his life, we can see how his ambition grew from his small

00:21:21.957 --> 00:21:26.237
beginnings selling newspapers and confectionery on trains to forming

00:21:26.247 --> 00:21:30.987
huge companies that are still around today, such as General Electric.

00:21:32.117 --> 00:21:38.297
Ultimately, Edison’s genius was to take all of these new, upcoming technologies, to

00:21:38.307 --> 00:21:44.037
build on and improve them to make better, more user-friendly and affordable products.

00:21:44.827 --> 00:21:48.907
It is without question that his inventions shaped the world we

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:53.247
live in, perhaps more so than any other inventor of his era.

00:21:54.207 --> 00:21:59.217
I’ll leave you to decide whether this makes him the greatest inventor in the world.

00:22:01.937 --> 00:22:06.707
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Thomas Edison.

00:22:07.127 --> 00:22:10.677
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned some interesting

00:22:10.677 --> 00:22:14.637
details on one of the most prolific inventors ever to have lived.

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:18.787
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:19.087 --> 00:22:22.437
Do you think Thomas Edison was the greatest inventor in the world?

00:22:22.857 --> 00:22:27.927
Which do you think was most important, his hard work ethic or ingenuity?

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:33.007
How instrumental do you think Edison’s early years were to his success

00:22:33.377 --> 00:22:36.827
? 
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

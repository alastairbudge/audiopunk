Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.550
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.420
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:25.620
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Trial of Amanda Knox.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.130
It is the story of a young woman whose study abroad programme went horribly wrong.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.340
But it is also the story of the Italian justice system, the power of the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.960
media, and at the centre of it all, a British woman who was violently murdered.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.919
It is also a personal story, for reasons which I will reveal shortly.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.630
And on a quick admin note, this episode will be talking about quite a nasty murder

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:59.890
investigation, so if you would prefer not to listen to this, then I’d advise to press pause now.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.060
Ok then, let’s talk about the trial of Amanda Knox.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.969
Perugia is a hilltop city in Italy.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.570
It is a beautiful place, narrow old streets, Etruscan

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.620
arches, fantastic views that stretch for miles.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.249
It is also a student city, with a very good university, Università degli Studi, as

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.420
well as a university for foreigners to learn Italian, the Università per Stranieri.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.929
Every year, thousands of foreigners flock to the city, whether

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.759
that’s for a short Italian course or a longer exchange programme.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.640
And they have a lot of fun.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.160
Rent is cheap, there are lots of bars, restaurants, parties, lots of people to meet and make

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.339
friends with, lots of cultural activities, or hedonistic activities if that's more your vibe.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.329
It’s great, and if you are wondering why I know this, and am saying

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.320
this with such certainty, it's because I was one of those foreigners.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.310
At the start of 2006, I went to the Università per Stranieri for an Italian course.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.680
I lived in Perugia, and went to the same university where today’s story all took place.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.709
But this isn’t about me.

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.710
A year and a half after I left, two young women arrived

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.679
in Perugia, no doubt full of expectation and excitement.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.340
The first was called Meredith Kercher, and she was from England.

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:45.079
She was a student at the University of Leeds, and like many of her peers,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.240
she had chosen to spend a third year abroad studying at a foreign university.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.700
The second was Amanda Knox, who was a linguistics student at the University of Washington.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.870
She had decided to spend a year abroad, she thought Florence was too full

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.200
of Americans–which it is–and had settled on Perugia as her destination.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.690
And the way in which you found accommodation in Perugia back then was by little posters

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.700
that people would put up all over the city: room available, or flatshare wanted.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.020
You would tear off a little phone number, call up and take a look at the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.240
room, decide that you liked the look of it, or move on to the next one.

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:37.512
For Kercher and Knox, they found themselves living together in

00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:42.072
this way, sharing a small house with two young Italian women.

00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:48.252
They were different characters, Kercher and Knox, but they got along.

00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:54.812
They went out for pizza, they did things together, they were friendly but not best friends.

00:03:56.012 --> 00:04:00.512
Kercher would, reportedly, spend more time with English

00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:04.492
friends, while Knox was happier to mingle with Italians.

00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:08.032
And they were different people.

00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:12.972
Kercher was a more studious young woman, keen to get good

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:17.042
grades, whereas Knox was less focussed on her studies.

00:04:18.282 --> 00:04:24.342
And in late October, a month and a half after arriving in Italy, Amanda Knox

00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:29.912
saw a man who caught her eye, and would end up distracting her from class.

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:37.477
His name was Raffaelle Sollecito, and he was a shy-looking computer science student.

00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:42.307
Knox would later say that he reminded her of Harry Potter.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:49.187
The pair got talking, and swiftly became romantically involved with one another.

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:53.307
She would stay over at his house, which was a five minute walk away

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:57.217
from hers, they would watch movies together and smoke marijuana.

00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:03.207
And that was what they did on the evening of November 1st, 2007.

00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:09.937
They watched Amelie, smoked marijuana, and had sex, or so she would later recall.

00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:15.697
The following morning, Knox went back to her house for a shower.

00:05:16.897 --> 00:05:23.037
Sollecito was a 23-year-old male computer science student, and, perhaps as you

00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:27.867
can imagine, his bathroom wasn’t a particularly pleasant place to take a shower.

00:05:29.217 --> 00:05:34.267
She returned home, and saw that the front door of her house was open.

00:05:35.207 --> 00:05:39.777
This was unusual, kind of strange, but she didn’t think

00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:43.507
too much about it, as it had been faulty for a while.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:49.157
She got into the shower, and it was only when she got out that she

00:05:49.157 --> 00:05:54.177
noticed that there were spots, small drops of blood on the bathroom floor.

00:05:55.537 --> 00:05:59.117
She knocked on Kercher’s door, but there was no answer.

00:06:00.147 --> 00:06:02.837
She then tried to open it, but it was locked.

00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:08.507
What’s more, Kercher, her housemate, wasn’t answering her phone.

00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:12.371
And she always answered her phone.

00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:20.247
Worried, Knox returned to Sollecito’s house, and the pair tried to figure out what to do.

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:25.867
They returned to the house, and found Kercher’s phone had been dumped

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:29.717
behind the house, and saw that one of the windows had been smashed.

00:06:30.707 --> 00:06:35.937
They called the police, who came to investigate, but refused to smash

00:06:35.947 --> 00:06:39.647
Kercher’s door, on the grounds that it would be damage to private property.

00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:46.337
By this point, one of Kercher and Knox’s Italian housemates had arrived, along with a friend.

00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:54.427
They decided the situation was serious, and the friend kicked open Meredith Kercher’s door.

00:06:56.127 --> 00:07:00.193
They were confronted by a horrific sight: A bloody duvet

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:03.767
which covered the lifeless body of Meredith Kercher.

00:07:05.107 --> 00:07:11.267
The police pushed past to survey the scene, and Knox and Sollecito were ushered out of the house.

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:15.747
The detectives on the scene questioned Knox and Sollecito,

00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:20.277
but they were free to go, while the police gathered evidence.

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:27.057
On November 5th, just three days after the gruesome discovery of Kercher’s

00:07:27.097 --> 00:07:31.807
dead body, Knox went again to the police station to give evidence.

00:07:32.537 --> 00:07:33.887
She was a valuable witness.

00:07:34.177 --> 00:07:38.157
She was the housemate of the victim, it was her who had first seen

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:42.537
the blood, raised the alarm, and led to the gruesome discovery.

00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:48.907
She told the police what she knew, going over and over the events of that evening.

00:07:49.547 --> 00:07:53.917
She was with Sollecito, she returned to the house the following morning, took a

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:59.307
shower, and it was only afterwards that she noticed that something seemed odd.

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:05.627
She was told that she was being questioned as a witness, so she didn’t need a lawyer.

00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:10.917
What’s more, she was told that things would be worse for her if

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:14.527
she had asked for a lawyer, it would suggest some kind of guilt.

00:08:15.437 --> 00:08:18.967
And Knox, so she insisted, was innocent.

00:08:20.447 --> 00:08:24.687
She wasn’t provided with an interpreter, so this was all in Italian,

00:08:25.477 --> 00:08:28.737
the Italian of someone who has only been in the country for a few

00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:34.127
weeks, and–in her own words–she had the Italian of a 10-year-old child.

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:40.417
There she was, speaking in broken Italian, not really understanding what

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:44.227
she was being asked, knowing nothing about the Italian legal system,

00:08:44.637 --> 00:08:49.087
thousands of miles away from home, and only 20 years old at the time.

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:56.237
She was interrogated for hours, and on November 6th, the Italian police

00:08:56.557 --> 00:09:01.907
proudly announced that Knox was not just a witness; she had signed a written

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:08.157
statement admitting that her original story, the one I just told you, was a lie.

00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:12.527
She confessed to her role in the grisly murder.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:18.439
According to the written statement, the killer was the owner of the bar

00:09:18.439 --> 00:09:22.956
in which Amanda Knox worked, a Congolese man called Patrick Lumumba.

00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:31.239
Lumumba had come to the house, so Knox said, and murdered Kercher while Knox was in another room.

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:35.949
Knox even went to the length of telling the police that she put

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:40.249
her hands over her ears not to hear her housemate’s screams.

00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:49.159
Lumumba was promptly arrested, but he seemed confused, insisting that he had nothing to do with it.

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:53.369
He was no murderer, he was working in his bar all evening,

00:09:53.689 --> 00:09:56.499
just ask the half a dozen people who were there with him.

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:01.589
And it wasn’t just Lumumba who was insisting that he was innocent.

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:07.569
The morning after the signed confession, Amanda Knox wrote a lengthy letter

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:13.449
in which she said that she retracted the confession, and she was forced to

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:18.619
sign it under serious duress, with the police officers hitting her over the

00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:23.919
head and telling her that they had evidence linking her to the crime scene.

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:28.169
She was confused, she had been interrogated for 50

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:32.489
hours without adequate food or water, she was in shock.

00:10:33.189 --> 00:10:38.389
She couldn’t remember exactly what happened, she had been smoking drugs with her boyfriend the

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:45.559
night before, it was all a bit of a blur, but she certainly did not kill Meredith, or know who did.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.429
It wasn’t Lumumba; she had tried to pin the blame on him,

00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:53.472
inventing this story, to divert attention away from her.

00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:58.003
It didn’t matter, the police were not buying it.

00:10:59.089 --> 00:11:04.499
On November 9th, a week after the murder, an Italian judge ruled that the

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:10.819
three suspects–Lumumba, Knox, and Sollecito–could be detained for up to a

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:15.469
year while the police gathered the evidence to either convict or release them.

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:24.199
Then, on November 15th, almost two weeks after the murder, the police made another big announcement.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:28.479
They had found a knife at Raffaele Sollecito’s apartment.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:35.029
And on the knife’s handle was the DNA of both Sollecito and Knox.

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:42.969
And on the blade, traces of Meredith Kercher’s DNA, traces of the murder victim.

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:47.579
It didn’t look good for the young couple, for Raffaele

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:50.989
Sollecito and his American girlfriend, Amanda Knox.

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:55.639
But then, a matter of days later, there was another

00:11:55.659 --> 00:11:59.769
suspect named in the murder, a young man called Rudy Guede.

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:06.399
He was originally from the Ivory Coast but had lived in Perugia since he was a young boy.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:14.859
He was well-known to the police for petty crimes, drug dealing, and more recently, burglaries.

00:12:15.749 --> 00:12:18.319
He was also known to carry a knife…

00:12:19.689 --> 00:12:25.359
The day after he was named as a suspect, the German police announced that they had arrested him

00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:32.729
after he had tried to board a train without a ticket, and he was extradited, brought back to Italy.

00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:37.979
The very same day, Patrick Lumumba, the man who Knox

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:41.479
had initially said committed the murder, was released.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:48.139
It turned out that, yes, Lumumba’s surprise and protests of innocence were justified.

00:12:48.669 --> 00:12:54.949
He was at his bar all night, and a Swiss professor came forward and testified that he had

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:59.939
been talking to Lumumba all evening, he even had the receipt from the bar to prove it.

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:05.779
For Rudy Guede, on the other hand, things did not look good.

00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:11.759
He had fled to Germany immediately after the murder, and the police would

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:15.779
announce that they had found his fingerprints and other DNA evidence

00:13:15.849 --> 00:13:21.049
of him all over the crime scene, including his semen inside the victim.

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:25.739
When questioned, he admitted to the police that he was in

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:28.309
Meredith Kercher’s house during the night of the murder.

00:13:28.993 --> 00:13:30.699
But, he did not kill her.

00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:34.609
His account of what happened went as follows.

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:38.139
He had been asked to come to the house by Meredith.

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:42.879
The pair had sex, afterwards he had gone to the bathroom,

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:46.696
as he had an upset stomach after eating a dodgy kebab.

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:51.959
He sat on the toilet with his headphones on, listening to loud music.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:57.079
He came out of the bathroom and saw another man who told him,

00:13:57.599 --> 00:14:02.749
"black man found, guilty found", and then ran off into the night.

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:07.369
And it was only then that he discovered Meredith, who had

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.779
been stabbed multiple times and was dying in front of him.

00:14:11.689 --> 00:14:17.509
He tried to save her, but when he realised that he wouldn’t be able to, and fearing

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:22.289
that the police would never believe his account of the story, he decided to flee.

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:26.769
But first he wrapped Meredith’s body in a duvet, which

00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:30.969
explains his bloody handprint that was found under the pillow.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.999
Now, you might believe Guede, you might not.

00:14:35.549 --> 00:14:37.219
The police certainly didn’t.

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:44.109
But, strangely enough, they also didn’t believe Knox or Sollecito’s account, and

00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:50.779
posited that all three were involved in the murder: Guede, Knox and Sollecito.

00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:55.339
All three were held in police custody until they were

00:14:55.349 --> 00:14:59.649
formally charged with murder in July of the following year.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:06.459
Guede, interestingly enough, opted to have a separate “fast track” trial,

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:11.839
during which he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.569
All throughout this, despite one man already being found

00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:20.869
guilty of murder, Sollecito and Knox were still in jail.

00:15:22.109 --> 00:15:28.039
And then in January of the following year, January of 2009, their trial began.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:33.979
To say it was a media circus is perhaps an understatement.

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:37.609
It drew huge media interest from all over the world:

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:41.369
in Italy, because that was where the crime took place.

00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:45.259
In the UK, because that was where the innocent victim was from.

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:49.349
And from the United States, because that's where Knox was from.

00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:56.209
And the media interest wasn’t just because of where the people involved came from, there

00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:02.149
were multiple elements of the trial that intrigued and enthralled armchair detectives.

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:07.219
First of all, the murder seemed unlikely.

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:13.292
Knox and Sollecito didn’t look or sound like your typical violent murderers.

00:16:14.162 --> 00:16:19.429
Sollecito was a quiet, mild mannered computer science student with round glasses.

00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:23.879
Knox was a young American student on her study abroad year.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:27.729
The pair had only met a few weeks before.

00:16:28.359 --> 00:16:34.729
It might have been a whirlwind romance, but for them to have gone from smoking marijuana, having

00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:42.159
sex and watching movies together to discussing and then committing violent murder seemed…odd.

00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:47.159
What’s more, there was the not insignificant fact that Rudy

00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:51.059
Guede had already been charged and found guilty of the murder.

00:16:51.972 --> 00:16:54.839
What part did Knox and Sollecito play, then?

00:16:56.549 --> 00:17:01.928
For this we must now talk about the lead prosecutor in the case, Giuliano Mignini.

00:17:03.248 --> 00:17:10.199
Mignini seems to have decided, almost from the outset, that Knox was guilty, he

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:16.229
just needed to find a motive and some evidence that supported this hypothesis.

00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:21.319
He proposed to the court that Knox had attacked her housemate,

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:26.759
and then she and Sollecito held her down while Guede raped her.

00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:34.399
Perhaps they had done this for sexual gratification, Mignini suggested, perhaps it was because

00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:40.669
they wanted to play some kind of drug-fueled sex game, and Meredith refused to take part.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:47.049
When this was all over, Knox and Guede stabbed her to death.

00:17:47.979 --> 00:17:52.389
The trio had then staged a burglary, they had then broken a

00:17:52.389 --> 00:17:55.999
window to make it look like someone had broken into the apartment.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:59.679
They were guilty, the prosecution alleged.

00:18:01.199 --> 00:18:06.579
Against the backdrop of all of this, journalists were looking for any tidbits that they

00:18:06.579 --> 00:18:12.109
could find that would give their readers more salacious gossip about Knox or Guede.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:19.429
They were delighted to find out that Amanda Knox’s MySpace nickname was “Foxy Knoxy”.

00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:24.039
Foxy is a slang term for sexually attractive.

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:28.069
Any information on Amanda Knox’s life would be

00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:31.859
published by hungry journalists, the racier the better.

00:18:32.629 --> 00:18:36.519
They found people who gave details of her sex life, how she

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:39.869
had slept with several Italian men shortly after arriving.

00:18:40.589 --> 00:18:44.399
She was painted as some kind of sex-crazed young woman.

00:18:45.229 --> 00:18:49.789
Even the BBC, which normally abstains from the worst tabloid

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:54.539
gossip, ran articles with headlines “Who is the real 'Foxy Knoxy'?”

00:18:56.249 --> 00:18:59.459
And the entire thing spun out of control.

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:03.389
Amanda Knox was a sex-crazed temptress.

00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:05.889
It wasn’t just her backstory.

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:10.589
It was also her behaviour during the investigation and trial that

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:14.979
journalists and prosecutors pointed to as a sign of her guilt.

00:19:16.249 --> 00:19:22.369
She seemed unmoved by the death of her housemate, and the police would report that she

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:27.909
did cartwheels in the police station, which she would later say were only yoga exercises.

00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:33.909
On Valentine’s day during her trial she wore a t-shirt with “all you need

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:39.229
is love” on, and she smiled and looked even happy when she was in court.

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:45.019
This wasn’t the behaviour of an innocent person, the prosecution alleged.

00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:48.309
No normal person would behave in this way.

00:19:49.929 --> 00:19:55.289
In the courtroom, the prosecutor brought out evidence that further tied the duo to the crime scene.

00:19:56.079 --> 00:20:00.329
There was the bloody knife, the murder weapon, and Mignini also

00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:05.659
announced that the police had found Sollecito’s DNA on the victim’s bra.

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:11.909
It was not looking good at all, and after almost a

00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:17.349
full year, on December 4th, 2009, the trial was over.

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:24.289
The jury declared that Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were guilty of

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:30.109
murder, and they were sentenced to 26 years and 25 years respectively.

00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:36.399
There were cheers outside the courtroom as justice had finally been served.

00:20:37.179 --> 00:20:39.989
This young woman who might look sweet and innocent

00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:44.609
had been proved to be a violent and cruel murderer.

00:20:45.819 --> 00:20:50.459
Knox and Sollecito’s families said they would immediately appeal the verdict,

00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:56.429
and the next two years were characterised by appeals, second and third opinions.

00:20:57.849 --> 00:21:02.379
As the appeals continued, more and more evidence came to light.

00:21:03.219 --> 00:21:08.919
Or rather, it came to light that more and more evidence wasn’t actually evidence at all.

00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:15.531
The supposed murder knife was reexamined, and it was found that it couldn’t have

00:21:15.531 --> 00:21:20.806
been the knife that killed Meredith; it was too big, and the traces of Meredith’s

00:21:20.811 --> 00:21:25.541
DNA that were found on the knife could have been from anyone or anything.

00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:25.617
It was a knife from Sollecito's kitchen, so of course

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:25.708
his fingerprints were on it, as he used it for cooking.

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:25.953
And given how much time Knox spent in his apartment, preparing and cooking food

00:21:25.953 --> 00:21:26.101
together, it's perfectly reasonable that her fingerprints would be on there too.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:51.301
And the other main piece of evidence for the prosecution was Sollecito’s DNA on the victim’s bra.

00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:57.331
When experts were consulted on the matter, they concluded that the manner in which the

00:21:57.341 --> 00:22:03.261
forensic investigators searched the house was so unprofessional that evidence would almost

00:22:03.261 --> 00:22:09.241
certainly have been contaminated, and nothing could be considered valid legal evidence.

00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:14.011
With these two pieces of evidence being completely discounted,

00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:17.931
there was nothing tying Sollecito and Knox to the scene.

00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:23.401
The only “evidence” of their guilt was Knox’s unusual behaviour.

00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:27.941
And of course, you don’t need to be an expert in Italian law to know

00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:32.421
that behaving in an unusual way isn’t enough to be convicted of murder.

00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:40.561
Finally, on October the 3rd, 2011, almost 4 years after the murder,

00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:46.001
Knox and Sollecito were acquitted, they were released from prison.

00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:52.661
Knox was found guilty of perjury, of lying to the police that Patrick Lumumba was

00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:58.771
involved, and she was sentenced to 3 years, but because she had already served almost

00:22:58.771 --> 00:23:04.281
4, she was released straight away, and she was able to return to the United States.

00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:08.581
This, however, wasn't the end of it.

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:15.871
In 2013 the Italian Supreme Court ruled that the pair should stand trial again.

00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:22.801
Knox refused to return to Italy for the trial, but she was found guilty by another

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:28.411
court, and faced the possibility of spending the rest of her life in an Italian prison.

00:23:29.681 --> 00:23:34.731
There was some diplomatic ping pong, as the US government faced the very real

00:23:34.731 --> 00:23:39.961
possibility that it might receive an extradition request for one of its own citizens.

00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:45.911
Clearly, extraditing Amanda Knox to Italy would have been a pretty unpopular move

00:23:45.911 --> 00:23:51.281
domestically, but if the US didn’t extradite a citizen that had been found guilty

00:23:51.341 --> 00:23:55.761
in a court of law, it couldn’t really continue to make extradition requests to other

00:23:55.761 --> 00:24:00.911
countries if it wouldn’t uphold its part in the bargain and extradite one of its own.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:08.910
Fortunately, the case never went this far, and a year later, on March 27th,

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:17.330
2015, 2,702 days after Meredith was found brutally murdered, Amanda Knox

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.660
and Raffaele Sollecito were fully exonerated, acquitted of all charges.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.160
Importantly, Knox was “declared innocent”, not simply “declared not guilty”.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:37.980
This being said, there are plenty of people, not just on internet forums but also influential

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:43.430
journalists, especially in Italy, who have never acquitted the pair, who continue to put

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:49.410
forward this image of Foxy Knoxy, the American sexual deviant who murdered her housemate.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.480
This would make for a much more theatrical and interesting

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.150
tale, but the reality is almost certainly less mysterious.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.120
Rudy Guede broke into the house, like he had done to

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.091
several other houses in the days leading up to the murder.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:12.510
He was confronted by Meredith, there was a struggle, he raped and killed her and then fled.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.550
A horrible crime indeed, but one with a simpler explanation

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.700
than the one suggested during the trial of Amanda Knox.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:28.430
Guede, it should be said, maintains that he was innocent, and says that Knox was involved.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.970
He is now a free man, after having served 16 years in

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.100
prison and being released early for good behaviour.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.310
Whether he ever comes clean and reveals what really happened, remains to be said.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.480
OK then, that is it for The Trial Of Amanda Knox.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.040
As you may have gathered, we've only really scratched the surface in this episode,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.680
there is a lot more too to it, and it really is a fascinating story of police

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:02.040
ineptitude, international diplomacy, the power of the media, and how the Italian legal

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.700
system works, so we are actually going to be following up this episode with another,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.220
bonus episode, where we are going to go into all of this in much greater detail.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.860
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:21.090
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.970
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.980
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.360
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.970
called Cryonics, the practice of deep freezing people who have just died with

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.599
the hope of bringing them back to life at some indefinite date in the future.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.529
It is, to state the obvious, a big deal, if it works, that is.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.960
So, in this episode we’ll look at the history of this fascinating but controversial

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.290
practice, how it works, or doesn’t work, and what this all means for the future.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.159
OK then, Cryonics & Freezing People in Time.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.019
Roughly two hours north of Moscow, in a small warehouse, are 94 people and 61 pets.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.680
This isn’t the start of some joke, a dog talent show, or an unusual family.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.560
The people and their pets are dead; their bodies are hung upside down, all the blood has been

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.600
drained from their body, and they have been frozen in minus 196-degree Celsius liquid nitrogen.

00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:32.864
Like a group of frozen bats, they hang there, awaiting

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:35.824
a possible future when they can be brought back to life.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:40.134
To state the obvious, the technology doesn’t exist

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:44.284
yet, these people are as dead as any other dead person.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:52.134
But they all paid a lot of money, anywhere from $12,000 to $36,000 by some

00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:56.844
reports, to be frozen in the hope that at some time in the future, they

00:01:56.844 --> 00:02:02.224
will be unfrozen, perhaps technologically altered, and able to live again.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:08.624
The process that these people underwent is something called cryonics - it’s the

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:13.364
idea of preserving a dead person so they can be brought back to life in the future.

00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:19.574
The idea of someone coming back from the dead is of course something that exists

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:26.074
in many cultures and societies; after all, we all die, so the prospect of dying but

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:31.614
then coming back to life, well understandably it’s a universal and an appealing one.

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:37.584
But, for much of human history, it has remained a fantasy, a pipe

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:41.974
dream, something relegated to myths and science fiction novels.

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.464
When someone dies, they die.

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:49.040
You might have certain religious beliefs about what happens to their spirit

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.344
or their soul after they die, but their body in its original form is no more.

00:02:56.832 --> 00:03:01.992
This was also what a 12-year-old American boy called Robert Ettinger thought,

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:07.152
that was, until he started reading a story called “The Jameson Satellite”.

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:12.114
The story was published in a magazine called Air Wonder

00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:17.604
Stories in 1931, and it was written by an author called Neil R.

00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:18.114
Jones.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:26.464
In the story, a professor decided to send his corpse into space after he died, where

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:34.851
he thought it would be preserved forever at absolute zero, −273.15 degrees Celsius.

00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:42.051
Then, millions of years later, and with humanity long extinct, a

00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:46.721
group of intelligent robots discover the professor’s frozen corpse.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:52.161
The robots, these machine men, are fascinated by the discovery of

00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:56.821
a human being, as us poor humans have been extinct for millennia.

00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:01.921
They decide to revive the professor by transferring

00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:05.611
his brain into a mechanical body, similar to their own.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:07.721
It works.

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:14.761
This transformation grants Professor Jameson immortality and the ability to survive in space.

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:20.731
The 12-year-old boy, Robert Ettinger, didn’t just read this story and think

00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:27.711
“wow, cool story”, he read it and thought “wow, one day this will be possible”.

00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:32.001
He realised that that day might be quite a way off.

00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:36.921
I mean, this was 1931 and nobody had ever even been to space.

00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:43.601
But technology was rapidly advancing, and the young boy assumed that working on the secret to

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:49.651
eternal life and preserving the human corpse would be a big focus for scientists around the world.

00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:57.751
In this, he was wrong, and as the years went by, he started to realise that it was

00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:03.151
extremely unlikely that sufficient progress in the subject would be made in his lifetime.

00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:09.121
He was destined to face the same fate as every other human being

00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:14.231
in history; he was confronted by the reality of his own mortality.

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.761
But Robert Ettinger wasn't the kind of person to just

00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:21.791
give up on an idea that had captured his imagination.

00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:26.001
As he grew up, this thought stayed with him.

00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:30.861
He had decided to become a physics professor and the idea of

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:36.341
preserving human life beyond death became his focus and obsession.

00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:41.991
And in 1962, Ettinger published a book that would become a

00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:46.011
cornerstone in the field of what would come to be called cryonics.

00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:54.351
This book was called "The Prospect of Immortality," and in it he detailed his theories and

00:05:54.351 --> 00:06:01.761
ideas about how humans could be frozen and, potentially, brought back to life in the future.

00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:08.181
As you might imagine, this was a revolutionary idea, and

00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:12.361
Ettinger was all over the news talking about this hypothesis.

00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:19.219
This idea, which he had been cherishing since he was a 12-year-old boy, was

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:24.229
finally something that serious people were considering as a viable option.

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.979
So, let me briefly explain how it works from a scientific point of view.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:37.204
As you’ll know, freezing something is an effective way of extending the lifespan of something.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:42.236
Whether it’s fish fingers, ice cream, or some leftover lunch, if you

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:45.696
put something in the freezer then it won’t go bad for a long time.

00:06:47.016 --> 00:06:50.046
But clearly, the purpose of freezing a human after

00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:53.456
they die is very different to freezing a fish finger.

00:06:54.086 --> 00:06:59.656
The freezing is the easy bit; freezing safely is where it gets more complicated.

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:03.156
So, cryonics works something like this.

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:09.586
After someone dies, there is a very short window in which their body can be frozen.

00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:15.446
Too long and the body starts to decay, and of course you cannot start the

00:07:15.446 --> 00:07:20.136
process before the person is dead as that is legally considered murder.

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:25.936
So, you have this short window after someone is pronounced dead to lower their

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:31.036
body temperature so that all the metabolic processes are slowed down or stopped.

00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:37.536
To do this, a corpse is typically placed in an ice bath before being

00:07:37.546 --> 00:07:41.846
transported to the cryonics company for processing and storage.

00:07:42.866 --> 00:07:48.326
During this time it needs to be kept cold but not too cold, because if

00:07:48.326 --> 00:07:53.606
it gets too cold, ice crystals can form in the organs and in the blood.

00:07:54.936 --> 00:08:01.306
Ice crystals are problematic because they have sharp edges, so as they form they

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:06.686
can cut through cells and tissues, which can cause irreparable damage to the cells.

00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:11.706
So, the key is to keep the body cold enough to stop the

00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:15.896
metabolic processes but not so cold that ice crystals form.

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:25.056
Then, when it is safely at the cryonics laboratory, all of the blood is drained from the body and

00:08:25.056 --> 00:08:31.376
is replaced by a fluid similar to the kind that you put in your car to stop the engine freezing.

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:37.376
The purpose of this is so that the corpse can then be frozen without

00:08:37.396 --> 00:08:42.406
any damage to the cells, and this is a process called “vitrification”.

00:08:43.896 --> 00:08:50.406
If you know your Latin, “vitrification” comes from the Latin word “vitrum”, meaning glass.

00:08:51.436 --> 00:08:58.116
And what vitrification does is it turns bodily fluids into a solid

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:03.916
“glass-like” state, so that it freezes but ice crystals don’t form.

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:09.206
And then, the final stage is to reduce the temperature

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:15.196
even further, bringing it down to -196 degrees Celsius.

00:09:16.736 --> 00:09:20.216
Of course, this is not really the “final” stage of the procedure.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:26.076
The final stage is bringing the patient back to life again, but we’ll come to that bit in a minute.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:33.266
Now, there are a bunch of different cryonics companies around the world, but fewer than 10.

00:09:34.276 --> 00:09:38.356
They all work in slightly different ways, and the process they

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:43.406
use is similar to the one I described, but with a few variants.

00:09:44.757 --> 00:09:49.607
And in terms of the costs, well these vary wildly.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:58.477
The leading US company is called Alcor, and it charges $200,000 for a

00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:04.827
full body cryopreservation and $80,000 if you only want your head done.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.290
You might think, “hey, I can understand that I might be able to save a bit of money by

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.060
only getting by head done if I’m having a massage, but if I’m going to be brought back

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:21.040
to life in a 1,000 years time, I’d quite like my entire body, thank you very much”.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:27.140
That's a perfectly sensible argument, but the reason that there is the option to only

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:33.760
preserve your head comes back to the idea in the 1931 story, “The Jameson Satellite”.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:41.720
If you remember, the professor’s head was brought back to life and implanted on a robot body.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:48.790
And the theory goes that if technology has advanced far enough to bring someone back from

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:55.470
the dead, then the technology will exist to attach a head onto the body of another human

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:01.360
or a robot or computer or something that you or I can’t even fathom, we can’t imagine.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:09.040
So, if you’d like to save a cool $120,000 and you’d like to chance

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.340
it by only getting your head done, then, that option exists too.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:22.580
In fact, if finances are a little tight and even $80,000 is too much, you can go to the

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.400
Russian cryonics company you heard about right at the start of the episode, KrioRus.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:37.450
There it’s $46,000 for entire body cryopreservation or a mere $23,000 for just your head.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:46.300
But the facilities seem to be somewhat more basic - the American one, to my untrained eyes at least,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.270
looks more like a more genuine medical facility while the Russian one is located in what looks

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:59.390
like a normal countryside house, down a road in a forest, and seems like a more artisanal affair.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.460
If money was no object, and this was something I was keen on, I think I know which one I’d go for.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.510
Now, on the subject of cost, the main cost of cryopreservation is the

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.310
start and the end, the preparing the body to be frozen and then the

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.200
reviving of the corpse, but keeping the body properly stored is not cheap.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:32.430
And you might well be thinking, “ok, I pay a one-off fee for this service, but I might be frozen

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:38.530
for hundreds or thousands of years, presumably there is an annual subscription or something.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.764
I can’t expect my great great great great great great grandchildren to keep footing the bill?”

00:12:44.854 --> 00:12:50.904
And that is also a perfectly valid question, and the way that these companies tend to go

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:57.774
about it is by investing the large lump sum you paid at the start into a stock market fund,

00:12:58.374 --> 00:13:04.074
so that it continues to generate enough of an annual return to cover the costs of the storage.

00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:06.504
Well, that’s the theory at least.

00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:12.104
And in terms of the one big elephant in the room that we haven’t talked

00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:17.924
about yet, how and when does one go from a frozen corpse in a Russian

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:24.884
warehouse to a singing, dancing, smiling and undoubtedly “alive” human being?

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:32.943
That is the big mystery, and cryonics companies tend to conveniently sidestep

00:13:33.084 --> 00:13:38.070
that question, instead saying “we’re not sure, but hopefully in the future”.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.250
To quote the Alcor website’s FAQs section, to the question

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.833
of “When will patients be revived”, the answer is:

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:53.185
"that depends on when they are cryopreserved, the specific details of how well they're cryopreserved

00:13:53.455 --> 00:14:00.085
and how rapidly future medical technologies, particularly molecular nanotechnology are developed.

00:14:01.115 --> 00:14:06.635
Eventually a time will come when human suspended animation will be perfected.

00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:11.045
In other words, it will be possible to routinely turn people off

00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:16.565
and on for medical time travel, space, travel, and other purposes.

00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:23.495
Some think it will take centuries before patients can be revived while others think the accelerating

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:29.885
pace of technological change might so rapidly transform our world that decades would suffice.

00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:32.915
Alcor is planning for however long it might take.

00:14:34.505 --> 00:14:39.035
"
In other words, these cryonics companies are not responsible for developing

00:14:39.035 --> 00:14:43.425
the technology that will allow their patients to be revived, but when this

00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:47.575
technology is developed, it will be harnessed to revive these patients.

00:14:49.035 --> 00:14:53.875
Now, the first person to be cryogenically frozen was an old woman

00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:59.355
from California in April of 1966, a matter of a few years after the

00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:03.685
publication of Robert Ettinger’s influential The Prospect of Immortality.

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:10.745
But a few months later her relatives decided that they weren’t so keen on the idea, so she was

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:17.115
removed from the container, thawed, defrosted, one might say, and then given a traditional burial.

00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:24.335
A year later, in January of 1967, saw the first person to be cryopreserved

00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:28.955
in the form of a university psychology professor called James Bedford.

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:34.725
He was actually the first client of Alcor, and is still there today,

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:39.805
in Alcor’s storage unit in Scottsdale, Arizona, patiently waiting

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:43.245
for the day to come when he can safely be brought back to life.

00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:51.575
Now, the final area to touch on when talking about Cryonics is the ethical questions around it.

00:15:52.925 --> 00:15:59.575
These are all theoretical at the moment, as Professor James Bedford and the other few

00:15:59.575 --> 00:16:04.775
hundred or so people who have been cryopreserved around the world are as dead as Mother

00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:10.465
Theresa or Napoleon or Anne Boleyn or your or my ancestors who died centuries ago.

00:16:11.895 --> 00:16:16.895
But if it works, and of course this is a big “if”, it

00:16:16.905 --> 00:16:20.605
fundamentally changes the concept of life and death.

00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:25.605
And it would almost certainly cause people to behave differently.

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:29.385
If you knew that you could be brought back to life in

00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:33.085
the future, how would that change your behaviour today?

00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:37.345
How would it change our perception of what it means to grow old?

00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:42.465
And what would it mean to be able to bring someone back from the dead?

00:16:43.645 --> 00:16:50.595
What’s more, clearly it is an expensive process, and there are many valid questions about other

00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:56.645
ways in which the medical expertise and costs could be better used, helping people live longer

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:02.925
and healthier lives today rather than potentially being brought back to life in a thousand years.

00:17:04.455 --> 00:17:09.945
And that’s even before we get into any discussion of the ethics or problems

00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:16.645
of how someone who died in 1967 might adapt to life in the year 3,000.

00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:21.762
Thinking back to Professor James Bedford, the first person

00:17:21.762 --> 00:17:28.322
to be cryopreserved, he was born in 1893 and died in 1967.

00:17:29.122 --> 00:17:34.632
He would probably be baffled if he was brought back from the dead today and could

00:17:34.632 --> 00:17:42.242
see life in 2024, so imagine what life would be like for him in the year 3024.

00:17:43.432 --> 00:17:48.192
I mean, your guess is as good as mine, but in all probability it would be so

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:53.082
mind bogglingly different that there would be ethical questions about whether it

00:17:53.082 --> 00:17:57.502
is the right thing to bring someone back from the dead in such a foreign world.

00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:04.732
But, to take the other side of the argument, it’s what they wanted, they paid a large amount

00:18:04.732 --> 00:18:09.962
of money for it, and no doubt fully considered all of the questions that we are today.

00:18:11.312 --> 00:18:15.352
And if someone can be brought back from the dead and given the chance to

00:18:15.352 --> 00:18:19.832
live again, surely that is one of the greatest gifts that can be given.

00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:25.887
In 2015, there was a sad case of a two-year-old girl

00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:29.377
from Thailand who developed a rare form of brain cancer.

00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:35.137
When it became clear that the disease could not be treated, and it was going

00:18:35.137 --> 00:18:40.469
to be fatal, her parents decided that they wanted her to be cryopreserved.

00:18:41.684 --> 00:18:46.797
They contacted Alcor, and after the poor young girl died shortly after

00:18:46.797 --> 00:18:52.213
her third birthday, she was whisked away and is now a patient at Alcor.

00:18:53.837 --> 00:18:58.747
In her case, her parents wanted to do everything they could to give her

00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:03.397
the chance to live, and when it was clear that the cancer treatments would

00:19:03.397 --> 00:19:07.497
not be enough, they decided that this was the only chance they had left.

00:19:08.967 --> 00:19:14.927
The chance might be slim, but it was better than zero, at least in her parents’ eyes.

00:19:15.147 --> 00:19:18.097
It was the last thing they could do for their daughter.

00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:26.147
But, to the critics of cryonics and cryopreservation, it is a scam, it is very successful at

00:19:26.147 --> 00:19:32.547
selling the dream of returning from the dead but provides no concrete plan about how to do it.

00:19:34.017 --> 00:19:39.247
As you saw on the Alcor website, there is no plan, just a hope

00:19:39.687 --> 00:19:43.657
that at some point in the future someone might solve this problem.

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:50.507
And even if the technology does progress to a position where these companies feel like they can

00:19:50.517 --> 00:19:57.367
give it a shot at reviving someone, inevitably the first attempts would fail, people might be

00:19:57.367 --> 00:20:03.457
brought back to life in a hugely damaged state and into a world that they do not want to be in.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:10.084
And even if the process of bringing someone back to life without any degradation

00:20:10.407 --> 00:20:15.097
is perfected, this would lead to the most monumental shift in society.

00:20:16.387 --> 00:20:22.067
It is still a very long way off, but it’s certainly a thought-provoking subject to learn about,

00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:29.797
and leaves us thinking about the very nature of life, death, and what it means to be human.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:35.647
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cryonics.

00:20:36.017 --> 00:20:39.167
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:42.667
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:44.877
Did you know about cryonics before?

00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.867
If money was no object, would you do it?

00:20:48.317 --> 00:20:52.237
And how do you think it would change our world if we knew it was possible?

00:20:52.717 --> 00:20:55.787
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:56.147 --> 00:20:58.737

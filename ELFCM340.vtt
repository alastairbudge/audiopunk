Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.290
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.390
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.190
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.870
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.150
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.340
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.100
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.820
is part three of our three-part

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.210
mini-series on great queens.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.613
In part one we looked at the

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.213
tragic life of Anne Boleyn,

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:33.503
the second wife of Henry VIII.

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:36.563
In part two, we looked at the life

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:39.073
of her daughter, Queen Elizabeth I of

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:41.653
England, and saw how she navigated a

00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:44.203
world of men to leave a phenomenal legacy.

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:47.463
And today we are moving abroad, to

00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:49.913
Russia, in fact, where we will meet

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:52.649
another strong, powerful woman, a woman

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.129
who had such an impact on Russia that she

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.639
earned herself the nickname “The Great”.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.489
Yes, it’s Catherine, the 18th

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:02.239
century Empress of Russia.

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:04.829
Her story is one of power,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.549
deceit, sex and rebellion, though

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.319
not necessarily in that order.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.417
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:18.037
In 1744, a fourteen-year-old

00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:20.577
Prussian princess arrived in Russia.

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:23.547
The princess was named

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:25.477
Sophie Friederike Auguste.

00:01:25.937 --> 00:01:28.107
She was charming and quick-witted,

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.427
and impressed everyone she met.

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:33.397
She had been brought there at the

00:01:33.397 --> 00:01:35.719
request of the childless Empress,

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.947
Elizabeth I, as a potential match for her

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:42.047
nephew, Peter, who was 15 at the time.

00:01:43.277 --> 00:01:44.707
It wasn’t, in fact, the

00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:46.347
first time the pair had met.

00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:48.927
They were second cousins, and had

00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:50.837
met when Sophie was 10-years-old.

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:54.147
She hated Peter the first time

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.977
they met, and she hated him

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.767
even more four years later.

00:01:58.627 --> 00:02:00.817
He was a pale, sickly looking

00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:02.983
boy, who already stunk  of

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:05.083
alcohol despite his young age.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.733
Nevertheless, the pair would marry,

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:11.173
but it would be an event that would

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.893
ultimately lead to the princess rising up

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:16.723
against her husband, overthrowing him and

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:19.093
taking the Russian throne for herself.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:23.753
The Princess, this “Sophie”, was of course

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.663
Catherine, Catherine The Great of Russia.

00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:29.933
Like the English queens of parts

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.763
one and two of this mini-series,

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:34.333
she had to survive in a hostile

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:36.953
male-dominated environment, fending

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:39.283
off constant threats and conspiracies.

00:02:40.303 --> 00:02:43.593
Like Elizabeth I, and unlike Anne Boleyn,

00:02:43.973 --> 00:02:46.113
she succeeded, at least in terms of

00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:48.623
holding on to power until her last breath.

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:52.343
And although the outcomes of

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:54.573
Elizabeth I and Catherine the Great

00:02:54.823 --> 00:02:57.673
are similar, the techniques to get

00:02:57.673 --> 00:02:59.983
there were very different, and in

00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:02.233
many ways further underline the

00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:04.903
hypocrisy and double standards  that

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:06.813
female rulers had to put up with.

00:03:07.943 --> 00:03:09.373
So, where to start?

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:11.783
Well, let’s start with her character.

00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:15.063
Like Anne Boleyn and Elizabeth, she was

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:17.613
clearly a strong-willed, intelligent,

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.393
charismatic woman, more than capable

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:22.643
of holding her own in the company of

00:03:22.643 --> 00:03:24.503
men who thought themselves superior.

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.743
She had grown up with a fashionable

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:30.323
French governess and received a modern

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.156
education influenced by the Enlightenment,

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.673
the contemporary philosophical movement

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:37.503
based on the importance of reason.

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:41.613
As such, she was an avid reader of

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.783
political works from authors like

00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:46.073
Plutarch, Tacitus, Machiavelli

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:48.473
and Voltaire, all which highlight

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:49.913
the importance of public

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:51.683
opinion and the shaping of it.

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.493
After arriving in Russia and marrying

00:03:55.493 --> 00:03:57.513
Peter, which she did when she was a

00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:00.333
mere 16-years-old, she set about turning

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.543
herself into a full Russian princess.

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:07.213
Gone was the name of Sophie, she would

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:10.153
now be called Yekaterina, or, Catherine,

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:12.388
echoing the legacy of Catherine the I,

00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:14.923
the legendary wife of Peter the Great.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:18.123
She converted to the Russian orthodox

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:20.613
church, and became fluent in Russian.

00:04:21.883 --> 00:04:24.263
This was in stark contrast to

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.083
her husband, Peter, who made

00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:28.463
no secret of his preference for

00:04:28.463 --> 00:04:30.553
Prussia and all things Prussian.

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:33.973
At court, Catherine was popular

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.173
with nobles and servants alike.

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:37.823
She treated her servants

00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:39.903
well, and was quick-witted and

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:41.753
funny when in conversation.

00:04:42.893 --> 00:04:44.853
Peter, on the other hand was

00:04:44.853 --> 00:04:47.850
neurotic, boring, and an alcoholic.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.880
It couldn’t have been a worse match,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.570
but of course, marriages in the 18th

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.380
century were not about matches of

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.680
character, or matters of the heart;

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.810
the objective was to form an alliance,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.230
and above all, to produce an heir.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.750
As such, on their wedding night, Catherine

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.550
might have dreaded the thought, but

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.450
she knew what was expected of her.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.360
She waited upstairs in the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.840
bedroom, ready to perform her duty.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.490
Peter did come to bed several hours

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.060
later, but was completely drunk and

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.020
passed out, fell over onto the floor.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.550
The marriage was not consummated that

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.330
evening, and there are some theories that

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.210
the pair never actually slept together,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.994
so much was their hatred for one another.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.110
Whether this is true or not,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.220
Catherine did fall pregnant.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.590
Over the next decade, Catherine, in fact,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.120
fell pregnant several times, losing the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.920
baby each time, until 1754, when she

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.970
successfully gave birth to a son, Paul.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.260
Now, it’s widely believed that both

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.200
Catherine and Peter were having

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.570
affairs with other people, so Paul

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.100
was almost certainly not Peter’s son.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.300
But this didn’t really matter.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.890
The important thing was

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.550
that people thought he was.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.810
And even though she had done what

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.010
was expected and produced a child,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.440
Catherine sensed her position was

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.130
becoming increasingly insecure.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.280
Given her trouble with previous

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.360
pregnancies, great care was given to

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.720
her last pregnancy and her physical

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.030
activities were largely stopped.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.700
This meant no more attendance at Empress

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.270
Elizabeth’s grand balls and other events

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.560
at court; no more working her charm.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.850
Essentially, she had fewer allies,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.690
fewer friends in high places.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.940
Yes, she might have been married to the

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.310
heir, but she knew he hated her, and

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.660
the feeling was most certainly mutual.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.050
Moreover, Peter was only

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.740
getting more cruel towards her.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.710
Not only was he verbally abusive

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.500
towards Catherine, threatening to

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.900
divorce her and send her to a convent,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.410
but he would appear in public with

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.420
his mistress, embarrassing her in

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.550
front of Russia’s rich and powerful.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.270
As such, she began to grow fearful

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.100
that she would be sent away into

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.360
exile once he took the throne.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.370
But Peter’s vulgar behaviour and open

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.590
adoration for his homeland, Prussia

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.460
– which Russia had fought against in

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.110
the Seven Years’ War – this was all

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.630
earning him more and more enemies.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.050
Even Elizabeth began to favour

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.940
Catherine as heir to the throne,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.590
often deriding, making fun of

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.920
Peter as “her foolish nephew”.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.297
Always mindful of her future,

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.407
Catherine began taking steps

00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:52.217
to ensure her own protection.

00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:55.137
She befriended foreign ambassadors and

00:07:55.287 --> 00:07:57.527
built up a network of informants who

00:07:57.717 --> 00:07:59.647
ensured she was always up to date with

00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:02.320
the latest goings on at court, and who

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.780
could provide her with secrets to be used

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.304
as leverage in any potential schemes.

00:08:08.334 --> 00:08:10.414
And several of these allies

00:08:10.414 --> 00:08:12.804
and informants were far more

00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:14.724
than friends and acquaintances.

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:17.294
They would also become her lovers.

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:21.054
One such man, who would prove to be

00:08:21.064 --> 00:08:23.644
vital for her future, was a military

00:08:23.664 --> 00:08:26.114
officer called Grigory Orlov, who

00:08:26.254 --> 00:08:29.244
she began an affair with around 1760.

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:32.204
Just a few years after their affair

00:08:32.204 --> 00:08:35.234
began, Empress Elizabeth died and

00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:37.704
Peter was thrust onto the throne of a

00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:40.354
country he had spent his life despising.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:44.344
Perhaps unsurprisingly, he proved

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:47.204
to be an immensely unpopular leader.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.994
In the days immediately after becoming

00:08:49.994 --> 00:08:52.784
Emperor, he had disrespectfully – and

00:08:52.924 --> 00:08:55.564
true to style, drunkenly – publicly

00:08:55.574 --> 00:08:57.174
celebrated the death of his aunt,

00:08:57.334 --> 00:08:59.264
the popular Empress Elizabeth.

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.234
What’s more, his support for

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:04.524
Russia’s enemy, Prussia, became

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:06.714
intolerable to many at court.

00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:09.844
In an effort to protect herself

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:12.304
and her position, Catherine and her

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:15.054
lover Orlov began conspiring against

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.004
Peter with the help of Orlov’s

00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:18.846
brothers and some other nobles.

00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:22.338
Catherine knew Peter was strongly disliked

00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:24.818
amongst the military and thought that she

00:09:24.818 --> 00:09:26.898
would not struggle to gain their support.

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:28.858
It didn’t take long.

00:09:29.748 --> 00:09:32.138
Just six months after the crown

00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:33.968
was placed on Peter’s head, he

00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:36.528
was unceremoniously booted out,

00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:38.798
kicked out, by his wife, no less.

00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:43.518
On the 9th July 1762, while Peter was

00:09:43.578 --> 00:09:46.298
outside St Petersburg, the 33-year-old

00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:48.548
Catherine sensed her opportunity.

00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:51.768
She dressed in a Russian military uniform,

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.908
led the army through the streets of St

00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:56.577
Petersburg and declared herself Empress.

00:09:57.538 --> 00:10:01.128
And, to cut a long story short, it worked.

00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.118
When Peter returned to the palace

00:10:04.268 --> 00:10:06.298
he surrendered to his wife and

00:10:06.558 --> 00:10:08.518
abdicated, hoping he would be

00:10:08.538 --> 00:10:10.558
exiled to his beloved Prussia.

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.908
But Catherine was no fool.

00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:16.268
She knew that if she did this

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.098
he could lead an uprising

00:10:18.098 --> 00:10:19.498
against her in the future.

00:10:20.248 --> 00:10:22.298
What’s more, he had clearly not built

00:10:22.298 --> 00:10:24.588
up any goodwill with his wife, who

00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:26.498
would refer to him in her memoirs

00:10:26.498 --> 00:10:28.838
as both ‘an idiot and a drunkard’.

00:10:29.218 --> 00:10:31.538
She hated him, and was not

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.268
going to do him any favours.

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:37.418
So she instead had him arrested and

00:10:37.488 --> 00:10:39.988
placed under house arrest, with one of

00:10:39.988 --> 00:10:42.275
the guards being a man called Grigory

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:44.478
Potemkin, who we’ll meet again shortly.

00:10:45.498 --> 00:10:47.968
Eight days later, Peter was dead.

00:10:49.128 --> 00:10:51.088
Now, the cause of Peter’s death

00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:53.258
is still unknown to this day.

00:10:53.848 --> 00:10:56.108
Officially it was reported as due

00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:58.718
to haemorrhoids but the more likely

00:10:58.718 --> 00:11:00.868
story is that he was murdered,

00:11:01.108 --> 00:11:02.848
potentially by Orlov’s brother.

00:11:04.078 --> 00:11:06.478
Whether natural or unnatural causes,

00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:08.508
having him out of the way was

00:11:08.508 --> 00:11:10.418
certainly helpful for Catherine.

00:11:11.688 --> 00:11:13.958
Two months later, as her son Paul

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.328
was too young to rule, Catherine

00:11:16.338 --> 00:11:18.478
was crowned Empress in his place.

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:21.678
She was acutely aware of the need

00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:23.128
to get off on the right foot,

00:11:23.478 --> 00:11:25.468
and project an image of strength.

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:28.698
Like Elizabeth I two centuries

00:11:28.698 --> 00:11:31.158
before, Catherine knew how important

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:33.628
her image was to her rule and she

00:11:33.628 --> 00:11:35.968
cultivated this carefully, following

00:11:35.968 --> 00:11:38.628
the specific examples of two powerful

00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:41.548
Russian female rulers, Catherine I and

00:11:41.828 --> 00:11:43.718
her predecessor, Empress Elizabeth.

00:11:44.848 --> 00:11:46.938
And she trod a careful balance

00:11:46.948 --> 00:11:49.508
between femininity, of embracing

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.968
her female side, and masculinity.

00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:54.678
For her lavish coronation

00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:56.978
ceremony, she commissioned a brand

00:11:56.998 --> 00:11:59.568
new crown, an incredibly grand

00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:01.398
and expensive piece, which was

00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:04.438
adorned with over 5,000 diamonds.

00:12:05.428 --> 00:12:07.928
As Empress, her dresses were often

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:09.698
designed with subtle touches that

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.138
aligned them with men’s military

00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:14.268
clothing, making her look more like

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:16.518
a glamorous but powerful soldier

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:19.078
than a supposedly “weak” woman.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.558
Now, 18th-century Russia, it should

00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:25.468
be said, had seen four female rulers

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:28.028
and the country was, by and large,

00:12:28.178 --> 00:12:30.558
more tolerant to female rule than

00:12:30.728 --> 00:12:32.188
England had been, for example.

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:35.858
But Catherine still faced considerable

00:12:35.968 --> 00:12:37.568
scrutiny stemming from her gender.

00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:40.188
And let’s not forget that she

00:12:40.188 --> 00:12:42.648
was, in the minds of some, a

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:45.348
Prussian-born usurper, a foreigner

00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:47.358
who had stolen the Russian crown.

00:12:48.128 --> 00:12:50.748
So, she needed to tread very carefully.

00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:52.958
But it worked.

00:12:53.238 --> 00:12:55.437
She fitted herself into a man’s

00:12:55.437 --> 00:12:57.677
world, showing that her gender was

00:12:57.687 --> 00:13:00.117
no limitation to her rule, and she

00:13:00.117 --> 00:13:02.567
became an extremely adept leader.

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:06.107
She would work tirelessly from morning

00:13:06.227 --> 00:13:08.887
until night, striving to bring Russia in

00:13:08.887 --> 00:13:10.887
line with its European contemporaries.

00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:13.597
Russia in the 18th century,

00:13:13.657 --> 00:13:15.647
let’s not forget, was a very

00:13:15.747 --> 00:13:17.997
underdeveloped country in comparison

00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:19.767
to most of its Western neighbours.

00:13:20.587 --> 00:13:24.107
Its population was 95% rural, and there

00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:26.957
was the system of serfdom, essentially

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:30.357
rural slavery, where landowners would own

00:13:30.357 --> 00:13:33.207
vast swathes of the country and peasants

00:13:33.337 --> 00:13:35.508
were required to farm their land for them.

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:39.157
Catherine did attempt to reform this

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:42.317
system, and showed sympathy for the

00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:44.747
plight of the serfs, but ultimately

00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:46.829
was unable  to make much progress

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:49.069
with abolishing serfdom, which would

00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:52.099
only be fully abolished in 1861.

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:55.678
She grew to realise that the  progressive

00:13:55.678 --> 00:13:57.568
reforms that she wanted to put into

00:13:57.568 --> 00:13:59.908
place needed to be supported by the

00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:02.278
nobles, and persuading them to give up

00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:04.958
their, at times, tens of thousands of

00:14:05.158 --> 00:14:07.768
slaves really, well, it wasn’t easy.

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.098
In fact, under Catherine’s rule,

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:13.488
the plight of the serf actually

00:14:13.578 --> 00:14:16.048
deteriorated, it got worse, and

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:18.198
Catherine had to deal with more than a

00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:21.108
dozen serf uprisings during her reign.

00:14:22.448 --> 00:14:24.818
The bloodiest and most bizarre

00:14:25.008 --> 00:14:28.388
came in 1774, and was led not

00:14:28.398 --> 00:14:31.128
by a serf but by a former army

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:33.579
officer called Emelyan Pugachev.

00:14:34.348 --> 00:14:36.468
Pugachev had managed to convince a

00:14:36.468 --> 00:14:39.128
large group of peasants that he was the

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.968
deposed emperor Peter – yes the same

00:14:41.968 --> 00:14:44.078
Peter who had died 12 years before.

00:14:45.528 --> 00:14:47.788
This uprising became the largest

00:14:47.818 --> 00:14:49.738
peasant revolt in European history,

00:14:50.008 --> 00:14:52.978
with 25,000 peasants fighting against

00:14:52.978 --> 00:14:55.318
the state, and 5,000 government

00:14:55.338 --> 00:14:57.548
officials and noblemen being killed.

00:14:58.938 --> 00:15:01.178
The rebellion lasted two years,

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.618
and when it was finally crushed

00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:06.038
Catherine showed no mercy.

00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:09.498
The rebel leader, Pugachev, was

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:11.508
brought to a square in Moscow,

00:15:11.848 --> 00:15:13.028
in front of a large crowd.

00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:16.128
He was then beheaded, his head

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:19.038
chopped off, his insides pulled out,

00:15:19.308 --> 00:15:21.458
and then he was chopped into pieces.

00:15:22.248 --> 00:15:24.848
No, you certainly didn’t want to get on

00:15:24.848 --> 00:15:26.448
the wrong side of Catherine The Great.

00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:29.728
She was fearless at home, but would also

00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:32.388
be remembered as being fearless abroad,

00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:34.578
and amassed an impressive amount of

00:15:34.588 --> 00:15:36.658
military victories throughout her reign.

00:15:37.718 --> 00:15:39.638
Just six years after she took

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.818
the throne, in 1768 the Ottoman

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:45.265
Empire had declared war on Russia

00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:47.175
after its interference in Poland.

00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:51.075
The resulting war, the Russo-Turkish

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.735
war, turned out to be a disaster for

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:55.835
the Ottomans and a great victory for

00:15:55.835 --> 00:15:57.955
Catherine, resulting in territorial

00:15:57.975 --> 00:16:00.055
gains of over half a million square

00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:02.365
kilometres, strengthening both the

00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:05.045
empire and Catherine’s position as ruler.

00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:08.295
Some of the lands were even seized

00:16:08.445 --> 00:16:10.515
from one of her former lovers, a

00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:12.995
man called Stanisław Poniatowski,

00:16:13.254 --> 00:16:15.454
who Catherine had, in her early

00:16:15.454 --> 00:16:17.414
reign, helped become King of Poland.

00:16:18.614 --> 00:16:20.904
And on the subject of lovers, it is

00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:23.424
worth spending some time talking about

00:16:23.434 --> 00:16:25.884
this aspect of Catherine’s reign and

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:28.194
character, because this highlights

00:16:28.414 --> 00:16:31.234
not only her cunning and intelligence,

00:16:31.364 --> 00:16:34.024
but also the glaring double standards

00:16:34.084 --> 00:16:36.184
and misogyny she had to face.

00:16:36.883 --> 00:16:38.504
There is little doubt that Catherine

00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:40.774
had lovers, that she had affairs

00:16:40.784 --> 00:16:42.304
with men who were not Peter.

00:16:43.124 --> 00:16:45.464
I mean, who can blame her, Peter

00:16:45.584 --> 00:16:47.744
sounds absolutely vile and she

00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:49.464
clearly found him repulsive.

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:53.444
In terms of just how many lovers,

00:16:53.574 --> 00:16:55.654
she is remembered in the history

00:16:55.654 --> 00:16:58.324
books as being a highly sexualised

00:16:58.344 --> 00:17:00.744
woman, a woman with a large amount

00:17:00.744 --> 00:17:03.294
of lovers, but historians believe the

00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:06.475
number is somewhere between 12 and 22.

00:17:07.567 --> 00:17:10.254
And, had she been a king, clearly

00:17:10.254 --> 00:17:11.825
this wouldn’t have mattered at all,

00:17:12.104 --> 00:17:13.754
it wouldn’t even have been a topic

00:17:13.754 --> 00:17:15.704
of interest, nobody would have spent

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:17.754
any time even thinking about it.

00:17:18.284 --> 00:17:20.503
Having lovers and mistresses was

00:17:20.653 --> 00:17:23.093
completely expected behaviour for a

00:17:23.093 --> 00:17:26.443
king, but it has become a black spot

00:17:26.523 --> 00:17:28.633
on Catherine’s legacy, even to the

00:17:28.633 --> 00:17:30.673
extent that people spread rumours

00:17:30.803 --> 00:17:32.663
that she died while having sex with

00:17:32.663 --> 00:17:35.023
a horse - which I should add, is

00:17:35.163 --> 00:17:37.423
completely untrue, there is zero

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.473
evidence of anything like that happening.

00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:43.563
Now, in some cases Catherine chose some of

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:46.193
her lovers for perfectly rational reasons

00:17:46.193 --> 00:17:48.213
of the heart, she was attracted to them.

00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:51.523
In other cases, she chose them because

00:17:51.523 --> 00:17:53.953
of their potential political usefulness.

00:17:54.883 --> 00:17:56.673
We already heard about Grigory Orlov,

00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:58.983
the military officer who helped

00:17:58.983 --> 00:18:00.503
her seize the throne from Peter.

00:18:01.193 --> 00:18:04.313
In 1774, 12 years after Peter

00:18:04.313 --> 00:18:06.703
had died, the 45 year-old empress

00:18:06.883 --> 00:18:08.733
took another officer as a lover.

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:11.833
His name was Grigory Potemkin.

00:18:12.973 --> 00:18:14.573
If you remember him from earlier

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.833
on in this episode, he was one

00:18:16.843 --> 00:18:18.413
of officers guarding Peter.

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:22.543
Potemkin was a skilled officer and

00:18:22.653 --> 00:18:25.813
intelligent man, and the pair embarked on

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:28.213
a two-year love affair which led to the

00:18:28.213 --> 00:18:30.333
ambitious Potemkin being rewarded with

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:32.593
significant power in the Russian empire.

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:35.433
But, it wasn’t to last.

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:38.373
Potemkin was too ambitious, he

00:18:38.373 --> 00:18:40.503
had too much power, and many

00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:42.153
began to see Catherine giving

00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:44.223
him top jobs as an example of a

00:18:44.393 --> 00:18:46.283
woman submitting to her lover.

00:18:47.383 --> 00:18:49.113
What’s more he was deeply

00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:51.463
insecure, jealous of Catherine, and

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:53.363
fearful that she would leave him.

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:56.193
Enough was enough, and the affair

00:18:56.193 --> 00:18:59.353
ended, but, if anything, their political

00:18:59.353 --> 00:19:02.303
relationship grew, and he became an even

00:19:02.303 --> 00:19:04.073
more valued political advisor to her.

00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:08.103
Now, aside from her military victories,

00:19:08.323 --> 00:19:10.563
Catherine had also enacted a number of

00:19:10.563 --> 00:19:13.193
forward-thinking reforms in an attempt to

00:19:13.373 --> 00:19:15.453
introduce Enlightenment thought to Russia.

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.993
In 1775 she reorganised the structure

00:19:20.003 --> 00:19:22.233
of the empire’s territory for more

00:19:22.243 --> 00:19:25.366
efficient governance; and in  1786 she

00:19:25.656 --> 00:19:28.116
introduced a network of free schools,

00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:30.358
well, free as long as you weren’t a serf.

00:19:31.478 --> 00:19:34.006
And throughout her reign, her patronage

00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:36.956
of the arts also transformed St Petersburg

00:19:36.956 --> 00:19:40.206
into a modern cultural haven, and–like

00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:42.366
Elizabeth I of England–her reign has

00:19:42.366 --> 00:19:44.826
been dubbed “The Golden Age” of Russia.

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:48.556
In one episode that I think particularly

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:50.776
highlights both her understanding

00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:53.055
of public perception and her

00:19:53.055 --> 00:19:55.535
appreciation for reason and science,

00:19:55.672 --> 00:19:57.842
she was also the first person in

00:19:57.842 --> 00:20:00.342
Russia to receive the smallpox jab.

00:20:01.832 --> 00:20:04.272
But her rule wasn’t to last forever.

00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:07.832
On the 5th November 1796, her

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.452
day started like any other.

00:20:10.312 --> 00:20:12.662
This “Great” empress prepared her

00:20:12.662 --> 00:20:15.132
coffee as she always did and she

00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:17.202
spent hours going over her papers.

00:20:18.502 --> 00:20:20.212
Some time that evening, the

00:20:20.212 --> 00:20:22.702
67-year-old Catherine had a stroke,

00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:25.002
and she died the following day.

00:20:26.212 --> 00:20:28.992
After her death, her son Paul took the

00:20:28.992 --> 00:20:31.722
throne, being sure to burn her papers in

00:20:31.722 --> 00:20:33.632
case she had written him out of her will.

00:20:34.882 --> 00:20:37.452
He then took steps in avenging what he

00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:40.082
believed to be wrongs done to his father.

00:20:40.712 --> 00:20:43.602
He dug up Peter and gave him the state

00:20:43.602 --> 00:20:46.742
funeral he never received, and then, shock

00:20:46.742 --> 00:20:49.462
horror, he ordered for his mother and

00:20:49.462 --> 00:20:51.912
father to be buried next to one another.

00:20:52.812 --> 00:20:55.382
Catherine was condemned to be alongside

00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:57.482
her hated husband for eternity.

00:20:58.182 --> 00:21:00.072
She was back, in a strange

00:21:00.072 --> 00:21:02.052
way, to how it had all begun.

00:21:02.952 --> 00:21:04.702
But not without leaving a

00:21:04.712 --> 00:21:07.032
monumental impact on her beloved

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:08.732
adopted country, of Russia.

00:21:09.522 --> 00:21:11.242
She had expanded the land of the

00:21:11.242 --> 00:21:13.832
empire, strengthened its economy, and

00:21:14.032 --> 00:21:16.692
transformed it into a modern European

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.152
power that would rival its contemporaries.

00:21:20.242 --> 00:21:22.962
And, like the subjects of parts one and

00:21:22.972 --> 00:21:25.052
two of this mini-series, Anne Boleyn

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:27.822
and Elizabeth I over in England, she

00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:30.382
had done this as a woman in a world

00:21:30.382 --> 00:21:32.992
of often poisonous conspiring men.

00:21:34.262 --> 00:21:36.712
Much like Elizabeth I, Catherine

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.302
had subtly adapted her image to

00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:41.482
portray herself as more powerful.

00:21:42.612 --> 00:21:44.942
For Elizabeth, she did this by

00:21:45.062 --> 00:21:47.612
insisting she was a virgin to avoid

00:21:47.612 --> 00:21:50.162
marrying and losing power to a husband.

00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:52.832
Catherine went in the opposite

00:21:52.852 --> 00:21:55.686
direction, often using her love

00:21:55.706 --> 00:21:58.366
affairs to advance her power by using

00:21:58.366 --> 00:22:00.496
the alliances and connections of the

00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:02.136
men who she became involved with.

00:22:03.286 --> 00:22:05.486
The strategies of both queens

00:22:05.676 --> 00:22:07.519
clearly worked, in terms of their

00:22:07.596 --> 00:22:09.406
huge legacies that they left

00:22:09.476 --> 00:22:10.746
on their respective countries.

00:22:11.746 --> 00:22:14.186
And in the case of Catherine, perhaps

00:22:14.276 --> 00:22:16.116
it’s even more impressive to think

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:18.016
that she fought against all of this

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:20.886
discrimination, she managed not just to

00:22:20.976 --> 00:22:23.876
survive but to thrive as Empress, and

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:25.516
that she would go down as one of the

00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:27.486
greatest leaders in Russian history.

00:22:28.456 --> 00:22:30.786
And to think, she wasn’t

00:22:31.036 --> 00:22:32.056
even really Russian.

00:22:34.806 --> 00:22:38.096
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on

00:22:38.136 --> 00:22:40.486
Catherine the Great, and with this comes

00:22:40.486 --> 00:22:42.386
the end of this three-part mini-series.

00:22:42.996 --> 00:22:44.756
As always I would love to know what

00:22:44.756 --> 00:22:46.356
you thought of this episode, and

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:47.946
of this mini-series in general?

00:22:48.426 --> 00:22:50.696
For the Russian listeners out there, how

00:22:50.696 --> 00:22:52.176
do you feel about Catherine The Great?

00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:54.956
What lasting impact has she had on Russia?

00:22:55.526 --> 00:22:58.186
What other powerful female queens could

00:22:58.186 --> 00:22:59.756
we have added to this mini-series?

00:23:00.382 --> 00:23:02.132
I would love to know, so let’s

00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:03.512
get this discussion started.

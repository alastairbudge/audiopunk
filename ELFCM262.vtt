Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:16.658
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:20.988
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:25.328
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:29.878
about JK Rowling & The Battle To Publish Harry Potter.

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:37.358
It’s a story of magic and mystery, misery and hope, a story of loss, of perseverance,

00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:42.378
and ultimately, how fairytale endings aren’t always what you might think.

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:48.478
And I’m not talking about the Harry Potter books, but rather the story of what it

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:54.508
took to publish these books, the story of the creator of Harry Potter, JK Rowling.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.390
OK then, JK Rowling & The Battle To Publish Harry Potter

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.790
On June the 26th of 1997, if you were to walk into a bookshop in the UK and head to the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.460
children’s section, if you looked carefully you might see a book with a dark red cover.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.800
There was a drawing on the front of a train with the words “Hogwarts

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.330
Express”, and a confused looking boy with large round glasses and floppy hair.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.920
The title of the book was Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.390
Although you wouldn’t have known it, this book would go on to change the world

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.130
and turn its writer, JK Rowling, into the best selling author in history.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.610
The journey getting there, however, was far from simple.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.400
Joanne Rowling, or JK as she is known in the books, was born on July 31st

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.680
of 1965, the same day of the year as her most famous creation, Harry Potter.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.410
She was the first born child, and her parents were far from happy that they had had a daughter.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.410
They had hoped for a son, and proceeded to treat young Joanne like a young boy,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.890
dressing her up in boy’s clothes and keeping her hair short, even after the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.720
birth of her younger sister.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.390
She grew up in a village in south west England, she

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.990
lived a middle class life, not completely unlike Harry’s.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.640
From an early age she was obsessed with books, and had even

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.460
written her first short story when she was six years old.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.460
Tragedy struck the young Joanne when her mother was diagnosed with multiple

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.370
sclerosis, a devastating disease of the spinal cord and nervous system.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.490
Joanne was only 15 years old.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.290
Like many teenagers, she sought escapism in everything from fantasy to music, but was by no means

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.790
a badly behaved teenager - indeed, she was head girl at her school, and went on to study French

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.860
& Classics at Exeter University, a prestigious university on the south west coast of England.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.700
After graduating, as she spoke French, she used her language skills to pick up a job as

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.450
a bilingual secretary, but her true passion, her real dream, was to become an author.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.490
She had written some stories, but by her own admission, they weren’t very good.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.930
It was to be in the summer of 1990, on a delayed train from King’s Cross

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.290
Station in London to Manchester that she was hit by a flash of light, a

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.320
flash of inspiration, for the story that would change her life forever.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.550
All of a sudden this vision came to her in incredible

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.440
detail about this boy and the magical world he lives in.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.200
Now, if you’ve read Harry Potter or seen the films, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.380
But even if you haven’t, you probably have some kind of idea.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.440
Rowling started developing this idea of Harry and the world he lived in, imagining his friends,

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:37.214
teachers, enemies, the magical spells, everything that would later become part of the books.

00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:41.734
The only problem was that Rowling had brought nothing with her

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:45.684
on the train - not a pen, nor a piece of paper to write with.

00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:51.134
Once she returned to her flat in Clapham Junction in London, where she was

00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:55.514
living at the time, she began writing everything down as quickly as she

00:04:55.514 --> 00:05:00.894
could, a process which would continue pretty much for the next 17 years.

00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:05.544
During all this time, however, her mother’s condition

00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:09.794
was getting worse and she died at the end of 1990.

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:14.484
Rowling had never told her mother about what she was working on.

00:05:15.544 --> 00:05:19.924
Filled with grief and at a loss for what to do, she moved

00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:24.214
to Porto, in Portugal, and took a job as an English teacher.

00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:29.104
Now, an English teacher is of course an incredibly valuable profession,

00:05:29.304 --> 00:05:33.414
and no doubt Rowling was able to help people improve their English.

00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:38.774
But it wasn’t her calling, it wasn’t what she felt she was destined to do.

00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:44.484
All the time, she had this burning idea for Harry building inside her.

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:48.974
On a personal level, she met and married a Portuguese

00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:52.104
journalist, and they had a child together, Jessica.

00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:54.884
But it was not a happy marriage.

00:05:55.214 --> 00:05:59.374
Her husband was abusive, and the relationship ended with

00:05:59.374 --> 00:06:03.524
Rowling fleeing back to the UK with her infant daughter in tow.

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:10.234
She moved to Scotland, to Edinburgh, to be precise, where her younger sister was living.

00:06:11.094 --> 00:06:13.034
Picture this situation for a minute.

00:06:13.694 --> 00:06:18.114
Joanne Rowling is 28 years old with a small child, she has

00:06:18.114 --> 00:06:22.384
no job and no income, and is reliant on social support.

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:29.144
Yet deep inside her she knows that she has this magical story that the world needs to hear.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:36.054
By this time she had already written most of the first Harry Potter book, and indeed

00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:41.754
she had also written the last chapter of the very last book of the series as a way to

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:47.464
inspire her to not give up hope, that she had this huge task that needed to be done.

00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:54.704
Now, as anyone who has had a young baby knows, finding some quiet time alone to do

00:06:54.734 --> 00:07:01.164
anything is pretty tough, so Rowling would push her daughter around in her pram until

00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:06.484
she fell asleep, then she would go to a café to continue working on Harry Potter.

00:07:07.814 --> 00:07:11.714
By 1995 the first book was complete.

00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:15.744
It was unlike other children’s literature at the time,

00:07:16.024 --> 00:07:19.384
as it was filled with dark, complicated material.

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:23.184
Harry is an orphan, his parents are dead.

00:07:23.774 --> 00:07:27.464
He is different, he has near misses with death.

00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:31.024
There are people who betray him, his friends even.

00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:35.614
There is a huge amount of detail in the books, from the names

00:07:35.614 --> 00:07:40.524
and recipes for magic spells through to prices of goods in shops.

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:45.054
It’s also pretty long, at 223 pages.

00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:50.734
So, when Rowling tried to send it out to publishers, as you may well

00:07:50.734 --> 00:07:55.554
know, it was not immediately snapped up, it wasn’t an immediate hit.

00:07:56.254 --> 00:08:01.034
In fact, the first 12 publishers she sent it to rejected it.

00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:07.874
It was too long, it was full of too much detail, it was too dark for children, it was set in

00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:13.374
a boarding school, which is a type of school that only a tiny proportion of children go to.

00:08:14.004 --> 00:08:20.674
The publishers, who were of course adults, and not the target reader, simply didn’t understand.

00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:24.684
One publishing house, however, did.

00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:26.744
It was called Bloomsbury.

00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:32.164
But had it not been for the daughter of one of the publishers, a man

00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:36.874
called Nigel Newton, perhaps Bloomsbury too would have rejected the book.

00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:41.694
Rowling’s agent, a man named Christopher Little, had

00:08:41.694 --> 00:08:44.884
taken a sample of the book to Bloomsbury’s offices.

00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:50.504
The head of Bloomsbury Publishing, Nigel Newton, didn’t read the sample,

00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:55.224
instead taking it home and giving it to his 8-year-old daughter, Alice.

00:08:56.564 --> 00:09:01.614
Alice, so the story goes, took the book upstairs, and returned an

00:09:01.644 --> 00:09:06.474
hour later saying “Dad, this is so much better than anything else.”

00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:13.644
Newton agreed to publish it, and paid Rowling a £2,500 advance.

00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:19.204
£2,500 is about €5,000 in today’s money.

00:09:20.084 --> 00:09:26.054
Not so bad, perhaps, but a tiny amount compared to how much work had gone into

00:09:26.054 --> 00:09:30.704
it and certainly tiny compared to how much of an impact the books would have.

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:36.024
It was enough to pay for rent and nappies for a few months, but

00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:40.454
certainly not enough to provide a large financial cushion for Rowling.

00:09:41.474 --> 00:09:46.874
Indeed, one of the publishers from Bloomsbury, a man named Barry Cunningham, later

00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:51.654
said in an interview that he was worried about Rowling’s ability to continue to

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:56.634
support herself, as she was a young mother without a job, living on benefits.

00:09:57.134 --> 00:10:00.304
He told her she would never make any money from publishing

00:10:00.324 --> 00:10:04.364
children’s books, and even encouraged her to get a day job.

00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:09.914
It might seem ridiculous now, but at the time it was very rare

00:10:09.914 --> 00:10:13.574
for children’s authors to make enough money to support themselves.

00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:17.244
Obviously, this wouldn’t be the case with Joanne Rowling.

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:24.014
As you will know, the book wasn’t published under the name Joanne Rowling, as the

00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:29.124
publishers thought young boys wouldn’t want to read a book written by a female author.

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:34.774
So, Joanne chose the gender-neutral initials, JK, with

00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:38.734
K coming from her paternal grandmother’s name, Kathleen.

00:10:40.134 --> 00:10:44.944
When the book was eventually published, in June of 1997, there

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:49.304
was no great fanfare, no great celebration across the country.

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:52.784
It was a children’s book like any other children’s book.

00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:59.524
But sure enough, as kids across the country began to pick it up and

00:10:59.674 --> 00:11:03.534
news began to spread, more and more copies were sold every week.

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:09.284
Without any real marketing behind it, the book was becoming a sensation.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:13.874
It was simply so good that kids told other kids, parents

00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:16.884
told other parents, and everyone wanted to read it.

00:11:17.754 --> 00:11:21.804
If you are my sort of age, perhaps you can relate to this.

00:11:22.304 --> 00:11:27.044
I was just 10 years old when the first book came out, and I can remember

00:11:27.174 --> 00:11:31.603
being completely captivated by it and everyone talking about it.

00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:36.194
Of course, I knew nothing about the woman behind the book and the

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:40.844
struggles that she had gone through to publish it, but when you know about

00:11:40.844 --> 00:11:45.364
JK Rowling, a lot more of the Harry Potter books start to make sense.

00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:50.484
For example, King’s Cross Station plays an important role in the

00:11:50.484 --> 00:11:54.284
books, as that’s where the train leaves from to go to Hogwarts.

00:11:54.774 --> 00:12:00.014
It is a real train station in London, and it was the place where Rowling first

00:12:00.014 --> 00:12:05.374
had the idea for the books, and it was also the place where her parents first met.

00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:10.044
Rowling had a deeply loving relationship with her mother.

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:17.044
She never told her mother about Harry Potter, and has publicly spoken about how much she regretted

00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:23.054
not doing this, and how much she wished she had more time with her mother before she died.

00:12:24.204 --> 00:12:29.114
If you’ve read the books, you’ll remember that this sense of loss is something that

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:36.144
Harry feels throughout, and he has frequent dreams and visions about his dead parents.

00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:41.604
And Rowling had a deeply troubled relationship with her father.

00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:48.614
From a young age, Rowling always felt that she had disappointed him, first by being a daughter,

00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:55.174
not a son, and it seemed that nothing she could do would get his approval or make him happy.

00:12:56.172 --> 00:13:02.514
Furthermore, her father remarried soon after his wife’s death, to his secretary no less,

00:13:02.584 --> 00:13:08.624
which Rowling found distressing, and she cut out her father completely from her life.

00:13:09.544 --> 00:13:13.374
Again, if you remember the story of Harry Potter, there is the

00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:18.234
constant theme of a search for a father figure, of someone who will

00:13:18.234 --> 00:13:22.844
fill the gap left in Harry’s life after the death of his own father.

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:30.394
And especially compared to other children’s fiction the Harry Potter stories are dark and bleak.

00:13:30.754 --> 00:13:31.494
People die.

00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:33.534
There is danger throughout.

00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:35.944
A lot of it just isn’t very happy.

00:13:36.814 --> 00:13:41.654
When you know what JK Rowling went through as she was writing the stories, from

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:46.864
the abusive relationship with her first husband through to the prolonged multiple

00:13:46.864 --> 00:13:52.224
sclerosis and death of her adored mother, then struggling to make ends meet with a

00:13:52.224 --> 00:13:57.854
young daughter, well it seems perfectly understandable that there is a lot of darkness.

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:03.134
Indeed, she once spoke about the deep depression that she felt when she was

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:08.304
in Edinburgh writing the first book, describing it as being “characterised by

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:14.094
a numbness, a coldness and an inability to believe you will feel happy again.

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:16.934
All the colour drained out of life”.

00:14:17.634 --> 00:14:24.184
Now, if you remember the Dementors from the Harry Potter books, the nasty creatures that first

00:14:24.184 --> 00:14:30.994
appear in the third book, they are described as “infesting the darkest, filthiest places, they

00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:38.344
glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around them”.

00:14:39.584 --> 00:14:44.054
Fortunately for Rowling, the books were to prove to be her escape.

00:14:44.824 --> 00:14:49.104
After the rip-roaring success of the first book, there was a bidding

00:14:49.124 --> 00:14:52.824
war for the publishing rights to take it to the United States.

00:14:53.244 --> 00:14:58.344
A publishing house called Scholastic paid $105,000 dollars for

00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:02.444
the rights to the first book, and it was a phenomenal success.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:08.104
JK Rowling had become a celebrity author, and the book series would

00:15:08.104 --> 00:15:13.134
go on to sell over half a billion copies worldwide and turn its author

00:15:13.494 --> 00:15:17.904
into the best-selling and subsequently wealthiest author in history.

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:25.584
It has been translated into over 80 languages, including everything from Scots to Tibetan,

00:15:25.864 --> 00:15:31.184
and has been read and loved by hundreds of millions of children all over the world.

00:15:32.234 --> 00:15:37.214
Although there are plenty of criticisms that have been levelled against JK Rowling

00:15:37.294 --> 00:15:42.754
over the years, too many for us even to go into now, it is undeniable that there

00:15:42.754 --> 00:15:48.569
are few people who have brought magic and joy to as many people as JK Rowling.

00:15:49.224 --> 00:15:53.154
She had to overcome some serious obstacles to get to where she wanted to

00:15:53.154 --> 00:15:59.374
go, but in the end she got there, and created Harry Potter, the boy with

00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:04.094
a scar on his forehead, a creation that would change the world forever.

00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:12.621
OK then, that is it for this look at JK Rowling and the battle to publish Harry Potter.

00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:18.321
In our next members-only episode we are actually going to explore this subject a little bit

00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:24.641
further, and look at how Harry Potter changed the cultural landscape, with everything from its

00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:30.511
effect on children’s literature through to its effect on fan culture and Britain’s soft power.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.821
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:16:35.021 --> 00:16:36.611
Are you a Harry Potter fan?

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:40.181
What did the Harry Potter books mean to you, growing up?

00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:42.491
Or what did they mean to your kids?

00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:47.481
Did you know about the struggles of JK Rowling, and how does knowing

00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:50.951
about them affect your relationship with the books, if at all?

00:16:51.331 --> 00:16:52.521
I would love to know.

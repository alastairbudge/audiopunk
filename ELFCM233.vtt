Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:18.034
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.354
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:29.474
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Great Stink.

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:34.704
A stink, by the way, means a terrible smell, a foul odour.

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:41.854
And in London, in the mid-19th century, there was a great stink indeed,

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:48.234
a stink so bad, a smell so terrible, that it resulted in some of the

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:53.714
most important, but least visible, changes to the city in history.

00:00:54.224 --> 00:01:01.064
So, in this episode, which I’m pleased to say does not come with an accompanying fragrance,

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:06.914
we will first talk about life in London in the 19th century, we’ll talk about the

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:13.214
circumstances that led up to the Great Stink, what actually happened during the summer

00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:20.354
of 1858, the actions that were taken, and how this changed the city of London forever.

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:25.294
I should, perhaps, warn you that there will be some descriptions of

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:30.124
some pretty bad smells in the next twenty minutes, so if you were

00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:34.934
about to eat your breakfast, then I’d press pause and do that first.

00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:42.045
OK then, The Great Stink, the smelliest story in the history of London.

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:47.245
If you have been to London, you will know that it has a

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:51.655
large river that runs through the middle, called the Thames.

00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:55.875
Without this river, there would have been no London, or

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:59.405
at least London would never have been what it is today.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:07.285
The Romans chose to settle on the northern banks of London because the Thames provided easy access.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:13.445
The Vikings sailed up the Thames to attack medieval London, and the Thames

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:19.214
later on provided fantastic access to both trade and military ships.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.445
It’s a big river, both wide and deep.

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:28.045
At London Bridge, in the centre of London, it’s around

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:33.625
250 metres wide, and can be up to 25 metres deep.

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:39.335
It’s also a tidal river, meaning that the level of

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:43.756
the water in the river goes up and down with the tide.

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:51.375
And for centuries, in fact for the entirety of the history of London, the Thames

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:58.655
was the main source both of drinking water and the main rubbish tip for Londoners.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:06.785
Waste from industry, waste from cooking, waste from slaughterhouses - the places where animals

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:14.075
were killed - and of course human waste, urine and faeces - most of it ended up in the Thames.

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.725
I know what you’re probably thinking.

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:21.111
Hmm, getting your drinking water from the same place

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:24.105
where you put your rubbish doesn’t sound like a good idea.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:32.465
But what people in London thought was that, because the Thames was a tidal river and so close to

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:41.025
the sea, all of the bad stuff would be flushed out to sea, and the water would be fine to drink.

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:48.695
The problem was that the tide was so strong that it also pulled all of the rubbish back

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:55.345
up the river, so it wasn’t so simple as all of the waste just going in one direction.

00:03:56.595 --> 00:04:01.415
But the river was big, and for centuries the population of

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:06.145
London was sufficiently small that it didn’t really matter.

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:12.115
In the year 1300 London was one of the biggest cities in

00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:17.405
Europe, but its population was still only around 80,000 people.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:27.365
By 1800 it had reached a million, and by 1860 it had grown threefold to over 3 million.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:32.235
The river Thames was, of course, still the same size.

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:35.955
The city was cramped, it was crowded.

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:42.385
Very few people had flushing toilets, and they would take their household waste

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:49.145
to primitive cesspits, essentially just holes in the ground full of waste.

00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:57.995
These cesspits would often overflow, leading to horrible waste flowing down the streets of the city.

00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:03.055
Some of these cesspits were linked up to sewers.

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:09.215
Now, sewer is a word that we’ll hear a lot in this episode - a sewer is

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:14.795
the underground pipe used to take waste away from one area to another.

00:05:15.805 --> 00:05:21.455
These sewers were often very basic, normally made of wood, which

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:25.845
meant that they would frequently leak waste into the ground.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:33.855
They, theoretically, led the waste directly into the Thames, which was by the mid-19th

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:41.155
century collecting all of the waste of a rapidly industrialising city of 3 million people.

00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:47.775
The city had, by this time, developed its own nasty smell.

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:55.005
I’ll leave you to think about exactly what that smell would have been, but it certainly wasn’t nice.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:06:02.045
And starting in 1831, the city had started to see outbreaks of

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:07.375
cholera, a nasty infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea.

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:13.215
These outbreaks continued, and tens of thousands of people died.

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:21.795
The presiding belief about how infections spread at this time was something called the miasma

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:30.555
theory, which essentially says that diseases and infections such as cholera spread through bad air.

00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:36.195
Although we now know that this was completely false, it

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:40.225
isn’t hard to imagine how people came to this conclusion.

00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:46.735
The city was very smelly, there was lots of rotting food and waste

00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:51.975
around, and it seemed plausible that this nasty smell was causing cholera.

00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:58.655
It was, in fact, an English physician called John Snow who first

00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:03.485
suggested that cholera was caused by drinking contaminated water.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:09.115
Although he conducted several experiments that strongly suggested

00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:13.255
this was the case, his suggestions were largely ignored.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.670
The miasma theory had been the dominant theory since Hippocrates  in

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.971
the fourth century BC, so simply saying it was wrong was a bold move.

00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:33.381
Given that the presiding belief was that it was bad smells that caused disease

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:39.411
to spread, the authorities in London hurried to get rid of the open, stinking

00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:45.541
cesspits, and move to flushing sewers that would take the waste more quickly

00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:50.821
away from the areas in which people lived, and flush it out into the Thames.

00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:57.801
This might have made the streets smell slightly better, but did nothing to

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:02.801
help the outbreaks of cholera, which is, of course, an infection carried

00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:07.431
by contaminated water, it isn’t something you get through bad smells.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:12.991
The water was still filthy, and the sewers leaked into the

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:16.861
drinking water, and there were continued outbreaks of cholera.

00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:23.751
Then in the summer of 1858, in fact only a month after

00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:28.495
the death of John Snow, the city was hit by a heatwave.

00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:35.241
Now, you probably don’t associate London, or any part of the UK for that

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:40.681
matter, with wonderful hot weather, but at times it can get quite hot.

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:45.441
And the summer of 1858 was one of those times.

00:08:46.531 --> 00:08:50.681
Towards the end of June the temperature started rising.

00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:57.641
It got to 35 degrees Centigrade in the shade and up to 48 degrees in the sun.

00:08:58.511 --> 00:08:59.761
Lovely, you might think.

00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:06.121
Well, it might be lovely if you are sitting on a beach somewhere sipping a cold drink.

00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:09.011
But it was not lovely in London.

00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:15.461
Now, I want you to imagine what the effect of this temperature would be on a river

00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:23.131
25 metres deep and 250 metres wide that, for its entire history, has been filled with

00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:29.953
human waste, dead animals, industrial waste and all sorts of horrible, rotting things.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:38.663
Imagine this dark brown water getting heated up to almost 50 degrees Centigrade under the hot sun.

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:48.593
It started to evaporate, leaving pieces of waste on the banks, and reducing to a thick brown slime.

00:09:49.543 --> 00:09:53.122
It was horrible to look at, but even worse to smell.

00:09:54.082 --> 00:10:01.502
In a letter to a friend, the author Charles Dickens wrote “I can certify that the offensive

00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:08.652
smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature”

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:14.012
A whiff means a smell, and “head-and-stomach-distending”

00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:18.832
means causing your head and stomach to swell, to grow in size.

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:23.622
The smell covered the entire city, and before long

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:28.022
newspapers were reporting on it as “The Great Stink”.

00:10:28.892 --> 00:10:31.502
Even Queen Victoria couldn’t escape it.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:36.502
During the summer of 1858 she tried to go on a pleasure

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.842
cruise with her husband, Albert, down the river Thames.

00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:45.325
She had taken a bouquet of flowers with her, and kept it close to

00:10:45.325 --> 00:10:50.285
her face, right up against her nose, to avoid the terrible smell.

00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:52.855
But it was too much for her.

00:10:53.085 --> 00:11:00.685
She only lasted a few minutes before instructing the boat to turn around - so awful was the stench.

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:06.985
It was also too much for the Members of Parliament, the MPs, whose place

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:11.475
of business, the Houses of Parliament, was on the banks of the river.

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:15.705
All of the curtains of the building were covered in

00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:19.265
lime chloride in an attempt to cover up the smell.

00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:25.495
MPs ran from one meeting to another with their handkerchiefs in front of their noses.

00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:31.695
People literally couldn’t work because the smell coming from outside was so terrible.

00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:37.165
And it wasn’t like there was an immediate way to fix it.

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:45.145
There was, essentially, a huge, bubbling open sewer that ran through the heart of the city.

00:11:45.525 --> 00:11:52.245
Centuries of waste lay in it, rotting and giving off a terrible smell with the heat.

00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:59.075
The authorities tried to pour lime directly into the river, and up

00:11:59.075 --> 00:12:04.765
to 250 tonnes of lime was poured into the river every single week.

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:12.155
In the end, as the temperature dropped, it started to rain and the river started

00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:17.975
to flow again, the smell improved and the smell on the streets of London went

00:12:17.985 --> 00:12:23.795
from absolutely disgusting and so bad that you couldn’t even breathe to just bad.

00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:28.895
But it was clear to all that something had to be done.

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:34.005
Simply putting all of the city’s waste into the river wasn’t an option.

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:42.125
There had been plenty of warnings of this before, going back even to the 17th century, 200 years

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:49.821
before, but it really took such a terrible event, one that affected everyone in the city, and

00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:56.961
one that also affected the top politicians in the country personally, for any action to be taken.

00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:02.997
The action they decided to take was a complete overhaul of the city’s

00:13:03.087 --> 00:13:07.857
sewage system, of the system of taking waste away from the city.

00:13:08.847 --> 00:13:14.737
A civil engineer called Joseph Bazalgette had proposed a plan to do this

00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:21.170
in 1856 but it had been rejected on the grounds that it was too expensive.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.080
The summer of 1858, and the terrible smell that had filled the air

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.560
of the nation’s capital, made it clear that almost no price was too

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.730
high to not have to relive, or should I say resmell, that experience.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:45.010
Indeed, there was an article in The Times newspaper that read “Parliament was all but

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:51.830
compelled to legislate upon the great London nuisance by the force of sheer stench".

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.460
Essentially, the smell was so bad that the government had to do something.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.590
On August 2nd, a month and a half into the Great Stink, Parliament

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:09.641
voted to support Bazalgette’s plan, and work started in early 1859.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.260
The plan was both incredibly complicated and beautifully simple.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.100
Bazalgette used the natural geography of London to carry waste from the higher areas to the

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:30.170
lower ones, allowing gravity to do the hard work, and using pumping stations when required.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.890
Several of the sewers were built using an egg shape, wider at the top

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.320
than the bottom, which meant the liquid would flow more effectively.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.680
There was still the problem of how to actually put these large

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.750
sewers under a city that already had three million people.

00:14:51.751 --> 00:14:57.200
Bazalgette’s genius was to reclaim land from the river, and to put

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.560
the sewers on the banks of the river in the most built-up areas.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:08.790
There’s an area in central London, just south of Trafalgar Square, called The Embankment.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:15.340
It used to be part of the river Thames, but Bazalgette reclaimed this land

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.330
and built a large pipe for his sewer, meaning that he didn’t need to dig

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:25.480
below houses, he simply dug part of the river and built on top of this.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.360
It was a monumental piece of engineering.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:37.440
He used 318 million bricks, 670,000 metres cubed of concrete,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.810
and it resulted in over 2,000 kilometres of sewers under London.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:52.920
The entire project cost £6.5 million, which is today’s equivalent of just over a billion Euros.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.000
But if there was ever money well-spent, this was it.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:05.860
Bazalgette had the foresight to understand that he needed to build a sewage system for the London

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:13.020
of the future, and he actually made the pipes twice as large as they needed to be at the time.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.240
The sewer system that Bazalgette put into place is still in operation

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.050
today, his is still the basis for all of the sewers in London.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.390
The city was so thankful for his work that it was even

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.850
proposed that he was given a bonus of almost a million Euros.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:39.290
This would have been completely unprecedented - he was a public

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.520
servant, and the Victorians were not known for handing out money.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.730
And although it was initially approved, the bonus was later denied,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.750
but it just shows quite how thankful people were for his work.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.470
He is certainly one of the unsung heroes, the unknown heroes of London,

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.940
and it is his work, his fantastic engineering, that has meant that The

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.690
Great Stink is an experience that Londoners have not had to repeat.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.840
If you go to London, you can see a monument to Joseph Bazalgette on the

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:23.040
Victoria Embankment, a testament to all that he has done to the city.

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:28.527
Or, you can simply go to the bathroom, flush the toilet, close your

00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:34.237
eyes, think about this story, and be thankful for Joseph Bazalgette.

00:17:36.177 --> 00:17:40.987
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Great Stink.

00:17:41.487 --> 00:17:44.897
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:45.437 --> 00:17:48.807
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:49.207 --> 00:17:52.327
Did you know anything about the story of The Great Stink?

00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:58.067
Do you have any examples of other “unsung heroes” from your city or country?

00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:04.507
And have there ever been any similar episodes, any times where a town you know

00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:09.077
has been covered in foul smells, and people have had to do something about it?

00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:13.327
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:13.597 --> 00:18:16.887

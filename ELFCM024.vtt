Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:09.599
by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.609
I'm Alastair Budge and today it is the second part, the second half, of the most common mistakes

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.879
people make when learning English and how to avoid them.

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:28.919
In part one, we learned about why you should choose normal content over content in traditional

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.289
language learning textbooks, why you shouldn't judge yourself against others, why you shouldn't pay

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:45.039
attention to hacks or shortcuts, how you should rid yourself of your fear of making mistakes and why

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.249
trying to speak too fast is a terrible idea.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.959
So if you haven't listened to part one yet and that sounds right up your street, then go and give

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:56.769
that a listen.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:03.977
And just in case you haven't got it right in front of you, you can grab a copy of the transcript and

00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:09.527
key vocabulary and become a member of Leonardo English over on the website, which is

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.117
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:18.907
All right then, let's get back into it and talk about the final five most common mistakes that

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:22.057
people make when learning English and how to fix them of course.

00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:30.995
Okay, mistake number six is a very common mistake that millions, tens, even hundreds of millions of

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:37.565
English learners make, and that is to focus on grammar as a standalone discipline.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:46.475
Grammar in English has its easy parts, but like anything, it has its tricky bits too, and once

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:53.855
you've covered the basics, the foundation of English grammar, the more complicated the grammar gets,

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:57.815
the harder and more never-ending it can seem.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:06.365
Yes, it's obviously a bonus that nouns don't have genders in English, and most of our verb

00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:14.105
conjugations are relatively easy compared to some other languages, but phrasal verbs are obviously a

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:21.605
nightmare, and English has a load of weird, and I'd still say wonderful grammar rules that take time

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:22.205
to master.

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:30.215
As I'm sure you've probably realised by now, even native speakers still make grammar mistakes, so

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:33.965
you shouldn't feel too bad about making grammar mistakes yourself.

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:42.753
But if you decide that the way to master English grammar is just by sitting down with a grammar book

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:49.383
and working your way through, then you're really not going to progress very fast at all.

00:02:50.793 --> 00:02:58.563
You'll probably also get pretty discouraged and it's easy to lose motivation if you are just heads

00:02:58.563 --> 00:02:59.793
down in a grammar book.

00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:08.218
You'll remember from part one that our first mistake was to not focus on interesting content, and

00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:15.418
you would have to be a bit of a masochist, slightly strange person, if you were to classify grammar

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:17.968
books as interesting content.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:26.473
Yes, of course, it's useful to have a base understanding of English grammar, how various words are

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:33.793
conjugated, and so on, but once you have reached the kind of level that I imagine you are now if you

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:43.258
can understand this podcast, then time spent on standalone grammar exercises is normally time, well,

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:47.728
not quite wasted, but certainly not particularly well spent.

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:51.448
So what is the fix for this?

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:52.528
What should you be doing?

00:03:53.488 --> 00:04:01.508
Well, instead of focusing on grammar-specific exercises, you should try to acquire grammar through

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:09.368
contact with real materials - books, articles, podcasts like this one, so that you understand and

00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:16.238
acquire grammar rules through real world practice rather than just focusing on the rules themselves.

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:24.799
When you come across a strange piece of grammar in English, by all means, you should try to figure

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:31.825
out the rule behind it, and make sure you put it in your little black book so you remember it, but

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.135
don't focus on grammar alone.

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:40.801
Remember too from part one of the podcast that you should try to lose your fear of making mistakes.

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:42.868
How is this relevant to grammar?

00:04:43.078 --> 00:04:49.438
Well, you shouldn't worry about making grammar mistakes in English, and as I said, even native

00:04:49.438 --> 00:04:51.478
speakers make mistakes as well.

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:58.918
If you can embrace the quirkiness, the weirdness, the strangeness of English grammar, and stop

00:04:58.918 --> 00:05:06.088
worrying about learning it as a standalone discipline, then you'll be amazed at how quickly you

00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:08.068
actually learn grammar.

00:05:08.068 --> 00:05:13.558
You pick up the grammar rules without spending any time actively working on it.

00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:23.248
Our next mistake is a real pet peeve of mine, something that's really close to my heart, especially

00:05:23.248 --> 00:05:28.678
given that I started this podcast partly as a way to combat the problem.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:37.043
And this mistake is of not really listening to native speakers of not really paying full attention

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:42.773
to the sentence structures, the choice of words that they use or the way that they pronounce a

00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:43.643
particular word.

00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:52.703
When listening to native speakers, whether it's this podcast, any other podcast, or speaking to a

00:05:52.703 --> 00:06:01.778
native speaker in real life, so many people just put their entire focus on trying to understand the

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:09.158
gist of what is being said, the meaning of what is being said, without focusing on the content, the

00:06:09.158 --> 00:06:10.808
actual words that are being used.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:18.038
Now I should say that there are those that have a completely different view to this saying that you

00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:24.698
should just focus on comprehension, saying that you should train your ears to listen out for a few

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:27.518
core words to get the meaning of a sentence.

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:35.228
But this only really works if you're just starting out, if you're just at the beginning of your

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:41.272
journey and you're not trying to get to advanced level, the sort of level that I imagine you would

00:06:41.272 --> 00:06:42.712
like to achieve in English.

00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:50.998
For anyone who is, let's say, intermediate level or above and thinking about listening as an

00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:58.366
opportunity to improve their own English abilities, not just as a survival thing, then you really

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:05.326
need to stop listening passively, purely from a survival point of view and to start focusing on

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:06.646
every single word.

00:07:07.402 --> 00:07:14.456
If you didn't understand a particular word or turn of phrase or idiom, ask someone what it means or

00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:15.236
look it up.

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:22.286
Find out why they chose to use that particular word when you might've thought there might've been

00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:22.766
another.

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:30.399
If it's something like a podcast, radio, or film, then make a note of it in your own little black

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.819
book.

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:39.295
Go back to it and treat every time you listen to a native speaker as a time to learn from them, not

00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:45.535
just to go into survival mode, to just understand the gist, the overall meaning, of what they're

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:45.955
saying.

00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:54.385
The sooner you switch to doing this, the sooner you will start actually learning from every single

00:07:54.385 --> 00:08:02.875
interaction as opposed to just understanding, and you should view every single time you hear native

00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:06.025
speakers as an opportunity to learn.

00:08:07.545 --> 00:08:12.544
Our next mistake is another one that's quite close to my heart for two reasons.

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:20.884
Firstly, as this podcast now has listeners from all over the world, I think when I last checked it

00:08:20.884 --> 00:08:28.914
was 115 countries, and secondly, because I'm recording this podcast from the little island of Malta,

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:33.714
which is famous for people coming here specifically to learn English.

00:08:34.584 --> 00:08:38.844
So if you've guessed the mistake I'm referring to, hats off to you.

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:41.302
Perhaps the clues were not particularly clear.

00:08:41.932 --> 00:08:48.022
What I'm talking about is the mistake of assuming that you need to be, physically be, in an English

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:55.942
speaking country to really get better at English, and that these opportunities to listen to and

00:08:55.942 --> 00:09:03.802
speak English only exist within a physically immersive environment, meaning that you have to

00:09:03.802 --> 00:09:04.822
actually go there.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:12.423
A load of English language schools will continue to push this message to people as it's obviously in

00:09:12.423 --> 00:09:19.233
their interest that people get on a plane and enroll in a school halfway across the world in order

00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:20.493
to improve their English.

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:27.536
I'm not here to hate on language schools, some of them are really, really good, and for some people

00:09:27.656 --> 00:09:29.126
it is a great choice.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:36.326
But it is a big mistake to think that you can only really make progress in an English speaking

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:40.406
country and that you have to go to an English school to do so.

00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:49.706
It's completely possible to become fluent, in the traditional sense of the word, while never setting

00:09:49.706 --> 00:09:51.776
foot in an English speaking country.

00:09:52.314 --> 00:09:52.854
How?

00:09:53.574 --> 00:10:00.084
Well, through all sorts of fantastic materials that exist all over the internet that will allow you

00:10:00.084 --> 00:10:03.804
to create your own immersive English experience.

00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:12.729
From listening to podcasts like this, to finding an English conversation partner through things like

00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:20.829
italki or Cambly, or just Facebook groups to switching your phone to English, watching English films

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:28.239
and TV series, you can create your own immersive English experience while not only saving yourself a

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:33.984
huge amount of money, but also allowing you to fit in your learning around your schedule.

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:41.514
If you're currently at university or if you're working, it's not very easy to decide to take three

00:10:41.514 --> 00:10:45.144
or six months off to go to another country to learn English.

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:51.234
Perhaps you are already doing this, and if so, kudos to you, hats off to you.

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:57.804
If you're not and you're thinking that you should absolutely need to get on a plane and spend time

00:10:58.044 --> 00:11:02.094
in an English speaking country, just remember, you really don't.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:11.210
Okay, mistake number nine is to not make time for it and to assume that you can just fit in the

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.250
learning around the rest of your schedule.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:21.485
Unless you actually make time every day, or every couple of days or whatever it is, you are so much

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.765
less likely to actually do it.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:31.535
If you're the kind of person that puts everything in your calendar, just put in that little 15

00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:37.595
minute English practice session every morning at 7:30 AM or whatever time suits your schedule.

00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:45.561
Or if you're not a calendar type of person, just make sure that you mentally set aside time, you

00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:50.901
reserve time, every day or every few days to dedicate to your learning.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:12:00.853
You might be a super organised person and just be able to fit in things at odd times of the day, but

00:12:00.883 --> 00:12:07.993
for most people, setting aside the time every day or every couple of days is the best solution as it

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:15.283
means it's a lot harder to postpone it, to move it to another time or just forget or skip it.

00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:24.793
There is a terribly overused quote in English, which is "failing to prepare is preparing to fail",

00:12:25.493 --> 00:12:29.093
but in this case, it really is true.

00:12:29.873 --> 00:12:36.473
What will happen if you don't schedule that time in every single day is you'll end up skipping it,

00:12:36.503 --> 00:12:43.503
you'll end up just not doing it because you know, life happens and there's always something shinier

00:12:43.523 --> 00:12:47.303
and more attractive than sitting down and doing English practice.

00:12:48.573 --> 00:12:54.663
And once you start skipping it, you lose your rhythm and it'll become a chore, it'll become

00:12:54.663 --> 00:13:01.173
something you don't enjoy doing, and you'll lose your motivation, and it really is a vicious circle.

00:13:02.943 --> 00:13:09.633
So if you make time for it every day, look, it doesn't have to be an hour a day, even just a 10

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:16.593
minute slot is fine, then it'll just become part of your routine, it'll become part of what you do.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:24.407
And again, little and often is better than setting yourself huge, ambitious goals that you'll never

00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:30.527
managed to achieve, so saying that you're going to do it for 10 or 15 minutes every day and actually

00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:37.757
doing it, is much better than saying I'm going to study for two hours every day and never doing it.

00:13:39.964 --> 00:13:47.440
And this brings us on to our penultimate mistake, our second to last mistake, which is actually kind

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.660
of two mistakes wrapped into one.

00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:55.015
These mistakes are related to setting yourself goals.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:14:03.235
So the first mistake is not setting yourself any goals, and the second mistake is setting yourself

00:14:03.235 --> 00:14:05.515
goals that are too hard to achieve.

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:10.075
Why is not setting yourself a goal a mistake?

00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:16.075
Because if you don't have anything to aim for, if you don't have a target of something you want to

00:14:16.075 --> 00:14:23.890
achieve, it's not only harder to measure your progress, but it's harder to motivate yourself, to get

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.570
yourself up in the morning to do it.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:33.340
These goals don't have to be huge, you don't have to say that you want to become a professor of

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:41.530
English or write a bestselling novel in English, they can be something as simple as "this week I

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:48.370
want to have five conversations with native speakers", or "I want to listen to five podcasts and

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.110
annotate the transcriptions".

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:56.760
Then you can have your bigger goal, which is your overall target, the thing you're aiming for, the

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.870
thing you want to achieve.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:06.731
Perhaps that's being able to get a certain score in IELTS or it's to be able to have a natural

00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:12.996
flowing conversation with a neighbour or relative, or to be able to watch an entire film in English

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:16.356
without subtitles and for it to not feel like a chore.

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:24.394
And to elaborate on our second goal-related mistake, it's setting yourself goals that are too

00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:32.314
ambitious and too hard to achieve either because you just don't have enough time to dedicate to them

00:15:32.674 --> 00:15:39.724
or because they require results that are just so difficult to achieve that you are setting yourself

00:15:39.724 --> 00:15:47.602
up for failure So it could be something like, "I want to be fluent in English in 60 days", or "I

00:15:47.602 --> 00:15:51.712
want to spend three hours every morning before work reading Jane Austen".

00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:58.942
Yes, it obviously would be great if you could achieve these, but it's far better to set yourself

00:15:59.002 --> 00:16:04.792
goals that you have a chance of hitting rather than just setting yourself up for failure.

00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:12.986
Our final mistake, a bonus 11th one actually, if you're counting, is one that is far easier to say

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:20.928
than to avoid making, and that is to get disheartened, to get depressed and sad with your progress.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:27.273
Learning English, like learning any language can be a roller coaster ride.

00:16:28.443 --> 00:16:34.488
There will be days when you think you can't do anything right, and that it's such an uphill struggle

00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:37.269
that you may as well give up, just pack everything in.

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:42.489
And I've been there with language learning, it's very easy to get disheartened.

00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:50.467
But if you remember your goals, remember what you're aiming for, this should hopefully give you the

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.687
motivation to stay on track.

00:16:53.827 --> 00:17:00.757
By listening to podcasts like this, you certainly are on the right track and learning English is a

00:17:00.757 --> 00:17:04.387
journey that never really finishes, even for native speakers.

00:17:05.227 --> 00:17:09.098
So stay motivated, stay curious stay hungry.

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.458
You can do it and you just have to believe in yourself.

00:17:14.732 --> 00:17:20.530
Alright, then, with this uplifting message of being disheartened learning English comes the end of

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:26.598
today's podcast and of our list of the most common mistakes people make when learning English and

00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:27.348
how to avoid them.

00:17:28.728 --> 00:17:34.558
I'm really curious, are there any mistakes that you think we missed, or is there anything in this

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:36.658
podcast that you didn't agree with?

00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:38.098

00:17:52.978 --> 00:18:00.902
interlude, so our next episodes will be on explaining why Great Britain isn't really a country, and

00:18:00.932 --> 00:18:06.182
talking about the difference between Great Britain and the United Kingdom, if you weren't aware,

00:18:06.182 --> 00:18:13.142
there was a difference and then we'll also ask ourselves why so many jobs seem so pointless.

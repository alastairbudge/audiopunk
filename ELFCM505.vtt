Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.875
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.995
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:26.365
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about an organisation called BlackRock.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:31.575
If you have spent much time in dark corners of social media, you might

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:36.145
have seen claims that this mysterious organisation controls everything from

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:41.735
companies to governments, with its tentacles and influence knowing no bounds.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:47.055
So in this episode, we’ll learn about what it really does, how it

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:52.045
works, and ask ourselves whether BlackRock really owns the world.

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:55.075
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:00.775
The 1980s were a boom time on Wall Street.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:07.565
Ronald Reagan had assumed office in January of  1981, and after a brief

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:13.205
mini-recession at the start of the decade, the American economy bounced back.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:20.695
This was partially fuelled by increasing deregulation, especially of the financial sector.

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:27.825
Whizzes on Wall Street were creating new and innovative ways to make money, ways of chopping

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:33.945
up and repackaging every element of the financial world and reselling it to other people.

00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:40.685
One of these new financial instruments was something called a mortgage-backed security.

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:46.745
In case you don’t know what this is, it is essentially a collection of thousands of different

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:53.505
home loans, mortgages, that are piled together and then chunks can be sold off to investors.

00:01:54.685 --> 00:02:00.015
In theory, it’s a clever idea from the investor side, because the probability

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:04.295
of one person losing their job and not being able to pay their mortgage is

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:09.905
relatively high but the probability of 1,000s of people all losing their jobs

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:14.375
at the same time and not being able to repay their mortgage is much lower.

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:20.102
In other words, pooling together these loans lowers the risk of the investment.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:25.762
And it’s also a clever idea from the bank’s side, from the perspective

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:29.172
of the organisation that makes the loan in the first place.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:36.032
Banks make money by handing out loans, by issuing debt, but there are

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:41.002
regulations about how much debt any bank can have on its balance sheet.

00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:46.112
But, if they sell this debt, it is no longer their problem.

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.482
It vanishes from their balance sheet, and they can

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:53.872
then make more home loans, thereby making more money.

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:59.242
So, the banks make more money, and the investors can invest in a

00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:03.342
relatively safe asset, because they would receive monthly repayments

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.562
from thousands of different people who were paying off their mortgages.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:12.122
And, of course, the people in the middle who facilitated this transaction,

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:17.092
the investment bankers and advisors who brought together the home loan

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:22.952
providers and the investors, they would make a tidy commission for their work.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.652
One such person was a man named Larry Fink.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.510
By the mid-1980s he had got a name for himself as one of the most successful bankers on Wall Street

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.710
for his ability to create these packages of loans and then sell them on to investors, and he had

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.520
made his employer, the investment bank First Boston, a reported billion dollars in the process.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.470
It seemed that he could do no wrong, money seemed to be sprouting out of his ears.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.740
But then in 1986, he made a bad call.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.830
He had become too confident and made a large bet, on behalf of

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.440
his firm, about the direction in which interest rates were going.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.280
He believed that they would rise.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.310
He was confident in his decision and assumed that it would result in hundreds of millions of dollars

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.220
of profit for the firm, and millions if not tens of millions of dollars in his Christmas bonus.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.150
But, he got it wrong.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.360
Interest rates moved in the other direction, they fell, and in a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.706
single quarter, this decision cost his employer–the bank–$100 million.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.620
He went from Wall Street darling to the man nobody and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.360
no bank wanted to touch with a ten-foot barge pole.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.520
He wasn’t technically fired, at least according to him.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.540
After all, he had made the bank $130 million the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.049
quarter before that, so it was still up $30 million.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.320
But he had lost his golden boy status, he was no longer invincible.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.630
What happened next was a realisation, a realisation that if he wanted

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.800
to succeed he needed to get better at understanding and evaluating risk.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.400
It was this single realisation that, now almost 40 years later, would turn into

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.740
a company that, if it were a country, would be the third biggest country in the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.410
world, and be responsible for almost 10% of all economic activity around the world:

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.900
The company, of course, is BlackRock.

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:56.673
So, what does BlackRock actually do and why has it become the subject of controversy?

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:05.460
Well, when it first started, in 1988, it was an asset management firm focused on risk management.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.640
That sounds like a bit of a mouthful, and a boring mouthful at that, but let me try to

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.460
explain what it means in plain English, and why it is important in the context of BlackRock.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.230
Any investment has an element of risk.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.480
If you invest money in your friend’s fledgling idea for a company that they think could be

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.420
massively successful, but all that they have is an idea and they have no track record in business,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.300
well it might take off, you might make lots of money but it’s probably quite a risky investment.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.020
You might lose all of your money.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.830
Statistically speaking, you almost certainly will.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.320
On the other hand, if you leave the money in a savings account at the bank, you are almost

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.000
certainly not going to lose it, but you are never going to make much money from the investment.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.460
You might even end up losing a bit when you take into account inflation.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.424
The point is, risk is positively correlated with reward.

00:07:10.044 --> 00:07:13.444
The more risk you take on, the higher the reward you stand

00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:17.524
to receive, but the lower the probability of getting it.

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:25.274
The thing that Larry Fink came to realise after his big $100 million loss was

00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:30.344
that his previous employer never really understood the risk of what it was doing.

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:36.984
Sure, it had a vague understanding, but it couldn’t quantify it, it couldn’t

00:07:37.014 --> 00:07:42.714
always put a number on it, and therefore it was unable to price it correctly.

00:07:43.824 --> 00:07:50.034
The idea behind BlackRock was to develop models, software and tools that

00:07:50.074 --> 00:07:54.904
allowed the company to accurately analyse the risk of anything, thereby

00:07:54.944 --> 00:07:59.494
reducing the risk of a big loss, and making better investment decisions.

00:08:00.944 --> 00:08:07.724
Its pitch to potential clients was “We’ll manage your investments for you and because we

00:08:07.724 --> 00:08:13.354
have this superior understanding of risk, we will be better custodians of your money”.

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:23.094
It worked, and just over a decade later the company was managing over $165 billion in assets.

00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:28.014
And for companies that didn’t want BlackRock to take full control of their assets

00:08:28.314 --> 00:08:33.404
but wanted BlackRock’s risk management expertise, well, it had a piece of software

00:08:33.404 --> 00:08:38.414
called Aladdin that would do hundreds of millions of calculations each week and model

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:43.914
every conceivable change in the global markets, and allow financial institutions

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:48.554
to better understand and manage the risk associated with their investments.

00:08:49.364 --> 00:08:53.064
Not particularly sexy, but incredibly valuable.

00:08:54.344 --> 00:08:58.734
BlackRock continued to grow, but it was with the global financial

00:08:58.734 --> 00:09:05.054
crisis of 2007-2008 that it really started to gain serious influence.

00:09:06.564 --> 00:09:10.444
If you were nodding your head earlier when we were talking about Larry Fink’s

00:09:10.474 --> 00:09:14.794
innovation in bundling home loans together and selling them to investors and

00:09:14.794 --> 00:09:20.634
thinking “I’ve heard that one before”, yes this is exactly the same financial

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:26.244
instrument that played a major role in bringing down the global economy in 2007.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:32.514
Wall Street banks had been packaging bad loans up and selling them to investors,

00:09:32.974 --> 00:09:37.454
and when it turned out that homeowners were unable to keep up with the repayments

00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:43.294
on their loans, the banks and investors holding the bad loans went belly up.

00:09:44.004 --> 00:09:49.354
Some went bust, went bankrupt, while others had to be bailed out by the government.

00:09:50.564 --> 00:09:55.364
And it was here that BlackRock and its famously risk-averse

00:09:55.364 --> 00:10:00.134
CEO, Larry Fink, found themselves in high demand.

00:10:01.494 --> 00:10:05.744
As one of the architects of the mortgage-backed security, back in the 1980s,

00:10:06.234 --> 00:10:11.814
ironically Larry Fink was one of the best-placed people to help banks and the

00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:17.064
US government understand exactly how bad the situation was and fix the mess.

00:10:18.414 --> 00:10:23.964
He found himself, or rather, BlackRock found itself, advising the US government

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:29.404
and a whole host of financial institutions on what to do with all of this debt.

00:10:30.184 --> 00:10:35.684
This brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in advisory fees, but more

00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:41.964
importantly, it made Larry Fink the go-to guy on Wall Street, and BlackRock the

00:10:41.994 --> 00:10:47.394
go-to firm, when it came to particularly complicated transactions involving debt.

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:52.539
Alongside this, BlackRock started to buy up a bunch of

00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:56.719
other companies and to get into the retail investor market.

00:10:58.489 --> 00:11:05.509
In its early years, and until the 2010s really, BlackRock had focussed on what’s called

00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:12.759
institutional investors: banks, pension funds, insurance companies - large companies who would give

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:18.889
hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to BlackRock to manage and invest on their behalf.

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:27.209
But Larry Fink saw an even greater opportunity in the retail market, individual investors.

00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:33.589
Instead of having thousands of clients who might each invest hundreds of millions with BlackRock,

00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:39.519
he wanted to have hundreds of millions of clients who would invest thousands of dollars with him.

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:48.539
He didn’t want to only have a handful of big fish, he wanted to have an ocean full of little fish.

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:53.209
How BlackRock went about this was by offering

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:57.379
something called exchange-traded funds, ETFs for short.

00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:02.342
In case you don’t know what these are, they are large collections

00:12:02.342 --> 00:12:06.102
of shares or bonds or financial instruments of some sort.

00:12:06.662 --> 00:12:10.884
Any individual can invest in a BlackRock ETF.

00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:17.642
What this means in practice is that rather than saying “I want to buy shares of

00:12:17.712 --> 00:12:23.522
Apple”, you can say “I want to buy shares of every big company in the world”, or “big

00:12:23.522 --> 00:12:28.282
American companies”, or “big European companies”, or “big pharmaceutical companies”.

00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:34.642
This is called “passive” investment, so instead of giving your money to a

00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:40.122
human who tries to pick winning investments and outsmart the market, if you

00:12:40.122 --> 00:12:46.012
invest in an ETF you effectively buy all the shares within a certain category.

00:12:47.512 --> 00:12:50.922
The advantage of this is firstly risk management.

00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:57.653
By owning a small chunk of everything you reduce the risk of losing money, and you are essentially

00:12:57.663 --> 00:13:03.923
betting on an entire market rising over time, rather than a small selection of winning investments.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.533
The secondary advantage is cost.

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:14.873
Active investing can be expensive - an actively managed fund might charge anywhere up

00:13:14.873 --> 00:13:23.923
to 2% a year, but a passively managed investment like an ETF can be as low as 0.03%.

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:32.533
BlackRock only started offering ETFs in 2009, after acquiring another business, but the amount

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:38.523
of money it manages in ETFs is now comparable to the amount of institutional money it controls.

00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:44.979
And, added together, the total is more than $10 trillion.

00:13:45.313 --> 00:13:48.093
Yes, that is a trillion with a “t”.

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:53.023
If it were a country, it would be the third biggest country in the world.

00:13:54.303 --> 00:14:01.173
This $10 trillion is invested into tens of thousands of different companies, and it owns

00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:08.043
large chunks, typically 5% or more, of almost every large public company in the world.

00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:12.223
So if you look at the ownership structure of any of these

00:14:12.223 --> 00:14:16.603
large public companies, you will almost always see BlackRock.

00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:22.113
Now, this has sprouted a bunch of conspiracy theories, people making all

00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:27.143
sorts of claims about BlackRock being at the centre of some secret cabal, some

00:14:27.543 --> 00:14:32.113
top-secret powerful group, that is pulling the strings of the global economy.

00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:37.909
When researching this episode, I looked through a bunch of these on TikTok

00:14:38.229 --> 00:14:42.589
and the theory that some people are pushing is essentially that BlackRock

00:14:42.859 --> 00:14:47.829
owns the world because they “own” all of the largest companies in the world.

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:54.109
They “own” the media, so they can tell the media what stories to publish, they “own” the tech

00:14:54.139 --> 00:15:00.269
companies, so they have access to all of our private data, they “own” the banks, so your money

00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:06.179
is their money, and they “own” the defence industry, so they can make a country go to war.

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:11.709
They don’t “own” these companies, or at least they aren’t a majority owner.

00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:16.789
They typically own somewhere between 5 and 7%.

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:20.909
But again, to go back to the question of what “own”

00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:24.899
means, they own shares on behalf of other people.

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:27.489
So, who are these people?

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:32.969
Well, there are the institutional investors, such as pension funds whose

00:15:32.969 --> 00:15:36.899
job it is to manage other people’s pensions, perhaps even your pension.

00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:42.569
It’s other institutional investors, and it is also retail investors,

00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:47.179
millions of people around the world who choose to keep anything from a few

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:51.374
hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars and more with BlackRock.

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:58.686
And to try to unwind this conspiracy one level further, what many people peddling

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:03.546
these theories don’t understand, or do understand but don’t mention because it would

00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:08.486
undermine their entire argument, is that, in the case of the multiple trillions

00:16:08.496 --> 00:16:14.786
held in ETFs at least, BlackRock doesn’t choose which companies to buy or sell.

00:16:15.646 --> 00:16:19.986
The entire point of an ETF is that it is algorithmically

00:16:19.996 --> 00:16:24.329
required to hold shares in every company in that ETF.

00:16:25.096 --> 00:16:29.216
Nobody at BlackRock says “ok, I think we should buy more Apple”

00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:32.356
or “we don’t like Pfizer so we’re going to sell its shares”.

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:40.366
The more popular an ETF is, the more shares within that ETF BlackRock is required to buy.

00:16:41.216 --> 00:16:47.186
And if people want to sell a particular ETF, an algorithm at BlackRock

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:51.620
will sell the underlying shares in the companies in that ETF.

00:16:52.356 --> 00:16:59.136
So, to portray BlackRock as some evil beast that is secretly buying up the shares of large

00:16:59.136 --> 00:17:05.756
companies for nefarious ends is simply incorrect; these purchases are largely dictated

00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:10.736
by an algorithm that reflects the choices of millions of individuals around the world.

00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:18.306
Now, this is not to say that BlackRock is without influence; clearly this is not true.

00:17:19.486 --> 00:17:23.376
It holds considerable stakes in some of the biggest companies in the world.

00:17:23.966 --> 00:17:30.266
In some cases, BlackRock votes at shareholder meetings on behalf of its investors, meaning that

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:36.446
it can influence corporate decisions on everything from hiring to diversity to sustainability.

00:17:37.646 --> 00:17:42.546
And its CEO, Larry Fink, is not afraid to speak his mind.

00:17:43.466 --> 00:17:48.356
He caused serious controversy back in 2018 when he suggested that

00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:52.806
companies needed to have a positive contribution to society, writing

00:17:53.456 --> 00:17:57.006
“Companies must ask themselves: What role do we play in the community?

00:17:57.386 --> 00:17:59.626
How are we managing our impact on the environment?

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.836
Are we working to create a diverse workforce?”, end quote.

00:18:05.556 --> 00:18:11.626
This was perceived by some as pushing a “woke” agenda, and of BlackRock

00:18:11.676 --> 00:18:15.786
trying to use its power to influence companies into taking certain

00:18:15.786 --> 00:18:20.556
decisions, for example around environmental or hiring policies.

00:18:21.336 --> 00:18:25.856
But by others, it was seen as “greenwashing”, of BlackRock pretending

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:29.056
to care about the environment and social issues while maintaining

00:18:29.096 --> 00:18:33.436
investments in everything from fossil fuel to arms manufacturing companies.

00:18:34.606 --> 00:18:38.736
Another area where it has come under scrutiny is the very

00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:42.466
close links between BlackRock and the world of politics.

00:18:44.116 --> 00:18:48.046
In the UK, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer–the

00:18:48.056 --> 00:18:52.036
Finance Minister–was hired by BlackRock after leaving office.

00:18:52.906 --> 00:18:58.249
A bunch of senior staff under Barack Obama went straight to BlackRock, and

00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:03.029
at least one has since rejoined the government, serving under Joe Biden.

00:19:04.089 --> 00:19:08.476
Now, you could look at most Wall Street institutions and find former government

00:19:08.536 --> 00:19:13.906
officials and public servants, there is a revolving door between finance and government.

00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:19.266
BlackRock isn’t unique in this category, and practically every company

00:19:19.266 --> 00:19:23.086
that has the means tries to develop closer links with the government.

00:19:23.846 --> 00:19:28.116
Ethically questionable, perhaps, but undeniably good for business.

00:19:28.746 --> 00:19:32.176
And BlackRock, clearly, is particularly good at it.

00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:38.956
So, to wrap things up, there are tons of videos on social media with clickbait

00:19:39.006 --> 00:19:43.936
titles like “BlackRock is evil”, or “this evil company controls the world”.

00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:48.925
Yes, the title for this episode does contain the words “The Company That

00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:53.678
Owns The World”, but I hope you noticed that it has a question mark after it.

00:19:54.298 --> 00:20:00.158
Yes, BlackRock manages a vast amount of money, and yes it is hugely

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:06.188
influential, but to say that it owns the world is somewhat of a simplification.

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:11.858
The reality is that it’s more like a mirror for our own decisions.

00:20:12.318 --> 00:20:18.378
It is a way for anyone, anywhere in the world, to pay a very small fee to stick a needle

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:24.248
into the pumping vein of capitalism and have a chance of making a good return on their money.

00:20:25.518 --> 00:20:28.268
As to whether that makes it evil, whether it makes it

00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:32.318
good or bad, well I’ll let you be the judge of that.

00:20:34.027 --> 00:20:37.698
OK then, that is it for today's episode on BlackRock.

00:20:38.088 --> 00:20:40.748
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something

00:20:40.748 --> 00:20:45.238
new, and if you’d never heard of BlackRock before, well then this has

00:20:45.238 --> 00:20:48.838
shone some light on this massive and somewhat mysterious business.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:52.458
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:54.528
Have you heard of BlackRock before?

00:20:55.028 --> 00:20:58.718
If so, what had you heard, and has anything you’ve heard

00:20:58.718 --> 00:21:01.908
today changed your mind, or at least got you thinking?

00:21:02.298 --> 00:21:05.748
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

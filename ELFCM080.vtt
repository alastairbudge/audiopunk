Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:15.634
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:20.874
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:28.127
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the 1MDB scandal, and the

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:33.837
group of people who allegedly stole billions of dollars from the Malaysian government.

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:42.297
The tale of 1MDB takes us from Malaysia to the United Kingdom, from the Middle East to Hollywood,

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:49.607
and involves everyone from greedy bankers, Prime Ministers, Paris Hilton and Leonardo di Caprio.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:57.727
It’s an ongoing story, but it looks like it will go down as one of the biggest thefts in history.

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:05.247
And at the centre of it all is a small, slightly overweight, young Malaysian man called Jho Low.

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:12.557
Before we get right into it though, let me remind you that you can get all of the bonus episodes,

00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:19.217

and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:34.805
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:42.995
So if that's of interest, and I hope it is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:44.228 --> 00:01:44.838
OK then, 1MDB.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:52.838
Our story starts in around 2009, shortly after Malaysia had

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:57.823
just appointed a new Prime Minister, a man called Najib Razak.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:02.928
Malaysia was still a ‘developing country’, and still lacked a lot of the

00:02:02.928 --> 00:02:06.988
kind of infrastructure that was enjoyed by neighbours like Singapore.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:14.308
So Malaysia needed a lot of foreign investment to pump into things like power stations,

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:20.278
roads, airports, and all the kinds of things that help a country develop economically.

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:26.478
One way in which countries do this is by creating big

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:30.538
funds where they borrow money from private investors.

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:37.218
Investors are normally happy to lend money to a country, because they are pretty sure

00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:42.508
that they’ll get their money back, and for a country like Malaysia, doing something

00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:47.678
like this would be a way of raising money that could be invested into things like

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:53.535
infrastructure, services, and industries that would help Malaysia develop economically.

00:02:54.815 --> 00:03:01.315
So, in 2009, shortly after Razak’s election, he created this kind of

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:06.265
Malaysian fund, a development fund that would invest in Malaysian projects.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:12.705
It started out with a relatively small amount of money, just $1 billion.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.505
Now, that obviously is a huge amount of money, but when

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:21.685
thinking about it on a country level, it’s not so huge.

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:29.405
This new fund was to be called 1MDB, short for 1 Malaysia Development Berhad.

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:35.435
Berhad is just a suffix that’s used by Malaysian companies to show that

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:41.095
they are limited companies, so like Ltd in the UK, or gmbh in Germany.

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:50.285
So, this 1MDB was set up, it hired employees and it had a mandate to invest in

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:54.585
various different types of industries that would benefit the Malaysian people.

00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:56.495
All good so far.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:02.935
But there was a character who seemed to be involved with the fund, who

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:07.725
seemed to be managing everything and have the complete trust of Razak,

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:13.005
the Prime Minister, but this man had no official role in the fund.

00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:15.905
His name was Jho Low.

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:23.285
Jho Low, at the time that the fund was set up, was only 27 years old.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:30.665
He came from a relatively wealthy Malaysian family, from an area of Malaysia called Penang.

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:37.875
He had been educated at one of the most elite private schools in the United Kingdom, called Harrow,

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:44.295
and he then went to university at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.

00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:51.055
At both of these institutions, he got acquainted with the lifestyle of

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:55.825
the super rich, befriending people from various Middle Eastern families.

00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:00.615
Low, although he was rich by any normal person’s

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:04.485
standards, was nothing compared to Middle Eastern royalty.

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:11.615
Despite this, Low managed to get a reputation as a person who had access to

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:17.685
a lot of money, and while he was at Wharton he would host large, flamboyant

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:22.755
parties, and generally be seen to be spending large amounts of money.

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:32.415
He hung around with princes and royalty, and fresh out of university he carved out a niche for

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:40.515
himself as someone who was a bit of a fixer - he was good at connecting people who had money to

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:46.425
people who wanted investment, and of course, pocketing a little commission when this happened.

00:05:47.935 --> 00:05:53.645
When 1MDB was formed, it was said that Low managed to get this strange

00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:58.325
advisory role partly because of his connections to the Middle East.

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:03.511
He knew people in high places, especially people with lots of money

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:08.821
to invest in the fund, and seemed to be trusted completely by Razak.

00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:16.001
Jho Low, and 1MDB got to work, and the main work they seemed to be doing

00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.601
was spending money, and then raising more money to add to their fund.

00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:28.401
From its little initial investment of $1 billion dollars, 1MDB managed

00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:35.018
to raise more and more money, and by March of 2014, under 5 years

00:06:35.198 --> 00:06:41.368
after it had started, 1MDB had reportedly raised $10 billion dollars.

00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:47.698
Now, it’s important to clarify that this money was money that foreign investors

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:53.088
had lent to 1MDB because they thought that they would be able to make a profit.

00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:58.028
That 1MDB would make investments in Malaysia, and abroad, would

00:06:58.028 --> 00:07:01.628
make a profit on these investments, and everyone would make money.

00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:08.288
1MDB, and Jho Low, had managed to raise all of this money because

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:12.848
the debt was, effectively, guaranteed by the Malaysian government.

00:07:13.578 --> 00:07:19.898
People were happy to lend it more, and it had no problem raking in more and more money.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:28.188
There were a lot of question marks emerging about what this money was actually going towards though.

00:07:29.378 --> 00:07:35.028
1MDB had made a series of investments in Malaysian infrastructure projects,

00:07:35.218 --> 00:07:41.838
from power stations to airports, but people were saying that it had paid far too

00:07:41.838 --> 00:07:47.788
much money for them, and that in exchange for paying too much money, politicians

00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:53.128
had received kickbacks, they had received payments or favours from the sellers.

00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:59.638
There were rumours going around that Razak was using some of the funds himself, both

00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:04.208
that he was using them as a way to bribe other politicians and try to influence the

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:09.728
upcoming elections, and that he was just stealing the funds and using them for himself.

00:08:11.318 --> 00:08:16.718
It didn’t help that his wife, Rosmah, had incredibly lavish taste in

00:08:16.738 --> 00:08:22.840
jewellery, and would go on huge shopping sprees in Paris, London, and New York.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.050
We’re not talking about a few thousand dollars here, we are talking millions.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.320
But what was perhaps more concerning was what was going

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.060
on with the central character in our story, Jho Low.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:43.350
Jho Low had always been quite a big spender, but ever since he

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.680
started to get involved with 1MDB, the spending hit new levels.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:56.160
There was a headline from the New York Post in November 2009, just months after 1MDB

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.760
was launched, which read “Big-spending Malaysian is the mystery man of city club

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:10.020
scene”, and talked about how this man, Jho Low,  had spent $160,000 in one night.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:17.650
But this was small fry, it was small potatoes, compared to what Jho Low went on to do.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:25.250
He bought penthouses, mansions, yachts, fine art, and threw huge

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.230
parties with celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:37.600
For his 31st birthday, in 2012, he threw the wildest party that Las

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.170
Vegas has ever seen - and I imagine it has seen quite a few wild parties.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.520
For this party, Kanye West performed, Britney Spears burst out of

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.950
a cake, and there were performances from Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.314
Pharrel Williams, Chris Brown, and Psy, the guy who sang Gangnam Style.

00:09:57.304 --> 00:10:01.074
This event apparently cost millions of dollars, and

00:10:01.374 --> 00:10:04.664
it was really just a drop in the ocean for Jho Low.

00:10:05.464 --> 00:10:10.394
He had private jets, and bought art by Picasso, Van Gogh and Monet.

00:10:11.254 --> 00:10:16.534
He would fly around the world on a private jet, stopping to spend weeks on his yacht

00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:22.184
with Middle Eastern royalty, then jetting into Vegas to gamble millions of dollars,

00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:27.854
and essentially just living the life of the world’s biggest international playboy.

00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:34.531
He invested in a film studio, and spent $100 million to produce the film

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:39.311
The Wolf of Wall Street, ironically enough a film about financial fraud.

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.921
If you remember The Wolf of Wall Street, there is a scene

00:10:43.931 --> 00:10:47.771
in it where the central character crashes a Lamborghini.

00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:53.091
While in most normal films, they wouldn’t crash a real Lamborghini,

00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:57.481
they’d find a model one or something like that, apparently Jho

00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:01.781
Low said it was fine to buy a real one, then completely wreck it.

00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:07.131
So, the question was, where did he get all this money?

00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:12.571
At the start, Jho Low said that it was all family wealth,

00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:16.131
and that he had inherited this money from his grandfather.

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:21.325
Low had certainly inherited some money from his family,

00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:25.445
but it was a tiny percentage of what he was now spending.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:31.125
Strangely enough, it seemed that not that many people asked

00:11:31.245 --> 00:11:34.475
tough questions about where the money really came from.

00:11:35.265 --> 00:11:39.345
Everyone was enjoying the ride - Jho Low was very generous,

00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:42.805
and would shower his friends with gifts and holidays.

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:46.455
And of course, he would always pick up the bar tab.

00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:49.665
Who wouldn’t like a friend like that, right?

00:11:50.825 --> 00:11:55.755
But, as you might have guessed, the money didn’t really belong to Jho Low.

00:11:56.865 --> 00:12:01.265
He had stolen billions of dollars from 1MDB in one

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:04.815
of the largest financial thefts in modern history.

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:11.485
Low, despite his young age, had developed a sophisticated understanding

00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:16.015
of how the global financial system works, and more importantly, how he

00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:21.395
could transfer large amounts of money from 1MDB into his own pockets.

00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:26.805
He used a variety of methods and tricks to achieve this.

00:12:27.855 --> 00:12:35.065
Firstly, he made sure that everyone who was involved in this theft was very adequately compensated.

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:39.708
From Emirati businessmen to private bankers, he made

00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:42.998
sure that everyone was also making lots of money.

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:49.448
Secondly, this whole scheme wouldn’t have worked without offshore companies,

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:54.048
which are very effective ways of hiding who actually owns something.

00:12:55.558 --> 00:13:00.078
Jho Low knew how offshore companies work, and how he could manage to

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:04.238
transfer billions of dollars around the world without people noticing.

00:13:04.978 --> 00:13:11.428
He would create different shell companies in places like the Cayman Islands or Curacao, which would

00:13:11.448 --> 00:13:18.198
often have names that were very similar to the companies that 1MDB was supposedly dealing with.

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:23.088
Then he would instruct the bankers to make payments into these

00:13:23.128 --> 00:13:26.098
shell companies, which were ultimately controlled by him.

00:13:26.098 --> 00:13:33.018
When that company received the money, he would then send the money on to various different

00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:38.658
anonymous bank accounts, or bank accounts that were held by anonymous companies, meaning

00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:45.318
that where the money came from, and whose money it actually was, was very hard to trace.

00:13:46.589 --> 00:13:52.215
Jho Low knew how to confuse the financial system, he knew all the tricks of the trade.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:57.325
He knew how the ultra-rich often hide their money, even money that is

00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:02.385
legally acquired, but he exploited all of these tricks to the maximum.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:08.407
And finally, Jho Low had an innate understanding of human greed.

00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:14.737
In the world of the ultra rich, he knew that people were always looking for more.

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:19.596
If you make 10 million dollars, then you want to make

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:22.856
50, 10 million suddenly isn’t so interesting anymore.

00:14:23.786 --> 00:14:26.116
If you make 50, then you want to make 100.

00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:29.636
For many people, there was no limit to their greed.

00:14:31.076 --> 00:14:34.896
Low realised this with one of the bankers that he used

00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:39.376
to help raise money for 1MDB, a man called Tim Leissner.

00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:45.896
Now, Leissner was a partner at the prestigious Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs.

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:52.489
He was one of the senior dealmakers in Asia, and had managed to befriend Jho

00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:58.099
Low, and make Goldman Sachs the bank of choice for helping 1MDB raise money.

00:14:59.609 --> 00:15:06.509
Goldman Sachs made huge amounts of money from 1MDB, reportedly $600 million in commission,

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:13.219
and for his part in this, Leissner was paid millions of dollars a year by the bank.

00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:18.649
But, millions of dollars a year, when you are hanging around with

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:23.259
people spending billions, makes you look like a bit of a nobody.

00:15:24.609 --> 00:15:29.559
Leissner got greedy, and started siphoning off, taking large amounts

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:34.609
of money for himself, reportedly taking $200 million dollars that

00:15:34.609 --> 00:15:39.259
he then spent on things like luxury property, yachts, and fine art.

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:46.299
When you hear this story, and think about quite how brazen, quite how open, this

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:50.919
theft was, you might think ‘how did they ever think they’d get away with it?’

00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:56.799
Low and his associates were stealing literally billions of dollars every

00:15:56.799 --> 00:16:02.289
single year, spending very heavily and very much in the public eye.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:06.599
Surely someone, somewhere was going to find out?

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:15.169
Of course, this is easy to say with hindsight, but at the time, I guess they felt invincible.

00:16:15.989 --> 00:16:18.799
And who knows, maybe the party would still be going

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:22.819
on were it not for a Swiss man called Xavier Justo.

00:16:24.119 --> 00:16:29.459
Justo had been an executive at a company called Petrosaudi, which was a former

00:16:29.499 --> 00:16:35.419
partner of 1MDB’s, and was heavily implicated in the theft of the money from the fund.

00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:43.289
Justo had been sacked by the company under circumstances that he felt were unfair, and

00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:49.459
had made copies of incriminating emails that showed the huge fraud that was going on.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:54.099
He had threatened to release the emails unless he was paid $2

00:16:54.329 --> 00:16:59.299
million, which was the money that he felt he was owed by PetroSaudi.

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:06.489
Long story short, Justo released these emails to a journalist, and the story broke.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:10.299
The curtain was lifted on this mysterious entity.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:16.319
The scale of the theft was bigger than anyone had imagined, and it looked like it wasn’t

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.989
just Jho Low, but Najib Razak, the Malaysian Prime Minister, who was directly implicated.

00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:26.739
The emails revealed that a payment of $681 million

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:31.019
was made directly into Razak’s personal bank account.

00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:37.814
Now, I should say that Razak denies that this was from 1MDB, and says that it was

00:17:37.814 --> 00:17:43.834
a personal donation from the Saudi royal family, but it does look very suspicious.

00:17:45.394 --> 00:17:47.964
There was a huge political scandal in Malaysia.

00:17:48.524 --> 00:17:53.274
Nabib Razak was kicked out of office after the general election of 2018, and

00:17:53.814 --> 00:18:00.644
just a few weeks ago, on July 28th, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

00:18:00.654 --> 00:18:05.514
Leissner, the Goldman Sachs banker, was made to pay a fine of

00:18:05.524 --> 00:18:12.194
43.7 million in 2018, and is currently awaiting sentencing.

00:18:13.484 --> 00:18:19.294
His employer, Goldman Sachs, is on the hook for a huge compensation payout to the Malaysian

00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:29.199
government for its role in the fraud, and on July the 24th agreed to pay 1MDB 3.7 billion dollars.

00:18:30.674 --> 00:18:33.234
And Jho Low, our chubby protagonist?

00:18:33.664 --> 00:18:39.014
Nobody actually knows where he is, although he is rumoured to be living in China.

00:18:40.014 --> 00:18:47.424
His assets in the US have mainly been frozen, but he still likely has assets to tens,

00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:53.194
if not hundreds, of millions, if not billions of dollars that he stole from 1MDB.

00:18:54.744 --> 00:19:00.664
Unlike the bank account that you or I might have, Low’s money is hidden all over the world, in

00:19:00.664 --> 00:19:07.744
secret accounts in different countries, held at law firms, private banks, and is very hard to trace.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:15.010
He protests his innocence, saying that this is all a mistake and a misunderstanding, and he has

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:22.360
hired expensive PR agencies to try and tell his story, and portray himself as a philanthropist

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.560
and businessman, and not as the criminal that almost every government believes he is.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.510
So, this is a story that is ongoing.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.530
Jho Low is still at large, his yacht, penthouses and mansions may have been captured, but

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:44.300
the nature of the global financial system means that he certainly isn’t without funds.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.660
And who, ultimately pays the price for all this?

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.200
The sad thing is that it’s the Malaysian people.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.670
This money didn’t just come from nowhere.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.170
It’s the Malaysian people who are on the hook for it, and they will continue

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.450
to pay the price for Low and Razak’s corruption for decades to come.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.290
Jho Low may have been the guy who always threw the best

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.660
parties, and always picked up the bill at the end of the night.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:19.690
But unfortunately, with this story, this time, he has left the Malaysian people to pick up the bill.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:28.220
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on 1MDB, and the missing Malaysian billions.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.070
It is a fascinating story, and one that brings together high

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.510
finance, greedy bankers, Hollywood celebrities, and politicians.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.690
It just makes you realise quite how intertwined all of these things are.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.380

Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast.

00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:12.414
It's December the 20th, just five days before Christmas.

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:18.279
And I guess for some of you, this might mean you're scurrying around trying to find last minute

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.544
presents for your loved ones.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.399
So we are going to be talking about something related to buying stuff or related to how people think

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.017
about companies when buying stuff, and talk about one of the things that makes us decide whether to

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:38.062
buy something from one company or from another, from one brand or from another brand.

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:45.188
Before we get right into the heart of the podcast though, I wanted to remind those of you listening

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:51.226
on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or wherever you might get your podcasts, that you can get the transcript

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:55.976
and key vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:01.104
If you're listening to this on the website with the transcript and key vocabulary in front of you,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:05.079
then congratulations, you are one step ahead of the game.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.909
Also at the end of the podcast, I'll reveal how one huge multinational company made a terrible

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.689
mistake with their messaging when they went to China.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:21.949
Okay, so Christmas presents and slogans.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:27.132
I don't need to tell you that Christmas is obviously a big time for shopping.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:33.552
It's boom time for high-street shops as people manically try to find gifts before Christmas Day.

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:41.566
Some retailers, some shops, especially those selling things like games and toys, do about 30% of

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.576
their entire sales just in December.

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:50.636
And companies are doing everything they possibly can to stand out, to be remembered, to make you

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:52.646
choose them over one of their competitors.

00:01:53.751 --> 00:02:00.045
I used to work in marketing, so I've got a bit of experience with how some of this stuff works, and

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.905
it basically boils down to this:

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:07.635
There are a few categories of things in life that you might be tempted to buy - stuff you need,

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:11.985
stuff you want and sort of don't need and stuff you'd really don't need.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:19.290
With all of this stuff, there are normally hundreds or thousands of different companies that can

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.180
sell you basically the same thing.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.280
Maybe it tastes, looks or feels a little bit different.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:33.036
In many cases, yes, you can tell the difference and you prefer a certain kind of bread, shampoo,

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:40.118
clothes, watch, whatever it might be, but in many cases it does basically exactly the same thing.

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:47.198
Especially with expensive branded goods, they are often almost exactly the same as the cheaper

00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:47.588
version.

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:52.988
But you're paying for something intangible, something that you can't feel, something you can't

00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:53.678
sense.

00:02:54.061 --> 00:03:00.061
It's because it makes you feel different, it makes you feel like you're part of something, like

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:03.271
you're buying into something that's bigger than just the products.

00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:06.288
This is all part of what's called branding.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.920
Now, branding is a complicated subject.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.040
I don't claim to be an expert on it at all, and there are thousands of branding agencies that will

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:23.473
charge hundreds of thousands of dollars to help craft a brand, and we may even have a few guests on

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:27.013
the podcast next year to talk about this if it's of interest to listeners.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.906
But today, as we are just five days away from Christmas, I wanted to talk about one tiny slice of

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:38.079
branding, and that's something called a slogan.

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:42.842
Now, perhaps you haven't heard the word slogan before.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:49.381
It's defined - if you look it up in the dictionary - you'll see the definition as 'a short and

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:56.696
striking or memorable phrase used in advertising.' For example, McDonald's - and I choose this one

00:03:56.696 --> 00:04:00.896
because it is translated into lots of languages has - in English.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:08.173
It's I'm lovin' it, Ich Liebe es in German, C'est tout que j'aime in French, Me encanta in Spanish,

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:10.555
or wo jiu xihuan in Mandarin.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:18.728
The idea is that a slogan should be catchy and functional, reminding consumers of why they like a

00:04:18.728 --> 00:04:22.418
brand in a single bite-sized phrase.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:29.320
It should make you as a, as someone who might buy the product, should make you feel that the slogan

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.315
reflects how you feel towards the company or brand.

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:41.025
It's all trying to make what might otherwise seem like a boring and uninteresting product seem more

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.705
interesting and aspirational.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:50.843
Today we are going to take a look at three of the most powerful, or at least three of my favourite,

00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:52.733
slogans in history.

00:04:53.183 --> 00:04:59.653
In English, of course, We're going to look at how they work, why they work, and we'll go through any

00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:02.413
clever twists on language that they use.

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:10.464
These three are all very different - in different industries, different countries, and completely

00:05:10.464 --> 00:05:11.514
different products.

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:14.234
One, you definitely would have heard of.

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:18.375
One you might have heard of, although I don't think so.

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.495
And one I'm pretty sure you will not have heard of.

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:27.031
Okay, so let's start with the one you definitely will have heard of.

00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:32.371
Some of you may even be wearing a t-shirt with this emblazoned on.

00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:33.931
It's Nike.

00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:38.768
Their slogan is, as you may know, Just Do It.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:40.238
Just Do It.

00:05:41.181 --> 00:05:48.051
It has been the key message for Nike or Nike, I should say, if I'm American, since 1988 and has been

00:05:48.051 --> 00:05:50.571
going strong for 30 years now.

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:58.953
Nike's brand is all about empowering people to achieve their goals, to not let anything get in their

00:05:58.953 --> 00:05:59.523
way.

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:06.225
And Nike wants to be the tool to allow them to do exactly what they want to, to allow everyone to be

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:06.705
an athlete.

00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:08.712
So let's take a look at this slogan.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.048
We can break down these three words and look at exactly why they work, right?

00:06:13.048 --> 00:06:14.488
The three words are not complicated.

00:06:14.668 --> 00:06:16.228
Just Do It.

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:19.406
So the first word is 'just'.

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:26.736
When 'just' is used at the start of a sentence before an imperative, it's like an order, right?

00:06:26.766 --> 00:06:29.886
It reinforces the need to do something.

00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:38.383
It also adds a sense of urgency, so 'just shut up' means to ask someone to be quiet right now.

00:06:39.242 --> 00:06:43.652
You can use 'just' as a term to reinforce an imperative.

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:47.636
Just shut up, just go away, just give me it.

00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:48.686
That kind of stuff.

00:06:49.507 --> 00:06:52.445
The second word of the slogan is 'do'.

00:06:53.555 --> 00:06:57.545
Okay, so you know what this word means, it's a, it's an active word.

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.375
Do is an active term.

00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:06.245
It's also the opposite of don't, the negative term you would use when telling someone not to do

00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:06.695
something.

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:11.649
And the final word of the slogan is 'it'.

00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:22.081
Using the pronoun 'it' here without having previously referred to what 'it' is means that 'it' can

00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:23.881
be anything you want it to be.

00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:32.482
When you put these three words together, Just Do It, you get a term that makes people think that

00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:39.145
they can do whatever they want, and that Nike is the tool to empower them to achieve their goals.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:40.585
It's clever, right?

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:42.055
Just Do It.

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:43.075
Just Do It.

00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:50.094
And for anyone who might be doubting the power of a slogan like this, just imagine two identical

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:50.914
white t-shirts.

00:07:51.673 --> 00:07:55.011
One is completely blank, just nothing on it.

00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:59.192
And the other has the words, Just Do It on.

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:06.266
Now think of what the price tag might be on each one, and that gives you an idea of the value of the

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:07.466
brand and of the slogan.

00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:15.295
Secondly, here's one you might have heard of, but unless you're living in the US you probably

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:15.775
haven't.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:23.201
It's from the American company Dollar Shave Club, which started out making razorblades and selling

00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:25.061
them by subscription, by delivery.

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:30.372
The idea was that you could buy a razor blade for a dollar and they will be delivered to your door

00:08:30.582 --> 00:08:31.722
every week or month.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:40.439
It was a slogan that they used in 2015 shortly before they were bought by the Dutch conglomerate

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:43.289
Unilever for over a billion dollars.

00:08:44.887 --> 00:08:50.587
So the slogan is, and listen carefully here, it's shave time, shave money.

00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:55.617
That's shave time, shave money with the 'sh' sound.

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:58.327
Can you see why this one is clever?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:07.691
Well, it's a play on words, both visually and audibly, meaning that shave sounds very similar to

00:09:07.871 --> 00:09:08.501
save.

00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:16.597
And also when you see the words written down, the only difference in the spelling is the addition of

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:18.397
the H in shave.

00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:26.582
Dollar Shave Club is a very playful brand, and this play on words fits right in with the rest of

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:28.202
their marketing.

00:09:29.121 --> 00:09:34.697
If you haven't seen their launch video yet, the video they made when they launched the brand, just

00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:38.087
search for Dollar Shave Club on YouTube and have a look.

00:09:38.357 --> 00:09:40.697
It's hilarious, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

00:09:40.787 --> 00:09:50.220
I'll also put a link in the show notes So shave time, shave money is playful, yet reinforces the two

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:57.150
core benefits of the service, which are that the company helps save you time because they deliver it

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.351
to your door and they help save you money because they are cheaper.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:10.036
Finally, this is one that you probably won't have heard of, but if you are listening in the UK, then

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:10.576
you might have.

00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:14.141
It was one of my mother's favourites when I was growing up.

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:23.198
It's from the British home and garden goods company, Ronseal Ronseal makes things like varnish,

00:10:23.318 --> 00:10:28.804
sealant, protective things for fences, doors, and that kind of stuff.

00:10:29.434 --> 00:10:36.673
Basically, really boring products that no one would ever have really thought you could build a fun

00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:37.723
brand around.

00:10:38.113 --> 00:10:44.323
There's nothing fun about buying paint for your kitchen floor or garden fence.

00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:47.931
But Ronseal have a pretty fun and memorable slogan.

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:56.581
Their slogan, which has been in use since 1994 is 'It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin'.

00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:58.411
So I'll repeat that.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.921
It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin.

00:11:03.106 --> 00:11:09.946
It's so well known in the UK that even the ex-Prime Minister David Cameron used it to describe his

00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:10.396
government.

00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:17.956
In a world where companies were trying to come up with more and more aspirational slogans and catch

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:24.586
phrases, which their products couldn't really live up to, Ronseal decided to go completely the

00:11:24.586 --> 00:11:29.086
opposite way and create a incredibly simple slogan.

00:11:30.378 --> 00:11:35.586
It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin means only that the product will work in the way that it

00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:40.864
says it will, that it will do what it says it will do on the outside of the tin.

00:11:41.209 --> 00:11:48.027
It's hardly the most aspirational claim by a company, but it really appeals to the British sense of

00:11:48.372 --> 00:11:51.432
self-deprecation, of putting oneself down.

00:11:52.242 --> 00:11:53.052
And it worked.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.642
I mean, it really worked.

00:11:55.062 --> 00:12:02.472
The slogan catapulted Ronseal well above its rivals, and it's now the market leader in the UK for

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.462
goods in its category.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.998
If you're in the UK and you hear someone saying It Does Exactly What It Says On The Tin, then you'll

00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:11.438
know where this phrase comes from.

00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:19.359
That's sort of the best possible thing that a brand can hope for, that its slogan becomes used in

00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:21.039
language and common parlance.

00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:28.479
People then just talking between themselves are in effect doing the marketing and doing the

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:30.759
advertising for a company for free.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:38.945
Okay, so that is a quick pre-Christmas summary of three of the most successful company slogans of

00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:42.091
all time Nike's Just Do It.

00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:49.141
Dollar Shave Club's, Shave Time, Shave Money, and Ronseal's, It Does Exactly What It Says On The

00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:49.531
Tin.

00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:56.296
Before we go though, I've just got one quick story about a slogan that went wrong.

00:12:56.671 --> 00:12:59.791
Or rather a translation of a slogan that went wrong.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.020
You've actually already heard it right at the start of the podcast.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.570
It's the McDonald's slogan, I'm lovin' it.

00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:12.185
In China, it was translated as wo jiu xihuan.

00:13:12.868 --> 00:13:20.670
This technically means something like, I just like it, but the second word 'jiu' is normally used to

00:13:20.952 --> 00:13:25.440
contradict someone who has said something different previously.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:33.359
So the implication is that the person saying the slogan is defending McDonald's food to someone who

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:34.469
has said it's disgusting.

00:13:35.909 --> 00:13:39.929
So the English equivalent might be something like, but I like it.

00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:43.921
The idea is that someone said, eugh, why do you eat that disgusting stuff?

00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:45.961
And the slogan is, but I like it.

00:13:47.308 --> 00:13:52.768
In any case, it does sound a bit stupid when it's pointed out, but it hasn't stopped the success of

00:13:52.768 --> 00:13:53.848
McDonald's in China.

00:13:55.812 --> 00:14:01.834
Okay then, as always, if you've enjoyed this podcast and you want to give me a Christmas present

00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:07.234
that will not only take you 20 seconds to do, cost you nothing and leave a big smile on my face,

00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:09.484
then you can leave a review of the podcast.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:15.388
Each review helps more people find the podcast, and the more people who listen well, the better

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:16.888
it'll get for everyone.

00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:22.293
There'll be another podcast coming out next Tuesday, so that's on the 24th where we'll be telling

00:14:22.293 --> 00:14:26.043
the story of how one book made Christmas, what it is today.

00:14:26.264 --> 00:14:27.484
And no it's not the Bible.

00:14:27.874 --> 00:14:32.944
The only clue I'll give you is that it was written 160 years ago in Victorian London.

00:14:33.778 --> 00:14:38.459
You've been listening to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.130
I'm Alastair Budge, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

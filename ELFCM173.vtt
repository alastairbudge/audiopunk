Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.540
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.190
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.390
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about something

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.040
that is close to almost every Brit’s heart, and that is the BBC.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.680
I’m sure you have heard of it, you have probably

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.000
watched it, listened to it, or read articles by the BBC.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.796
But I imagine that you might not know a huge amount about it - about how it works,

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:52.626
how it is funded, the mission it has, and what the future might hold for it.

00:00:53.726 --> 00:01:00.136
So, in 20 minutes time I hope that some of these questions will be answered, and you

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:05.286
will know a little bit more about something that is a British cultural institution,

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:11.466
and is in fact the oldest national broadcasting organisation in the entire world.

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:15.496
OK then, let’s talk about the BBC.

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:21.426
Just in case you weren’t aware of what the letters BBC

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:24.746
stand for, it’s the British Broadcasting Corporation.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:29.356
It’s the world’s oldest national broadcaster, and the

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:33.336
largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees.

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:39.436
Its mission is, and I'm quoting directly here, ‘to act in the public interest,

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:45.116
serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:51.536
and distinctive outputs and services which inform, educate and entertain’.

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:57.886
The key words there for me are ‘inform, educate, and entertain’.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:02.576
This is at the core of everything the BBC aims to do.

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:04.356
Provide information.

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:06.996
Educate people, and entertain them.

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:12.736
I wouldn’t like to make any comparison between this humble podcast and the

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:17.946
gigantic BBC, but at least, I think we have these three goals in common.

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:24.286
So, what does the BBC actually do then to achieve its mission?

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:29.956
Well, it produces and broadcasts shows on tv, radio, and online.

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:37.467
From news to drama, sports to language learning, nature documentaries to children's shows,

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:44.915
almost anything you can imagine hearing, seeing, or reading, it’s probably done by the BBC.

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:53.355
Since it was founded in 1922, almost 100 years ago now, it has faithfully and diligently

00:02:53.365 --> 00:02:59.305
broadcast news and entertainment to the British public, and I should also say, to the world.

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:05.475
It has what’s called a Royal Charter, a special licence from the government.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:09.575
This makes it, essentially, a state media company.

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:15.285
Although unlike let’s say in North Korea, you won’t find newsreaders

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:18.805
on the BBC constantly praising the leaders of the country.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:26.115
The BBC has editorial independence - it has the right, the obligation even, to

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:32.725
report impartially, and to present multiple arguments, multiple points of view.

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:38.165
This actually is easier said than done, as we’ll talk about shortly.

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:44.465
So, the BBC is a state media broadcaster, a state media company, and it

00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:49.325
is funded, it gets its money, from the people, from British taxpayers.

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:56.135
How this works is that if you watch live TV, or if you watch ‘catch-up’ BBC

00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:01.835
tv, on their service called ‘iPlayer’, you are required to pay a TV licence

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:11.345
fee, which is currently £154.50, so that’s around €180 or $200, per year.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:19.695
This is paid by 23 million households in the UK, about 83% of the population.

00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:27.905
The fact that everyone who has a TV is required to pay this fee to the BBC, is the subject

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:34.385
of not a small amount of controversy, and indeed in the era when we are increasingly

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:40.645
not tuning in to watch a film or programme at a fixed time on a TV in a living room,

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:47.015
it is far harder to actually police, to enforce the collection of this licence fee.

00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:52.271
The other effect of this licence fee is that, because everyone who

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:57.701
watches TV is essentially a paying customer of the BBC, there is a

00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:02.951
greater feeling of entitlement over what the BBC should and shouldn’t do.

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:09.131
Rightly so, as a paying customer of something, you feel like you have a greater

00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:13.711
right to speak your opinion than if you were getting something for free.

00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:20.621
Now, the end result of this is that the BBC is subject to constant

00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:25.061
complaints - people complaining that something was offensive to them,

00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:29.491
or that a political opinion was expressed that they disagreed with.

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:36.341
Although many businesses would be very envious of the BBC’s 23 million

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:41.721
customers who are in effect forced by law to buy a subscription to the BBC,

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:47.171
it does mean that you have 23 million households to potentially offend.

00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:51.101
We’ll talk about a few implications of this in a minute.

00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:56.161
But the BBC isn’t completely funded by the British people.

00:05:56.661 --> 00:06:03.691
The majority of the rest of its income comes from selling programmes to foreign TV networks.

00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:10.081
If you have watched Sherlock, or Downton Abbey, or Call The Midwife on TV

00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:16.131
outside the UK, then the BBC will have sold the rights to show that programme.

00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:25.051
And it makes a lot of money from that, around £1.4 billion, which is around 1.6 billion Euros.

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.481
It also gets a grant from the British government to make things like

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:35.401
English learning resources, which is all part of British soft power, of

00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:40.789
trying to help people learn English and be attracted to life in the UK.

00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:45.251
If you have listened to one of the very early episodes

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.601
on soft power then you will know all about that.

00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:55.601
Now, we have covered some introductory information about the BBC, and how it is funded.

00:06:55.961 --> 00:07:01.771
Let’s move on to discussing what this actually means in terms of the content that it produces.

00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:08.281
As a reminder, its mission is “to act in the public interest, serving

00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:13.081
all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and

00:07:13.081 --> 00:07:17.821
distinctive output and services which inform, educate and entertain”.

00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:23.061
So, on a practical level, what does this actually mean?

00:07:23.491 --> 00:07:27.811
Let’s dissect each part, and start with “the public interest”.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.220
If you look in the dictionary, you’ll find “the public interest” defined

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.670
as something like “the welfare or well-being of the general public”.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.920
So, if something is in the public interest, it is a good thing for people to be aware of.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.160
Informing people about the news in their country could be in the public interest.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.397
So could informing them about changes to laws, or bad behaviour of politicians.

00:07:57.154 --> 00:08:01.544
But the distinction between something that is in the public interest and

00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:06.686
something that isn’t in the public interest is, of course, not always clear.

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:13.536
For example, there was a famous interview that was broadcast on the BBC between a young

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:20.536
journalist called Martin Bashir and Lady Diana, the then wife of Prince Charles, the Queen’s son.

00:08:21.726 --> 00:08:27.396
During this interview, Princess Diana admitted to her and Charles’ extra-marital

00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:32.256
affairs, and it was ultimately an interview that led to their divorce.

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:39.856
Although it was over 25 years ago now, it has come under renewed scrutiny, as it was

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:45.626
alleged that the BBC journalist had tricked Lady Diana into giving him the interview.

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:51.096
Now, to go back to the BBC’s mission, it is certainly less

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:55.316
clear whether this kind of interview was in the public interest.

00:08:56.446 --> 00:09:01.996
If the news story is about a member of the Royal family, sure it might

00:09:01.996 --> 00:09:07.556
make for entertaining viewing, but is it by default in the public interest?

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:10.496
Certainly, there isn’t an easy answer.

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:17.626
Now, let’s dissect the second part of the BBC’s mission, “serving all audiences

00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:23.509
through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output”

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:29.436
The most important word here is “impartial”, meaning without

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:33.286
bias, objective, without a strong opinion either way.

00:09:34.586 --> 00:09:37.946
Being impartial is a lot harder than some people think.

00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:43.916
It means not expressing opinions, it means concealing what you actually think about

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:48.966
something, even if you might have a very strong opinion, you are not allowed to show it.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:54.586
It also means allowing different opinions to be aired, different

00:09:54.586 --> 00:09:59.376
opinions to be shown from the entire political spectrum, left to right.

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:07.626
Despite pledging to be politically neutral, the BBC is forever criticised by both right and left.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.666
On the political right, it is criticised for being too

00:10:11.676 --> 00:10:16.136
liberal, too left, and too full of the metropolitan elite.

00:10:16.986 --> 00:10:21.556
This is particularly true at the moment, when there is a Conservative

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:26.216
government, and the BBC asks hard questions of the government.

00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:33.225
But when there is a Labour government, a centre-left government, the BBC tends

00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:38.495
to get criticised for being too conservative-leaning, for being too right wing.

00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:46.105
During the 2016 Brexit referendum it was criticised by both sides at the same time.

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:53.895
The Leave side, the side for Brexit, criticised the BBC for being anti-Brexit, and the

00:10:54.035 --> 00:11:00.465
Remain side, the side that supported remaining in the EU, criticised it for being pro-Brexit.

00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:07.845
So, if both sides are saying that the BBC is biased, that is normally a pretty good

00:11:07.845 --> 00:11:13.535
sign that it is doing a decent job at remaining objective, of remaining impartial.

00:11:14.395 --> 00:11:21.985
This balance of opinion is generally given not through the newsreaders or through the interviews,

00:11:22.085 --> 00:11:28.485
but the choice of guests, the choice of interviewees that are invited to join a BBC programme.

00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:33.485
The debate shows will generally invite people from a range of

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:37.755
different opinions, to ensure that there is some balanced discussion.

00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:45.485
Finding that balance of opinions is, of course, hard, but the BBC does generally do this quite well.

00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:50.365
It does beg the question, though, of what is ‘balanced’.

00:11:50.515 --> 00:11:54.715
And how much ‘airtime’ should be given to different opinions?

00:11:55.585 --> 00:12:01.905
There are evidently some views that are so niche, some that are so ridiculous, or some that

00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:07.951
are so extreme that they are offensive, that probably don’t deserve any kind of airtime.

00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:14.591
But, especially in recent years where there has been a growth in extremism, of

00:12:14.781 --> 00:12:20.981
people having more ‘extreme’ views, the BBC has been accused of providing a platform

00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:25.391
for these opinions that are considered to be more dangerous and more radical.

00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:32.082
Now, going back to its mission again, the BBC has the duty to

00:12:32.242 --> 00:12:37.042
“serve all audiences”, and just because an audience might have a

00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:41.042
different opinion to you, does this mean that it shouldn't be served?

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:48.352
Whatever the BBC does, it will always have critics - on the one hand people who say that too much

00:12:48.382 --> 00:12:54.932
airtime is given to extremist views, and on the other hand, people who hold those views will say

00:12:54.932 --> 00:13:01.992
that the BBC is too liberal, is too ‘left wing’, or that it tries to make everything too neutral.

00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:06.902
So the BBC has a hard time pleasing everyone.

00:13:08.052 --> 00:13:14.354
The result of this is that the BBC has gained a reputation in the UK for extreme

00:13:14.414 --> 00:13:21.034
caution, and for trying to represent every single interest group or demographic, equally.

00:13:21.904 --> 00:13:26.604
No matter your skin colour, gender, religion, age, disability,

00:13:26.604 --> 00:13:30.504
or any other factor, the BBC tries to represent you.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:37.634
That is, in my view at least, a pretty great thing, and a noble development, but

00:13:37.744 --> 00:13:43.144
it has meant that it is often the object of ridicule, that people make fun of it.

00:13:44.384 --> 00:13:50.034
There’s actually a really good, what's called ‘mockumentary’, a kind of comedy documentary,

00:13:50.324 --> 00:13:57.674
called W1A, which is a BBC series that makes fun of how politically correct the BBC is,

00:13:57.864 --> 00:14:03.954
and how everyone is so afraid of offending a particular group that nothing ever gets done.

00:14:04.954 --> 00:14:08.094
It’s definitely worth a watch, and is a great example

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:11.444
of this extreme caution that the BBC exercises.

00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:14.524
Again it's called W1A.

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:21.254
In terms of what the BBC actually does, in terms of the programmes it actually produces, it would

00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:27.954
take us hours, days, weeks, to talk about all of them, so I want to just give you an overview.

00:14:28.654 --> 00:14:34.184
The BBC both makes its own programmes, and buys programmes from other production companies.

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:40.504
I guess you will have probably watched quite a few BBC programmes yourself, as they

00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:46.704
are often exported all over the world, and shown on other, non-bbc, tv channels.

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:53.384
To list some that I imagine you might have come across, there are the amazing ‘nature

00:14:53.384 --> 00:14:59.734
documentary’ series, things like The Blue Planet, Planet Earth, and Walking with Dinosaurs.

00:15:00.844 --> 00:15:06.434
There was the longest running weekly music show in history, called Top of The Pops, which

00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:11.914
hosted everything from The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to Madonna and The Spice Girls.

00:15:12.864 --> 00:15:17.354
Of course the classic comedies, things like Monty Python and Fawlty Towers.

00:15:17.944 --> 00:15:23.794
And the most recent hit success from the BBC - and I have to confess, I

00:15:23.804 --> 00:15:28.264
don’t really understand the appeal of this, I don’t really see why it was so

00:15:28.304 --> 00:15:34.084
popular, was The Great British Bake Off, the show where people make cakes.

00:15:35.104 --> 00:15:40.054
Now, the BBC will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, but it

00:15:40.074 --> 00:15:43.794
hasn’t actually been broadcasting non-stop for a hundred years.

00:15:44.674 --> 00:15:47.954
All TV broadcasting was stopped during the Second World War.

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:53.154
The BBC was partly moved out of London, and of course, the

00:15:53.294 --> 00:15:57.244
nation had bigger concerns than producing great documentaries.

00:15:58.084 --> 00:16:02.694
So the BBC was taken off air, the TVs were turned off from

00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:07.734
September 1939, allegedly in the middle of a Mickey Mouse cartoon.

00:16:08.644 --> 00:16:14.354
And the TVs were switched off until 1946 - there was no TV for 7 years.

00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:20.904
The story goes that when service resumed, after 7 years of pause, they started

00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:25.944
again at the same point from the same Mickey Mouse cartoon but only after

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:30.344
the announcer said “As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted.”

00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:36.784
For those of you familiar with the British sense of humour, that probably makes a lot of sense.

00:16:36.884 --> 00:16:41.399
It is a very British thing to say, to play down the fact that there has

00:16:41.504 --> 00:16:47.094
been a long and tragic war, and instead refer to being rudely interrupted.

00:16:47.814 --> 00:16:54.504
Even though it makes for a great story, unfortunately it is an urban myth, it’s not true.

00:16:55.104 --> 00:17:00.344
The real story is actually just as endearing, just as sweet and funny.

00:17:01.144 --> 00:17:06.864
The first person to appear when the TVs were turned back on and service resumed was

00:17:06.874 --> 00:17:12.804
a lady called Jasmine Bligh and her first words were "Good afternoon, everybody.

00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:13.644
How are you?

00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:15.994
Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh

00:17:16.794 --> 00:17:17.634
... ?"
Here’s a clip of her.

00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:22.062
"Hi, how are you?, do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh...".

00:17:22.534 --> 00:17:29.324
Now, given that the BBC is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary, this has led to renewed

00:17:29.394 --> 00:17:36.184
debate over the purpose it serves, how it is funded, and how it competes in a world full

00:17:36.194 --> 00:17:43.094
of Disney, Netflix, Amazon, and other well-oiled businesses that also offer compelling TV.

00:17:44.024 --> 00:17:50.504
There have been petitions to abolish the licence fee, arguing that it is a tax on anyone who

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:56.764
wants to watch television, and that it just isn’t an effective way to fund a national broadcaster.

00:17:57.894 --> 00:18:01.716
There is also debate over the existence of a national broadcaster.

00:18:02.286 --> 00:18:06.466
Should there be a state media company that tries to please everyone?

00:18:07.366 --> 00:18:12.116
With something like the “public interest” so hard to define, who

00:18:12.186 --> 00:18:16.726
and how should decide what qualifies as “in the public interest”?

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:23.826
If it is indeed a service that exists for the benefit of the country, wouldn’t it make more sense

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:30.436
for the fee to be paid directly as a tax, rather than households paying the same amount for it?

00:18:31.506 --> 00:18:35.126
Several countries have already gone this route, Sweden, for example,

00:18:35.446 --> 00:18:39.796
and wouldn’t this be a more sensible way of funding the organisation?

00:18:40.906 --> 00:18:44.736
The debate over funding the BBC has been going on since the

00:18:44.736 --> 00:18:48.916
1980s, and nobody has yet come up with a better way to do it.

00:18:49.716 --> 00:18:55.006
Something surely has to change, but whether that is a national tax, a

00:18:55.086 --> 00:19:00.136
subscription system, or the breaking up of different parts of the BBC, it

00:19:00.136 --> 00:19:04.556
seems unlikely that there will be agreement at any time in the near future.

00:19:05.466 --> 00:19:11.666
And in terms of how the BBC competes in a world dominated by tech giants that

00:19:11.666 --> 00:19:16.956
have started to move in on its territory, this is obviously an important question

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:22.676
not just for the BBC itself, but for the people in the UK who pay for it.

00:19:23.836 --> 00:19:28.306
Especially for the younger generation, let’s say those aged between

00:19:28.306 --> 00:19:33.766
16-25, the amount of time they spend sitting in front of a TV and

00:19:33.776 --> 00:19:38.106
watching traditional television programmes is dropping every year.

00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:44.176
Whether it’s YouTube, Netflix, or other forms of social media, the

00:19:44.176 --> 00:19:49.106
BBC has had to accept that the days of a family gathering around at a

00:19:49.116 --> 00:19:53.856
fixed time to catch a programme on BBC One will not be around forever.

00:19:54.696 --> 00:20:01.066
And there doesn’t seem to be a simple answer for what the BBC could, or should, do about it.

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:07.846
Now, despite all its faults and imperfections, it’s hard to deny that it is an amazing

00:20:07.976 --> 00:20:14.324
and enduring institution, and it has a pretty special place in almost every Brit’s heart.

00:20:14.906 --> 00:20:20.722
Especially in the era of fake news, and of private companies encroaching on the

00:20:20.732 --> 00:20:27.112
media industry, the BBC's long history of public service, and of impartiality,

00:20:27.312 --> 00:20:32.462
or reporting events fairly and objectively is more important than ever before.

00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:38.292
So, it is certainly my hope that the BBC is going to continue

00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:43.142
to inform, educate, and entertain for quite some time to come.

00:20:45.872 --> 00:20:49.992
OK, then, that is it for today’s episode on the British

00:20:50.022 --> 00:20:54.112
institution that is the BBC, the British Broadcasting Corporation.

00:20:54.832 --> 00:20:58.362
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:02.702
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:05.602
Is there a national broadcaster in your country?

00:21:05.982 --> 00:21:08.422
If so, who pays for it, and how?

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:14.862
What do you think organisations like the BBC should do in the era of Netflix and Amazon Prime?

00:21:15.572 --> 00:21:19.682
And finally, perhaps most importantly, are you a fan of The Great

00:21:19.732 --> 00:21:24.312
British Bake Off, and if so, can you please explain to me why?

00:21:24.982 --> 00:21:27.812

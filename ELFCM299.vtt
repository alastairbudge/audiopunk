Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:16.143
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:20.293
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:24.583
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:29.483
about the rise of the SUV, the “Sports Utility Vehicle”.

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:33.513
SUVs have overtaken the car market.

00:00:33.813 --> 00:00:38.263
With their off-road heritage they have become the heavyweight of roads across the

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:43.673
globe, towering over traditional hatchbacks, and taking 4-wheel-drive from the

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:48.193
American highway to the winding streets of Europe to the ring roads of Beijing.

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:55.553
So, in this episode we are going to look at the story of how the SUV took over the world.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:01.013
OK then, the rise of the SUV.

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:07.953
First off, what actually is a SUV, a Sports Utility Vehicle?

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:15.535
The term SUV was first used in the U.S in the 1980s but it is not a strict

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:21.065
category and includes various cars that have either four or two-wheel drive.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:28.425
They are larger than saloon or sedan models with wider and taller bodies and their raised suspension

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:33.745
leaves them higher off the ground, they are able to conquer all types of terrain if necessary.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:38.225
And their ability to drive off-road is where it all began,

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.585
for the origin of the SUV is in U.S military vehicles.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:48.455
Before the Second World War, the American army called for a sturdy

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:52.385
four-wheel drive vehicle that could transport soldiers over rough terrain.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:02:00.365
The company ‘Willys Overland’ responded to the army’s request and supplied it with a prototype,

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:06.105
the ‘Jeep’, which became the standard military vehicle that we likely all recognise today.

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:14.615
700,000 Jeeps were produced for World War II with the help of the Ford Motor company; and the

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:21.295
vehicles played a vital role carrying soldiers, weapons and medical equipment over the battlefields.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:28.685
Clearly, in times of war, when you really do need to drive over difficult territory and you

00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:34.685
need to have a durable and reliable vehicle, this is exactly the sort of vehicle you want.

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:43.205
After the war, the Jeep ‘CJ’, short for civilian Jeep, went on sale to the American public.

00:02:43.915 --> 00:02:49.565
The vehicle was still very influenced by its initial open-body military design,

00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:54.025
though, with no roof or no doors they would have looked more appropriate

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:57.755
trudging through the battlefields than cruising along the American highway.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:05.125
Inspired by the innovations they saw across the Atlantic, British brothers Maurice and Spencer Wilks

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:11.525
also decided to put their engineering skills to the test and produce their own four-by-four vehicle.

00:03:12.715 --> 00:03:17.538
Using a similar design to the Jeep, they produced the ‘Land Rover’,

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:23.195
which debuted in 1948 and quickly became a popular vehicle for farmers.

00:03:24.055 --> 00:03:29.805
Clearly, for a farmer who needs to drive through fields and ditches, such a car

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:35.295
simply made sense, if you’re a farmer you do literally need to rove across the land.

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:43.435
Not long after, in 1950, the Korean war broke out and the U.S military based in Japan

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:48.795
called for the manufacturer Toyota to develop a suitable vehicle for the battlefield.

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:53.285
However, the military were unimpressed by the prototype

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:56.165
offered and stuck with their trusty American Jeep.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:02.425
Nonetheless, in 1953, Toyota produced the ‘Land Cruiser’ model, which

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:06.225
quickly became the vehicle of choice for the Japanese police force.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:10.505
In the same year, Mitsubishi were given permission to reproduce

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:13.915
the Jeep for themselves and bring it to the Japanese market.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:19.795
Back in America, the popularity of the Jeep CJ, the “civilian

00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:24.754
jeep”, had led to a newer, more comfortable, civilian model in 1955.

00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:30.835
By this time, the manufacturer, now named Willys Motors, had become

00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:34.845
known as ‘the world’s largest maker of four-wheel drive vehicles’.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:40.475
It was not until 1963 though, that a more ‘car-like’

00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:44.065
Jeep was produced with the release of the Wagoneer model.

00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:49.615
This offered the luxury of doors and a roof, as well as more comfortable

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:54.715
interior and less rigid suspension which gave it a smoother ride.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:05:02.175
Similarly, in 1967 Toyota adapted their Land Cruiser, transforming

00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:05.885
it from a police vehicle to a rival of the Jeep or Land Rover.

00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:13.555
It too was more luxurious than its predecessor, and brought the utility of a four-by-four

00:05:13.755 --> 00:05:18.165
in line with the more civilian friendly models taking over the market in the U.S.

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:24.265
The popularity of the Jeep in the United States saw many other manufacturers such

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:29.945
as Dodge, Chevrolet and Land Rover continue to develop and expand their own models.

00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:37.432
Car production, however, was still somewhat of a wild west, it was still quite unregulated.

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:44.015
This all changed in the 1960s, when there were massive improvements in safety regulations.

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:50.085
In the 1960s it became mandatory for cars to be produced with seatbelts; and

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:55.775
in the 1970s and 80s, the U.S government issued mandates to reduce pollution

00:05:55.775 --> 00:06:00.645
from vehicles, increase fuel efficiency and improve car safety overall.

00:06:02.085 --> 00:06:06.525
While this was clearly good news for drivers, and–in the short term at

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:10.705
least–for the environment, it wasn’t good news for car manufacturers.

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:17.615
This period in American car history has become known as the ‘malaise era’, with the strict

00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:23.815
new list of regulations massively impacting car design as manufacturers were not prepared.

00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:27.815
There was no technology to continue producing these big muscle

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:31.335
car engines that would abide by the new limits on emissions.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:40.855
But importantly, SUVs were, until 2004, not classified in the same way as normal cars,

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:47.395
they were classified as a truck, not a car, which allowed them to be less fuel-efficient.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:55.115
And while the archetypal American muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge

00:06:55.115 --> 00:07:01.055
Charger weren’t able to abide by these stricter emissions requirements, SUVs,

00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:05.355
because they weren’t classified as cars, they were classified as trucks, they

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:10.345
needed to make some adjustments but they could comply with the new regulations.

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:16.165
By the 1980s, American car manufacturers were used to the

00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:19.515
regulations and they could produce a wider variety of models.

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:29.015
One of those models was the original SUV, the Jeep Cherokee XJ, which came out in 1984.

00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:35.115
This model was more compact and lighter in comparison to the previous

00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:39.115
Jeep models which made it more fuel-efficient and consumer friendly.

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:43.105
It was also far more comfortable and good for families.

00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:51.535
This Cherokee bridged the gap between a four-by-four and a passenger car and it was a huge success.

00:07:51.935 --> 00:07:55.045
It was in the media celebration of this car that the

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:59.815
term SUV, Sports Utility Vehicle, was originally used.

00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:05.965
When other car manufacturers realised that Jeep was taking away sales

00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:10.425
from classic sedan and hatchback models, they wanted their share of the

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:15.265
success and throughout the 1990s more and more SUV models were released.

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:23.785
By the mid-90s the SUV craze was well underway and by 1999 sales of

00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:28.735
SUV and pick-up trucks in the U.S exceeded regular passenger cars.

00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:34.085
Eventually, the trend would spread worldwide and between

00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:40.905
2010 and 2021, SUV sales increased by 178% globally.

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:49.205
This trend shows no signs of slowing down and in 2021 the number of SUVs on the road

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:58.385
increased globally by over 35 million, with SUVs making up 49.7% of all car sales in Europe.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:03.815
And if you add “trucks and pickups” together with SUVs, this

00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:10.414
category makes up 72.9% of all new cars sold in the United States.

00:09:11.372 --> 00:09:16.102
And this phenomenon is, as you will well know, taking over the world.

00:09:16.942 --> 00:09:17.472
Almost.

00:09:17.602 --> 00:09:21.902
Some SUVs are just simply too big for some urban environments.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:29.322
Boxy American SUVs like the popular Ford Expedition, for example, didn't quite make it to Europe.

00:09:29.884 --> 00:09:34.882
At over 5 metres long and over 2 metres wide, the model is

00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:38.902
just not a good fit for the narrower and urban roads of Europe.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:45.722
Instead, slightly more compact models such as the Peugeot 3008 have proved popular.

00:09:46.622 --> 00:09:50.572
Asia, too, has championed slightly more compact models.

00:09:51.484 --> 00:09:55.473
So how and why did SUVs get so popular?

00:09:55.843 --> 00:09:59.483
Well, perhaps you drive an SUV yourself, so you have

00:09:59.483 --> 00:10:02.513
your own reasons for choosing one over a smaller car.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:08.593
People, especially families, are attracted to the vehicle’s versatility,

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:14.453
with its ability to go off-road, its larger cargo space, potential for more

00:10:14.453 --> 00:10:18.683
seats, and towing abilities, it seems like you get more for your money.

00:10:20.028 --> 00:10:25.008
But one of the key things that people value, of course, is safety and

00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:30.028
these cars are often marketed on their ability to protect your family.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:37.368
Many people believe an SUV is a safer choice, being bigger, bulkier and taller.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:42.548
They have a better view over the road, their four-wheel drive gives a certain

00:10:42.548 --> 00:10:47.498
sense of security no matter the weather, and if you do hit something then it’s

00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:52.518
better to be hitting it in a massive truck than a small hatchback, a small car.

00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:58.998
And of course, if, statistically, over half of the cars on the road are SUVs,

00:10:59.328 --> 00:11:04.228
from a safety point of view you’ll be safer in a crash if you too are in an SUV.

00:11:05.308 --> 00:11:07.718
Or at least that is the popular belief.

00:11:08.338 --> 00:11:11.778
There are, in fact, critics of SUVs who say that

00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:14.708
they may not actually be much safer than other cars.

00:11:15.448 --> 00:11:19.688
And by “safer”, I don’t just mean safer for the people in the car.

00:11:20.528 --> 00:11:26.148
A study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests that their design

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:31.868
makes them twice as likely to roll over in a crash; while their large size is more likely

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:37.468
to kill pedestrians in comparison with sedan vehicles that typically impact the lower body.

00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:44.188
An article in Economics of Transportation reported that in the United States, pedestrian

00:11:44.188 --> 00:11:52.498
deaths increased by 30% between 2000 and 2019, a period when the number of SUVs tripled.

00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:57.318
These figures are alarming when we consider that these popular cars

00:11:57.488 --> 00:12:02.098
have begun to flood our cities, only increasing chances of collisions.

00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:10.818
In the UK, in fact, three quarters of SUVs are registered to urban areas, to towns and cities.

00:12:11.718 --> 00:12:16.608
This explains why they have become known as ‘Chelsea Tractors’, the term

00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:21.398
capturing how they plough through the middle-class streets, somewhat out of place.

00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:28.368
They are so popular in British urban areas that in 2016, the UK’s largest

00:12:28.368 --> 00:12:34.418
car park operator had to widen, it had to enlarge its parking bays in the

00:12:34.418 --> 00:12:38.768
cities of London, Manchester and Bournemouth to make space for these cars.

00:12:39.618 --> 00:12:46.218
In America, the influx of SUVs in urban centres has been described as ‘truck

00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:51.809
bloat’, this reflects how uncomfortably these cars fit in the streets.

00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:55.868
Not all cities are accepting this sitting down.

00:12:56.728 --> 00:12:59.878
In a first for the United States, Washington D.C.

00:13:00.118 --> 00:13:03.188
has proposed requiring owners of vehicles weighing

00:13:03.238 --> 00:13:07.948
over 2.7 metric tonnes to pay an annual fee of $500.

00:13:08.878 --> 00:13:13.188
It might not sound like a huge amount, especially to car owners in Europe,

00:13:13.428 --> 00:13:18.368
but this is nearly seven times the amount the city charges for a sedan model.

00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:26.171
In Berlin, the issue of SUVs in the city became painfully obvious when in 2019,

00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:32.211
a driver lost control of their SUV and mounted the pavement killing four people.

00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:39.651
And clearly, it isn’t just a case of SUVs clogging up the road or being a danger to pedestrians.

00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:46.191
They are terrible for the environment, producing 25% more CO2 than medium sized cars.

00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:54.631
And because there are now so many SUVs on the road, if SUV drivers were a country, it would

00:13:54.631 --> 00:14:01.081
rank 7th in the world for its carbon emissions, worse than the U.K and the Netherlands combined.

00:14:02.211 --> 00:14:08.661
In the UK in fact, SUVs have cancelled out the impact electric vehicles have had on emissions.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:15.964
And perhaps even more stunningly, the International Energy Agency found that the rise of the

00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:22.411
SUV is the second largest cause of the increase in global emissions across the last decade.

00:14:23.603 --> 00:14:28.413
As a result, there is an increasing backlash against SUV manufacturers.

00:14:29.193 --> 00:14:34.333
Some critics have called for a ban on adverts for SUVs, comparing the

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:39.283
vehicles to tobacco for the threat they pose to public health, and claiming

00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:45.483
that SUV adverts have similarly misled the public with their safety claims.

00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:52.473
The idea is, of course, that if SUV manufacturers can’t market their products to consumers,

00:14:52.653 --> 00:14:58.763
demand will fall off a cliff, it will drop dramatically, and so will SUV emissions.

00:14:59.423 --> 00:15:03.823
And all this is against a backdrop of global increasing

00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:07.673
hostility to all urban driving, not just SUVs.

00:15:08.683 --> 00:15:15.663
Paris, in France, plans to ban all private vehicles from the historical city centre by 2024.

00:15:16.553 --> 00:15:20.843
By the same year, Rome will ban diesel cars in an attempt

00:15:20.843 --> 00:15:23.973
to preserve the historic sites from pollution damage.

00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:28.083
And countless other cities across Europe plan on removing

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:31.363
fossil-fuel cars from their centres over the next five years.

00:15:32.483 --> 00:15:38.053
Many more cities have similar bold plans, and countries across the globe are,

00:15:38.423 --> 00:15:43.653
at least nominally, in the process of phasing-out fossil fuel vehicles entirely.

00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:50.683
The EU has the target of a 100% CO2 emissions reduction for new vehicles by

00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:57.043
2035, while the U.S is aiming for 50% of new vehicles to be electric by 2030.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:02.096
Given their big, polluting engines, the fate of the

00:16:02.096 --> 00:16:06.526
SUV certainly sounds precarious, it looks dangerous.

00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:12.186
That is until you discover that over 55% of electric car models

00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:17.706
on the market in 2021 were, in fact, SUVs and pickup trucks.

00:16:18.746 --> 00:16:23.646
In anticipation of where public opinion and public policy is heading,

00:16:23.976 --> 00:16:29.236
car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, Mercedes and Volvo have all declared

00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:33.266
they will be stopping their production of gas and diesel powered engines.

00:16:34.056 --> 00:16:37.566
Instead, these companies will be producing only electric

00:16:37.566 --> 00:16:41.306
vehicles, with many of those electric vehicles SUVs.

00:16:42.256 --> 00:16:49.766
The futuristic Tesla 'Cyber Truck’ is also on the horizon, with production due to start after 2022.

00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:53.866
This model claims it will have ‘better utility than

00:16:53.866 --> 00:16:56.506
a truck with more performance than a sports car’.

00:16:57.296 --> 00:17:01.406
It’s certainly a bold claim, and the announcement of Tesla’s new

00:17:01.406 --> 00:17:05.856
truck has been so popular that it has had to suspend pre-orders.

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:11.836
However, being electric does not completely eradicate concerns over SUVs.

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:17.106
Their large size still leads to problems as they require larger batteries

00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:21.016
and consume more energy in comparison to other electric vehicles.

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:27.916
The batteries for electric vehicles themselves are not particularly eco-friendly, as the

00:17:27.926 --> 00:17:33.266
mining of the raw materials required has major environmental and human rights impacts.

00:17:34.466 --> 00:17:39.736
Despite all this, it's clear that SUVs, both electric and fossil-fuel

00:17:39.736 --> 00:17:43.746
powered, are the choice model for many drivers all over the world.

00:17:44.616 --> 00:17:49.206
It’s quite the journey from a car produced for the army that, just to

00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:53.576
remind you, when it was first released, didn’t even have any doors.

00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:59.989
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on the rise of the SUV.

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:03.216
I hope it was an interesting one and you learned something new.

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:07.296
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:11.806
What are your thoughts on SUVs, do you love them or do you loathe them?

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:17.606
If you drive an SUV, what was it for you that made you make the switch from a smaller car?

00:18:18.196 --> 00:18:22.146
Do you think that SUVs are overcrowding our cities or

00:18:22.326 --> 00:18:24.606
do you think they’re just the same as a traditional car?

00:18:24.976 --> 00:18:28.306
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:28.756 --> 00:18:31.466

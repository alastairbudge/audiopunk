Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:16.052
Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and

00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:22.622
learn weird and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:29.657
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to tell the story of Guy Fawkes,

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:35.087
the man who almost managed to blow up the British parliament.

00:00:36.257 --> 00:00:41.807
Before we do that though, let me just quickly remind you that you can grab a copy of the

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:48.747
transcript and key vocabulary for this episode over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:54.662
The transcript is super helpful for following along with every word and the

00:00:54.662 --> 00:01:01.832
key vocabulary helps you build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:06.722
So that is definitely worth checking out if you haven't done so already.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:13.543
Okay then, let's talk about gunpowder, treason and plot.

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:19.043
On November the Fifth every year in the UK,

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:24.453
there is a celebration called bonfire night, Guy Fawkes night.

00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:28.808
Up and down the country this evening is

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:34.328
celebrated with people making a huge fire, a bonfire.

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:44.953
On top of that fire is placed an effigy, a fake copy of a man called the guy.

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:50.062
And then there's normally a big fireworks display.

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:58.868
This is a tradition that stretches back over 400 years now, to November

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:06.913
1605, to an event that nearly changed the fate of British history forever.

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:11.253
Before we go into exactly what happened, Alastair Budge:

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:16.293
let me just paint a picture of the situation in Britain at that time.

00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:23.573
On the throne was a man called King James the First.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:27.565
He had inherited the throne from Queen

00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:34.677
Elizabeth the First who was a Protestant, and she had fiercely persecuted

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:42.927
the British Catholic population for almost the entirety of her 45 year reign.

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:48.615
When James the First took over the throne the Catholic

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:54.436
population thought he might be a little kinder to them, and that they would

00:02:54.616 --> 00:03:01.008
finally be allowed to do things like practice their religion in the open.

00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:05.791
However, this was not to be the case, Alastair Budge:

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:11.634
and Catholics continued to be persecuted by the new King James.

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:18.831
So a group of them decided to take matters into their own hands.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:23.352
A group of activists, I guess we could call them,

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:27.396
activists, led by a man named Robert Alastair Budge:

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:31.898
Catesby got together and formed a plot.

00:03:33.608 --> 00:03:39.632
They plan to sneak under the Houses of Parliament, to sneak

00:03:39.632 --> 00:03:43.922
their way into the Houses of Parliament, where the British government meets.

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:48.262
And on the day that King James would officially

00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:53.032
open parliament, they would blow it all up.

00:03:54.378 --> 00:03:58.578
The plot was meticulously planned, it was very carefully planned.

00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:09.168
The men managed to smuggle over two tonnes of explosives into a cellar below parliament.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.750
This was 36 barrels full of explosives.

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:17.525
They were ready to go.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:25.205
All they needed was for the day to arrive, for the King to come, then they would light a

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:32.915
match and boom, the entire building would be blown to smithereens, completely blown up.

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:39.005
The King and everyone inside the building would be killed instantly.

00:04:40.472 --> 00:04:44.642
Then they could install a new Catholic monarch on

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:50.552
the throne, and of course, British history would be changed forever.

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:55.172
However, it wasn't to be.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:05:00.812
Shortly before the King was scheduled to open the Houses of Parliament

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.975
an anonymous letter was sent to a man named William Parker, the

00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:13.575
fourth Baron Monteagle, and it warned him to avoid the building on that day.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:21.795
Now, William Parker was a Catholic and he reported this letter to the

00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:26.521
authorities saying that he feared there was a plot

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:30.091
of some sort, that there was going to be an attack on the building.

00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:36.578
So in the early hours of November the Fifth Alastair Budge:

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:41.514
the building was searched and a man was found in the cellar.

00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:46.754
He was ready with enough explosives to blow the

00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:53.264
entire building up and destroy everything within a 40 metre radius.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.284
And that man was Guy Fawkes.

00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:04.313
Although some people mistakenly think that he was Spanish or

00:06:04.313 --> 00:06:10.583
Italian because he signed his name "Guido Fawkes", he was actually an Englishman.

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.019
He was born in York, in the North of England, in 1570.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:25.310
He was born a Protestant, but he converted to Catholicism when he was a teenager.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.350
And he spent quite a lot of time fighting in Europe with the Spanish Catholic army

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:40.077
and gained a reputation for being smart and good with explosives.

00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:46.957
And it was during his time fighting in Europe that he met some

00:06:47.287 --> 00:06:54.225
fellow Englishman who longed to rid Britain of its Protestant King, Alastair Budge:

00:06:54.225 --> 00:07:00.130
and they invited Guy, or Guido, they invited him in to their plot.

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:08.231
However, in the early hours of November the Fifth 1605,

00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:12.539
Guy was captured just in the nick of time.

00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:18.241
He was unable to light the fuse to blow up the explosives,

00:07:18.498 --> 00:07:23.658
and he was taken to the Tower of London where he was interrogated.

00:07:26.318 --> 00:07:33.158
Finally, after repeated days of torture, he revealed the names of his

00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:38.540
conspirators most of whom were captured by the King's troops.

00:07:39.877 --> 00:07:42.396
The punishment for attempted murder

00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:47.531
of the King was, as you'd expect, pretty serious.

00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:52.781
This was what was called high treason, and the

00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:58.151
punishment for that was being hung, drawn, and quartered.

00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:02.201
Now this is obviously pretty nasty.

00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:06.101
It involved being hung by your neck.

00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:13.391
Then they would cut open your stomach and eventually cut you into four pieces.

00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:17.951
Really something you want to avoid if you can possibly avoid it.

00:08:19.661 --> 00:08:25.991
Luckily, I guess sort of luckily for Guy Fawkes, he managed to throw

00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:32.651
himself off the platform just before he was going to be hung, so he broke

00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:37.931
his neck and died before this horribly painful death that awaited him.

00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:46.644
His body was still cut into four pieces and was sent to different corners

00:08:46.674 --> 00:08:54.114
of the country as a warning of what happens to anyone who commits treason against the King.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:02.065
After the rest of the gang was found and they were executed, King

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:08.635
James declared that November the Fifth was to be a celebration of his survival.

00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:17.485
And it was actually illegal not to celebrate November the Fifth until 1959.

00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:22.375
For almost 400 years you legally had to celebrate it.

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:30.089
So that is the story of Guy Fawkes, but there are a

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:35.039
few interesting things that are worth adding to this little story.

00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:38.871
Firstly, there is quite an interesting

00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:42.621
conspiracy theory about what actually happened.

00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:49.651
Some people believe that it was actually a deep state set-up.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:57.511
That someone within the circle of King James had enlisted the Catholic gang to

00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:02.841
blow up the King, but they knew that they would be stopped before they did it.

00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:11.009
So it was only an excuse to blame the Catholics so that the King could have an

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:18.870
excuse to be even tougher on the local Catholic population, which he then was.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:24.676
Although this theory is quite enticing, there are quite a few

00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:29.656
problems with it, and most serious historians have discredited it.

00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:38.490
Secondly, this story has left a lasting linguistic mark on the English language.

00:10:39.653 --> 00:10:42.833
You probably know the word guy, like

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:46.803
he's a nice guy, or have you seen that guy over there?

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:54.209
What you probably don't know though is that this word comes from Guy Fawkes.

00:10:54.889 --> 00:11:02.299
It originally meant someone who was poorly dressed, but now it's just a generic term for a person.

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:12.099
So next time you say the word guy or someone calls you a guy, says Hey guys, or

00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:18.444
whatever, you'll know that this comes from probably Britain's most famous terrorist.

00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:24.070
And for those of you who have spent much time in Britain,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.960
you probably know that there are lots of slightly strange traditions.

00:11:29.887 --> 00:11:31.807
Keeping a tradition, no matter

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:37.027
how weird, is something that seems to be quintessentially British.

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:41.967
And so it should come as no surprise to you Alastair Budge:

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:46.567
that there are some weird traditions that still apply to November the Fifth.

00:11:48.357 --> 00:11:51.806
Firstly, the Houses of Parliament are still

00:11:51.806 --> 00:11:58.436
searched by guards before the state opening, before they are opened by the King or Queen.

00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:06.356
The logic behind this is that they are looking for a modern day Guy Fawkes

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:11.082
hiding in the cellars with his barrels full of explosives.

00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:14.052
Although of course now it's just tradition.

00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:20.951
Secondly, there is only one place in the UK where November the

00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:27.611
Fifth is not celebrated, and I'd be very impressed if you can guess where it is.

00:12:29.484 --> 00:12:36.259
It is at a school called St Peter's in York, which is Guy Fawkes' is old school.

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:41.959
The school says that it refuses to burn one of its own

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:45.589
students, which I think is actually quite loyal of them.

00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:54.649
While all of these things are interesting and fun, one thing that I think is even more interesting

00:12:54.649 --> 00:13:00.731
to think about is how the perception of Guy Fawkes has changed over time.

00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:06.930
The real Guy Fawkes, as we know, tried to commit

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.430
what would have been the biggest terrorist attack in British history.

00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:16.089
And no matter what your religious or political beliefs

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:21.368
are, blowing up parliament and the monarch and thousands of

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:27.728
people would most definitely classify as a pretty nasty terrorist attack.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:36.871
Yet he has morphed, Guy Fawkes has changed into this sort of aspirational,

00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:44.770
anti-establishment figure and is associated with general rebellion and anarchy.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:52.050
So the hackers group Anonymous wear these Guy Fawkes masks,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.590
as did the Occupy Wall Street movement.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.420
But of course they would never dream of wearing masks of

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.230
other kinds of terrorists, Osama Bin Laden, for example.

00:14:05.114 --> 00:14:09.674
Part of this is of course, due to the fact that the attack

00:14:09.674 --> 00:14:14.594
failed, that Guy Fawkes never actually managed to blow up parliament.

00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:18.023
And it's partly due to the fact that it

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:22.913
happened so long ago and we can disassociate ourselves from it.

00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:30.113
And partly it's that these events have been romanticised by things

00:14:30.113 --> 00:14:36.443
like the book and film V for Vendetta, which is loosely based on the

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:42.473
Guy Fawkes story and is where the design for the masks come from.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:50.648
In any case, it's pretty interesting to think how people's perception of someone changes,

00:14:51.068 --> 00:14:58.778
how someone who shortly after the event was considered a terrible terrorist and enemy of

00:14:58.778 --> 00:15:07.930
the people, now 400 years later is a sort of anti-establishment icon, a hero

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:15.025
struggling against the system, even if that really wasn't how people thought of him at the time.

00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:21.654
But whatever you may think of Guy Fawkes, and how people now think of

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:29.699
Guy Fawkes, the events of November the Fifth 1605 have had a profound impact on British

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:35.527
culture and November the Fifth is a pretty fun celebration in the UK.

00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:40.957
So if you are in the UK on November the Fifth make sure you

00:15:40.957 --> 00:15:47.197
go to bonfire night, at least now you'll know the story behind why there is

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:52.927
a man being burned on a big fire and lots of people setting off fireworks.

00:15:55.003 --> 00:15:58.813
Okay then that is it for today's episode.

Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:16.052
Leonardo English, Alastair Budge: the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and

00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:22.622
learn weird and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:29.657
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to tell the story of Guy Fawkes,

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:35.087
Alastair Budge: the man who almost managed to blow up the British parliament.

00:00:36.257 --> 00:00:41.807
Before we do that though, let me just quickly remind you that you can grab a copy of the

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:48.747
transcript and key vocabulary for this episode over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:54.662
Alastair Budge: The transcript is super helpful for following along with every word and the

00:00:54.662 --> 00:01:01.832
key vocabulary helps you build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:06.722
So that is definitely worth checking out if you haven't done so already.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:13.543
Alastair Budge: Okay then, let's talk about gunpowder, treason and plot.

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:19.043
Alastair Budge: On November the Fifth every year in the UK,

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:24.453
there is a celebration called bonfire night, Guy Fawkes night.

00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:28.808
Alastair Budge: Up and down the country this evening is

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:34.328
celebrated with people making a huge fire, a bonfire.

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:44.953
Alastair Budge: On top of that fire is placed an effigy, a fake copy of a man called the guy.

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:50.062
Alastair Budge: And then there's normally a big fireworks display.

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:58.868
Alastair Budge: This is a tradition that stretches back over 400 years now, to November

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:06.913
1605, Alastair Budge: to an event that nearly changed the fate of British history forever.

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:11.253
Alastair Budge: Before we go into exactly what happened, Alastair Budge:

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:16.293
let me just paint a picture of the situation in Britain at that time.

00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:23.573
On the throne was a man called King James the First.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:29.740
Alastair Budge: He had inherited the throne from his mother, Queen Elizabeth the First

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.682
who was a Protestant, and she had fiercely Alastair Budge: persecuted Alastair Budge:

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:43.752
the British Catholic population for almost the entirety of her 45 year reign.

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:49.440
Alastair Budge: When James the First took over the throne Alastair Budge: the Catholic

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.261
population thought he might be a little kinder to them, Alastair Budge: and that they would

00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:01.833
finally be allowed to Alastair Budge: do things like practice their religion in the open.

00:03:03.138 --> 00:03:06.616
Alastair Budge: However, this was not to be the case, Alastair Budge:

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:12.459
and Catholics continued to be persecuted by the new King James.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:19.656
Alastair Budge: So a group of them decided to take matters into their own hands.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.177
Alastair Budge: A group of activists, I guess we could call them,

00:03:24.717 --> 00:03:28.221
Alastair Budge: activists, led by a man named Robert Alastair Budge:

00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:32.723
Catesby Alastair Budge: got together Alastair Budge: and formed a plot.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:40.457
They plan to sneak under the Houses of Parliament, to Alastair Budge: sneak

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:44.747
their way into the Houses of Parliament, where the British government meets.

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:49.087
Alastair Budge: And on the day that King James would officially

00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:53.857
open parliament, Alastair Budge: they would blow it all up.

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:59.403
Alastair Budge: The plot was meticulously planned, it was very carefully planned.

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:09.993
The men managed to smuggle over two tonnes of explosives into a cellar below parliament.

00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:15.575
Alastair Budge: This was 36 barrels full of explosives.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.350
They were ready to go.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.030
All they needed was for the day to arrive, for the King to come, then they would light a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.740
match and boom, the entire building would be blown to smithereens, completely blown up.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.830
The King and everyone inside the building would be killed instantly.

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:45.467
Alastair Budge: Then they could install a new Catholic monarch on

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:51.377
the throne, and of course, British history would be changed forever.

00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:55.997
However, it wasn't to be.

00:04:57.017 --> 00:05:01.637
Shortly before the King was scheduled to open the Houses of Parliament

00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:07.800
Alastair Budge: an anonymous letter was sent to a man named William Parker, the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.400
fourth Baron Monteagle, and it warned him to avoid the building on that day.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.620
Now, William Parker was a Catholic and he reported this letter to the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.346
authorities Alastair Budge: saying that he feared there was a plot

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:30.916
of some sort, that there was going to be an attack on the building.

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:37.403
So Alastair Budge: in the early hours of November the Fifth Alastair Budge:

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:42.339
the building was searched and a man was found in the cellar.

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:48.789
He was ready with enough dynamite, enough explosives Alastair Budge: to blow the

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:55.299
entire building up Alastair Budge: and destroy everything within a 40 metre radius.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.319
And that man was Guy Fawkes.

00:06:01.698 --> 00:06:06.348
Alastair Budge: Although some people mistakenly think that he was Spanish or

00:06:06.348 --> 00:06:12.618
Italian because he signed his name "Guido Fawkes", he was actually an Englishman.

00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:18.054
Alastair Budge: He was born in York, in the North of England, in 1570.

00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:27.345
Alastair Budge: He was born a Protestant, but he converted to Catholicism when he was a teenager.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:35.385
And he spent quite a lot of time fighting in Europe with the Spanish Catholic army

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.112
Alastair Budge: and gained a reputation for being smart and good with explosives.

00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:48.992
Alastair Budge: And it was during his time fighting in Europe that he met some

00:06:49.322 --> 00:06:56.260
fellow Englishman who longed to rid Britain of its Protestant King, Alastair Budge:

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.165
and they invited Guy, or Guido, Alastair Budge: they invited him in to their plot.

00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:10.266
Alastair Budge: However, in the early hours of November the Fifth 1605,

00:07:10.912 --> 00:07:14.574
Alastair Budge: Guy was captured Alastair Budge: just in the nick of time.

00:07:15.896 --> 00:07:20.276
Alastair Budge: He was unable to light the fuse to blow up the explosives,

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:25.693
Alastair Budge: and he was taken to the Tower of London where he was interrogated.

00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:35.193
Finally, after repeated days of torture, he revealed the names of his

00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:40.575
conspirators Alastair Budge: most of whom were captured by the King's troops.

00:07:41.912 --> 00:07:44.431
Alastair Budge: The punishment for attempted murder

00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:49.566
of the King was, as you'd expect, pretty serious.

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:54.816
This was what was called high treason, and the

00:07:54.816 --> 00:08:00.186
punishment for that was being hung, drawn, and quartered.

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:04.236
Now this is obviously pretty nasty.

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:08.136
It involved being hung by your neck.

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:15.426
Then they would cut open your stomach and eventually cut you into four pieces.

00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:19.986
Really something you want to avoid if you can possibly avoid it.

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:28.026
Luckily, I guess sort of luckily for Guy Fawkes, he managed to throw

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:34.686
himself off the platform just before he was going to be hung, so he broke

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:39.966
his neck and died before this horribly painful death that awaited him.

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:48.679
Alastair Budge: His body was still cut into four pieces and was sent to different corners

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:56.149
of the country as a warning of what happens to anyone who commits treason against the King.

00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:04.100
Alastair Budge: After the rest of the gang was found and they were executed, King

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:10.670
James declared that November the Fifth was to be a celebration of his survival.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:19.520
Alastair Budge: And it was actually illegal not to celebrate November the Fifth until 1959.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.410
For almost 400 years you legally had to celebrate it.

00:09:27.164 --> 00:09:32.124
Alastair Budge: So that is the story of Guy Fawkes, but there are a

00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:37.074
few interesting things that are worth adding to this little story.

00:09:38.326 --> 00:09:40.906
Alastair Budge: Firstly, there is quite an interesting

00:09:41.086 --> 00:09:44.656
conspiracy theory about what actually happened.

00:09:45.976 --> 00:09:51.076
Some people believe that it was actually the 16th century

00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:54.361
equivalent of a Alastair Budge: deep state set-up.

00:09:54.841 --> 00:10:02.221
That someone within the circle of King James had enlisted the Catholic gang to

00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:07.551
blow up the King, but they knew that they would be stopped before they did it.

00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:15.719
So Alastair Budge: it was only an excuse to blame the Catholics so that the King could have an

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:23.579
excuse to be even tougher on the Alastair Budge: local Catholic population, which he then was.

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:29.385
Alastair Budge: Although this theory is quite enticing, there are quite a few

00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:34.365
problems with it, Alastair Budge: and most serious historians have discredited it.

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:43.200
Alastair Budge: Secondly, this story has left a lasting linguistic mark on the English language.

00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:47.543
Alastair Budge: You probably know the word guy, like

00:10:47.873 --> 00:10:51.513
he's a nice guy, or have you seen that guy over there?

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:58.919
Alastair Budge: What you probably don't know though is that this word comes from Guy Fawkes.

00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:07.009
It originally meant someone who was poorly dressed, but now it's just a generic term for a person.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:16.809
So next time you say the word guy or someone calls you a guy, says Hey guys, or

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:23.154
whatever, you'll know that this comes from probably Britain's most famous terrorist.

00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:28.780
Alastair Budge: And for those of you who have spent much time in Britain,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.670
you probably know that there are lots of slightly strange traditions.

00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:36.517
Alastair Budge: Keeping a tradition, Alastair Budge: no matter

00:11:36.517 --> 00:11:41.737
how weird, is something that seems to be quintessentially British.

00:11:43.096 --> 00:11:46.677
Alastair Budge: And so it should come as no surprise to you Alastair Budge:

00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:51.277
that there are some weird traditions that still apply to November the Fifth.

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:56.515
Alastair Budge: Firstly, Alastair Budge: the Houses of Parliament Alastair Budge: are still

00:11:56.515 --> 00:12:03.145
searched by guards before the state opening, before they are opened by the King or Queen.

00:12:04.885 --> 00:12:11.065
The logic behind this is that they are looking for a modern day Guy Fawkes

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:15.792
hiding in the cellars with his Alastair Budge: barrels full of explosives.

00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:18.762
Although of course now it's just tradition.

00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:25.661
Alastair Budge: Secondly, there is only one place in the UK where November the

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:32.321
Fifth is not celebrated, and I'd be very impressed if you can guess where it is.

00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:40.968
Alastair Budge: It is at a school called St Peter's in York, which is Guy Fawkes' is old school.

00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:46.668
The school says that it refuses to burn one of its own

00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:50.298
students, which I think is actually quite loyal of them.

00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:59.358
While all of these things are interesting and fun, one thing that I think is even more interesting

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:05.440
to think about is Alastair Budge: how the perception of Guy Fawkes has changed over time.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.640
The real Guy Fawkes, as we know, Alastair Budge: tried to commit

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.140
what would have been the biggest terrorist attack in British history.

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:20.799
Alastair Budge: And no matter what your religious or political beliefs

00:13:20.859 --> 00:13:26.078
are, blowing up parliament Alastair Budge: and the monarch and thousands of

00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:32.438
people would most definitely classify as a pretty nasty terrorist attack.

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:41.580
Alastair Budge: Yet he has morphed, Guy Fawkes has changed into this sort of aspirational,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:49.480
anti-establishment figure and is associated with Alastair Budge: general rebellion and anarchy.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.760
So the hackers group Anonymous wear these Guy Fawkes masks,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.300
Alastair Budge: as did the Occupy Wall Street movement.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.130
But of course they would never dream of wearing masks of

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.940
other kinds of terrorists, Osama Bin Laden, for example.

00:14:09.824 --> 00:14:14.384
Alastair Budge: Part of this is of course, due to the fact that the attack

00:14:14.384 --> 00:14:19.304
failed, that Guy Fawkes never actually managed to blow up parliament.

00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:22.733
Alastair Budge: And it's partly due to the fact that it

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:27.623
happened so long ago and we can disassociate ourselves from it.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:34.823
And partly it's that these events have been romanticised by things

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:41.153
like the book and film V for Vendetta, which is loosely based on the

00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:47.183
Guy Fawkes story and is where the design for the masks come from.

00:14:48.968 --> 00:14:55.358
In any case, it's pretty interesting to think how people's perception of someone changes,

00:14:55.778 --> 00:15:03.488
how someone who shortly after the event was considered a terrible terrorist and enemy of

00:15:03.488 --> 00:15:12.640
the people, now 400 years later is a sort of Alastair Budge: anti-establishment icon, a hero

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:19.735
struggling against the system, even if that really wasn't how people thought of him at the time.

00:15:21.414 --> 00:15:26.364
Alastair Budge: But whatever you may think of Guy Fawkes, and how people now think of

00:15:26.364 --> 00:15:34.409
Guy Fawkes, the events of November the Fifth 1605 have had a profound impact on British

00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:40.237
culture Alastair Budge: and November the Fifth is a pretty fun celebration in the UK.

00:15:41.377 --> 00:15:45.667
So if you are in the UK on November the Fifth Alastair Budge: make sure you

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:51.907
go to bonfire night, at least now you'll know the story behind why there is

00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:57.637
a man being burned on a big fire and lots of people setting off fireworks.

00:15:59.713 --> 00:16:03.523
Alastair Budge: Okay then that is it for today's episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:16.446
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:20.716
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:26.546
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Britain’s most

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:32.709
famous hangman, Britain’s most famous executioner, a man called Albert Pierrepoint.

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:39.326
We’ll talk about how one actually becomes an executioner, what it took, and the road Pierrepoint

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:45.226
took to this most unusual of jobs, we’ll look at what he actually did, and we’ll try to get a

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:52.006
sense of what motivated him, what did he really think, and where did he see his place in society.

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:58.176
I should warn you that there is a lot of death in this episode, it is about Britain’s

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:03.106
most famous executioner after all, but it is a fascinating story nonetheless.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:05.822
Ok then.

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:07.052
Albert Pierrepoint.

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:13.482
Children have all sorts of dreams about what they want to do when they grow up.

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:19.942
Doctors, teachers, nurses, film stars, football players, astronauts.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:24.942
Albert Pierrepoint, on the other hand, always wanted to be an executioner.

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:30.592
Indeed, when he was just 11 years old, Albert wrote in a school essay,

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:35.062
“When I leave school, I should like to be the Official Executioner.”

00:01:36.372 --> 00:01:42.162
His father was an executioner, his uncle was an executioner, and sure enough young

00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:46.955
Albert Pierrepoint would go on to achieve his dream, becoming the country’s most

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:53.365
famous executioner, and being responsible for the executions of up to 600 people.

00:01:54.465 --> 00:02:02.965
When Henry Pierrepoint died in 1922, his 17-year-old son, Albert, received two blue diaries.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:08.005
Were they his memoirs, his reflections on life, love

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.185
letters to his wife, or a great unpublished novel?

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:12.705
They were not.

00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:17.335
The diaries contained information on every single one

00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:21.705
of the 105 executions that Henry Pierrepoint had done.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:27.922
At the time, at the turn of the 20th century this is, the UK still had

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:32.866
capital punishment, where the most serious of crimes are punished by death.

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:39.366
And the most common method of capital punishment in the UK was hanging.

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:46.406
This involved putting a rope, otherwise known as a noose, around someone’s neck and

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:51.414
hanging them from a tall wooden frame, which was technically called a “gallows”.

00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:58.706
In these blue diaries, Pierrepoint's father, Henry Pierrepoint, described in detail

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:04.676
how to hang people and the best way to do it, a sort of executioner’s cheat sheet.

00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:09.726
Now, this might not sound like the sort of thing you or I would be keen

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:15.637
on reading, but this 17-year-old boy, Albert Pierrepoint, was fascinated.

00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:20.616
It would spur him on, encourage him even more, to follow in

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:24.266
his father and uncle’s footsteps and become an executioner.

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:30.796
And sure enough, ten years later, in 1932 he made his first

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:34.996
move, and he got a position as an assistant executioner.

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:40.386
Now, it’s worth spending a minute to talk about the role of the executioner,

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:44.766
as understanding this can help us understand Albert Pierrepoint.

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:51.316
Given that executions were relatively rare, it wasn’t a full-time job.

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:56.836
You would apply for it, you’d be offered a position on an official list,

00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:01.716
given some basic training, and when there was a prisoner that the court

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:06.236
had decided to be executed, you’d be called up and paid for your time.

00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:11.446
So, if you were the sort of person who didn’t mind doing it, it was actually

00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:16.346
quite a good way to earn a bit of money on the side, alongside your main job.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.050
As an assistant executioner, young Albert Pierrepoint’s

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.630
role was to watch and help the official executioner.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.520
Sometimes he worked with his uncle Thomas, who taught him

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.660
some of the most important things to do when hanging someone.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.190
And while we are going to try to avoid too many graphic descriptions here, the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.909
one thing to stress is that the role of the executioner, as Pierrepoint would

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:48.769
later go on to explain to anyone who asked, was mainly about professionalism.

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.949
You needed to tie the knots in the right way, behave as a professional, and

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.359
never let your emotions get in the way of the job that needed to be done.

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:05.269
After all, your job was to take someone’s life on behalf of the British state.

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.979
Disappointingly for Albert Pierrepoint, but probably not so disappointing for everyone

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.219
else, executions were rare in the 1930s, in that there weren’t very many of them.

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.439
So, while this was good news for the prisoners, it wasn’t that great for the

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.459
enthusiastic young executioner who wanted to start his career as soon as possible.

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:33.319
He would have to wait, and he spent most of the 1930s working in the

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.199
grocery business, and assisting his uncle whenever the opportunity arose.

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.449
Finally, in 1941, Pierrepoint was able to hang, to

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:48.759
execute, his very first criminal, as “lead” executioner.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:56.759
The man was Antonio Mancini - not the famous painter, but a London gangster of the same name.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:02.119
Mancini had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.389
On the day of the hanging, Pierrepoint did everything that he was supposed to do.

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.659
Mancini seemed to appreciate the young executioner’s professionalism, and Pierrepoint would later

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:21.569
recount that Mancini’s last words were “Cheerio”, which is a very English way of saying goodbye.

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.209
After that, things went quiet again, and Pierrepoint didn’t have many executions.

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.979
However, everything changed after the Second World War, and the high number

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.139
of war criminals that had been sentenced to death provided Pierrepoint with

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.609
plenty of work, and plenty of opportunities to make a name for himself.

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:47.089
In fact, during the decades that followed the Second World

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:52.089
War, Pierrepoint would go on to hang around 200 war criminals.

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:58.109
Most of them were Nazis, either Germans or British Nazi sympathisers.

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.209
One of Pierrepoint's most famous executions was the Nazi prison

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.165
guard Irma Grese, also known as “The Hyena of Auschwitz.”

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:15.045
Irma Grese was only 22 years old and one of the only three female guards to be sentenced to death.

00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:19.975
Now, while Pierrepoint was insistent that the hardest thing

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:24.235
about being an executioner was maintaining a cool head and being

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:28.605
professional, getting it right was actually harder than you might think.

00:07:29.785 --> 00:07:34.865
At the time in Britain the preferred method of hanging was something called the long drop.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:41.195
I'm afraid that to describe this skill I'm going to have to go into some grisly detail,

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:46.035
so if you don't want to hear this, you should probably skip ahead a couple of minutes.

00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:51.515
Okay, so you might think that hanging someone is simple,

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:54.925
you just put a rope around their neck and the job is done.

00:07:55.915 --> 00:07:58.245
It’s actually a bit more complicated than this.

00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:02.965
This long-drop method that Pierrepoint needed to use

00:08:03.135 --> 00:08:06.399
was introduced in England around the early 1870s.

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:12.675
This method allowed the prisoner to “drop” and then be brought up quickly by the rope.

00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:18.025
This resulted in a faster and less painful death as the drop was

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:22.265
usually accurately measured according to the person’s height and weight.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:27.645
The problem was that the length of the rope needed to be exactly right.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:33.685
Too short and the prisoner’s neck wouldn’t break, and they would suffer a longer death.

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:40.805
Too long and there was the risk of decapitation, of the head actually separating from the body.

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:46.355
I apologise for the detail here, but the point to reiterate is that

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:51.362
it was far from an unskilled job, and Pierrepoint was very good at it.

00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:56.558
So good, in fact, that he became the top hangman in the country,

00:08:56.838 --> 00:09:00.288
and was called upon for all of the most famous executions.

00:09:01.868 --> 00:09:05.188
One of the problems for Pierrepoint, however, was that he soon ran

00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:09.458
out of war criminals to hang, so he was forced to get another job.

00:09:10.748 --> 00:09:14.318
This job involved beer, a bar and customers.

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.348
He became a pub landlord.

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:23.888
It seems, however, that this career choice was made to fit in with his real passion for execution.

00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:30.698
When he was asked about his new role as a pub landlord, Pierrepoint replied, “I wanted

00:09:30.698 --> 00:09:35.278
to run my own business so that I should be under no obligation when I took time off.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.988
... I could take a three o'clock plane from Dublin after conducting an

00:09:38.988 --> 00:09:43.698
execution there and be opening my bar without comment at half-past five.”

00:09:44.998 --> 00:09:48.978
So, what was it about Pierrepoint that made him so good at his job?

00:09:50.118 --> 00:09:56.418
Some say that he built a reputation for being fast, relaxed, and efficient during his hangings.

00:09:57.148 --> 00:10:00.718
He was also very good at making sure that the noose was the correct

00:10:00.718 --> 00:10:04.848
size so that the prisoner had a quick and somewhat painless death.

00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:10.638
He was compassionate; in that, he was nice to the people he was about to hang.

00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:14.888
“You mustn’t get involved in whatever crime they’ve committed,” he once said.

00:10:15.578 --> 00:10:17.098
“The person has to die.

00:10:17.248 --> 00:10:20.768
You’ve got to treat them with as much respect and dignity as you can.

00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:22.758
They’re walking into the unknown.

00:10:23.148 --> 00:10:27.438
And anyone who’s walking into the unknown, well I’ll take my hat off to them.”

00:10:28.718 --> 00:10:34.908
All of this led to historians calling him a “modern hangman”, a hangman that was kind and gentle.

00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:39.808
Now, it might be difficult for you or me to imagine that someone who

00:10:39.828 --> 00:10:44.688
chooses “executioner” as their career would be known as a kind and

00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:49.738
gentle person, but he was, reportedly, a very kind and gentle soul.

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:55.898
After polishing off, after executing, around 200 Nazis, he was

00:10:55.898 --> 00:10:59.988
frequently called upon to execute Britain’s most notorious criminals.

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:05.168
One such criminal was a serial killer called John Haigh.

00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:08.568
Haigh was known as the Acid Bath Murderer.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:13.538
He murdered nine people and dissolved their bodies in acid before

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:18.058
being caught, sentenced to death and hung by Pierrepoint in 1949.

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:22.768
Then, a year later, Pierrepoint was called upon for another

00:11:22.768 --> 00:11:26.678
hanging, this time of one of the customers at his pub.

00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:30.808
It was a man called James Corbitt, who had been

00:11:30.808 --> 00:11:34.278
sentenced to death for murdering his mistress, his lover.

00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:39.978
Pierrepoint and Corbitt weren’t close friends, as such, but they would chat

00:11:40.008 --> 00:11:44.188
and sing at the pub together, and they even had nicknames for each other.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:49.155
Pierrepoint called Corbitt “Tish” and Corbitt called him “Tosh”.

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:54.308
When it came to the execution, Pierrepoint was his usual

00:11:54.468 --> 00:11:57.678
consummate professional, his normal true professional.

00:11:58.688 --> 00:12:04.558
As Pierrepoint put the noose around his neck, Corbitt said “Hallo, Tosh”, to which

00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:10.608
Pierrepoint replied “Hallo Tish, how are you?”, before executing the man seconds later.

00:12:11.978 --> 00:12:16.888
This all adds to the image of Pierrepoint being an ordinary man, a pub

00:12:16.908 --> 00:12:20.958
landlord who simply happened to be the country’s most famous executioner.

00:12:22.048 --> 00:12:26.498
However, being an “ordinary kind man” sometimes worked against him.

00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:33.198
People thought it was strange that such a kind and gentle person made money from hanging people.

00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:38.488
They thought that somewhere deep down there was a monster, that a man who was

00:12:38.498 --> 00:12:42.838
ultimately responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people, no matter whether

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:47.658
these people were criminals themselves, that this sort of person must be truly evil.

00:12:48.978 --> 00:12:52.468
And, although Pierrepoint clearly did believe that he was simply

00:12:52.488 --> 00:12:56.158
doing a job, it’s clear that he did struggle with this himself.

00:12:57.698 --> 00:13:02.968
This was particularly true when it came to the more controversial hangings that he carried out.

00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:07.598
Not long after hanging his customer, James Corbitt, in

00:13:07.608 --> 00:13:11.518
1950, Pierrepoint hanged a man called Timothy Evans.

00:13:12.398 --> 00:13:18.238
Now, this is a rather sad story but also a very important one because it eventually

00:13:18.238 --> 00:13:22.828
became one of the reasons why the death penalty was made illegal in the UK.

00:13:24.198 --> 00:13:29.238
Timothy Evans was 25 years old but had the mental age of a ten-year-old.

00:13:30.448 --> 00:13:34.058
When Evans’ wife and daughter were found murdered, Evans

00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:37.468
was accused, found guilty and hanged by Pierrepoint.

00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:42.708
But three years later, Timothy Evans’ landlord, John

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:45.878
Christie, was arrested for the murder of several women.

00:13:46.998 --> 00:13:52.471
The women’s bodies were all found in his house, on the same street as the one he rented to Evans.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:57.231
After he was arrested, John Christie admitted to murdering

00:13:57.231 --> 00:14:00.191
Timothy Evans’s wife, as well as many other women.

00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:06.811
He met the same fate as Timothy Evans - he was executed by Pierrepoint, but it did little

00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:11.561
to make up for the fact that Pierrepoint had been responsible for the execution of not

00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:17.181
just an innocent man, but an innocent man without the mental ability to defend himself.

00:14:18.141 --> 00:14:21.511
Now, of course this wasn’t the first time that someone had been

00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:25.701
executed for a crime they didn’t commit, and it wouldn’t be the last.

00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:30.361
But it was a very high profile case, and brought the role

00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:33.371
of the death penalty further into question in the UK.

00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:41.361
In 1953, Pierrepoint also executed a 19-year-old man called Derek Bentley, and

00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:46.121
this is particularly interesting because it involves a linguistic misunderstanding.

00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:53.501
Bentley was arrested during a burglary along with his 16-year-old friend, Christopher Craig.

00:14:54.921 --> 00:15:00.561
At first, the police struggled to arrest the teenage pair because they kept running away and hiding.

00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:05.431
Craig, the younger of the boys, was also trying to scare

00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:07.531
the police with a gun that he had brought with him.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:12.851
When the police told Craig to put down the gun, he refused.

00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:19.521
Bentley, the 19-year-old then reportedly said, “Let him have it, Chris”.

00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:25.251
The younger boy then pulled the trigger, shot one policeman in the shoulder,

00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:30.211
and when another policeman arrived, Craig shot one of the policemen dead.

00:15:31.351 --> 00:15:37.831
Now, this case, and ultimately the execution of the 19-year-old Bentley, all hinged

00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:44.351
upon, it relied upon, what Bentley actually meant when he said “Let him have it, Chris”.

00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:48.671
Did he mean give him the gun, literally “let him have

00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:52.661
the gun”, or was he speaking in more colloquial terms?

00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:58.621
Colloquially, “to let someone have it” can mean to shoot them or to attack them.

00:15:59.971 --> 00:16:05.201
Ultimately, the judge decided that Bentley told his friend to shoot the policeman, he was

00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:10.011
found guilty, sentenced to death, and it was Pierrepoint who carried out the execution.

00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:15.311
His friend, the 16-year-old Craig, was under 18, and

00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:18.991
consequently was sentenced to life imprisonment instead.

00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:24.011
Just like with Timothy Evans, the case was very controversial.

00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:30.041
Firstly, Bentley hadn’t actually pulled the trigger, and it wasn’t clear

00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:34.071
whether he was telling his friend to put down the gun or to shoot the policeman.

00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:40.141
And secondly, like Timothy Evans, Bentley had a reduced mental capacity.

00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:42.553
He had the mental age of a 10-year-old.

00:16:44.363 --> 00:16:47.271
This wouldn’t be Pierrepoint’s last controversial hanging.

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:51.781
In 1955, Pierrepoint was the hangman in the case of

00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:54.829
the last woman to be executed in the United Kingdom.

00:16:56.111 --> 00:17:01.791
Her name was Ruth Ellis, and she was sentenced to death for murdering her abusive lover.

00:17:02.971 --> 00:17:06.891
The case attracted attention all over the country with many

00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:10.031
people writing to the government to try and stop the hanging.

00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:16.597
It didn’t work, but Ruth Ellis would be the last woman to be hanged in Britain.

00:17:17.182 --> 00:17:18.402
Things were changing…

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.552
Two weeks after hanging Ruth Ellis, although he didn’t know

00:17:23.552 --> 00:17:27.572
it at the time, Pierrepoint would conduct his last execution.

00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:33.572
He was scheduled to conduct another one in January of 1956, but the

00:17:33.572 --> 00:17:37.698
prisoner was granted a last minute reprieve, they were not hanged.

00:17:38.972 --> 00:17:45.672
And after this, after a career executing up to 600 prisoners, Pierrepoint retired.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.902
Many people said that it was because he didn’t agree with the

00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:54.472
execution of Ruth Ellis, but he later said that this was not true.

00:17:55.762 --> 00:17:58.712
Others speculate it was because his travel costs

00:17:58.832 --> 00:18:02.232
weren’t paid fully after the planned hanging in January.

00:18:02.992 --> 00:18:07.492
Or perhaps he had simply had enough, after 25 years of

00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:12.662
the job and 600 satisfied, or rather unsatisfied, clients.

00:18:13.782 --> 00:18:17.162
In any case, just a few years after Pierrepoint retired,

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:21.803
in 1965 capital punishment was made illegal in the UK.

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:27.075
After retiring, Pierrepoint moved to the seaside with his wife, and

00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:32.345
published his autobiography, aptly titled “Executioner: Pierrepoint”.

00:18:33.635 --> 00:18:37.915
This book really is our best clue into how Albert Pierrepoint the

00:18:37.915 --> 00:18:41.545
man felt about the job he had dedicated most of his life to doing.

00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:47.155
Perhaps surprisingly, Pierrepoint revealed that he didn’t believe

00:18:47.155 --> 00:18:51.965
that capital punishment worked, writing “it is said to be a deterrent.

00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:53.365
I cannot agree.

00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:56.975
There have been murders since the beginning of time, and we

00:18:56.975 --> 00:18:59.755
shall go on looking for deterrents until the end of time.”

00:19:00.685 --> 00:19:03.985
He may have changed his mind about this shortly after, though.

00:19:04.415 --> 00:19:08.805
He was reportedly concerned about the rising crime rate in the UK and

00:19:08.805 --> 00:19:12.905
said that maybe capital punishment would be the only way to solve it.

00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:18.815
Fortunately it had been banned, though, and Pierrepoint was never called upon again.

00:19:19.995 --> 00:19:26.265
He lived out the rest of his life as a pub landlord, quiet, silent about his previous life.

00:19:27.385 --> 00:19:32.005
Indeed, most of the customers at his pub had no idea that the man who was

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:36.385
now pouring their drinks had spent most of his life executing criminals.

00:19:37.255 --> 00:19:44.185
And, in 1992, at the ripe old age of 87, he died, of natural causes I should add.

00:19:45.395 --> 00:19:49.885
Ever since, people have tried to get under the skin of Albert Pierrepoint,

00:19:50.025 --> 00:19:54.585
they have tried to understand what being the country’s most famous executioner

00:19:54.835 --> 00:19:59.325
does to a person, and tried to figure out the real Albert Pierrepoint.

00:20:00.455 --> 00:20:06.485
There are books, TV series and radio shows, and–perhaps most famously–an

00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:12.065
excellent 2005 film that explores the sense of guilt that Albert Pierrepoint felt.

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:18.945
Clearly, no matter whether you believe that you are simply carrying out the law, it’s hard to

00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:24.135
believe that being present at the deaths of 600 prisoners does not have an effect on a person.

00:20:25.035 --> 00:20:30.955
Was Pierrepoint haunted by his role, or did he simply believe he was doing a job like any other?

00:20:32.355 --> 00:20:36.785
We will never know for sure, but it seems that Pierrepoint had a rare

00:20:36.845 --> 00:20:42.195
talent, if indeed one can call it a talent, for completely shutting off his

00:20:42.195 --> 00:20:47.075
emotions and putting up a wall between himself and the job he was paid to do.

00:20:48.445 --> 00:20:53.775
If it is a talent, it’s a talent that is fortunately no longer needed, but it is one that

00:20:53.775 --> 00:21:00.025
certainly comes in useful when your boyhood dream is to become Britain’s Most Famous Executioner.

00:21:01.715 --> 00:21:06.305
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Albert Pierrepoint.

00:21:06.775 --> 00:21:11.565
I know it isn’t the most pleasant and uplifting of subjects, but it is interesting to

00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:17.315
try to understand this man’s motivations, and to see how he saw his role in the world.

00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:21.495
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:21.915 --> 00:21:25.225
Do you think that Pierrepoint felt regret for his life choices?

00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:28.865
Do you think that someone who is responsible for the executions

00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:33.025
of so many people can ever be completely innocent of their deaths?

00:21:33.935 --> 00:21:36.485
If you live in a country where capital punishment is

00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:40.015
still legal, is there a strong movement to abolish it?

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:43.965
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

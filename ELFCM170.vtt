Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.899
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.459
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.539
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Scientology, the controversial

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:35.299
belief system founded by a science fiction writer that, to its followers, is a compelling way of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:42.009
understanding the world and connecting with your inner self, and to its critics is a dangerous cult.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.669
This is part two of a mini-series.

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.319
Part one was on Mormonism, another religion that has been labelled a dangerous cult, and

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:56.879
in part three we are going to come back and look at Scientology and Mormonism together,

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.959
and discuss what questions they raise about religion, and what makes us believe anything.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.679
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.769
a member of Leonardo English and follow along with the subtitles, the transcript

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.719
and its key vocabulary over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.579
Membership of Leonardo English gives you access to all of our learning materials, all of

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.099
our bonus episodes, so that’s more than 170 different episodes now, including part one

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:37.639
and part three of this mini-series, as well as two new ones every week, plus access to

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:43.689
our awesome private community where we do live events, challenges, and much, much more.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.699
Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:54.759
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.109
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.129
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.376
OK then, Scientology.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:14.989
The story of scientology is inseparable from the story of its iconic but

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:21.009
controversial founder, Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, otherwise known as L.Ron Hubbard.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.469
Now, I should start by saying that there isn’t universal agreement about the life of

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:33.879
L.Ron Hubbard, and one of the criticisms of Scientology is that his achievements have

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.939
been exaggerated by the church to make him seem far more impressive than he actually was.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.629
Naturally, where there are disagreements I’ll point these out, but it is hard to deny

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:53.979
that the life of L.Ron Hubbard was varied and full of excitements of different kinds.

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.019
He was born in 1911 in Nebraska, in the US midwest.

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:06.609
As a young boy he didn’t seem to excel at anything in particular, he wasn't good at

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:14.019
anything in particular, and he failed at his first attempt to get a place in the US Navy.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.889
He won a place to study civil engineering at George Washington University,

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.499
and would later claim that he was on track to become a nuclear physicist.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.469
But his university records suggest otherwise; he received poor

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.059
grades, and wasn’t considered to be a talented student by any means.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.519
But he had discovered another talent completely unrelated to engineering.

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.369
Writing fiction.

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:51.959
In the 1930s he would become a prolific writer, and although his favoured

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:56.749
genre was science fiction, he would write almost anything: adventure

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:02.049
fiction, romance novels, travel stories, anything that his editors requested.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.419
He got married in 1933, and had a daughter a year later.

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:15.619
When World War II broke out, he joined the US navy, and was given the rank of a junior officer.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.419
Although the official Scientology story of L.

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.409
Ron’s time in the navy is one of a glorious, brave navy officer, there are several other

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:33.799
accounts that described an overly confident officer who wasn’t suited for military duty.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.149
This all culminated when the ship that L.Ron was commanding bombed an island that

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:48.179
was actually part of Mexico, an ally of the US, and the young L.Ron was dismissed

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:53.579
from active military duty, he was in effect sacked as a commanding officer.

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.399
After this he complained of a great number of illnesses - stomach

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.779
pain, headaches, shoulder pain - and he was sent to hospital.

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:09.439
He was kept there for three months, and this will later prove to be an

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:15.239
important part of the L.Ron Hubbard mythology, and the story of Scientology.

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:23.969
After the war was over, and L.Ron Hubbard returned to civilian life, he was at a point of loss.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:29.149
He was reportedly abandoned by his family and friends, his marriage had

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:33.639
collapsed, and he was suffering greatly from a health point of view.

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.259
He moved to Los Angeles, continued his science fiction writing, but started to develop

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:47.069
a system of self-help, which he would test on anyone who would be amenable to it.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.349
His first, and most famous patient was himself.

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:56.059
He would later claim that this self-help system cured

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.559
him of all of his illnesses, both physical and mental.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.219
By this time L.Ron had become particularly interested in

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:10.759
psychiatry, but was a sceptic of traditional psychiatric treatments.

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:17.039
Instead, he sought to create his own system, a new kind of

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:22.439
psychotherapy that claimed to cure people of all sorts of illnesses.

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:27.427
This system, which was called Dianetics and I’ll explain

00:06:27.477 --> 00:06:31.087
properly in a minute, is at the heart of Scientology.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.997
The system was codified, it was set out, in a book

00:06:36.217 --> 00:06:40.057
called “Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health”.

00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:46.737
The book was an almost instant commercial success, selling 4,000 copies

00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:51.937
in a week in its first few months on sale, and has grown to become the

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:57.337
canonical text, the most important text, in the religion that was to follow.

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:05.347
Although it had an authoritative and seemingly medical title [it was “Dianetics:

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:09.837
The Modern Science of Mental Health”], it was poorly received by medical

00:07:09.837 --> 00:07:14.637
health professionals because, well, it wasn’t based on real science at all.

00:07:15.408 --> 00:07:22.207
It was based on L.Ron Hubbard’s personal experience, not based on scientific fact or study.

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:28.917
Indeed, to quote some reviews of it, The American Psychological Association said that

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:34.627
Hubbard's claims were "not supported by empirical evidence", Scientific American said that

00:07:34.957 --> 00:07:40.767
Hubbard's book contained "more promises and less evidence per page than any publication

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:48.257
since the invention of printing", and The New Republic called it a "bold and immodest

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:53.677
mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long

00:07:53.697 --> 00:08:00.177
acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology".

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:06.587
So, one could summarise these reviews as “the book was a load of made up rubbish”.

00:08:07.247 --> 00:08:13.507
But the people who were first attracted to the idea of Dianetics, and to L.Ron Hubbard as an

00:08:13.517 --> 00:08:19.767
individual were not the sort of people who were to be deterred by these kinds of negative comments.

00:08:20.287 --> 00:08:23.987
The kind of people who were attracted to Dianetics were the kind of

00:08:23.987 --> 00:08:30.627
people who had had negative, or less than 100% positive, experiences

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:36.377
with traditional psychotherapy, and were looking for a new perspective.

00:08:37.307 --> 00:08:42.987
They were unlikely to care if experts from a field they didn’t trust said

00:08:42.987 --> 00:08:47.387
something negative about a theory that they wanted to believe was true.

00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:54.047
Dianetics is a lengthy book with many new and controversial ideas that are

00:08:54.047 --> 00:08:58.917
considered to be complete rubbish by most mental health professionals, but it

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:04.557
is at the heart of Scientology so I will try to explain some of them briefly.

00:09:05.437 --> 00:09:09.627
The main idea is about the formation of the human brain.

00:09:10.497 --> 00:09:15.437
L.Ron Hubbard proposed that your mind is divided into two

00:09:15.447 --> 00:09:20.077
main sections: an analytical mind and a reactive mind.

00:09:21.077 --> 00:09:25.112
The analytical part works perfectly, Hubbard proposed,

00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:29.607
but the reactive mind can’t think or make decisions.

00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:35.207
The reactive mind is filled with all sorts of memories that send

00:09:35.497 --> 00:09:40.737
incorrect data back to the analytical mind, and this is part of what

00:09:40.737 --> 00:09:45.687
causes people to make bad life decisions and suffer from mental illness.

00:09:46.617 --> 00:09:50.887
Through a process that L.Ron Hubbard designed called auditing, it is

00:09:50.887 --> 00:09:56.607
possible to control this reactive mind, and reach a state called “Clear”.

00:09:57.727 --> 00:10:02.697
Now, although there is no evidence for this being valid science at all,

00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:08.447
and it's completely contrary to how we believe the human brain works,

00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:13.297
it was very attractive to its small group of devoted fans, or believers.

00:10:14.217 --> 00:10:20.747
At this time though, Scientology as a religion, or as a belief system, didn’t exist.

00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:26.657
Dianetics was a psychiatric treatment, albeit a completely unproven

00:10:26.697 --> 00:10:31.567
one, and one that was considered to be a complete sham by medical

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:35.287
professionals, it was considered to be something that didn't work at all.

00:10:36.257 --> 00:10:40.937
L.Ron Hubbard’s primary income was still coming from science fiction writing,

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:46.797
although he was struggling to make ends meet, he was not paid very much for his work.

00:10:47.787 --> 00:10:53.727
Frankly, he was more about quantity than quality, and even though he was publishing

00:10:53.917 --> 00:11:00.597
huge volumes, huge amounts of science fiction, he was still not earning very much money.

00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:07.337
There’s an account, which is fiercely denied by Scientologists, of L.Ron Hubbard

00:11:07.547 --> 00:11:12.837
complaining about not being able to make enough money, and a fellow science

00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:18.007
fiction writer telling him that the way to get rich was by starting a religion.

00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:25.117
Whether that’s true or not we will never know, but what is undeniable is that within a

00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:33.047
few years L.Ron Hubbard had started the process of turning Dianetics from a pseudo-medical

00:11:33.087 --> 00:11:39.287
procedure to something that was at the heart of this new religion, Scientology.

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:45.927
As a medical procedure, Dianetics would be treated like any other medical procedure,

00:11:46.127 --> 00:11:51.007
and would have to display evidence that it was doing good, that it was helping people.

00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:55.847
As already mentioned, there was very little evidence that it actually

00:11:55.847 --> 00:12:01.347
worked, other than L.Ron Hubbard’s stories about it working on himself, and

00:12:01.507 --> 00:12:06.087
various other stories of people who claimed that they had been cured by it.

00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:12.157
And as you will know there are plenty of government guidelines and laws that

00:12:12.157 --> 00:12:17.217
restrict medicine to trained professionals, for very good obvious reasons.

00:12:18.107 --> 00:12:25.277
But L.Ron Hubbard realised that there was another category that didn’t need to provide evidence.

00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:26.347
Religion.

00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:33.847
If L.Ron could turn Dianetics from a medical procedure into a religious organisation,

00:12:34.297 --> 00:12:37.617
it wouldn’t be required to demonstrate its efficacy, it wouldn't be required

00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:45.087
to show that it worked, and it wouldn’t be bound by such strict guidelines.

00:12:46.247 --> 00:12:51.487
This was either a moment of religious inspiration or of cynical

00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:55.507
opportunism, depending on how supportive you are of Scientology.

00:12:56.257 --> 00:13:02.517
So, in December of 1953, three and a half years after Dianetics was first

00:13:02.527 --> 00:13:08.217
published, L.Ron Hubbard incorporated three new churches: The Church of

00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:13.597
Scientology, The Church of American Science and The Church of Spiritual Engineering.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.520
This was to be the start of his new religion, The Church of Scientology.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:26.750
And as part of this new religion, L.Ron Hubbard was able to charge a lot of money for it.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.580
24 hours worth of auditing, of this Dianetics programme,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.710
would cost $500, around $5,000 in today’s money.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:46.420
The cash soon started to flood in, and L.Ron Hubbard went from struggling science fiction

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:52.460
writer to the head of a new organisation that was generating large amounts of cash.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.510
He implemented a system whereby he would receive a percentage of all

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.880
income from these auditing sessions, and by 1957 he was reportedly

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:11.940
earning around $250,000 a year, which is over $2 million in today’s money.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.780
There was a very thin line between the funds of the Church of

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.460
Scientology, as it was called, and L.Ron Hubbard’s personal funds.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.460
He bought extravagant houses which became Scientology centres.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.710
He bought boats, plots of land, and real estate all over the world.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:38.620
And there were reports of him just withdrawing from the church’s bank

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.420
account and transferring to his own account, without any particular reason.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:51.300
Different branches of the Church of Scientology sprung up all over the world, and its members grew.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.270
This brought it further into the public eye, and under closer examination.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:04.950
It might have started as a harmless self-help system, but it started to be considered by

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:11.840
many governments to be a dangerous cult, and was accused of indoctrinating its followers.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.110
L.Ron Hubbard himself was accused of suffering from paranoid schizophrenia,

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.324
being of doubtful sanity, and of having delusions of grandeur.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.140
If you’ve listened to the last episode on Mormonism, these

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.990
accusations might remind you of someone we learned about in that one.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.290
The result of this was that The Church of Scientology started

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.430
to get in trouble in almost every country it was active in.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:47.140
It was banned in parts of Australia, the UK banned Scientologists from

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.770
entering the country, and L.Ron was considered to be, and I'm quoting here, a

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:59.620
“mental case” by the FBI, a “mental case” is a slang term for a crazy person.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.030
But, as often tends to be the case, the more a belief system is persecuted

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.630
and cast out from mainstream society, the more its followers are drawn to it.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.540
Scientology continued to grow, with members joining from all over the world.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:24.930
But life wasn’t any easier, and it continued to run into problems with a wide range

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:32.640
of governments, so in 1967 L.Ron Hubbard decided to move the base of Scientology

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:38.970
offshore, and launched something called the Sea Org, the organisation of the sea.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.650
This was a fleet of ships, initially three large boats, that travelled around the

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:51.540
Mediterranean and Northern Atlantic, staying for short periods of time at each port.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.540
It was manned by the most dedicated members of the Church

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.190
of Scientology, including L.Ron Hubbard and his family.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.890
It was aboard the Sea Org, and over the period of the next five

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:11.370
years or so, that his behaviour became even more erratic, and he made

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.090
some curious additions to the doctrine of the Church of Scientology.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.210
L.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:24.210
Ron said he had discovered that humans had been brought to Earth 75 million years ago by a

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.860
galactic dictator called Xenu, who put them all in a volcano and blew them up with hydrogen bombs.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.210
And the souls of these original humans stick to our bodies, and that's what causes us problems.

00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:45.350
Now, I should say that this story is not public, the Church of Scientology

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.310
denies its existence, but numerous ex-Scientologists have confirmed it.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.460
According to them, as a Scientologist you are only allowed to learn about

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:02.130
this story, which is essentially the account of the Creation, by going through

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:07.490
numerous levels of training, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.810
We’ll discuss this further in a minute, but let’s return to L.Ron Hubbard.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.910
Aboard the Sea Org, his mental and physical health seemed to be in decline.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.930
He was a heavy smoker, and he had put on large amounts of weight.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.810
He was reportedly erratic, and started behaving in an even stranger manner.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.470
But nobody was allowed to question him.

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:40.160
After he returned to land, he continued to be pursued by the authorities.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.220
He was charged with obtaining money under false pretences by a

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.550
French court and sentenced to four years in prison in France.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:56.120
This was in absentia, he wasn’t actually in France and never served any time in prison.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.490
And in 1980 he went into hiding.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.530
He was never seen again, and in 1982 it was announced that he had died.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:13.660
According to the Church of Scientology, L.Ron Hubbard had decided to drop his body because it was

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:20.320
getting in the way of his research, and he had decided to continue his research on another planet.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.110
Quite a life, right?

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.840
Now, if you thought that Scientology had ended with

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.080
L.Ron Hubbard’s death, you would be much mistaken.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.810
After his death the religion was taken over by a young messenger, David

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.640
Miscavige, who is to this day the leader of the Church of Scientology.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.470
With Miscavige at its helm, the Church of Scientology

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.790
has grown into an incredibly powerful organisation.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.720
Nobody seems to know how many Scientologists there actually are,

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.480
and there are vastly different numbers depending on who you ask.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:06.100
The Church of Scientology says it has between 8 and 15 million members, which would make it

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:12.060
on a similar level to Mormonism, as we heard about in the last episode, and even Judaism.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.540
But most experts dispute this number, with a recent documentary, called

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.290
Going Clear (which is excellent by the way, I would certainly recommend it).

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.180
This documentary said that it had fewer than 50,000 members.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:33.830
If this is indeed the case, one might wonder why Scientology seems to be so present in the news.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.450
Firstly, it is because it has this strange and

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.400
unorthodox founding story that we’ve just learned about.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.670
Secondly, it has a vast amount of money - there was

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.080
even an advert for it during the 2021 Super Bowl.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.080
And thirdly, Scientology has done a very good job at cultivating celebrities,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:01.500
people who are in the public eye and talk about the religion during TV interviews.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.510
Tom Cruise and John Travolta are both Scientologists, and there is

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.610
a long list of other Hollywood actors who are members of the church.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.470
Of course, for the church, this is excellent PR, it’s great marketing.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.360
These celebrities are normally huge proponents of the benefits of

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:27.720
Scientology, and will go on talk shows and explain how it has helped them.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.120
So, given how frequently Scientology is mentioned, it might be surprising to find

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.810
out that the actual number of Scientologists is a lot smaller than you might think.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:46.800
Now, to its devoted followers, Scientology appears to be an amazing part of their lives.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.600
It helps them address their emotions, understand their life, and be better humans.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:59.350
But criticisms of Scientology didn’t stop with L.Ron Hubbard, and the church has continued

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:05.350
to be attacked on all sorts of grounds, theological, financial, and even criminal.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:11.360
The first reason is both financial and theological, and is about Scientology’s

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.540
status as a religion, and what this means in terms of how much tax it has to pay.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:23.740
If an organisation is a religion, there are some very attractive tax benefits in the United States.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:30.400
For 37 years The Church of Scientology was in battle with the US government.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:36.880
Scientology said it was a religion, and therefore didn’t have to pay all sorts of taxes.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:42.610
The US government argued that it wasn’t a religion, and therefore owed

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:48.540
almost a billion dollars in unpaid taxes over this almost 40 year period.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:57.540
In 1991 though, the IRS finally settled, the Inland Revenue Service finally settled, and agreed

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.560
that Scientology was indeed a religion, and was therefore exempt from paying these taxes.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:11.400
Now, you can agree or disagree with the criteria about what is or isn’t a religion, and indeed we

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:18.250
will discuss this more in the next episode, but the result meant that the church had saved almost a

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:24.870
billion dollars in taxes, and this gives you an indication about quite how much money it was making.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:31.990
Another criticism of the church, which is again related to its finances, is quite how much

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:37.990
money it makes from each follower, and how hard it is to leave once you have joined it.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.030
If Scientology were a business, it would be an excellent business.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.270
To become a Scientologist, you don’t just turn up one day and go to

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:54.000
church and perhaps drop a few coins in a donation box, there are numerous

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.000
courses and auditing sessions you need to do, each of which is paid.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:05.300
It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to reach the higher levels, and

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:10.310
once you are there you don’t stop, you continue doing these paid sessions.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.280
During these sessions you are asked to share very personal information, and this is all

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:23.440
recorded by the church, there is a central database of everything you have ever confessed to.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.640
Critics of the church say that this information is

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.300
used as blackmail to stop people leaving the church.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:38.000
Understandably, if you have confessed all of your sins, and talked about deeply personal

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.650
memories or traumas, you probably wouldn’t want these to be shared with the world,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.810
especially if you are a celebrity, an actor like Tom Cruise or John Travolta, let’s say.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.210
Now, this is just a small list of the accusations against the church.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:25:00.832
Its leaders have been accused of physical and mental abuse, of murder,

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:05.900
of fraud, of brainwashing, and all sorts of very nasty activities.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.330
If you are interested in learning more about this, the Internet is full of

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.590
tens of thousands of articles about all of the accusations against The Church

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.590
of Scientology, and that would certainly keep you busy for a long time.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.940
So, that is Scientology.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:28.020
To its most ardent followers, its most passionate followers, it is

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.880
a way of making sense of the world, and becoming a better person.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.370
To its critics, it is a cult, or even a criminal enterprise.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:42.400
While one can only hazard a guess at the true intentions of its founder,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.490
L.Ron Hubbard, if even he had any true intentions, what is certainly

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.860
undeniable is that he has left a weird, weird legacy on the world.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:02.430
OK then, that is it for part two of this mini-series on Mormonism and Scientology.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.230
I hope you enjoyed it, that you learned something new, and if you see large

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:12.390
buildings in New York, London or Paris with Church of Scientology written

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:16.630
on them, well now you’ll know a little bit about the story behind them.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.310
Next up, in part three, we will come back to look at a comparison between

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:27.390
Mormonism and Scientology, two very different religions, but two that have

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:32.350
a uniquely American story, and have been criticised for similar reasons.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.150
In this episode we’ll talk about the similarities and differences between the

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:43.070
two, as well as think about the wider question of what is a religion, and ask

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:48.030
ourselves whether they would have been possible in any country other than the USA.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.510
That is one of our member-only ones, and will be coming out on Tuesday.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:58.520
And on that note, if you enjoyed this episode, and you are wondering where to get all

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.530

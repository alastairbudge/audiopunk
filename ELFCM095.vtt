Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:15.625
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.135
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:25.815
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Man Who

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.965
Makes The World’s Glasses, and the story of a company called Luxottica.

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:35.235
I wear glasses, and there’s a good chance that you do too.

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:42.455
The story of how glasses are made and sold is pretty fascinating, and the most powerful person in

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:49.365
the world of eyes is a man called Leonardo Del Vecchio, the founder of a company called Luxottica.

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.655
You might not have heard of Luxottica, but there’s a good chance that

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.895
you have been into one of its shops and bought a pair of its glasses.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:06.305
So, without further ado, let’s tell the amazing story of The Man Who Makes The World’s Glasses.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:11.365
Now, if you wear glasses, I don’t need to tell you how important they are.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:17.335
Depending on whether you are myopic or hyperopic, if you are short-sighted

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:23.325
or long-sighted, and depending on how bad your vision is, glasses range

00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:29.265
from mildly useful to absolutely critical for living a normal life.

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:36.595
Over 60% of the world’s population need some form of vision correction, and

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:42.655
this number is projected to continue to increase every year, as we all spend

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:48.315
more time inside, looking at small screens and not getting enough natural light.

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:56.255
Indeed, there was a paper back in 2013 that predicted that over 50% of the

00:01:56.255 --> 00:02:03.325
world’s population will be myopic by 2050, will be short-sighted by 2050.

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:06.105
This trend has already started.

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:10.845
Over the course of just one generation, double the number of

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:14.965
children in secondary school are myopic vs their parents' generation.

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:17.395
So, there we go.

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:21.015
Glasses, or I should say ‘vision correction’, is

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:24.985
incredibly important, and will continue to be ever more so.

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:31.965
You know this already, but it might surprise you to find out that a large part of the

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:39.845
total glasses market, approximately 30% of the global market, but up to 80% in the

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:46.375
United States, is controlled by one company, which is mainly controlled by one man, the

00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:53.185
richest man in Italy, Leonardo Del Vecchio, the real godfather of how the world sees.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:59.085
The story of Leonardo Del Vecchio and of Luxottica starts in 1935.

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:06.705
Del Vecchio was born to a very poor family in Milan, he was the youngest of four brothers.

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:14.395
His father sold vegetables on the streets of Milan, but he died just before Del Vecchio was born.

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:21.485
His mother struggled to make ends meet for her young family, and so when he was just

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:27.815
seven years old, Del Vecchio was sent to an orphanage, where he stayed until he was 15.

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:33.335
Aged 15, he was sent to become an apprentice, and he

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:37.895
was sent to learn engraving at a tools maker in Milan.

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:46.615
He soon turned his attention to making parts for glasses, and in 1961, when he was

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:53.395
just 25 years old, he moved to a small town called Agordo, to the north of Venice.

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:59.765
Agordo was small and isolated, and as a way of encouraging new

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:04.815
businesses to come and set up there, it was offering free land.

00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:10.435
Del Vecchio took up this offer, and built a small factory where he started

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:14.795
making parts for glasses in a little company that he called Luxottica.

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:21.685
When Del Vecchio started out, glasses were a little different to how they are today.

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:26.655
They were much more of a practical purchase, something that

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:30.525
your optician would prescribe you, then you would just buy them.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:34.875
There wasn’t a huge amount of choice, and they certainly weren’t

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:38.775
fashion accessories in the same way in which they are today.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:45.785
Del Vecchio gradually built up Luxottica, buying up distributors and retailers.

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:54.655
He recognised that if he only supplied the parts, then firstly he was missing out on a large chunk

00:04:54.685 --> 00:05:01.995
of the profits, a large part of the money to be made, and secondly he was really at the mercy of the

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:08.885
distributors; one year they could decide not to buy his parts, and he wouldn’t be able to sell them.

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:16.095
He wanted to control everything, and so Luxottica started buying up

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:21.285
retailers all over the world, so it controlled both the manufacturing

00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:25.505
and the sale of glasses to consumers, to people like me and you.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:30.465
The other thing that Del Vecchio recognised, probably before

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:35.335
anyone, really, is the potential of glasses as a fashion accessory.

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:44.035
He did deals with large fashion houses, first Giorgio Armani in 1988, then Versace,

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:50.235
Chanel, and many others, as well as buying up glasses brands, such as Ray Ban.

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:57.655
Instead of people paying 20 or 30 euros for a pair of glasses, he realised that they could

00:05:57.665 --> 00:06:04.435
be sold for ten times that if these glasses became a fashion statement, in the same way in

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:11.005
which a watch serves the practical purpose of telling the time, but is also a fashion item.

00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:17.405
Indeed, as a glasses wearer, but certainly not someone who has ‘designer’

00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:22.825
glasses, buying glasses is a strange experience and it’s very easy

00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:27.295
to find yourself spending much more money than you planned on them.

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:33.885
They might be very expensive for just some plastic and glass, but if you

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:40.225
wear them for 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, then it’s easy to see how

00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:44.985
people can justify spending a lot more on them than they probably should.

00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:53.285
Plus, when you are actually prescribed them, and it’s a product that you have to have in

00:06:53.285 --> 00:07:00.425
some shape or form, and if you are in an opticians owned by Luxottica, which sells only

00:07:00.885 --> 00:07:08.215
Luxottica-owned brands, then it’s easy to see how this swiftly has become a very powerful business.

00:07:09.285 --> 00:07:13.135
And there is a lot of money in glasses and eye care.

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:18.925
They are very cheap to produce and are sold for vast amounts of money.

00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:25.735
Even the most expensive designer glasses typically cost not much more than €30 to

00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:32.925
produce, but they can easily be sold for more than €300, ten times the cost of production.

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:40.235
This has meant that the eyecare industry is now worth 100 billion euros a year.

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:45.525
The richest self-made female billionaire in the UK is a woman

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:49.375
called Mary Perkins, who founded an opticians called Specsavers.

00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:53.295
And Leonardo Del Vecchio has become the richest man

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:58.565
in Italy, with a net worth of around 25 billion euros.

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:02.365
So, there’s clearly a lot of money in how we see.

00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:10.155
But while hundreds of millions of pairs of glasses are sold every year, the biggest prize for

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:16.215
Del Vecchio is the proportion of the world’s population that need glasses but don’t have them.

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:23.265
It’s estimated that over 2.5 billion people should wear glasses but don’t,

00:08:23.955 --> 00:08:28.655
normally because they have no way to get their eyes tested or to buy glasses.

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:34.035
Similar to companies like Facebook and Google, that are starting to run out of new

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:39.855
people in the developed world to start using their services, Luxottica knows that if

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:46.135
you need glasses in Europe or in the US, you will probably go to a Luxottica-owned

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:52.235
shop and choose from a range of Luxottica-owned brands, so how big they can

00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:57.805
grow in a country like the US is limited by how many people that country has.

00:08:59.325 --> 00:09:04.565
But if you live in a rural community in India, or Ghana, or Bolivia,

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:09.845
then you might not have the means to get your eyes tested, so even

00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:13.985
if you could buy glasses, you wouldn’t know which ones to buy.

00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:17.025
So people just don't buy them.

00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:22.025
Luxottica is investing huge amounts of money in trying to

00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:26.655
get this ‘unglassed’ population kitted out with glasses.

00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:33.095
Evidently it knows that it can’t sell Gucci glasses for €500 to someone

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:38.915
in rural Cambodia, but glasses are so cheap to make that it can still

00:09:38.925 --> 00:09:44.615
sell them for €5 and get that person into the habit of wearing glasses.

00:09:45.295 --> 00:09:50.245
Because once you start wearing glasses, you are not going to stop, it’s a one way ticket.

00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:55.325
One day you’ll buy a more expensive pair, owned by Luxottica of course,

00:09:55.695 --> 00:10:00.455
or if you decide to wear contact lenses or have laser eye surgery, you’ll

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:05.155
probably need to buy them or get it done in a Luxottica-owned shop.

00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:09.825
You might be asking yourself - isn’t this a bit of a problem?

00:10:10.395 --> 00:10:17.185
If Luxottica owns everything, isn’t that a monopoly, and isn’t that normally a bad thing?

00:10:18.325 --> 00:10:19.465
And yes, you’d be right.

00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:26.425
Luxottica not only had a monopoly on the glasses frames market beforehand, but

00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:34.315
in 2018 it merged with a company called Essilor, which makes the lenses that go

00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:40.195
in glasses, and also owns a wide range of different retailers, suppliers, and

00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:45.685
companies related to the manufacturing and selling of stuff to help you see.

00:10:46.755 --> 00:10:52.285
This created this huge, mega company that controls almost

00:10:52.305 --> 00:10:56.145
everything that you might possibly want if you have problems seeing.

00:10:57.065 --> 00:11:01.845
From making the bits that go into the glasses frames to the lenses themselves,

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:08.105
from the websites that compare different prices of glasses to the insurers that

00:11:08.105 --> 00:11:14.165
pay out for glasses, this huge, 50 billion euro corporation controls it all.

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:19.425
And this, for those of us that wear glasses or have any problems

00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:23.245
with our eyes, is probably not a very good thing at all.

00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:28.305
Without much competition, and owning the entire distribution,

00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:33.955
Essilor Luxottica is free to charge almost what it wants for glasses.

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:38.365
Imagine you go to a shopping mall to get your eyes checked.

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:43.885
You go there, you see that there are 10 different opticians in the mall, all with

00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:48.915
different names, and it looks like they have a wide selection of different glasses.

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.255
Of course, you have your eyes checked, you get a new

00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:55.195
prescription, and you need a new pair of glasses.

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:59.785
You’re allowed to walk around the shop and find some pairs that you like.

00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:03.685
Or maybe you don’t see any that you like, but you go

00:12:03.685 --> 00:12:06.205
to the other shop next door with your prescription.

00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:13.485
If everything is ultimately owned by EssilorLuxottica, which it often is,

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:18.315
then you don’t really have a choice, even though it might seem like you do.

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:24.515
If you need glasses to see, they aren’t a discretionary purchase, you

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:29.785
can’t just choose not to buy them, so you can see why this is problematic.

00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:35.885
Naturally, EssilorLuxottica also sells cheaper glasses, they aren’t all

00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:41.895
€300, but as they control the entire experience they can do everything in

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:46.545
their power to push you towards the glasses where they make the most money.

00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:53.435
This is especially the case with the protective coverings that go on glasses.

00:12:54.345 --> 00:13:00.315
If you haven’t bought glasses before, what normally happens is that you choose the frame, then you

00:13:00.315 --> 00:13:06.625
are recommended the right lenses for you, based on your prescription, and you can choose different

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:14.155
protective coverings that do things like block out UV light or protect the lenses from scratches.

00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:19.255
These can add up quickly, and it can easily add

00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:23.515
another €100 or more to the cost of a pair of glasses.

00:13:24.865 --> 00:13:31.075
These protective coverings are, reportedly, the things that make the most money for opticians, and

00:13:31.075 --> 00:13:39.685
for EssilorLuxottica, as they only cost a few cents to produce, but are sold for 10,000 times that.

00:13:40.635 --> 00:13:41.565
Mad, right?

00:13:42.015 --> 00:13:45.115
But you don’t have a choice - you can’t go anywhere else for it.

00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:51.605
And it’s not just us, consumers, who are getting a raw deal, who

00:13:51.745 --> 00:13:56.055
are powerless in the face of ‘big lens’, as it has been named.

00:13:57.215 --> 00:14:02.315
Oakley, the US sunglasses manufacturer, used to sell its sunglasses

00:14:02.315 --> 00:14:06.055
to sunglasses shops, who would then sell them to consumers.

00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:11.495
When Luxottica bought up one of the largest sunglasses retailers in

00:14:11.495 --> 00:14:16.945
the US, it ordered all of the manufacturers to reduce their prices.

00:14:17.995 --> 00:14:20.695
Most did, but Oakley refused.

00:14:21.725 --> 00:14:23.555
So what did Luxottica do?

00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:29.925
It just stopped selling Oakley sunglasses, it removed them from all of its stores.

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:36.945
Oakley's sales plummeted, as it just lost one of the main ways that people could buy its glasses.

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:41.765
Its share price dropped, and the company was in real trouble.

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.845
So what did Luxottica do?

00:14:45.395 --> 00:14:49.875
It waited for a few years, then bought Oakley for a cut-down price.

00:14:50.645 --> 00:14:53.915
Only then did it start selling Oakley sunglasses again.

00:14:54.895 --> 00:15:02.115
So, Luxottica, and now EssilorLuxottica is a hugely powerful company that controls the way

00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:08.355
the world sees, yet only a tiny proportion of its customers will ever have heard of it.

00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:14.615
And in a world where an ever increasing amount of people need its products

00:15:14.775 --> 00:15:20.465
yet lack the access or financial resources to be able to use them, there is

00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:25.445
a lot of concern about what’s going to happen when one company is allowed to

00:15:25.445 --> 00:15:30.995
have such a large amount of control over something as important as how we see.

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:37.475
But whether EssilorLuxottica uses its power for good, by providing lower

00:15:37.475 --> 00:15:43.165
cost glasses to those that need but can’t afford them, or uses it for ill, by

00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:48.445
exploiting its monopoly and jacking up prices, we will have to wait and see.

00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:56.025
OK then, that is it for Luxottica and The Man Who Makes The World’s Glasses.

00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:57.875
I hope it’s been an interesting one.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:02.525
Whether you wear glasses or not, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:05.635
The place for that is our lovely new community forum,

00:16:05.895 --> 00:16:09.655

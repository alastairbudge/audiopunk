Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:15.986
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:21.236
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:27.746
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The War on Drugs.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:34.886
In 1971, President Richard Nixon declared drugs to be a menace

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:38.936
to society, and that there was to be a war against them.

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:46.646
Almost 50 years later, we are going to tell the story of why this war was waged,

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:54.086
what actually happened, what its impact was and who, if anyone has won the war.

00:00:55.586 --> 00:01:00.661
Before we get right into that, though if you are listening to this episode on your favourite

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:06.161
podcast app, let me just remind you that you can get all of them bonus episodes, plus

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:12.681
subtitles, transcripts, and key vocabulary over at the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:18.491
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English and join a

00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:24.531
community of curious minds from, I think it's almost 20 different countries now, doing

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:30.231
meetups exchanging ideas and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:37.901
So if that is of interest, and I hope it is, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:43.581
Okay then let's talk about The War on Drugs, a war that

00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:47.421
has cost the United States over a trillion dollars.

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:54.229
To understand why this war was declared we need to go a little bit further back,

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:01.489
as Nixon's declaration didn't come out of nothing, it was to a certain degree, the

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:07.369
next logical step to what US policy had been over the past a hundred years or so.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.869
When, what we now consider hard drugs were first synthesised, so things like

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.459
cocaine and heroin their effects weren't as well known as they are today.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:26.475
Morphine was isolated at the start of the 19th century and syringes, which allow

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:32.475
direct insertion of substances into your veins were first invented in 1851.

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:39.325
And during the American Civil War, tens of thousands of soldiers were given morphine for

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:46.285
pain relief, and after the end of the war, there were a large number of addicted veterans.

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:54.863
Up until the start of the 20th century, heroin was still available over the counter in pharmacies.

00:02:55.568 --> 00:03:01.118
It was something that you could be prescribed to treat a sore throat or for insomnia.

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:06.948
Cocaine was also widely available, and this wasn't only in the United States;

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:13.968
Sherlock Holmes, the famous British detective is often found injecting himself

00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:19.338
with cocaine as a way to get inspired and to keep his energy levels up.

00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:23.648
If you didn't know that well, you should read some Sherlock Holmes.

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:30.715
Even in the 1890s, Sears, the iconic American department store had a

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:36.805
popular catalogue with an offer for a syringe and some cocaine for $1 50,

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:39.153
You could literally buy it from a catalogue.

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:47.063
The point is that these drugs that are now highly illegal were not only legal, but they were

00:03:47.063 --> 00:03:54.653
completely tolerated, more so than things like alcohol or tobacco are in most societies in 2020.

00:03:55.623 --> 00:03:59.778
At the turn of the 20th century, the United States started to

00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:04.608
pass more regulation on these previously unregulated drugs.

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:09.678
And of course, on one of the world's most popular drugs, alcohol.

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:18.274
The prohibition era, which lasted from 1919 to 1933, banned the production and

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:24.334
sale of all alcohol, although drugs like heroin and cocaine were still allowed.

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:26.091
Strange, right?

00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:29.721
It's a complete reversal of the situation we have today.

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:36.051
As the world started to recover from the trauma of two world wars, in

00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:41.391
the United States, recreational drug use started to rise and particularly

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:46.101
marijuana, which was associated with the hippy antiwar movement.

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:50.526
At the same time, heroin use was starting to increase,

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:54.216
in particular in African American communities.

00:04:55.185 --> 00:05:02.967
There was an increasing fear in America about the impact on society of drug use, and it's

00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:10.617
thought by many that this declaration of The War on Drugs was just a reaction to public opinion.

00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:15.297
However, there is another interesting angle.

00:05:16.812 --> 00:05:24.504
A man called John Ehrlichman, who was an aide to Nixon said that The War on Drugs was actually

00:05:24.684 --> 00:05:31.434
a way to disrupt both the antiwar hippie community and the African American population.

00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.982
He said, and I'm quoting directly here, the Nixon White

00:05:35.982 --> 00:05:39.822
House had two enemies, the antiwar left and black people.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.071
We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.601
by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana, and blacks with

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:54.948
heroin, and then criminalising both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:59.448
We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their

00:05:59.448 --> 00:06:04.364
meetings and vilify them night after night on the evening news."

00:06:05.864 --> 00:06:11.174
Marijuana was put into the most dangerous category of drugs, along with cocaine

00:06:11.174 --> 00:06:17.804
and heroin, and this meant that the police had incredible powers to go after the

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:23.624
antiwar hippy crowd, who they suspected of being frequent users of marijuana.

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.499
Of course, the public reason for declaring The War on Drugs wasn't that.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:38.019
Nixon said "if we cannot destroy the drug menace in America, then it will surely in time destroy us.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.709
I am not prepared to accept this alternative."

00:06:42.642 --> 00:06:45.671
The goal of the drug war, at least from a public

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:50.051
point of view, was to reduce and eliminate drug use.

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:56.831
If you can stop the production of drugs, if you can stop them getting into the country, then

00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:02.871
you can stop them getting into the hands of citizens, then bingo, the drug war would be won.

00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:07.451
Or more practically speaking, you make the punishment

00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:10.721
sufficiently high so that people don't want to take the risk.

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.830
As a result, the price increases, so drugs become unaffordable.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.380
And what's more, not only are they expensive, but they are so hard to find

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.090
that people can't find someone to buy them from, even if they can afford them.

00:07:27.002 --> 00:07:28.227
That's the idea, at least.

00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:31.767
So what actually happened?

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.239
First, let's talk about what has happened to society, then

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:40.559
we'll discuss whether The War on Drugs has worked or not.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:47.942
For starters, it has led to the incarceration, the imprisonment of millions of people.

00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:55.276
The United States has around 5% of the world's population, but 25% of

00:07:55.276 --> 00:08:00.106
the world's imprisoned population, largely due to The War on Drugs.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:10.336
In 1971, when The War on Drugs was declared just under 0.2% of the US population was in prison.

00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:16.066
By 2008, this had risen to 0.8%.

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:21.544
Of the 1.5 million Americans who are arrested each year for drug

00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:26.854
offenses, one third of them, half a million end up behind bars.

00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:34.324
And this as I'm sure we all know has an inordinate impact on the black community,

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:39.694
with one in five black Americans spending time behind bars for drug offenses.

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:45.709
13% of the American population is black, yet 40% of the

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:49.759
incarcerated population, the population in prison is black.

00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:54.949
So obviously The War on Drugs doesn't affect everyone equally.

00:08:56.449 --> 00:09:00.649
In terms of the effect of all this cracking down on communities that

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:05.809
sell and use drugs, the question to ask next is whether this has had

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:10.399
the intended effect of making drugs harder to find and more expensive.

00:09:12.229 --> 00:09:16.039
Certainly from an accessibility point of view, it's

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.679
obviously harder to buy drugs if they are illegal.

00:09:19.306 --> 00:09:23.866
Unlike in 1900, you can't just walk into a chemist and ask someone

00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:28.296
for some morphine or buy a syringe with some cocaine from a catalogue.

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.006
But that's the easy part.

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:36.166
Yes, drugs might still be quite easy to find in large parts of America,

00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:41.056
but they are still harder to find than if they were sold in supermarkets.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.880
Next up is the price question.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:50.570
Has The War on Drugs made drugs so unaffordable that people can't keep up with their habits?

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.627
The answer to that is it's complicated, but probably not.

00:09:57.131 --> 00:10:00.966
For some drugs, in fact, completely the opposite has happened.

00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:12.248
The price of heroin reduced by 93% from 1891 to 2007, and the price of cocaine fell by 87%.

00:10:13.228 --> 00:10:17.690
Marijuana, one of the main drugs that The War on Drugs was intended to

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.850
eradicate has remained a similar price since The War on Drugs was declared.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:30.920
In fact, no drug has become much more expensive; drugs are cheaper than ever before.

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:35.599
Economists have a name for this: the balloon effect.

00:10:37.084 --> 00:10:40.774
If you think of a balloon, if you squeeze it the air

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:44.044
moves, it doesn't disappear, it just goes somewhere else.

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:51.109
With drugs, they are so lucrative, so profitable, that even if the production

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:55.939
is stopped in one area, it will be taken up by another group in another area.

00:10:56.672 --> 00:11:00.891
This is exactly what happened with the clamping down on cocaine

00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:04.381
production in Peru and Bolivia, it just moved to Colombia.

00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:11.721
And when marijuana farms were burned in certain areas of Mexico, production just moved elsewhere.

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:17.931
And even in areas further away from the United States, where The War on Drugs was

00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:24.321
first declared, the crackdown on production often doesn't have any real impact at all.

00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:31.371
In Afghanistan, where not only has the US spent almost $8 billion

00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:36.501
cracking down on opium production, but it has a substantial military force

00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:43.083
based there, opium production reached historic record levels in 2013.

00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:51.483
The reality is, even though drugs are cheaper than ever before, there is still so much money

00:11:51.483 --> 00:11:57.568
to be made from them, especially in countries where the drug trade offers excellent economic

00:11:57.568 --> 00:12:05.010
opportunities, and it will be incredibly difficult, nigh impossible for the production of drugs to

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:12.701
stop while there are still millions of buyers across the world who are hungry for the product So The

00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:19.361
War on Drugs continues, but there have been a lot of hard questions asked over the past few years

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:27.345
In June, 2011, the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which is as the name suggests

00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:33.255
a global panel of world leaders, released its first report on The War on Drugs.

00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:40.305
It started with the words, "the global war on drugs has failed with

00:12:40.305 --> 00:12:44.775
devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world."

00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:51.685
It went on to call for urgent reforms in drug policy, decriminalising

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:56.715
the nonviolent users of drugs and challenging taboos around usage.

00:12:58.185 --> 00:13:01.725
Yet, since that report, almost 10 years ago now,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.355
nothing significant has happened in The War on Drugs.

00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:10.545
Thanks to the ease with which prescription opiates have been handed

00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:15.795
out by doctors, there is a new generation of drug users who have turned

00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:20.115
to things like heroin when the prescription drugs don't work anymore.

00:13:21.815 --> 00:13:26.285
But there are constantly new and interesting ideas proposed.

00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:32.205
The first thing to say, which is important to clarify is that drug

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:37.065
policy requires a country to choose between different, bad choices.

00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:43.635
There is an interesting interview with a man called Keith Humphries from Stanford university.

00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:49.215
He explained that there are five main factors that policymakers need

00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:56.175
to choose between: freedom, pleasure, health, crime, and public safety.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.850
There is no one drug policy that allows you to optimise for all five of these.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.770
And you can't have everything.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:11.040
For example, if you believe that freedom and pleasure are the most important factors,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:18.450
then this is likely going to come to the detriment of health, as drugs can be dangerous.

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:25.184
Similarly, if you believe that reducing crime and increasing public safety are the most

00:14:25.184 --> 00:14:31.484
important things, then this is probably going to come with a reduction in freedom and pleasure.

00:14:32.264 --> 00:14:35.924
And this is really the route that The War on Drugs has taken.

00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:41.624
The implicit message with The War on Drugs is that if prohibition

00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:46.154
reduces usage, then it's a good thing, whatever the other costs.

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:54.989
Yet, given that there are legal drugs, legal opioids, which are now the greatest gateway drugs

00:14:54.989 --> 00:15:01.819
to stronger things like heroin, one has to question whether this objective is even valid anymore.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:10.529
The US spends $51 billion on The War on Drugs every year, yet allows pharmaceutical

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:16.219
companies to make billions of dollars by selling other legal drugs to its citizens.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:20.489
It certainly seems like a bit of a contradiction to me.

00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:27.776
One thing that will be interesting to see in some states in the US where marijuana is legal,

00:15:28.076 --> 00:15:34.946
is how things might be different if instead of the US paying billions of dollars to stop

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:40.556
drugs ever getting into a country, it legalised these drugs and collect taxes on them.

00:15:41.876 --> 00:15:48.666
At the moment, the vast majority of the profits from the drug trade flow to organised crime gangs.

00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.921
But that's not how it needs to be.

00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:57.711
Drugs are expensive comparatively speaking, because of the fact that they are

00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:03.201
illegal and there is a risk involved with their production, transport, and sale.

00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:11.691
The raw materials on the other hand are typically pretty cheap, so the idea goes, what if,

00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:17.391
instead of all this money going to crime gangs, it went to the government via the tax system.

00:16:18.085 --> 00:16:25.255
It's certainly an interesting idea, and there was a study back in 2010 from the libertarian Cato

00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:32.875
Institute that suggested that adding a tax to illegal drugs, similar to the one on tobacco and

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:41.108
alcohol could raise almost $50 billion in taxes every year, which could be spent on schools,

00:16:41.108 --> 00:16:47.980
hospitals, drug rehabilitation, or all sorts of things that might be positive for society.

00:16:48.938 --> 00:16:53.108
The obvious counter argument to this is the fear that if drugs

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:57.848
were legal usage would skyrocket, it would increase dramatically.

00:16:58.828 --> 00:17:04.108
However, this hasn't proved to be the case in countries that have decriminalized

00:17:04.138 --> 00:17:09.278
the use of drugs like Portugal, where the prophecies about every man

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:14.078
and his dog deciding to start injecting heroin just haven't come true.

00:17:15.878 --> 00:17:19.208
As almost every drug policy expert seems to repeat,

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:23.408
there are no perfect solutions and something has to give.

00:17:25.148 --> 00:17:30.098
The War on Drugs will reach its 50 year anniversary next year, and what does

00:17:30.098 --> 00:17:35.678
seem to be clear is that although it may have started with lofty, ambitious

00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:41.078
aims, it seems that the main winners of the longest war in recent American

00:17:41.078 --> 00:17:46.118
history are the very criminal enterprises that the war set out to destroy.

00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:53.246
Okay, then that is it for today's episode on The War on Drugs.

00:17:53.816 --> 00:17:56.546
It's the kind of topic that lots of people have a

00:17:56.546 --> 00:17:59.786
strong view on, so I would love to know what you think.

00:18:00.566 --> 00:18:07.496
We have a lot of listeners in several countries outside the US which have been a centre for The War

00:18:07.496 --> 00:18:14.276
on Drugs, so if you have a view on how it has affected you or your country, I would love to know.

00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:18.676
You can email hi Hi@leonardoenglish.com

00:18:19.962 --> 00:18:25.812
And finally, one of our recent new members, an awesome guy called Mykhailo from Ukraine told

00:18:25.812 --> 00:18:30.342
me that I should do more shout outs to celebrate the countries that new members have come from.

00:18:30.612 --> 00:18:31.512
So here we go.

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:38.142
We had Mykhailo from Ukraine, of course, but the past few weeks have seen new members joining

00:18:38.142 --> 00:18:45.762
from Germany, Italy, Oman, Spain, France, Ireland, Czech Republic, Turkey, and Thailand.

00:18:46.212 --> 00:18:51.702
I probably missed out a few and apologies if I have, but anyway, if you

00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:55.212
recognise your country there, then welcome, it's great to have you on board.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:19:00.575
And if you would like to join them and discover a more interesting way to improve your

00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:06.275

00:19:06.515 --> 00:19:12.315
and member only Q and A sessions, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:18.455

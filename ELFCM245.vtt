Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:17.887
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:22.257
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:30.317
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Robin Hood, the legendary outlaw.

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:36.707
Now, I’m sure that you’re all familiar with the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men from

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:45.047
the numerous films, books and TV series based on this heroic outlaw’s feats or achievements.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:51.357
Instead, what I’d like to focus on today is the True Story of Robin Hood.

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:58.377
In today’s episode we are going to go on a time-travelling journey back to 14th

00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:04.267
century England where we’ll unravel the traditional tale of Robin Hood against

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:11.653
a backdrop of rebellion, corruption, war and even a suspected royal muder.

00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:18.627
There’s plenty to discover, so it’s time to learn about The True Story of Robin Hood.

00:01:19.627 --> 00:01:23.707
The first question you might be asking yourself is whether

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:28.861
there is, indeed, any truth to the story of Robin Hood.

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.916
Was there actually a man called Robin Hood?

00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:35.991
Did he steal from the rich and give to the poor?

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.039
Was there a terrible Sheriff of Nottingham?

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.917
And, ultimately, is there any truth to this story?

00:01:42.017 --> 00:01:50.225
These are some excellent questions, to which historians don’t always agree on the answer.

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:56.410
But they are very interesting to explore, so that is what we are going to do in this episode.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.410
As with any mystery, we have to consider the evidence available to us if

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.940
we’re going to discover whether or not there really was a real Robin Hood.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.810
Today, the character that we call Robin Hood is known as Robin of Locksley.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.510
In modern versions, our noble born hero has been dispossessed of his property, his property

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.110
has been taken from him, while fighting abroad in the religious wars known as the Crusades.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.055
He becomes an outlaw, living in Sherwood Forest with his Merry Men, rescuing

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:46.455
his love interest Maid Marian from unwanted suitors, the men who want to marry

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:52.825
her and, perhaps most famously, stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:03:00.035
This familiar version of Robin Hood is actually very far removed, very

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:05.475
different to the earliest surviving text that we have about Robin Hood, a

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:11.925
text which dates back to the early 16th century called: A Gest of Robyn Hode.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.375
A gest, by the way, means an adventurous story.

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:22.625
This first record of Robin Hood provides us with plenty of

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:27.825
clues about the true story of Robin Hood, so let’s dive into it.

00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:35.755
The original version features a low-born freeman who, in typical fashion

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:42.835
for a hero of his time, commits plenty of gory, or bloody, crimes.

00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:49.915
This Robin Hood steals from the rich, the highly unpopular and greedy

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:55.495
abbot at St Mary’s Abbey, although he doesn’t really give to the poor.

00:03:56.835 --> 00:04:03.055
He does, however, adhere to a certain code of ethics, of moral

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:09.429
duty, in contrast to the money-grabbing clergymen, or monks, in St.

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:10.185
Mary’s Abbey.

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:16.585
While Robin Hood is presented as a low-born outlaw, a criminal,

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:22.635
living in Barnsdale Forest, he is also shown to have superior morals.

00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:30.595
What’s more, Robin Hood’s actions in the text have a restorative effect - he

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:37.665
rights wrongs through a sort of rough justice which highlights even further

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:44.435
the hypocritical, or the false, insincere, nature of the ruling classes.

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:51.975
In the Gest, in the original story, Robin Hood’s men bring a knight to dine with him.

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:58.213
When the knight is asked to pay for his meal, he tells the truth to Robin Hood - he

00:04:58.213 --> 00:05:05.033
has no money apart from the low amount of 10 shillings, a shilling being a

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:12.553
historical coin equivalent to twelve pence, a tiny and inadequate amount of money.

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:20.593
The knight goes on to tell Robin Hood of his misfortunes and how the abbot is about to seize his

00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:29.563
lands for a debt of £400 that must be repaid to the abbey before sunset, before the end of the day.

00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:36.313
Robin Hood asks if the knight has any friends who can help him with this debt.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.393
No, the knight replies.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:44.753
Before, when he was rich he had plenty of friends; now that he is poor, he has none.

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:50.063
Robin Hood then asks if he has anyone who could provide

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:54.603
collateral, as security that he will repay the debt.

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:57.503
No, the knight replies again.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:01.513
There is nobody who can provide him with any collateral,

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:05.593
except for the Virgin Mary who has never let him down.

00:06:06.823 --> 00:06:12.883
Robin Hood is deeply devoted to the Virgin Mary and upon hearing these words

00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:18.943
he immediately agrees to lend the knight the £400 that he so desperately needs.

00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:25.583
£400, by the way, would be today’s equivalent of hundreds of thousands of Euros.

00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:32.923
As the day begins to draw to a close, the greedy abbot is waiting for the

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:38.433
deadline to pass so that he can take the knight’s land and make a huge profit.

00:06:39.543 --> 00:06:46.023
However, thanks to Robin Hood, the knight arrives and repays the money just in time.

00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:52.863
Later on in the story when Robin Hood is awaiting his repayment from the knight,

00:06:53.253 --> 00:06:58.803
a monk passes through Barnsdale Forest and is stopped by Robin Hood’s men.

00:06:59.423 --> 00:07:07.333
He behaves discourteously, or impolitely, towards Robin Hood and lies about how much money he has.

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:15.773
Robin Hood finds out that the monk comes from St Mary’s Abbey and that he has £800

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:22.373
on him - Robin Hood takes this money from the monk, effectively doubling his money.

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:28.653
After all, the Virgin Mary was his collateral, so, to Robin Hood’s

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:32.913
eyes, the monk from St Mary’s had brought him his repayment.

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:40.953
When the knight finally arrives to repay his debt, Robin Hood refuses to accept the

00:07:40.953 --> 00:07:47.673
payment, saying that he has already been reimbursed, or repaid, by the monk from St Mary’s.

00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:54.990
What’s more, Robin Hood orders his men to pay the knight £400.

00:07:55.523 --> 00:08:02.773
All in all, Robin Hood does not gain or lose any money in the story, rather he rights the

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:09.543
wrongs by rewarding the truthful knight and taking from the greedy, disrespectful monks.

00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:14.193
The Gest also tells of how one of Robin Hood’s men,

00:08:14.713 --> 00:08:18.173
Little John, ends up serving the Sheriff of Nottingham.

00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:24.001
When Little John is poorly treated by the sheriff’s staff, he

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.610
retaliates, he reacts, and steals the sheriff’s silverware and his money.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.570
Little John gives the money and silverware to Robin Hood, then he tricks

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.720
the sheriff into an ambush, where Robin Hood and his men are lying in wait.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.240
After a night sleeping rough in the forest, Robin Hood allows the sheriff to leave

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.140
provided that he swears never to harm Robin Hood or his men again, which he does.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.280
Later in the story, the Sheriff of Nottingham breaks his

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.170
oath, his promise, not to harm Robin Hood and his men.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:08.950
The sheriff organises an archery competition in an attempt to capture Robin Hood.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.500
However, Robin Hood manages to escape and seeks refuge, he

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.100
seeks shelter, with the same knight that he previously helped.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.690
This knight is captured by the sheriff, before being rescued by Robin Hood.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.620
With news of an uprising spreading and Robin Hood’s increasing notoriety, or

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.560
infamy, being famous for the wrong reasons, the King ends up travelling to the area.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:43.580
Upon meeting Robin Hood in disguise, the King grants mercy to Robin

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.970
Hood, he pardons him, as well as his followers and the knight.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.810
Robin Hood enters the King’s service as an archer and joins the Royal Court.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.850
A year later, homesick Robin Hood returns to visit Barnsdale

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.740
Forest, only to be killed by the Prioress of Kirklees.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.880
The prioress is, in fact, a relative of Robin Hood.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:17.010
She rather gruesomely lets him slowly bleed to death when he seeks medical treatment at her priory.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:24.530
Now, this is a very basic summary of the earliest surviving text about Robin Hood, but

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:31.980
we can already identify plenty of clues that can help us to narrow down our search for

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.030
the real Robin Hood, and we can come up with a fairly precise historical time and place.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:46.720
These details will allow us to ascertain, or to make sure, to verify, whether or

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.250
not some of the most popular real life Robin Hood suspects are indeed plausible.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.780
As you may have noticed earlier, the location we are

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.590
looking for is not Sherwood Forest, but Barnsdale Forest.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:10.110
For reference, Barnsdale is an area in South and West Yorkshire, not so far from Nottingham.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.520
While the original text is clear about the location,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.880
coming up with a date requires a bit of detective work.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.610
Let’s put together the pieces of the puzzle.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.300
Robin Hood, even in today’s version, is a highly skilled archer and much is

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.510
made of his archery skills, they are admired, and highly desirable qualities.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.790
So, we are looking for a time when archery really started

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.570
to take off, when it was a sought-after skill in Britain.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:51.830
To narrow things down further, let's add in an important detail from the Gest.

00:11:52.473 --> 00:11:55.693
We are also told that the King is in the area.

00:11:56.003 --> 00:12:01.713
So, if we can find any evidence of a King visiting near to the

00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:06.133
Barnsdale area, we’ll have a good idea of when the story is set.

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:15.463
On the 16th March 1322, some 60 km north of Barnsdale, there was a large

00:12:15.517 --> 00:12:21.263
battle called the Battle of Boroughbridge, where a group of rebellious barons,

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:27.170
headed by a man called Thomas of Lancaster, fought against King Edward II.

00:12:27.725 --> 00:12:34.585
King Edward II of England had a short, disastrous reign that ended in his forced abdication

00:12:34.905 --> 00:12:43.285
in 1327, when he was made to renounce or give up his throne in favour of his son, Edward III.

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:49.575
He was subsequently held prisoner before dying in uncertain

00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:55.585
circumstances at Berkeley Castle later on that year, in 1327.

00:12:56.205 --> 00:13:00.148
Anyway, back to Boroughbridge, back to the battle of Boroughbridge,

00:13:00.637 --> 00:13:06.115
Thomas of Lancaster lost the battle, in part due to heavy archery

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:11.315
fire from the King’s longbowmen, as well as being greatly outnumbered.

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:18.605
He was taken to Pontefract Castle, a nearby castle, where he was executed.

00:13:19.115 --> 00:13:26.705
I know that’s a lot of names and details for you, but it is important to our quest for the truth.

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:34.265
The reason I shared this with you is that all of this proves, or suggests, that the King

00:13:34.395 --> 00:13:41.515
was in the area in 1322 with his archers, which lends credibility to the story that the

00:13:41.515 --> 00:13:47.835
real Robin Hood was actually pardoned, he was forgiven, and then recruited by the King.

00:13:49.045 --> 00:13:53.985
With a clear date and precise location backed up by historical

00:13:53.985 --> 00:13:58.045
records, we are a step closer to finding the real Robin Hood.

00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:03.915
Out of all of the possible suggestions that have been made by historians

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:09.655
as to who the real Robin Hood could be, only one person really fits in

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:14.385
with both the earliest surviving text and the matching historical data.

00:14:15.035 --> 00:14:20.245
And that person is… a man named Robert Hood of Wakefield.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:27.805
Obviously, we cannot be 100% certain, but in terms of making a plausible guess, Robert

00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:33.915
Hood of Wakefield is a prime suspect, he is one of the best matches that we have.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:40.115
Robin was a common diminutive or familiar name for Robert.

00:14:40.585 --> 00:14:44.915
And if you are wondering about Wakefield, well that also fits

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:48.715
in perfectly, being located just north west of Barnsdale.

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:57.865
So, if there is a good chance of Robin Hood having been a real person, Robert Hood of Wakefield is

00:14:57.865 --> 00:15:04.675
as close as we’re going to get to finding him, short of discovering any new miraculous evidence.

00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:11.365
That said, while Robert Hood may be our best bet, that is our most

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:16.575
probable choice, there are a couple of other contenders who also have some

00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:22.525
interesting details with similarities to the Gest or the historical data.

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:31.085
A man called Robert Hod of York features in legal records dating back to 1226.

00:15:32.005 --> 00:15:36.885
While this is a lot earlier than the time frame we were originally considering,

00:15:37.266 --> 00:15:41.968
there is written evidence that this Robert Hod became an outlaw after

00:15:42.188 --> 00:15:46.458
his possessions were confiscated to pay back money that he owed to St.

00:15:46.508 --> 00:15:49.368
Peter’s, the largest church in York.

00:15:50.358 --> 00:15:55.738
So, while Robert Hod of York is a slightly less plausible character

00:15:56.118 --> 00:16:00.578
than Robert Hood of Wakefield, he was actually a confirmed outlaw.

00:16:01.818 --> 00:16:06.658
Robert Hod of York could very well have been Robin Hood’s namesake,

00:16:06.868 --> 00:16:11.798
providing the name and inspiration for Robin Hood as a fictional character.

00:16:13.158 --> 00:16:16.428
Another historical outlaw who could have provided

00:16:16.438 --> 00:16:21.278
inspiration for a fictional Robin Hood is Roger Godberd.

00:16:22.478 --> 00:16:28.258
While his surname, Godberd, is a lot further away from our hero’s compared

00:16:28.268 --> 00:16:33.008
to the previous two suspects, there are numerous parallels between

00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:37.698
his real life career as an outlaw and the details given in the Gest.

00:16:39.508 --> 00:16:45.478
For example, Godberd had numerous men at his call in the forest where he was hiding

00:16:45.478 --> 00:16:51.208
out and just like Robin Hood, Godberd was wanted by the Sheriff of Nottingham.

00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:59.778
The sheriff’s men captured him in 1272 but Godberd managed to escape, thanks

00:16:59.788 --> 00:17:04.628
to the help of a local knight, not unlike the knight in the Gest of Robin Hood.

00:17:05.168 --> 00:17:09.738
However, Godberd was eventually captured again and imprisoned.

00:17:11.078 --> 00:17:15.298
Godberd was later pardoned by the King, as was Robin Hood.

00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:23.648
So, while Robin Hood is by no means a carbon copy, a clone, of Godberd, there is no denying

00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:30.528
that the tale of Robin Hood has a lot of striking similarities with the life of Roger Godberd.

00:17:31.308 --> 00:17:38.858
Alternatively, another inspirational figure for the Robin Hood legend is a certain Robert Deyville.

00:17:39.578 --> 00:17:44.358
Along with his brother and their kinsmen, their relatives, the Deyvilles

00:17:44.388 --> 00:17:49.078
were linked to the Barnesdale area and there is also a mention of

00:17:49.078 --> 00:17:54.088
a settlement of a £400 mortgage, the same figure as in the Gest.

00:17:55.638 --> 00:18:00.488
Lastly, Robert Deyville’s fortified home in North Yorkshire, at a place

00:18:00.488 --> 00:18:05.818
called Hood Hill, could have been an inspiration for the name of Robin Hood.

00:18:06.888 --> 00:18:10.688
Of course, there is also the possibility that the name Robin

00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:14.798
Hood was an alias, or another name that was used for an outlaw.

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:21.448
This could also tie in with earlier suggestions of actual real life people who

00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:26.738
may well have provided the basis for the story of Robin Hood, and that all of

00:18:26.748 --> 00:18:31.631
these people were possible inspirational figures for the Tale of Robin Hood.

00:18:32.668 --> 00:18:37.443
The fact that we do not know whether or not he actually existed adds to

00:18:37.528 --> 00:18:42.708
his appeal, and both the man and his story have become the stuff of legend.

00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:49.738
A legend that each new generation has sculpted to suit their times, adapted

00:18:49.888 --> 00:18:55.998
to suit modern tastes but with a basis in the original text, in the Gest.

00:18:56.548 --> 00:19:04.008
And no matter how the story is adapted, the legend of Robin Hood is a persistently appealing story.

00:19:04.548 --> 00:19:09.348
Sure, he is an outlaw, a criminal, and especially in some of the

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:14.538
earlier editions, he could be vicious, deliberately violent and cruel.

00:19:15.398 --> 00:19:19.178
But there is a moral element to his story.

00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:26.278
In early editions it was a semi-religious element, as we can see from his devotion

00:19:26.478 --> 00:19:32.128
to the Virgin Mary, and in later editions it’s simply about redistributing

00:19:32.158 --> 00:19:37.258
property, or wealth, from those who don’t deserve it to those who do.

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:44.448
The success of the Robin Hood legend comes from the fact that the figures of authority

00:19:44.598 --> 00:19:51.078
and supposed virtue in all of the stories are all worse than Robin Hood himself.

00:19:51.918 --> 00:19:58.588
Robin Hood is presented as being an outlaw but those who control the laws

00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:04.938
are hopelessly corrupt and devoid of, or with a complete lack of, virtue.

00:20:05.888 --> 00:20:08.718
None more so than the greedy monks.

00:20:09.378 --> 00:20:14.348
In 16th century England, like in much of Europe, the church

00:20:14.368 --> 00:20:18.738
and appointed officials, mainly sheriffs, held all the power.

00:20:19.378 --> 00:20:25.148
To a contemporary audience, clergy and officials were fair game; it

00:20:25.148 --> 00:20:30.498
was acceptable to make fun of or criticise them because of the sheer

00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:35.278
amount of power they held, and for their reputation for corruption.

00:20:36.678 --> 00:20:43.508
By portraying the clergy and officials as inadequate hypocrites, as being false and

00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:50.758
unable to fairly rule, the story of Robin Hood pokes fun at these almighty, powerful

00:20:50.758 --> 00:20:56.868
characters, allowing the audience to have a laugh at their expense, or directly at them.

00:20:57.891 --> 00:21:03.901
What’s more, the way the haughty, overly proud monks act, makes them appear

00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:08.781
to deserve what they get when Robin steals from them or humiliates them.

00:21:09.771 --> 00:21:15.811
The incompetence of the Sheriff of Nottingham and any other authoritative characters,

00:21:16.111 --> 00:21:22.361
alongside their scheming and secret plans, makes them appear ridiculous, laughable.

00:21:23.521 --> 00:21:30.301
Robin Hood, on the other hand, despite technically being a criminal, is admired by the reader.

00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:37.191
He is honest, fair, clever and brave - he’s everything that the monks are not.

00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:39.951
He is the true hero of the story.

00:21:40.811 --> 00:21:45.201
And whether or not he ever actually existed, the Legend

00:21:45.211 --> 00:21:48.701
of Robin Hood is still alive and kicking centuries later.

00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:55.345
So, with dozens of on-screen adaptations, and no doubt more adaptations to come in the

00:21:55.345 --> 00:22:01.705
future, there is no sign that the Legend of Robin Hood is losing its popularity any time soon.

00:22:04.221 --> 00:22:09.995
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The True Story of Robin Hood.

00:22:10.625 --> 00:22:14.255
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned a bit about

00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:18.665
the truth, or at least some of the possible truths, behind this story.

00:22:19.615 --> 00:22:23.215
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:23.695 --> 00:22:28.525
Do you have any theories on whether or not there was ever a real Robin Hood?

00:22:29.325 --> 00:22:31.845
Who do you think is the most probable subject?

00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:36.295
Do you have versions of a Robin Hood story, of someone who

00:22:36.295 --> 00:22:39.705
steals from the rich and gives to the poor, in your country?

00:22:40.215 --> 00:22:43.905
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.189
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.229
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.500
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Adam Smith.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.410
He is, by many people’s standards, the father of modern economics, and his thoughts

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.769
and ideas have proved to be a foundation for much of the modern global economy.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:44.860
So, in this episode we’ll explore Smith himself, his most famous ideas

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.330
and papers, and look how he has influenced the world we live in today.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.060
Let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.200
In the cult American TV Series, The Wire, there is a drug kingpin called Stringer Bell.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.600
He has been investigated by a detective called McNulty, who

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.199
presumes that Stringer Bell is like every other drug dealer.

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:19.630
At the end of Season 3, McNulty manages to get into Stringer Bell’s Baltimore apartment.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.199
He opens the door, and is surprised to find an immaculately kept and very tasteful apartment:

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.900
expensive furniture, a set of ornamental Japanese swords, and a well-stocked bookshelf.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.310
He wanders over to the bookshelf, and pulls out a leather-bound book.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:51.970
He turns to his colleague, confused, and utters the immortal line, “who the fuck was I chasing?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.750
The camera pans down and the name of the book is revealed: “The Wealth of Nations”, by Adam Smith.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.759
This book was published in 1776 by a Scottish philosopher and academic,

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:15.230
so what was it doing in the house of a drug dealer in inner Baltimore?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.470
Well, the inclusion of the book is to show us, the viewer, that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.440
Stringer Bell was far from your run of the mill, average, drug dealer.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.320
He was interested in learning everything he could about business and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.100
economics, and there was no better manual about how to do this than the

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:44.060
dense and unforgiving 18th-century book written in a coastal Scottish town.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.400
Indeed, Stringer Bell saw that the world around him, not just the illegal world of drug dealing

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.050
and crime but the entire economy, it was all based on the ideas in The Wealth of Nations.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.540
So let us channel our inner Stringer, at least the legal parts,

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.970
and dive into the story of this book and its author, Adam Smith.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.179
Adam Smith was born in 1723 in the town of Kirkcaldy, in Scotland.

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:23.279
He was clearly a gifted young man, and won a scholarship to the University of Glasgow at the

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:30.930
age of 14 to study moral philosophy, before transferring to Oxford University at the age of 17.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.999
You might have thought that this move from Glasgow to Oxford would have ignited the young

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.790
man, as he studied at one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the entire world.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.780
But it didn’t.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.870
Smith found the teaching at Oxford to be uninspiring and dull, and instead

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.339
of engaging in intense debate with his professors and fellow students, he

00:03:56.339 --> 00:04:00.890
spent most of the time devouring the books in Oxford’s Bodleian Library.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.739
Smith had in fact found Glasgow University to be a much more stimulating place.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.163
At Glasgow, Smith had been taught by wonderful teachers, people who would go on to have an influence

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:22.313
on him for the rest of his life, and he found his teachers at Oxford dull and lazy in comparison.

00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:29.293
This might seem strange to hear, but remember that Scotland was, at the time,

00:04:29.723 --> 00:04:33.953
perhaps even more of a centre of scholarship and Enlightenment thought than England,

00:04:34.413 --> 00:04:39.473
and it produced many brilliant Enlightenment minds in addition to Adam Smith.

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:47.723
Smith returned to his home country in 1746, at the age of 23, after suffering what

00:04:47.733 --> 00:04:52.633
some people think must have been some kind of mental breakdown at Oxford University.

00:04:53.903 --> 00:04:57.933
On his return, his academic career went from strength to strength.

00:04:58.523 --> 00:05:03.083
He gave well-received lectures, won a position at his alma mater, Glasgow

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:09.613
University, in 1751, and became the Head of Moral Philosophy a couple of years later.

00:05:10.673 --> 00:05:13.993
Importantly, moral philosophy, not economics.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:17.953
Economics as a standalone discipline didn’t exist.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:27.063
And let’s also remember, he was only born in 1723, so all of this happened before his 30th birthday.

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:33.614
He published his first book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, in 1759.

00:05:34.493 --> 00:05:39.422
We aren’t going to focus on this one today, but it was very well-received, and

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:44.352
cemented his reputation as one of the most brilliant moral philosophers of his day.

00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:51.332
His reputation grew to such an extent that students would enrol at the University

00:05:51.332 --> 00:05:58.432
of Glasgow just to be taught by him, so he was an early sort of celebrity professor.

00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:06.552
Surprisingly, perhaps, he packed it all in 1764 to become a private

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:10.822
tutor, he quit university teaching to become a private teacher.

00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:19.292
Now, you might think it somewhat strange for a wildly popular university professor to change

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:26.062
career and become a private tutor, but he would not become any old private tutor; the offer

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:33.612
he had was to be the private tutor of a man called Henry Scott, a young Scottish nobleman and

00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:39.255
the stepson of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Finance essentially.

00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:47.074
The idea was that Scott was being groomed for a major political role, and Smith

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:52.654
was the best person in the country to educate him on politics and philosophy.

00:06:53.774 --> 00:06:59.634
Smith accepted this offer, not only because it would double his pay, but also because

00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:04.284
it would offer him opportunities that he might not have as a university professor.

00:07:05.804 --> 00:07:11.494
Given the political and international ambitions that people clearly had for the young Scott,

00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:17.774
one of the first things that Adam Smith and Henry Scott did was go on a large European

00:07:17.794 --> 00:07:23.054
tour, where the pair met Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

00:07:24.134 --> 00:07:29.044
They also met François Quesnay and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, who were the most

00:07:29.094 --> 00:07:34.294
prominent voices behind an economic theory called The Physiocrat movement, a theory

00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:39.464
that resonated strongly with Smith and would go on to influence his later work.

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:46.054
The trip was two years in, but it was cut short after Henry Scott’s

00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:50.974
brother fell ill and died, and all the travellers had to return to Britain.

00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:57.354
Fortunately for Adam Smith, part of the tutoring deal was that he would get a

00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:03.084
generous lifelong pension after it was complete, so he had no need to work again.

00:08:04.434 --> 00:08:10.954
But, being a Scottish intellectual and moral philosopher, Smith didn’t do the 18th century

00:08:10.954 --> 00:08:17.364
equivalent of sipping margaritas on a Mexican beach; he retreated to his hometown of

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:23.584
Kirkcaldy in Scotland to start writing his magnum opus, the book that Detective McNulty would

00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:28.724
find on Stringer Bell’s bookshelf a couple of hundred years later, The Wealth of Nations.

00:08:30.314 --> 00:08:35.394
It took him 9 years, but it would go on to be, by many

00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:39.804
standards, the most influential book on economics in history.

00:08:41.374 --> 00:08:46.914
In it, Smith brought together his decades of experience studying and teaching moral

00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:52.414
philosophy and ethics, as well as discussions and exchange of letters with intellectuals and

00:08:52.424 --> 00:08:59.014
thinkers from all over Europe all about the nature of where a country’s wealth comes from.

00:09:00.314 --> 00:09:06.264
Now, a lot of what Smith writes about in the book might seem obvious to me

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:10.844
and you, because we live in a world that comes from the ideas in his book.

00:09:11.464 --> 00:09:14.024
But it certainly wasn’t at the time.

00:09:15.584 --> 00:09:19.104
Before Smith, the dominant view of how economies

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:22.184
worked was something called the Mercantilist system.

00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:28.664
In this system, the “value” of an economy could be measured by how

00:09:28.664 --> 00:09:32.874
much gold and silver a country had to buy the goods that it needed.

00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:39.104
It didn’t really address how the goods were produced or the human motivation behind

00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:44.804
the process; the only important thing was the value of the money inside the economy.

00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:50.134
Smith’s innovation, or divergence from this path,

00:09:50.744 --> 00:09:53.414
was to link wealth more closely to living standards.

00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:59.907
In The Wealth of Nations, Smith suggested that the traditional view of wealth in the

00:09:59.907 --> 00:10:05.607
Mercantilist system was not appropriate for the rapidly industrialising world in which he lived.

00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:13.707
Mercantilism, the dominant economic theory before Smith, posited that a country's wealth was

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:19.657
measured by its stock of gold and silver, which was often accumulated through trade surpluses.

00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:25.377
In other words, economic policy was geared towards exporting more

00:10:25.377 --> 00:10:29.397
than importing, therefore hoarding precious metals or “wealth”.

00:10:30.687 --> 00:10:39.517
As such, global trade was a zero-sum game: one country’s gain was another’s loss, so it was all

00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:45.667
about collecting and hoarding as much gold and silver as possible; this was how wealth was created.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.060
Smith, on the other hand, introduced a new understanding of wealth creation.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:59.670
He argued that wealth wasn't just about accumulating gold and silver, but about increasing

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.260
production efficiency and, consequently, the total output of goods and services.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.680
In other words, wealth creation didn’t need to come at the expense of

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.080
another country; it could come directly from productivity increases.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.490
The most prominent example of this in his book was the theory of the division

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:28.530
of labour, that if work is divided into separate parts, productivity increases.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.920
Smith used the example of the process of making a pin to demonstrate this.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.680
A pin is the thin piece of metal with a sharp point at one end and a round head

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.520
at the other, which is particularly useful for attaching pieces of cloth together,

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.930
so it was a small but vital component of the huge British garment industry.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.000
Smith wrote that one person who was tasked with making an entire

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.810
pin might be able to make one pin per day if they really tried.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:10.900
But if each step of making a pin was given to a different person, they could focus on that

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:17.730
particular part of the process, and the entire pin-making process would be much more efficient.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.050
By Smith’s estimate, at its most efficient, a worker would go from being able

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:29.330
to make one single pin in a day if doing it on their own to being able to make

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:35.900
4,800 pins a day if doing it as part of a divided, industrialised process.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.770
Now, this might seem blindingly obvious to us now, and it’s certainly

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:46.070
not the case that people before Smith hadn’t figured out that splitting

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.440
processes into smaller parts was often a more efficient way of doing it.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.460
The important thing about this theory of the division of labour was that that

00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:01.510
it proved that value could be created by productivity increases, not just

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.880
by running a trade surplus, by a country exporting more than it imported.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.000
Another key idea in The Wealth of Nations was that government

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.480
regulation and intervention in the economy should be limited.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.890
In other words, trade should be free.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:26.150
Again, this might seem like an obvious concept to us, but it certainly wasn’t at the time.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.690
At the time, British trade was dominated by The East India Company, which was

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:38.089
essentially a state-sponsored and regulated quasi-governmental private company.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:44.559
It was responsible for a staggering 50% of global trade at the time, and

00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:49.049
enjoyed substantial protections and favourable treatment from the British state.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:57.129
Smith argued that this type of state intervention in a market was in fact damaging to an economy.

00:13:58.419 --> 00:14:03.569
Instead, he introduced the concept of an “invisible hand”, and that

00:14:03.579 --> 00:14:08.389
markets were self-regulating; they didn’t need government intervention.

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:16.119
This “invisible hand” is the idea that humans are self-interested; they take

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:22.429
actions because those actions will result in positive outcomes for them, and, in a

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:27.589
functioning free market economy, these actions will also be good for other people.

00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:33.169
In other words, there is an invisible force that naturally pushes

00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:37.419
people in the right direction; the government doesn’t need to intervene.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:44.319
This probably all sounds very theoretical, so let’s take a practical example.

00:14:45.589 --> 00:14:50.840
In a village without a bakery, someone might think, “I’m going to start a bakery”.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.270
They aren’t doing this because they are passionate about baking bread; they do

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.770
it because they see that there is demand for it and they can make money from it.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.020
They open a bakery, people start going to it because they want

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.980
to buy bread, and the baker earns money to make a good living.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:15.190
If the baker charges too much for the bread, or the bread is bad quality,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:20.550
people won’t buy it, or perhaps someone will start another bakery and charge

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.670
less for the same bread or make better-tasting bread for the same price.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.560
The point is that there is no value in the government saying “someone must start a bakery

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:38.280
here” or “the price of bread cannot exceed x or go below y” or “bread must taste like this”.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:44.640
There are invisible market forces, this “invisible hand”, that serves this purpose.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:52.070
And again, this might sound obvious to us now, but it certainly wasn’t in an era when the government

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.200
intervened in everything from the price of goods to the types of industries that could operate.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.790
Smith's invisible hand theory was revolutionary because it suggested that government

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:09.250
interventions were not only unnecessary but could also be counterproductive.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.560
By allowing the free market to operate, resources would be allocated more

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.320
efficiently and effectively than any government could manage through regulation.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.730
Now, there were some areas which Smith said still required government intervention:

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.620
primarily producing and protecting public goods that the free market would have

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.910
limited incentive to produce on its own, such as public parks and libraries, and so on.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.330
And the government still should enforce the laws of private property and personal

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.840
freedom, as well as protect the country through having a standing army, but it

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.550
shouldn’t really get involved with much else; the free market would take care of it.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.150
Now, The Wealth of Nations is over 1,000 pages long and packed with

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.020
lots of different ideas and nuance, so I hope you’ll forgive the brevity

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.230
of this summary, but we need to move on to talk about its legacy.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.370
The fact that so many of the ideas in the book seem obvious

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.810
to us now is an indication of quite how important it is.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:24.720
We live in a globalised world of free trade based largely on the ideas in The Wealth of Nations.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.110
Smith practically invented the discipline of the study of economics and

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.760
The Wealth of Nations is required reading for any good economics student.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.850
And his pro free trade stance became increasingly popular

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.760
in the years after the publication of The Wealth of Nations.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.100
It was highly influential when it came to the founding of the United States, and

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:54.090
throughout the 19th and 20th centuries countries adopted a more market-driven

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:59.860
approach to economic planning, allowing the invisible hand and the self-interest of

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:05.350
individual actors to lead economic growth with less and less government interference.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.730
Of course, this has not always led to positive outcomes, and critics of Smith’s

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.510
economic theory point to this increasing economic inequality as the rich accumulate

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:23.440
more capital and power while the poor and working classes often struggle to keep pace.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.670
And modern critics would certainly argue that, while free markets can drive

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.720
innovation and growth, they also require careful regulation to prevent monopolies,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:40.490
exploitation, and systemic imbalance that can lead to social and economic injustice.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.830
Moreover, there's still a clear political divide over the extent to which

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.840
government intervention is necessary, but everyone apart from the most

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.710
devout libertarians agree that some government intervention is necessary.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.650
In other words, the market should be free but not completely free.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.140
Adam Smith died in 1790, at the age of 67.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.630
On his deathbed, it is remembered that he only wished he could have achieved more.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:17.943
Well, at the time of his death, the output of the global economy was less than $1 trillion.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:24.280
In 2023, it is projected to be over $100 trillion, a 100 times

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.050
increase, while the population has increased by only 10 times.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.370
Of course, this wealth of nations is far from equally distributed, with some countries

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.760
having experienced spectacular economic growth and prosperity while others have not.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.000
But if Smith were alive to see it, he would no doubt be impressed, in the

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.780
literal sense, by the interconnectedness of the global marketplace, the

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:56.550
invisible hands pushing and pulling, from Beijing to Beirut, Cairo to Chicago.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:02.960
And if he went to the site of his old house, in High Street Kirkcaldy in Scotland,

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:08.680
he might be interested to see the impact of globalisation, and of the free market.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.330
When he was writing The Wealth of Nations, back in the 18th century, he

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.450
might have been lucky to have a pub within walking distance from his house.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:25.420
Now, opposite he would find an Indian restaurant, a Turkish barber and a kebab shop.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:31.410
Under his window he would find a nail salon, and next door he’d find a

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.230
deserted shop, lying empty because clearly there isn’t enough demand for it.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.480
I like to think that, if he saw this he might smile,

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.740
and think “beautiful, my beloved free market in action”.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.590
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Adam Smith, the father of modern

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.900
economics and a man whose thoughts and ideas affect each and every one of us.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.410
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.190
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.000
What do you think are some of the limitations of free market economics?

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.660
Where do you think the government needs to intervene, and what are some

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.660
examples of how the government has and hasn’t done this in your country?

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.120
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

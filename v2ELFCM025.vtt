Hello hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:12.854
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.711
I'm actually recording this podcast on February the first.

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.951
Why am I telling you this at the start of the show?

00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:29.831
Well, because the UK technically left the European Union at midnight on January the 31st, yesterday,

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:37.406
and that might prove to be a very relevant thing for what we are going to be talking about today.

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:43.752
In today's podcast, we are going to talk about the difference between the

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:49.332
UK, Great Britain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:57.762
England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the British Isles.

00:00:59.562 --> 00:01:05.952
Now, you might be sort of aware of this already, but I guess for you this is

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:13.722
probably a point of confusion and me just listing out all of the countries just now

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:19.422
probably hasn't made life any easier and you aren't any clearer on the difference.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.556
If I asked you now, what's the difference between the

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:26.396
UK and Great Britain, would you be able to tell me?

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:34.376
It's certainly something that lots of people in the UK are confused about, and if you were

00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:41.246
to stop someone on the side of the street in London, Manchester, or Liverpool, I would

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:47.366
imagine the majority of people wouldn't be able to tell you exactly what the difference was.

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:53.901
So the difference between the UK and Great Britain is a bit of a tricky one.

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:58.311
I'll explain exactly why and what the difference is in the little bit.

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:05.576
An easier one is the difference between England and Great Britain, or Scotland and the UK.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:10.976
I imagine that you might know this already or maybe you don't.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.813
Believe it or not, it's not just native speakers who don't know there's difference.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.863
It's something that lots of Americans frequently

00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:26.903
get wrong using Britain and England interchangeably.

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:33.580
Now, of course, I shouldn't generalise about Americans and obviously there are many,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.070
many who don't fit this, but it is a little bit of a theme, a bit of a stereotype.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.190
So today let's clear things up and explain how there are four different countries and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.495
sometimes even five different countries that people put together as one, so if you weren't

00:02:55.495 --> 00:03:01.210
100% sure on the difference, by the end of this podcast, you'll know exactly what the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:09.220
difference is, how this happened, and we'll take a minute just to think about how long this

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.640
explanation may stay relevant for in light of the UKs decision to leave the European Union.

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:22.995
So let's start by explaining exactly what the differences are and then

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:29.235
I'll explain how we got to this admittedly pretty confusing situation.

00:03:30.452 --> 00:03:36.018
The UK and Great Britain are often used as synonyms, people use

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:40.068
them interchangeably, assuming that they mean the same thing.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.173
But this isn't actually correct.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.513
They are two different things.

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:52.981
A useful thing to do here is to pull up a map of Britain on your phone, or if you

00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:58.471
don't need to do that, just picture, just imagine the British Isles, the collection

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:04.516
of islands to the North of France that form England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:10.535
Of the two larger islands, Great Britain is actually just the big

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:17.585
one on the right, and it's not technically a country, it's an island.

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:22.485
So Island with an I S not Ireland as in I.

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:22.792
R.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:23.407
E L.

00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:23.557
A.

00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:25.694
N.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:25.582
D.

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.242
Great Britain isn't actually a country.

00:04:29.272 --> 00:04:37.582
The country, the sovereign state is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which

00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:44.512
includes Northern Ireland, so that's the six counties to the north of the Republic of Ireland.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:49.702
So the country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:55.912
Ireland, and it is formed of four different countries: England, Scotland,

00:04:56.122 --> 00:05:01.762
Wales, and Northern Ireland, which are all themselves countries.

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:03.382
Huh?

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:07.012
I wouldn't blame you for being a little bit confused.

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:14.122
You can't normally have a country within another country, so how does this work?

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:19.952
Well, the way to think of it is probably something similar

00:05:19.982 --> 00:05:24.242
to how different states work in the United States of America.

00:05:25.322 --> 00:05:27.792
There are some different laws that apply.

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:34.412
Scotland and Wales, for example, have their own parliament and have power over things

00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:41.932
like health and education, but they ultimately fall under control of the government of the

00:05:41.932 --> 00:05:48.142
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is normally shortened to the UK.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.642
So how did this all come about?

00:05:53.302 --> 00:05:59.842
Well, the British Isles by which I'm referring here to Great Britain and

00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:05.512
Ireland, they've got a pretty long and complicated history, as you may know.

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:16.089
To summarise, the creation of what we now know as the UK came to be after a series of key events.

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:28.704
Firstly, in the year 925 AD the Kingdom of England was formed after the unification, the union, of

00:06:28.884 --> 00:06:36.684
Anglo Saxon tribes, so that's the group of people who had lived in Britain since the fifth century.

00:06:37.974 --> 00:06:42.774
They united and formed England as its own kingdom.

00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:51.117
Then in 1536 after the Kingdom of England had been in existence for 600 years, more or

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:58.570
less, England decided to expand its kingdom and King Henry the Eighth, you might remember

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:05.140
him as the King who was quite keen, who quite liked removing his wives heads from their

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:12.190
bodies, he effectively made England and Wales the same country, governed by the same laws.

00:07:12.712 --> 00:07:16.631
So that was one country, the Kingdom of England and Wales.

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:21.582
At least from the point of view of what we're talking about today there

00:07:21.582 --> 00:07:29.892
weren't any major changes until 1707 when the Kingdom of Great Britain was

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:35.472
formed after the Kingdom of England and Wales joined the Kingdom of Scotland.

00:07:37.277 --> 00:07:43.689
Then just under a hundred years later, in 1801, Ireland joined the

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:48.789
union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed.

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:56.009
So this made both of the big islands, so island, not Ireland, one united country.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:01.339
If you've really been paying attention though, you'll note that this is

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:06.799
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, not the United Kingdom

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:10.429
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is what we have now.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.129
So what's the difference?

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:19.549
Well, the reason for this is that in 1922 the Republic of

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:25.189
Ireland, what we now know as Ireland withdrew from the union.

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:31.159
It gained independence leaving just the northern counties of Ireland in the

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:35.389
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is what we have today.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.639
So just to recap, because I appreciate that's quite a lot

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:43.039
of information and it could be a little bit confusing.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:48.619
The sovereign state, the official country, is the United Kingdom

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:52.699
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is comprised of four

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.929
different countries, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:03.298
The British Isles is the name given for all of the islands in the

00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:07.108
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Ireland.

00:09:08.458 --> 00:09:11.488
There are two big ones, so if you look at it map, it might seem

00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:16.813
like there's just two - Great Britain, and Ireland, but the British

00:09:16.813 --> 00:09:21.973
Isles are actually comprised of 6,000 different little islands.

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:26.706
To make matters even more confusing, not all of the

00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:30.576
islands in the British Isles are part of Great Britain.

00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:36.351
They include three what's called crown dependencies.

00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:41.961
So that's the Isle of Man, the bailiwick of Guernsey and the bailiwick

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:46.731
of Jersey, which are self-governing possessions of the crown.

00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:52.251
They are owned by the Queen, the Royal family, so

00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:55.671
they are sort of part of the UK, but technically not.

00:09:56.751 --> 00:10:01.011
Yes, I know it's pretty confusing, and in fact, we're not going to go into huge

00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:06.501
detail on these crown dependencies because it would take quite a long time and

00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:11.451
perhaps not be that interesting, so let's leave it there with the crown dependencies.

00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:12.361
Okay.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:19.531
So that is a quick explanation of how this slightly complicated situation came to be, and

00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:25.801
I would completely forgive you for not having known the difference before this podcast.

00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:30.751
As I said, the majority of people in the UK also wouldn't know the difference.

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:36.088
Now it's time to answer a few questions that you may have about all of this.

00:10:36.028 --> 00:10:39.895
Firstly, why is Great Britain called great?

00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:45.055
We don't have great Spain, great Russia or great Italy.

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:50.023
And there are actually two conflicting arguments, two

00:10:50.023 --> 00:10:55.123
theories about why great was stuck in front of Britain.

00:10:56.128 --> 00:11:03.457
The first theory is that great is used to distinguish Britain from its

00:11:03.477 --> 00:11:09.342
similarly sounding, but much smaller French neighbour, brittany, which is a

00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:13.632
province in the North of France, Bretagne for the French speakers out there.

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:18.934
So the idea was that they wanted to make Britain seem different from Brittany.

00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:27.557
The second reason, the second theory is that it was due to the ego of a certain

00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:32.822
King James the First, who was actually the first King of England and Scotland.

00:11:33.407 --> 00:11:37.664
He was King of both countries, England and Wales and Scotland

00:11:38.024 --> 00:11:41.594
at the same time, even when they were independent countries.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.520
He wanted to make it abundantly clear that he wasn't just the King of the old

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:54.360
Roman Britain, which only included England and some of Wales, but of the entire

00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:00.240
island, and therefore he referred to himself as the King of Great Britain.

00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:06.318
The second question you might have is from a sporting point of view.

00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:13.382
If England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales aren't real countries, they aren't

00:12:13.382 --> 00:12:19.562
real sovereign states, then how come they are allowed to play in sporting world cups?

00:12:20.432 --> 00:12:23.942
And why does Great Britain compete in the Olympics,

00:12:24.062 --> 00:12:27.632
not England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:32.642
And why is the Olympic team called Great Britain, not

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:35.972
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?

00:12:37.472 --> 00:12:44.072
Well for the Olympics it is because the Olympic committee only recognises teams

00:12:44.072 --> 00:12:50.462
from passport-issuing countries and as England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern

00:12:50.462 --> 00:12:57.512
Ireland all have the UK passport then they all form part of the UK Olympic team.

00:12:58.752 --> 00:13:06.582
But yes, it is called team GB, not team UK, which is confusing even for people in the UK.

00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:13.902
Actually, the technical term for the Olympic team is "the Great Britain and

00:13:13.902 --> 00:13:18.492
Northern Ireland Olympic team", but that doesn't sound particularly catchy.

00:13:19.002 --> 00:13:23.322
And so just for branding reasons, it's called team GB.

00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:32.088
And for things like the football, rugby, or cricket world cup, the way it works is that it's

00:13:32.088 --> 00:13:38.688
more like member organisations that represent a country, not the sovereign state itself.

00:13:39.408 --> 00:13:43.578
So that's why you can have England or Scotland playing

00:13:43.578 --> 00:13:46.428
as their own team for these kinds of competitions.

00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:56.325
Now finally, when should you call someone British as opposed to English, Scottish, Irish, or Welsh?

00:13:56.865 --> 00:14:00.465
Well, this is indeed a complicated subject.

00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:06.375
Each country is fiercely proud of its own heritage and identity.

00:14:07.725 --> 00:14:14.055
Call a Scotsman English and well, I'm sure he wouldn't be particularly impressed.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.840
As a general rule, anyone from Great Britain, and remember that's the island of

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.720
Great Britain, so not including Northern Ireland here, so anyone from England,

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:34.560
Scotland, or Wales, they shouldn't be too offended at being called British.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.170
So that's normally a safer bet, rather than assuming that they are

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.400
English, Welsh or Scottish, unless you actually know for a fact.

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:50.650
So long story short, you should be okay if you call people British normally.

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:58.951
And as I'm sure you know, and as I mentioned at the start of the podcast, the UK voted to leave

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:08.191
the European Union in June, 2016 and this happened technically on January the 31st of 2020.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:17.261
While Brexit is a phenomenally complicated subject that we could speak for hours about, it's worth

00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:23.651
just mentioning that it is completely plausible that Brexit could be the decision that brings

00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:30.761
about the end of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its current form.

00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:37.571
The majority of people in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:42.731
the EU, while the majority of people in England and Wales voted to leave.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:50.996
But the entire of the UK has now left the EU, not just England and Wales.

00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:59.576
Scotland, as you may well know, is already talking about a referendum on membership

00:15:59.606 --> 00:16:06.746
of the UK, so a popular vote on whether to gain independence from the United Kingdom.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:11.714
So only time will tell how long this union manages to last for.

00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:19.204
In any case, as of February, 2020 this is still the difference between Great

00:16:19.204 --> 00:16:23.584
Britain, the United Kingdom, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:31.561
So next time someone inevitably misuses these terms, calling England Britain or calling

00:16:31.561 --> 00:16:37.961
a Welshman English, and there are probably hundreds of people misusing these terms at

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:42.971
this very second you will be able to correct them and put them in the right direction.

00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:48.521
Okay then, as always, thank you for listening to the show.

00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:50.621
It has been a pleasure.

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:57.386

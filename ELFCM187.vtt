Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.690
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.000
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.510
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part two of our three-part mini series on Scottish Heroes.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.820
In today’s episode we are going to talk about the amazing life of an

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.590
extraordinary lady – a royal who combined in so many ways the romance

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.100
and glitter of France with the romance and mystery of Scotland.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.730
Her name was Mary Queen of Scots.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.150
As in the other episodes in this mini series, this episode is split into several

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.250
sections: some background to what was happening in Scotland and England at the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.410
time of her birth; a brief account of her life; a discussion about the relationship

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.140
with Scotland’s powerful neighbour, England; her legacy to the folklore of Scottish

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.220
nationalism; and finally, we will end with some weird and bizarre facts about Mary.

00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:23.900
Now, there is a lot to get through, so let’s get started.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.760
Let’s begin with an outline of what was going on in the British Isles when Mary

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.100
Stuart, otherwise known as Mary Queen of Scots was born, on the 8th of December 1542.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.340
Scotland and England were both independent kingdoms, they both had their own monarchs.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.650
When Mary Queen of Scots was born, her father James V was the king of Scotland.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.930
On the English throne was Henry VIII, the king you may

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.850
know of because of his fondness for executing his wives.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.000
But crucially, just six days after Mary was born, her father died.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.700
She had no legitimate brothers and sisters, which meant

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.260
that she was first in line to be queen of Scotland.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.160
And she became queen on his death, aged just six days old.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.820
Obviously, a six-day-old baby doesn’t make a very good monarch, so Scotland was ruled by

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.920
a collection of what’s called “regents” until Mary was old enough to take back the throne.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.030
Mary wasn’t only in line to the Scottish throne though.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.930
Mary’s grandmother, Margaret, was the English king, Henry VIII’s, older sister.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.320
In England, Henry VIII had already gone through 5 wives by the time that Mary

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.610
was born, he did have some direct heirs, but their claim to the English throne

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.830
was, let’s say complicated, given that he had broken with the Catholic Church.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.730
So, long story short, Mary was also an indirect heir to the English throne.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.960
This made her an incredibly eligible bride, but it also made her a threat.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.410
Henry VIII wanted his infant son, Edward, to be engaged to marry the infant Scottish Queen.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.710
Mary had this really strong claim to the English throne, and if she were married to Edward,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.730
then not only would this threat be neutralised, but he could also become King of Scotland.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.380
There was much discussion about this, and disagreement within the Scottish nobility.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.920
The decision was taken to reject Henry, and instead to have Mary

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.170
engaged to the three-year-old son of King Henry II of France.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.380
The English King, Henry VIII, was furious about being rejected, and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.580
invaded the southern part of Scotland, rampaging through border towns.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.650
It was decided that Mary wasn’t safe in Scotland, so

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.840
she was whisked away, she was taken away to France.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.020
Now, you might be asking yourself, why should there

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.210
have been such a link between France and Scotland?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.460
Well this alliance and long-standing friendship between the two countries was based on

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.810
mutual self interest - the self interest which comes from having a common enemy – England.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.060
The relationship was described using the Scottish

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.290
word for old – the Auld - A U L D - the Auld Alliance.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:06.930
From her arrival in France in 1547 until her eventual return to Scotland in 1561, Mary had a

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:14.600
highly privileged childhood in arguably the most glittering and wealthy royal court in the world.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.160
She was a charismatic, beautiful, talented, and clever

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.780
young woman, and she flourished at the French court.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.810
Unfortunately, as will become a theme in Mary’s life, she was dragged down by a man.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.960
The Dauphin, or Crown Prince, Francis, might have seemed like a great catch.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.020
Indeed, he was heir to the French throne.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:51.370
After they married in April 1558, with Mary just 15 years old, things swiftly went downhill.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.200
He was a prolific womaniser, he was completely unfaithful

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.630
to Mary, and their marriage was not a happy one.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.530
He became king of France a year later, in 1559, but died in 1560.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.680
Not only did his premature death mean that she lost her husband and status

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.040
as Queen of France, but it also meant that she could be dominated – you could

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.197
say bullied – by Francis’s mother – her mother-in-law – Catherine of Medici.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.400
Meanwhile, back in England Elizabeth I had become queen.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.000
She was the sole surviving heir to Henry VIII, but

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.690
wasn’t considered by Catholics to be a legitimate heir.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:48.910
She was Henry’s daughter from Anne Boleyn, but Anne was Henry’s second wife, after his divorce

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.590
from Catherine of Aragon, hence many Catholics didn’t consider it to be a legitimate marriage.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.309
After the death of Mary’s mother back in Scotland, Mary returned

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:06.789
to the country of her birth in the summer of 1561, aged 18.

00:07:07.592 --> 00:07:12.192
Her intention was to retake the throne, and to rule over Scotland.

00:07:13.092 --> 00:07:19.412
Imagine the sense of excitement and nervousness – trepidation, you could say – as

00:07:19.612 --> 00:07:25.292
Mary’s small fleet of ships reached the harbour of Edinburgh’s port, Leith.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:32.152
It is August but the Scottish air is typically chilly and Mary’s boats

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.892
have made such good time that there is no one there to greet her.

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:45.081
Out steps this beautiful, eighteen year old: a charismatic, lively, young woman - 180cm

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:51.471
tall with light brownish red hair, it must have been quite something to behold.

00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:58.581
She has kept her Scottish language – the dialect known as Lowland Scots – but she is

00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:05.294
happier in French and has no real knowledge of the land that she is expected to rule over.

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:11.241
For the past 14 years, in her absence, the real power has been

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:16.251
exercised by a group of 24 Scottish nobles or aristocrats.

00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:22.521
Scotland, a country of a mere 800,000 people, is a very complex

00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:28.481
and divided society, with many people owing much greater loyalty to

00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:33.708
the leader of their clan or wider family than to the king or queen.

00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:39.958
Being a young woman from abroad was not a good basis for success.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.604
There is one other big issue which needs mentioning here.

00:08:45.194 --> 00:08:47.224
Mary was a Catholic.

00:08:47.874 --> 00:08:52.914
Scotland at this time was becoming dominated by a particular form of

00:08:52.974 --> 00:08:57.224
Protestantism which had its origin in the teachings of a Frenchman

00:08:57.384 --> 00:09:01.824
called Jean Calvin – Calvinism was the resulting religious movement.

00:09:02.974 --> 00:09:07.334
Although Mary knew that she had to accept the prevailing Scottish

00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:11.494
religion, there was no getting around the fact of her Catholicism.

00:09:12.694 --> 00:09:17.114
The man who embodied this negative attitude towards her was

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:22.394
a fearsome Calvinist priest or minister called John Knox.

00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:30.514
Preaching sermons in his Edinburgh church of two or three hours in length every Sunday, he

00:09:30.514 --> 00:09:38.034
was openly aggressive in in his opposition to Mary: she was a Catholic; she was a woman and

00:09:38.065 --> 00:09:45.644
her behaviour as a fun-loving, brightly dressed and extravagant aristocrat from the decadent,

00:09:45.754 --> 00:09:51.964
pleasure-loving French court meant that there was a lot of ammunition for Knox to use against her.

00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:58.804
Surrounded by powerful nobles who were plotting against her, and attacked by

00:09:58.874 --> 00:10:04.834
the most powerful churchman in the country and confused by the many challenges

00:10:04.944 --> 00:10:10.214
of trying to rule this divided country, she was also in search of a husband.

00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:18.164
Or, to put it more accurately, other people, notably her elder cousin, Elizabeth of England, or

00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:24.874
her French relatives and other European royalty were searching for a suitable husband for her.

00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:30.734
Unfortunately, as is becoming something of a recurring feature

00:10:30.924 --> 00:10:35.344
in this doomed young woman‘s life, she made a poor choice.

00:10:36.074 --> 00:10:40.704
She married a vain, drunken, unprincipled and

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:45.164
treacherous young man, called Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.

00:10:45.924 --> 00:10:51.384
If you’ve noticed that he shares the same surname as her, well done, good spot.

00:10:51.724 --> 00:10:54.524
Yes, you are right, he is her cousin.

00:10:55.534 --> 00:11:02.924
He is a very beautiful man and he and Mary make a lovely couple as they dance together, but,

00:11:03.214 --> 00:11:10.984
along with his many disadvantages listed above, he is promiscuous, bisexual, and power-hungry.

00:11:12.174 --> 00:11:17.074
For him, a big attraction of the marriage is that he can not only

00:11:17.074 --> 00:11:21.614
become King of Scotland but, because he is a man, he can become

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:26.104
the dominant party in the partnership of the two, married monarchs.

00:11:27.204 --> 00:11:31.094
So, back to the sad unfolding of Mary‘s story.

00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:35.364
I am sorry, but life is only going to get worse for her.

00:11:36.084 --> 00:11:39.674
She finds herself at the centre of a power struggle,

00:11:39.864 --> 00:11:44.404
which results in two bloody and semi-public murders.

00:11:45.234 --> 00:11:52.904
First of all, meet her private secretary, David Rizzio; an Italian who is possibly her

00:11:52.934 --> 00:11:59.414
lover and probably Darnley’s as well, he is sleeping both with Mary and her husband.

00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:06.934
This young Italian is literally pulled out from behind the young Queen by one of a band of

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:14.994
attackers and stabbed to death 56 times in the next door room of her palace in Edinburgh.

00:12:15.794 --> 00:12:21.844
The final dagger - left ostentatiously in Rizzio’s body is - guess whose?

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:22.834
Darnley’s.

00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:29.204
A mere two years later, her decadent husband, Darnley is himself murdered.

00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:32.744
It’s not completely clear who murdered him.

00:12:32.954 --> 00:12:38.154
The finger has been pointed at other Scottish noblemen, and even Mary herself.

00:12:39.394 --> 00:12:44.344
As all these tragic and bloody events are happening, Mary is continuing

00:12:44.374 --> 00:12:49.344
to try to find some agreement with her cousin, Queen Elizabeth of England.

00:12:50.224 --> 00:12:55.274
The situation gets even more complicated when, following Darnley’s

00:12:55.304 --> 00:12:59.494
murder, public opinion is blaming Mary herself for the murder.

00:13:00.494 --> 00:13:06.074
Darnley, let’s not forget, was Mary’s cousin but he was also Elizabeth’s.

00:13:06.534 --> 00:13:10.194
These royal marriages were all family affairs, one could say.

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:18.344
By now Mary has become attached to another dubious man, James Hepburn, The Earl of Bothwell.

00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:23.574
To cut a long and complicated story short, Bothwell is

00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:27.574
accused of the murder of Darnley, but found not guilty.

00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:33.054
Although many events in Mary‘s life are well documented, the

00:13:33.064 --> 00:13:37.634
circumstances of her subsequent marriage to Bothwell are much less clear.

00:13:38.304 --> 00:13:44.184
He certainly abducted her - it looks likely that he raped her and then

00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:50.162
made it very difficult for her not to marry him, which she did in May 1567.

00:13:50.932 --> 00:13:56.192
This marriage, like the previous two, proved to be another bad move for Mary.

00:13:56.922 --> 00:14:02.012
War between the different groups in Scotland had become a regular feature of Mary's

00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:08.132
life during her short reign as Queen, but now power started to slip away from her.

00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:13.612
In July 1567, she gave up her role as Queen.

00:14:14.842 --> 00:14:21.302
Fearful for her own life and also the life of the young prince that was the result of her and

00:14:21.482 --> 00:14:29.262
Darnley’s union, Prince James, she fled to England, seeking the protection of her cousin, Elizabeth.

00:14:30.212 --> 00:14:34.432
Although we don’t know exactly what was going through her mind, perhaps

00:14:34.552 --> 00:14:39.332
she thought that her cousin, another woman struggling to keep control

00:14:39.472 --> 00:14:43.902
over her position in a world dominated by men, might have helped her.

00:14:45.022 --> 00:14:49.882
Unfortunately, she badly misjudged her cousin’s generosity.

00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:58.042
She was arrested, and kept prisoner in various castles in England for the next 19.5 years.

00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:06.202
Elizabeth’s spies were continually looking out for evidence of treason, or Mary plotting against

00:15:06.202 --> 00:15:15.442
her cousin, and this was supposedly found in 1587, almost 20 years after she was first arrested.

00:15:16.412 --> 00:15:22.327
On February 8th 1587, she was taken to Fotheringhay Castle,

00:15:22.487 --> 00:15:26.497
a castle in the north east of England, and executed.

00:15:27.157 --> 00:15:32.227
To the last minute of her life, she was aware of the power of theatre.

00:15:33.337 --> 00:15:37.447
For her execution, she chose to wear the colours of

00:15:37.477 --> 00:15:41.377
Catholic martyrdom – the dark red of dried blood.

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:46.887
So, to the question of Mary’s relationship with England, how

00:15:46.887 --> 00:15:50.687
important was this and how much did this influence events?

00:15:51.637 --> 00:15:55.357
The answers to these questions are “very much” and “greatly”.

00:15:56.007 --> 00:16:03.317
Remember that Mary considered herself to be the divinely-ordained, true Queen of England: she

00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:11.219
felt that it should be she, rather than Elizabeth, on both the English and Scottish thrones.

00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:17.507
If it wasn’t possible for Mary to be queen of England, she wanted her heir, Prince

00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:23.437
James, to be declared by Elizabeth the heir to the English throne on Elizabeth‘s death.

00:16:24.587 --> 00:16:30.027
Elizabeth was understandably reluctant to agree to any such arrangement

00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:35.107
with Mary, as she knew that it might mean Catholic supporters, either

00:16:35.117 --> 00:16:39.587
in England or in continental Europe, might come to Mary’s assistance.

00:16:40.407 --> 00:16:47.077
Elizabeth was incredibly fearful of anyone plotting against her, and actually made

00:16:47.127 --> 00:16:53.547
any discussion about who would succeed her a treasonable offence punishable by death.

00:16:54.677 --> 00:16:59.787
Now, moving on to the cultural impact of Mary’s tragic life, she

00:16:59.787 --> 00:17:04.687
has provided much material for historical novelists and filmmakers.

00:17:05.437 --> 00:17:09.717
You may well have seen the movie, Mary Queen of Scots which came out

00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:14.947
in 2018, and if you are asking me, was really not very good at all.

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:18.291
There was another film in 2013.

00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:22.447
There are many more - in fact one of the earliest films

00:17:22.677 --> 00:17:27.557
ever made was about her execution - it was made in 1895!

00:17:28.557 --> 00:17:33.457
Both of these recent films could not resist the dramatic and cinematic

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:38.717
opportunities that a meeting between Mary and Elizabeth gave to the films.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:42.607
Unfortunately, no such meeting ever took place.

00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:47.287
The two rival monarchs, the two female cousins, never met.

00:17:48.347 --> 00:17:53.747
Compared to the story recounted in the earlier episode – of William Wallace, the

00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:59.557
so-called Braveheart rebel against English power, Mary‘s story does not provide

00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:05.527
an easy folklore tale to inspire modern day campaigners for Scottish independence.

00:18:06.327 --> 00:18:10.277
If the story of Mary Queen of Scots tells us anything, it’s

00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:14.627
that although the English are nasty, the Scots are just as bad.

00:18:15.917 --> 00:18:20.947
One theme that is hard to ignore in the story of Mary Queen of Scots

00:18:21.237 --> 00:18:26.467
is that of the plight or situation of a young woman in a world where

00:18:26.477 --> 00:18:31.147
powerful men do not accept her authority simply because of her gender.

00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:38.357
She was considered biologically unfit to be queen, and almost from the day she was

00:18:38.357 --> 00:18:44.837
born she was considered inadequate for the role that she believed God had given her.

00:18:45.497 --> 00:18:49.467
There were plenty of accusations against her of sexual

00:18:49.517 --> 00:18:52.947
promiscuity, of having multiple sexual partners.

00:18:53.477 --> 00:18:59.037
This might have been true, but the point is that this was accepted behaviour for

00:18:59.047 --> 00:19:04.947
men, including all of her husbands, but was considered to be a sin for a woman.

00:19:06.117 --> 00:19:11.627
Life was not easy as a woman in the sixteenth century, and when you have your powerful

00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:16.830
cousin on the throne of England, as well as countless enemies who are supposedly

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.100
meant to be your countrymen, well it certainly wasn’t easy for Mary Queen of Scots.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:28.740
Now, to our final section, the weird and bizarre facts from her sad, short life.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.410
Although I’ve just said that life wasn’t easy for Mary Queen of Scots,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.810
she did enjoy earthly pleasures, and lived a life of material luxury.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:46.980
She had four close companions, known as ladies-in-waiting, conveniently they were all called Mary.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.940
And unsurprisingly, they were known as the Four Marys.

00:19:51.977 --> 00:19:55.780
At a time where coaches were very rare, Mary had a

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.550
coach that looked like a four poster bed on wheels.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.916
A four poster bed is one of these old-style beds with a

00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:03.520
pillar at each of its corners, and often curtains on the side.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.680
She had masses, huge amounts, of gorgeous, expensive

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.690
clothes, and she certainly didn’t travel lightly.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:24.310
Her baggage train when she moved from castle to castle required at least 30 carts.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:30.740
She ate off silver plates and had 36 pairs of velvet shoes.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.280
In her early days back in Scotland, in 1563, a French poet who was a member

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.050
of her court became so consumed by love for her that he hid under her

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:49.440
bed and waited for her to return, so he could declare his love for her.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.670
This turned out to be a bad idea.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.860
He was discovered, charged with high treason, and executed.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:05.510
Now, coming to a couple of slightly gruesome facts about Mary’s own execution, as was typical at

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:12.640
the time she forgave her own executioner, saying “I hope you shall make an end to all my troubles”.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.480
Unfortunately the executioner didn’t do a very good job of it, and instead of

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.930
cutting her head off cleanly, he missed the first time and hit the back of her

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:28.050
head, and it took him another two attempts to remove the head from the body.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:35.270
As he attempted to lift her severed head up so that the waiting crowd of 100

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:41.160
people could see that she was dead, he found that Mary’s famous red hair he was

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:47.660
holding was in fact a wig and that her real hair underneath was grey and cut short.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.900
As her body was removed, her favourite pet dog, a small

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.820
Skye terrier, was found sheltering under her skirts.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:03.250
When the poor dog was discovered it ran about whining miserably and lay down in the

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:08.660
widening pool of blood that was spreading in the gap between her head and her shoulders.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.570
Let’s leave on a positive note though.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.520
Mary’s personal motto was the French “En ma fin est mon commencement”,

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.700
which you could translate in English to “In My End is My Beginning”.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:27.060
Well, in fact this turned out to have a visionary or prophetic

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:33.740
quality: in 1603, on Elizabeth’s death, Mary’s only son, Prince James

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.840
became King James I of the combined crowns of England and Scotland.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.700
He was the first king of both countries, and paved

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.230
the way for a United Kingdom of England and Scotland.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:53.170
Indeed, the current Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II is the 13th

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:58.600
generation of succession from her distant ancestor, Mary Queen of Scots.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:05.110
So, although she might not have known it as the executioner’s axe was coming down

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:11.060
towards her head, she is a woman who forever changed the course of British history.

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:19.960
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the tragic life of Mary Queen of Scots, a

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.590
woman whose life was dominated by plots, betrayal, murder, and a series of terrible men.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.760
I guess the moral of the story here is don’t trust

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.370
your cousins, and that men often have bad intentions…

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.890
So, that is it for part two of this mini-series.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:44.400
Next up will be an episode on Bonnie Prince Charlie, a man who tried to

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.310
retake the Scottish throne from the English, and well, didn’t quite manage it.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.020
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.090
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:02.770
Scotland is a topic that is very dear to my heart, as my dad is Scottish and I grew up for much

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:07.860
of my early life just outside Edinburgh, so I would love to know what you thought of this one.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:14.190

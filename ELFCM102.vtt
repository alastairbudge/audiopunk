Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.971
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.750
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.700
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Daylight Saving Time.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.091
Depending on what country you live in, last Saturday evening, or Sunday

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:39.370
morning, the last Sunday in October, the clocks might have gone back one hour.

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:45.231
Your mornings are now a little lighter, but it gets dark an hour earlier.

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:51.241
So today’s episode is going to talk about the history of Daylight Saving

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:56.630
Time, why do the clocks change twice a year, why some people love it,

00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:01.531
why others hate it, and how long is this system going to go on for.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:08.371
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:14.120
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.601
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:24.561
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.811
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:34.370
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.221
And in case you missed it from our episode last week, to celebrate the 100th

00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:45.371
episode of English Learning for Curious Minds you can get 20% off your first

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:50.721
month, your first 3 months, or even your first year of membership by using

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:57.371
the code DAVINCI, d a v i n c i when you join as a member of Leonardo English.

00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:02.891
That code expires at midnight on October 31st, the day after

00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:06.090
this episode is going to be released, so the clock is ticking.

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.751
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:13.761
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:20.101
OK then, time, and specifically, Daylight Saving Time.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.471
The clock is, of course, a man-made invention, but time isn’t.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.101
The earth turns around on itself every day, but it’s us that decided to put labels

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:40.401
on how far around the Earth has turned, and to call the time that the sun is in the

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:47.361
middle of the sky ‘midday’, 12pm, and to split the day up into different units of time.

00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.931
In agrarian societies, societies that were dominated by farming,

00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:58.101
what the time was, or what the clock said, didn’t matter so much.

00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.851
You did things at the best time to do them.

00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:09.400
Chickens wake up when the sun gets up, animals don’t care whether you call that time 4am or 4pm.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:18.911
But measuring time in hours has been in existence since the Ancient Romans and Ancient Greeks,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.071
way before the invention of the mechanical clock, which came at the start of the 14th century.

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:32.230
For the Romans, who kept time with water clocks, there were always 12 hours

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:36.931
in the day, no matter how many minutes of sunlight there actually were.

00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:43.511
In the summer when there were more than 12 hours of sunlight, an hour

00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:49.731
would be shorter than 60 minutes, and in the winter when there were fewer

00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:54.721
than 12 sunlight hours, there would be more than 60 minutes in an hour.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.421
This meant that there were always 12 hours of daylight, but hours were different lengths.

00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.321
Confusing, right?

00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:11.251
As societies started to move away from everyone working in the fields, and appointments

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.221
needed to be made and kept, there was the need for a better official system of timekeeping.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.371
The time used to be set in each town.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.681
One person would be responsible for measuring when the sun was in the

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:33.960
middle of the sky, and would set the town’s clock as ‘noon’, as ‘midday’.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.381
Then that person would go around and set everyone else’s clocks accordingly.

00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:46.961
But of course a big problem with this was that every town had its own different mini time zone.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.691
12pm in one town was different to 12pm in a town just 100 km to the east or west, which made

00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:02.671
arranging things difficult when you were dealing with anyone who wasn’t in the same place as you.

00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:08.211
In the United States, for example, as the rail network expanded across

00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:14.581
the country the train stations had to observe 75 different time zones.

00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:21.607
It wasn’t until 1876 that a Scottish-born Canadian, a man called Sir Sanford

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:26.298
Fleming, suggested that there should be a worldwide system of time zones.

00:05:27.358 --> 00:05:33.378
Each 15 degree slice of the Earth would be split into a different hourly time zone,

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:38.888
so there would be 24 different time zones, making life a lot easier for everyone.

00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:44.948
15 times 24 equals 360 and there are of course 360 degrees.

00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:51.448
By 1900 almost every country had adopted this system, splitting the world

00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:56.938
into different areas that observed one of the 24 different time zones.

00:05:58.068 --> 00:05:59.668
There were a few exceptions.

00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:07.758
India, for example, uses a 30 minute offset, they don’t exactly fit within the 1 hour time zone.

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:13.748
So, that is how the world got split up into time zones, but there was another

00:06:13.758 --> 00:06:17.878
problem for some countries further away from the equator, where the amount

00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:22.958
of sunlight varies greatly depending on whether it’s summer or winter.

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:31.588
As the Earth is on an angle, it’s not directly straight, this 23.5 degree angle

00:06:31.818 --> 00:06:36.230
causes us to have seasons it means that the further away you are from the equator,

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.120
the near or further you are away from the sun based on what month you’re in.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.680
I’m sure you know this, but the consequence of this that is relevant to us today

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.040
is about the amount of daylight that countries get based on the time of the year.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.040
Countries in the Northern Hemisphere get more daylight in the summer months, and less daylight

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.090
in the winter months, and the further north or south you go, the more extreme this is.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.090
If you live near the equator you’ve probably never really experienced this, but

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.380
I have family from right at the north of Scotland, and I can assure you that

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:24.410
it is quite weird to go out for a walk in the moonlight at 4pm in December,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:30.800
and in the same place to be able to read your book by sunlight at 10pm in June.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.790
Given that businesses, schools, and general life was operating by the clock,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.320
with fixed starting and ending hours to the day’s activities, during the

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.320
summer months in the Northern hemisphere people would get up after the sun

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.830
was up, in effect sleeping while there was perfectly good daylight to be had.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.470
Various different people had proposed the idea of doing something about this, of changing

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:06.050
the clocks during the summer months to allow for more time after work for leisure activities.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:13.260
In fact, the actual idea of putting the clocks forward in summer, and then back in winter

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:20.490
was proposed by two men at roughly the same time, but on opposite sides of the world.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.520
George Hudson was in New Zealand, and he was a keen collector of insects.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.820
He thought that by shifting the clocks forward in summer people like him would

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:39.130
be able to have more leisure time outside to do things like collect insects.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.540
Meanwhile in Britain a man called William Willet, who is strangely

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.670
enough the great great grandfather of the lead singer of the band

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:54.430
Coldplay, he was reportedly a keen golfer and he noticed the same thing.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.430
In the summer he would often have to stop playing golf because it

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.310
got dark, but most people were still asleep when the sun came up.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.510
How about just moving the clocks forward during the summer to make the most of the daylight?

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:18.980
Note that these proposals were both made by people quite far away from the equator - for

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.830
anyone who lives close to the equator, this just isn’t a phenomenon that you experience.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.520
Their proposals soon started to catch on, and the first city to

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.110
observe Daylight Saving Time was Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.920
In the spring the clocks would go forward one hour, and in the

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.080
autumn they would go back, which is what just happened last week.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.920
At the outbreak of the First World War the Germans adopted

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.870
Daylight Saving Time as a way of conserving fuel, of saving fuel.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.550
If there was an hour of extra daylight in the summer months this would mean

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.430
that they would save coal, as people wouldn’t need to burn it to generate power.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.850
The same logic was soon adopted by most European countries, as well as the US, as

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.920
they were all looking to conserve energy and focus everything on the war effort.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:25.350
When the war ended in 1918 several countries ditched Daylight Saving Time, they got rid of it,

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:33.360
reverting to one, single time zone throughout the year, but in the past 100 years it has been

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:39.870
abolished and then re adopted by various countries at different times, for different reasons.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:47.730
Today, in 2020, some form of Daylight Saving Time is observed by roughly 70

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.406
different countries around the world, but it has remained a source of controversy.

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:59.206
Its proponents, the people who support it, say that the extra hour

00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:03.456
of daylight in the summer is good for our mental and physical health.

00:11:04.526 --> 00:11:10.196
More daylight hours mean more time for recreational activities, for hobbies,

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:15.736
things such as collecting insects or playing golf, or just more traditional

00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:20.366
activities like playing sports or being outside with friends and family.

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:25.816
It’s also good at keeping down crimes - assaults, robberies,

00:11:25.826 --> 00:11:29.596
and so on, which are helped by the cover of darkness.

00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:34.376
The longer evenings are also thought to reduce traffic accidents.

00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:39.916
If it’s easier to see, well, it’s easier to avoid other cars and pedestrians.

00:11:40.876 --> 00:11:42.756
Some businesses love it as well.

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:47.346
Not just golf courses though - anything that benefits from people having

00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:51.816
more time to go out in the evening, so shops, restaurants, and so on.

00:11:52.626 --> 00:11:59.466
And the candy industry in America loves it, as it means kids can go out for longer at Halloween.

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.956
So far so good.

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.886
But why the controversy then?

00:12:05.686 --> 00:12:11.456
Well, the original argument for Daylight Saving Time is no longer really a factor.

00:12:12.136 --> 00:12:17.426
Remember, it was to save energy, and nowadays any energy that is saved through

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:21.976
having an extra hour where you don’t have to turn the lights on in the evening is

00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:28.446
outweighed by having an extra hour where hotter places need to use air conditioning.

00:12:29.046 --> 00:12:33.546
Although I should point out that this was never a problem for me in the north of Scotland.

00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:40.116
It’s not just that the original ‘saving power’ argument isn’t valid, there are

00:12:40.116 --> 00:12:46.226
people who are vehemently against it, even nicknaming it ‘Daylight Slaving Time’.

00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:48.611
So, 'slaving' not 'saving'.

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:56.449
Firstly, just the fact that we have to change is not only a big annoyance for many people.

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:02.419
People hate change, and having to adjust to a new time twice a year is a bit annoying.

00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:09.579
The change itself is thought to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:16.789
- when the clocks go forward in spring people struggle to adjust to getting up an hour earlier.

00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:19.559
It’s also dangerous.

00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:26.639
On the Monday after the clocks go forward in spring there is a spike in car accidents, an

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:35.279
increase in car accidents, of 17%, and there’s an increase of 25% in the number of heart attacks.

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:37.049
Not great, right?

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:42.889
Just as there are some industries that are huge beneficiaries

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.609
of Daylight Saving Time, there are others that hate it.

00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:54.449
TV companies don’t like it, because people are outside instead of sitting on their sofa watching TV.

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:57.529
And farmers, in general, don’t like it.

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:03.739
As we know, animals don’t observe Daylight Saving Time, their daily rhythms are based on the sun.

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:12.409
If you are a farmer and you used to wake up at 6am, then one day the clocks go forward, this means

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:18.919
you now need to wake up at 5am, because your animals don’t care that the clocks have gone forward.

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:23.239
The further away from the equator you go, the more

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.329
acute the problem is, the more severe the problem is.

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:31.549
If you need sunlight to do your job then Daylight Saving Time can mean

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:35.679
that you end up having to work for an hour longer into the evening.

00:14:36.549 --> 00:14:43.019
If you have kids that finish school at 4pm let's say, but you were only able to start your day at

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:49.279
10am because the clocks went forward, well you might have one hour less time to spend with them.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:53.739
There are constant proposals to change Daylight Saving Time,

00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:58.099
from getting rid of it altogether to staying on it forever.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:05.749
The larger the country, especially the longer it is from North to South, the less sense there is

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:09.369
in a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:13.019
If we take the example of the UK, there is a movement

00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:16.409
to keep Daylight Saving Time for the whole year.

00:15:17.469 --> 00:15:21.169
For the south of England it would probably be fine.

00:15:21.979 --> 00:15:27.079
In the winter months daylight would start around 9am but the evenings would be longer.

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:33.939
But when it would come to the North of Scotland, the sun wouldn’t rise until 10am in the winter.

00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:41.429
This isn’t just a theoretical idea; the whole of the UK moved to permanent Daylight

00:15:41.429 --> 00:15:49.489
Saving Time between the years of 1968 and 1971, but we have since gone back to

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:54.829
Daylight Saving Time for the summer, and ‘normal’, universal, time for the winter.

00:15:56.069 --> 00:16:01.349
For those of you who need to arrange things like phone calls with people in

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:06.689
different countries, it can get even more confusing with Daylight Saving Time, and

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:11.749
looking at where countries are on the map it doesn’t always make a lot of sense.

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:17.179
Spain is 1 hour ahead of the UK but almost all of the country

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:20.839
is to the west of London, where Greenwich Mean Time comes from.

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:25.789
What happens if I’m in Chile and I need to call Morocco?

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:32.699
There are 3 time zones in Chile, the clocks go back 1 hour in April, and Morocco

00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:38.169
observes Daylight Saving Time all year round, apart from during Ramadan, where the

00:16:38.169 --> 00:16:43.019
clocks go back so that people observing Ramadan can break their fast 1 hour earlier.

00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:49.197
You can quickly see how this all gets pretty complicated , which is one

00:16:49.197 --> 00:16:53.287
of the main reasons that there are movements to get rid of it altogether.

00:16:54.417 --> 00:17:00.637
Indeed, there was an EU directive to get all member countries to either

00:17:00.697 --> 00:17:05.737
adopt year round Daylight Saving Time or universal time, normal time,

00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:12.147
and from 2021 all EU countries will have to choose which to go for.

00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:16.817
Some countries look like they’ll go for universal time,

00:17:17.187 --> 00:17:20.957
winter time, all year round, and others for summer time.

00:17:21.927 --> 00:17:26.467
The UK says it has no plans to get rid of Daylight Saving Time,

00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:31.547
which could well lead to a time difference between Northern Ireland,

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:35.987
which is part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which is not.

00:17:37.077 --> 00:17:42.017
It would of course be pretty weird to have one small island on two

00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:46.437
different time zones for half the year, but this is a real possibility.

00:17:47.327 --> 00:17:50.357
Discussions on what to actually do about this have

00:17:50.387 --> 00:17:55.187
stalled, given COVID-19, but there are no easy answers.

00:17:56.427 --> 00:18:01.087
So, you may well have woken up on Sunday morning and counted

00:18:01.087 --> 00:18:04.287
your lucky stars because you got an extra hour in bed.

00:18:05.157 --> 00:18:11.977
But this change is very controversial, and this may be one of the last years that you have to do it.

00:18:13.257 --> 00:18:16.307
At least you can count yourself lucky that you don’t

00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:19.547
work in one of the residences of the Queen of England.

00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:25.487
There are reportedly 1000 different clocks in her different palaces

00:18:25.497 --> 00:18:30.708
around the country and her staff need to go around every one of them

00:18:31.018 --> 00:18:35.038
in the early morning, twice a year, setting them to the right time.

00:18:36.088 --> 00:18:40.748
You’re not going to win any prizes for guessing what they think of Daylight Saving Time.

00:18:43.048 --> 00:18:47.558
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Daylight Saving Time.

00:18:48.138 --> 00:18:52.548
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new about this change

00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:58.338
that affects 70 different countries, and that we still haven’t really figured out the answer to.

00:18:59.458 --> 00:19:03.948
And as a final reminder, if you are looking to improve your English in a more interesting

00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:09.108

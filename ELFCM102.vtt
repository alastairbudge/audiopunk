Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.971
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.750
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.700
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Daylight Saving Time.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.091
Depending on what country you live in, last Saturday evening, or Sunday

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:39.370
morning, the last Sunday in October, the clocks might have gone back one hour.

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:45.231
Your mornings are now a little lighter, but it gets dark an hour earlier.

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:51.241
So today’s episode is going to talk about the history of Daylight Saving

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:56.630
Time, why do the clocks change twice a year, why some people love it,

00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:01.531
why others hate it, and how long is this system going to go on for.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:08.371
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:14.120
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.601
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:24.561
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.811
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:34.370
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.770
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.780
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.120
OK then, time, and specifically, Daylight Saving Time.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.490
The clock is, of course, a man-made invention, but time isn’t.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.120
The earth turns around on itself every day, but it’s us that decided to put labels

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.420
on how far around the Earth has turned, and to call the time that the sun is in the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.380
middle of the sky ‘midday’, 12pm, and to split the day up into different units of time.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.950
In agrarian societies, societies that were dominated by farming,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.120
what the time was, or what the clock said, didn’t matter so much.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.870
You did things at the best time to do them.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.420
Chickens wake up when the sun gets up, animals don’t care whether you call that time 4am or 4pm.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.930
But measuring time in hours has been in existence since the Ancient Romans and Ancient Greeks,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.090
way before the invention of the mechanical clock, which came at the start of the 14th century.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.250
For the Romans, who kept time with water clocks, there were always 12 hours

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.950
in the day, no matter how many minutes of sunlight there actually were.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.530
In the summer when there were more than 12 hours of sunlight, an hour

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.750
would be shorter than 60 minutes, and in the winter when there were fewer

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.740
than 12 sunlight hours, there would be more than 60 minutes in an hour.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.440
This meant that there were always 12 hours of daylight, but hours were different lengths.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.340
Confusing, right?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.270
As societies started to move away from everyone working in the fields, and appointments

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.240
needed to be made and kept, there was the need for a better official system of timekeeping.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.390
The time used to be set in each town.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.700
One person would be responsible for measuring when the sun was in the

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.980
middle of the sky, and would set the town’s clock as ‘noon’, as ‘midday’.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.400
Then that person would go around and set everyone else’s clocks accordingly.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.980
But of course a big problem with this was that every town had its own different mini time zone.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:24.710
12pm in one town was different to 12pm in a town just 100 km to the east or west, which made

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.690
arranging things difficult when you were dealing with anyone who wasn’t in the same place as you.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.230
In the United States, for example, as the rail network expanded across

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.600
the country the train stations had to observe 75 different time zones.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.627
It wasn’t until 1876 that a Scottish-born Canadian, a man called Sir Sanford

00:04:49.627 --> 00:04:54.318
Fleming, suggested that there should be a worldwide system of time zones.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:05:01.398
Each 15 degree slice of the Earth would be split into a different hourly time zone,

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:06.908
so there would be 24 different time zones, making life a lot easier for everyone.

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:12.968
15 times 24 equals 360 and there are of course 360 degrees.

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:19.468
By 1900 almost every country had adopted this system, splitting the world

00:05:19.498 --> 00:05:24.958
into different areas that observed one of the 24 different time zones.

00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:27.688
There were a few exceptions.

00:05:28.368 --> 00:05:35.778
India, for example, uses a 30 minute offset, they don’t exactly fit within the 1 hour time zone.

00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:41.768
So, that is how the world got split up into time zones, but there was another

00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:45.898
problem for some countries further away from the equator, where the amount

00:05:45.938 --> 00:05:50.978
of sunlight varies greatly depending on whether it’s summer or winter.

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:59.608
As the Earth is on an angle, it’s not directly straight, this 23.5 degree angle

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:04.250
causes us to have seasons it means that the further away you are from the equator,

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.140
the near or further you are away from the sun based on what month you’re in.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.700
I’m sure you know this, but the consequence of this that is relevant to us today

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.060
is about the amount of daylight that countries get based on the time of the year.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.060
Countries in the Northern Hemisphere get more daylight in the summer months, and less daylight

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.110
in the winter months, and the further north or south you go, the more extreme this is.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.110
If you live near the equator you’ve probably never really experienced this, but

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.400
I have family from right at the north of Scotland, and I can assure you that

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.430
it is quite weird to go out for a walk in the moonlight at 4pm in December,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.820
and in the same place to be able to read your book by sunlight at 10pm in June.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.810
Given that businesses, schools, and general life was operating by the clock,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.340
with fixed starting and ending hours to the day’s activities, during the

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.340
summer months in the Northern hemisphere people would get up after the sun

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.850
was up, in effect sleeping while there was perfectly good daylight to be had.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.490
Various different people had proposed the idea of doing something about this, of changing

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:34.070
the clocks during the summer months to allow for more time after work for leisure activities.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.280
In fact, the actual idea of putting the clocks forward in summer, and then back in winter

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:48.510
was proposed by two men at roughly the same time, but on opposite sides of the world.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.540
George Hudson was in New Zealand, and he was a keen collector of insects.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.840
He thought that by shifting the clocks forward in summer people like him would

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:07.150
be able to have more leisure time outside to do things like collect insects.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.560
Meanwhile in Britain a man called William Willet, who is strangely

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.690
enough the great great grandfather of the lead singer of the band

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.450
Coldplay, he was reportedly a keen golfer and he noticed the same thing.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.450
In the summer he would often have to stop playing golf because it

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.330
got dark, but most people were still asleep when the sun came up.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:39.530
How about just moving the clocks forward during the summer to make the most of the daylight?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:47.000
Note that these proposals were both made by people quite far away from the equator - for

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:52.850
anyone who lives close to the equator, this just isn’t a phenomenon that you experience.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.540
Their proposals soon started to catch on, and the first city to

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.130
observe Daylight Saving Time was Port Arthur in Ontario, Canada.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.940
In the spring the clocks would go forward one hour, and in the

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.100
autumn they would go back, which is what just happened last week.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.940
At the outbreak of the First World War the Germans adopted

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.890
Daylight Saving Time as a way of conserving fuel, of saving fuel.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.570
If there was an hour of extra daylight in the summer months this would mean

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.450
that they would save coal, as people wouldn’t need to burn it to generate power.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.870
The same logic was soon adopted by most European countries, as well as the US, as

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.940
they were all looking to conserve energy and focus everything on the war effort.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:53.370
When the war ended in 1918 several countries ditched Daylight Saving Time, they got rid of it,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:10:01.380
reverting to one, single time zone throughout the year, but in the past 100 years it has been

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.890
abolished and then re adopted by various countries at different times, for different reasons.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.750
Today, in 2020, some form of Daylight Saving Time is observed by roughly 70

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.426
different countries around the world, but it has remained a source of controversy.

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:27.226
Its proponents, the people who support it, say that the extra hour

00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:31.476
of daylight in the summer is good for our mental and physical health.

00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:38.216
More daylight hours mean more time for recreational activities, for hobbies,

00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:43.756
things such as collecting insects or playing golf, or just more traditional

00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:48.386
activities like playing sports or being outside with friends and family.

00:10:49.556 --> 00:10:53.836
It’s also good at keeping down crimes - assaults, robberies,

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:57.616
and so on, which are helped by the cover of darkness.

00:10:58.566 --> 00:11:02.396
The longer evenings are also thought to reduce traffic accidents.

00:11:02.606 --> 00:11:07.936
If it’s easier to see, well, it’s easier to avoid other cars and pedestrians.

00:11:08.896 --> 00:11:10.776
Some businesses love it as well.

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:15.366
Not just golf courses though - anything that benefits from people having

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:19.836
more time to go out in the evening, so shops, restaurants, and so on.

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:27.486
And the candy industry in America loves it, as it means kids can go out for longer at Halloween.

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:29.976
So far so good.

00:11:30.876 --> 00:11:32.906
But why the controversy then?

00:11:33.706 --> 00:11:39.476
Well, the original argument for Daylight Saving Time is no longer really a factor.

00:11:40.156 --> 00:11:45.446
Remember, it was to save energy, and nowadays any energy that is saved through

00:11:45.456 --> 00:11:49.996
having an extra hour where you don’t have to turn the lights on in the evening is

00:11:50.036 --> 00:11:56.466
outweighed by having an extra hour where hotter places need to use air conditioning.

00:11:57.066 --> 00:12:01.566
Although I should point out that this was never a problem for me in the north of Scotland.

00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:08.136
It’s not just that the original ‘saving power’ argument isn’t valid, there are

00:12:08.136 --> 00:12:14.246
people who are vehemently against it, even nicknaming it ‘Daylight Slaving Time’.

00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.631
So, 'slaving' not 'saving'.

00:12:17.349 --> 00:12:24.469
Firstly, just the fact that we have to change is not only a big annoyance for many people.

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:30.439
People hate change, and having to adjust to a new time twice a year is a bit annoying.

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:37.599
The change itself is thought to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:44.809
- when the clocks go forward in spring people struggle to adjust to getting up an hour earlier.

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:47.579
It’s also dangerous.

00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:54.659
On the Monday after the clocks go forward in spring there is a spike in car accidents, an

00:12:54.669 --> 00:13:03.299
increase in car accidents, of 17%, and there’s an increase of 25% in the number of heart attacks.

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:05.069
Not great, right?

00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:10.909
Just as there are some industries that are huge beneficiaries

00:13:11.099 --> 00:13:14.629
of Daylight Saving Time, there are others that hate it.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:22.469
TV companies don’t like it, because people are outside instead of sitting on their sofa watching TV.

00:13:23.489 --> 00:13:25.549
And farmers, in general, don’t like it.

00:13:26.099 --> 00:13:31.759
As we know, animals don’t observe Daylight Saving Time, their daily rhythms are based on the sun.

00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:40.429
If you are a farmer and you used to wake up at 6am, then one day the clocks go forward, this means

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:46.939
you now need to wake up at 5am, because your animals don’t care that the clocks have gone forward.

00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:51.259
The further away from the equator you go, the more

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:54.349
acute the problem is, the more severe the problem is.

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:59.569
If you need sunlight to do your job then Daylight Saving Time can mean

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:03.699
that you end up having to work for an hour longer into the evening.

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:11.039
If you have kids that finish school at 4pm let's say, but you were only able to start your day at

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:17.299
10am because the clocks went forward, well you might have one hour less time to spend with them.

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:21.759
There are constant proposals to change Daylight Saving Time,

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:26.119
from getting rid of it altogether to staying on it forever.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:31.549
The larger the country, especially the longer it is from North to

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:36.519
South, the less sense there is in a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.

00:14:37.439 --> 00:14:41.039
If we take the example of the UK, there is a movement

00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:44.429
to keep Daylight Saving Time for the whole year.

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:49.189
For the south of England it would probably be fine.

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:55.099
In the winter months daylight would start around 9am but the evenings would be longer.

00:14:56.409 --> 00:15:01.959
But when it would come to the North of Scotland, the sun wouldn’t rise until 10am in the winter.

00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:09.449
This isn’t just a theoretical idea; the whole of the UK moved to permanent Daylight

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:17.509
Saving Time between the years of 1968 and 1971, but we have since gone back to

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:22.849
Daylight Saving Time for the summer, and ‘normal’, universal, time for the winter.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:29.369
For those of you who need to arrange things like phone calls with people in

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:34.709
different countries, it can get even more confusing with Daylight Saving Time, and

00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:39.769
looking at where countries are on the map it doesn’t always make a lot of sense.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:45.199
Spain is 1 hour ahead of the UK but almost all of the country

00:15:45.219 --> 00:15:48.859
is to the west of London, where Greenwich Mean Time comes from.

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:53.809
What happens if I’m in Chile and I need to call Morocco?

00:15:54.339 --> 00:16:00.719
There are 3 time zones in Chile, the clocks go back 1 hour in April, and Morocco

00:16:00.729 --> 00:16:06.189
observes Daylight Saving Time all year round, apart from during Ramadan, where the

00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:11.039
clocks go back so that people observing Ramadan can break their fast 1 hour earlier.

00:16:12.977 --> 00:16:17.217
You can quickly see how this all gets pretty complicated , which is one

00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:21.307
of the main reasons that there are movements to get rid of it altogether.

00:16:22.437 --> 00:16:28.657
Indeed, there was an EU directive to get all member countries to either

00:16:28.717 --> 00:16:33.757
adopt year round Daylight Saving Time or universal time, normal time,

00:16:34.207 --> 00:16:40.167
and from 2021 all EU countries will have to choose which to go for.

00:16:41.227 --> 00:16:44.837
Some countries look like they’ll go for universal time,

00:16:45.207 --> 00:16:48.977
winter time, all year round, and others for summer time.

00:16:49.947 --> 00:16:54.487
The UK says it has no plans to get rid of Daylight Saving Time,

00:16:54.867 --> 00:16:59.567
which could well lead to a time difference between Northern Ireland,

00:16:59.737 --> 00:17:04.007
which is part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which is not.

00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:10.037
It would of course be pretty weird to have one small island on two

00:17:10.037 --> 00:17:14.457
different time zones for half the year, but this is a real possibility.

00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:18.377
Discussions on what to actually do about this have

00:17:18.407 --> 00:17:23.207
stalled, given COVID-19, but there are no easy answers.

00:17:24.447 --> 00:17:29.107
So, you may well have woken up on Sunday morning and counted

00:17:29.107 --> 00:17:32.307
your lucky stars because you got an extra hour in bed.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:39.997
But this change is very controversial, and this may be one of the last years that you have to do it.

00:17:41.277 --> 00:17:44.327
At least you can count yourself lucky that you don’t

00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:47.567
work in one of the residences of the Queen of England.

00:17:48.497 --> 00:17:53.507
There are reportedly 1000 different clocks in her different palaces

00:17:53.517 --> 00:17:58.728
around the country and her staff need to go around every one of them

00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:03.058
in the early morning, twice a year, setting them to the right time.

00:18:04.108 --> 00:18:08.768
You’re not going to win any prizes for guessing what they think of Daylight Saving Time.

00:18:11.068 --> 00:18:15.578
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Daylight Saving Time.

00:18:16.158 --> 00:18:20.568
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new about this change

00:18:20.728 --> 00:18:26.358
that affects 70 different countries, and that we still haven’t really figured out the answer to.

00:18:27.478 --> 00:18:31.968
And as a final reminder, if you are looking to improve your English in a more interesting

00:18:31.968 --> 00:18:37.128
way, to join a community of curious minds from all over the world, and to unlock the

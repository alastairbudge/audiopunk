Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.030
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.820
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.543
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about an unusual and controversial

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:29.533
plan the British government came up with to deal with the issue of illegal immigration.

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:33.943
It is the plan to deport asylum seekers and illegal

00:00:33.953 --> 00:00:37.853
immigrants to the small East African country of Rwanda.

00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:43.833
It might sound unusual, unfair, perhaps even a parody, a bad

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:47.543
joke, but it is indeed a current British government policy.

00:00:48.263 --> 00:00:55.113
So, let’s not waste a minute, and ask ourselves Why Britain Is Deporting Migrants to Rwanda?

00:00:56.653 --> 00:01:03.563
On the 14th of June 2022, an aeroplane stood on the tarmac, ready to take off.

00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:07.783
It was a large plane, with enough space for hundreds of

00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:12.773
people, but there were as few as seven passengers on board.

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:17.403
It was an expensive flight, paid for by the British

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:23.523
government at a reported cost of £500,000, almost €600,000.

00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:27.973
The passengers on board were people that the UK

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:31.703
government had declared had entered the country illegally.

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:38.263
They were to be sent to Rwanda where they would be rehoused and resettled,

00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:43.353
given a new life in a country 7,000 kilometres away from the UK.

00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:49.463
None of these 7 people were from Rwanda, or anywhere near Rwanda.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:56.443
Rwanda was as foreign and unknown to them as it is to me, and perhaps is to you.

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:03.643
The flight was getting ready to leave, but after hours of waiting, it was cancelled.

00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:09.063
There was a last-minute intervention from the European Court of Human Rights

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:14.160
that the flight was illegal and violated the human rights of the passengers.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.590
The engines stopped whirring, the passengers got out and were

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.720
returned to the detention centre where they had been held.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.880
It was a huge embarrassment to the British government, but British

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.310
politicians insisted that this was just a temporary setback, a delay.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.200
The British government would continue with its stated and controversial policy of deporting

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.160
asylum seekers and illegal immigrants to the East African nation, come hell or high water.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.980
Or perhaps more accurately, so long as the European Court of Human Rights didn’t get in the way.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.050
Now, as of the time of recording this episode, so the start of 2024, not a single person has

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.190
been deported to Rwanda, but the British government is still insisting that it will happen.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.110
So, why is it doing this, what is the objective, what are the major

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.414
criticisms of it, both moral and legal, and what is actually going to happen?

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:25.024
Let’s start with the first question, why is Britain deporting people to Rwanda?

00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:30.917
Compared to some European countries, Britain has a long tradition

00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:34.977
of immigration, of people coming to the country to settle here.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:42.015
It might be a step too far to go all the way back to the Vikings or William the Conqueror, who was

00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:48.125
from Normandy in France, but certainly in the second half of the 20th century, with the process

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:54.525
of decolonisation and to try to beef up its economy in the post-war years, Britain welcomed

00:03:54.535 --> 00:04:00.955
millions of people from former colonies including Jamaica, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.823
And then in the mid-2000s, with the expansion of the European

00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:10.333
Union, a new type of immigrant started to settle in the UK.

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:14.593
Europeans, especially people from Eastern Europe.

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:20.163
Poles in particular, with the population of people from Poland in the UK

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:30.583
going from 75,000 in 2003 to 911,000 in 2016, a more than 12 times increase.

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:35.723
And the demographic makeup of the country changed, with foreigners

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:39.323
making up an increasing proportion of the UK population.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:46.343
To give you some more numbers, the percentage of the British population that was born abroad

00:04:46.653 --> 00:05:00.693
was 4.2% in 1951, rising to 8.3% in 2001, rising still to 12.7% in 2011 and 14.4% in 2022.

00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:10.222
In other words, today, something like one in every 7 people living in the UK was born abroad.

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:15.866
Like in practically every country, in the UK immigration

00:05:15.886 --> 00:05:19.756
is a controversial topic, it is a political hot potato.

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:24.816
There are plenty of people who think it is wonderful, who believe that immigrants

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:29.541
add huge value to every element of Britain and British culture, and that the

00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:34.436
UK is a better place thanks to its relatively high proportion of immigrants.

00:05:35.696 --> 00:05:40.626
On the other hand, like in every country, there are those who feel that there are too many

00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:46.797
immigrants, that immigrants are hurting the British economy and eroding British culture and values.

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:52.443
To state the obvious, it is a hot topic, arousing passionate

00:05:52.443 --> 00:05:56.803
views on both sides, and it is certainly not black and white.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:03.363
But in June of 2016, the British government gave its

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.453
citizens the right to have their say on the issue.

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:14.363
Not only on immigration, but on whether to stay in or leave the EU, the European Union.

00:06:15.793 --> 00:06:22.014
As you may remember, it was a highly divisive referendum, but 52% of the country

00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:28.414
voted to leave, with immigration and “taking back control” being a major motivation.

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.789
In other words, leaving the EU would mean that Britain could have more

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.319
control over its borders, and the number of immigrants would reduce.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.629
The reality was that this simply didn’t happen, and

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.139
things have actually gone in the opposite direction.

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.849
Migration to Britain has increased dramatically since Brexit, with more than a million

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:59.389
people migrating to the country in 2022, the majority of them coming from non-EU countries.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:06.629
What happened is that the UK didn’t just swap immigrants from EU countries for immigrants

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.069
from non-EU countries, the number of immigrants overall increased significantly.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:17.219
For the British Conservative government, which has been campaigning

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.759
to crack down on immigration, and which pledged that Brexit would

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:26.349
deliver this this is something of an embarrassment and policy failure.

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:32.649
It told the British public that it would reduce immigration, but it has increased.

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:36.159
Now, how does this relate to Rwanda?

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:42.009
Well, the immigration that we've been talking about so far, the vast proportion of

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:47.649
it is legal immigration, it is people who have been given visas to work or study

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:53.359
in the country, people who have every legal right to be here, and in many cases are

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:58.139
paying a lot of money through university fees or taxes into the British economy.

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:05.159
But there is a subsection of this immigrant population that did not arrive in the country this

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:12.499
way, and instead arrived in small boats from continental Europe, or smuggled in lorries or ships.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:18.071
As you will know, starting in the mid-2010s, an increasing number of

00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:22.721
people have fled their countries and tried to seek a new life in Europe.

00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:28.791
Syrians, Afghans, Nigerians, Pakistanis, people from all over the world have

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:33.911
risked their lives and left their families in the hope of a better life in Europe.

00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:41.801
Britain, as a small island nation to the north of Europe, far away from the Mediterranean, was

00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:47.731
not on the frontlines, but it has still seen an increasing number of people trying to cross

00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:53.361
over the channel, the sea between England and France, to the shores of the United Kingdom.

00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:59.351
To give you some numbers on this, in 2022 there were applications for

00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:06.141
almost 100,000 asylum seekers in Britain, up from only 18,000 in 2010.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:13.191
And it is these people that we are talking about today, this is the category of people that the

00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:19.101
British government has announced it wants to start deporting to the small African country of Rwanda.

00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:24.371
Now, I appreciate that it has taken us a while to get to this

00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:28.651
bit, but the context is important to understand the “why”.

00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:35.031
Legal migration to Britain is a large net positive economically for the

00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:39.931
country; the health service needs workers, and there are not enough in the UK.

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:44.221
Nurses, doctors, hospital porters - these people come

00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:48.141
to the UK, deliver vital services, and pay taxes.

00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:53.451
Similarly, British universities make a large proportion of

00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:56.781
their money from the high fees that foreign students pay.

00:09:57.851 --> 00:10:03.001
The foreign students subsidise the cost for British students, so without

00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:06.481
these foreign students, it would cost more for people in Britain.

00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:13.351
Realistically, the government knew that reducing the tax-paying working population or the

00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:19.291
number of high-fee-paying students would harm the economy, but it needed to do something

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:23.821
to show that it was addressing the British public’s concern with rising immigration.

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.571
So, what does the British government decide to do?

00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:34.391
It aims for the most visible type of migration, the kind that is splashed all over the British

00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:41.491
tabloids and right-wing press; illegal immigration, people coming in boats or smuggled in lorries.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:48.986
And in April of 2022, the then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:54.318
that his government had formed a plan with the government of Rwanda to take

00:10:54.348 --> 00:10:58.778
people whom Britain had identified as asylum seekers or illegal immigrants.

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:05.748
Britain would pay £120 million, so almost €150 million,

00:11:06.178 --> 00:11:08.438
to the Rwandan government to set up the scheme.

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:16.788
It would then pay between £20,000 and £30,000 for each person successfully settled there.

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:24.186
It might seem expensive, but the British government claimed that it was actually a good deal

00:11:24.236 --> 00:11:30.756
for the British people; keeping asylum seekers in Britain is not cheap, and so many people

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:36.376
were seeking asylum that there was a huge backlog, there were far too many people to deal with.

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:40.647
Paying another country to do it for them, to solve

00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:44.217
this problem, was simply good business, it made sense.

00:11:45.817 --> 00:11:48.767
What’s more, the British government said that this policy

00:11:48.787 --> 00:11:52.327
would deter potential asylum seekers from crossing the channel.

00:11:53.387 --> 00:11:57.377
If you thought that you might end up in Rwanda, a country that you had absolutely

00:11:57.387 --> 00:12:01.697
no links to, perhaps you would think twice before trying to cross over into

00:12:01.697 --> 00:12:06.797
Britain and you would remain in France or go to another European country.

00:12:08.407 --> 00:12:15.697
And there was also another supposedly humanitarian objective behind it; by deterring potential

00:12:15.697 --> 00:12:21.587
asylum seekers from attempting the crossing, it would deal an important blow to the vile business

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:27.187
of human trafficking, the people who make money smuggling vulnerable people across Europe.

00:12:28.657 --> 00:12:33.557
And on the Rwandan side, clearly the Rwandan government needed to sell this

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:39.187
policy to its people, but in this case, money talks; the British government

00:12:39.397 --> 00:12:45.127
paid well, and Rwanda, well, it is not a rich country and it needed the money.

00:12:46.497 --> 00:12:49.987
In fact, it wasn’t just the Rwandan government that needed to

00:12:49.987 --> 00:12:53.412
sell this policy to its people; the British government did too.

00:12:54.714 --> 00:12:58.624
It was and still is the subject of major debate.

00:12:59.684 --> 00:13:04.194
Its supporters make the same argument as the UK government; it makes

00:13:04.194 --> 00:13:08.744
economic sense, it deters future migrants, and it stops human trafficking.

00:13:10.144 --> 00:13:14.784
But to its critics, it is everything from immoral to illegal.

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:20.274
These are people who have often fled war, persecution, and

00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:24.424
famine, in some cases wars perpetuated by the British government.

00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:29.744
Many will have left loved ones behind or lost loved ones on the journey.

00:13:30.204 --> 00:13:35.169
They have suffered enough, so the argument goes; it is inhumane to pack them

00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:38.889
on a plane and send them to a country that they have absolutely no links to.

00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:45.908
And as to the legal question, the British courts of law are divided on the issue.

00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:53.598
In December of 2022, the British high courts ruled that the plan was legal; it was

00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:58.988
an agreement between the UK and Rwanda, the individuals in question had come to the

00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:04.748
UK without the legal right to do so, and there was nothing illegal about sending

00:14:04.748 --> 00:14:09.278
them to a different country if that country agreed to take them, which Rwanda did.

00:14:10.658 --> 00:14:15.118
However, this decision was reversed a matter of months later,

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:19.718
with the law courts ruling that it was in fact illegal.

00:14:21.098 --> 00:14:27.538
Rwanda is in effect a one-party state without a strong rule of law, and there was not enough

00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:32.458
evidence that these people would be treated humanely and fairly when they arrived there.

00:14:33.398 --> 00:14:35.008
The plan was illegal.

00:14:36.528 --> 00:14:40.698
And that’s before we get to the moral question, which was even more divisive.

00:14:41.518 --> 00:14:46.548
There were large protests on the day that the first plane was scheduled to leave, with human rights

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:53.618
advocates blocking the roads, chanting “no more deportation” and “seeking asylum is not a crime”.

00:14:54.888 --> 00:14:58.968
In terms of the opinion of the British public, it is tightly divided.

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:04.568
Shortly after it was announced, a YouGov survey reported that

00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:10.396
42% of people disagreed with the plan, while 35% supported it.

00:15:12.076 --> 00:15:17.606
But a matter of a couple of months later, in June of 2022 and after the

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:21.476
government had had the chance to release more statistics on the increase of

00:15:21.476 --> 00:15:26.206
illegal immigration and had had the chance to put forward its arguments, this

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:33.016
had reversed, with 44% of people supporting it and 40% of people opposing it.

00:15:34.486 --> 00:15:37.216
So, what is actually going to happen?

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:42.456
The plan is still being fought by human rights activists and lawyers

00:15:42.466 --> 00:15:45.546
for the people who have been told that they will be deported to Rwanda.

00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:51.386
As of the start of 2024, nobody has gone, but the

00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:54.006
government is saying that it’s only a matter of time.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:00.010
As the debate continues, let's finish by looking at some broader implications.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.370
This plan isn't just about immigration policy; it's

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.580
also about international relations and human rights.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:13.040
By outsourcing its immigration responsibilities, Britain is entering

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.080
uncharted territory, this is something that hasn’t been done before.

00:16:18.517 --> 00:16:22.577
As such, it raises questions about the future of international asylum

00:16:22.577 --> 00:16:26.377
norms and the responsibilities of countries towards asylum seekers.

00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:32.057
Moreover, critics argue that this policy could set a worrying precedent.

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:37.717
If it’s successful, it might encourage other countries to adopt similar measures,

00:16:38.137 --> 00:16:43.227
potentially leading to a global shift in how we handle asylum and immigration issues.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:47.557
Instead of welcoming asylum seekers with open arms,

00:16:47.927 --> 00:16:51.117
countries simply pay another poorer country to take them.

00:16:52.057 --> 00:16:57.227
Yes, they might be protected from the persecution and wars they were fleeing from, but they

00:16:57.227 --> 00:17:02.737
are far from where they wanted to be, potentially irrevocably separated from their families.

00:17:04.005 --> 00:17:09.880
Supporters, however, see this as a practical solution to a complex problem, highlighting

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.510
that it could bring order to an otherwise chaotic and dangerous migration process.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.520
They argue that it could reduce the number of dangerous crossings and save lives while ensuring

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.920
that those in genuine need of asylum receive protection in a safe and structured environment.

00:17:27.466 --> 00:17:32.726
As of early 2024, the future of this policy is still in limbo, how it

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:37.026
progresses is likely to be determined by legal challenges, public opinion,

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:41.566
and in the UK’s case, an expected general election later on in the year.

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:45.476
No matter where you stand on this issue, it's

00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:49.266
undeniable that the way we handle migration is evolving.

00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:55.401
What’s clear is that the story of Britain's plan to deport migrants to Rwanda is far

00:17:55.401 --> 00:18:01.261
from over, and its outcome could have far-reaching consequences for many years to come.

00:18:03.731 --> 00:18:07.091
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the British

00:18:07.091 --> 00:18:10.421
government’s controversial plan to deport migrants to Rwanda.

00:18:11.021 --> 00:18:13.851
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:17.061
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:17.591 --> 00:18:19.101
What do you think of this proposal?

00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:23.281
A sound idea, completely immoral, or somewhere in between?

00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:26.961
Are there similar proposals being made by the government of your

00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:30.791
country, what are they, and where do people stand on the issue?

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:34.071
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

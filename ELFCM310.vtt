Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:16.832
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.202
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:25.812
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is the start of another

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:30.682
three-part mini-series, this time with the theme of “Halloween”.

00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:36.062
In part one, today’s episode, we’ll be diving into the gory history

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:40.862
behind one of Halloween’s more modern figures, vampires, and look at

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:44.942
how they became the unmistakable blood-sucking creatures we know today.

00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:51.252
Next up, in part two, we will look at werewolves, humans who turn into

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:56.322
wolves, and hear strange stories of transformation, trials and terror.

00:00:56.932 --> 00:01:02.902
And in the final part, part 3, we will focus on witches and their equally grim past.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:09.057
OK, let’s get started and talk about the spooky world of vampires.

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.807
The year is 1893.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:18.297
Your name is Jonathan Harker, and you are a young English lawyer.

00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:23.307
One of your clients, a man living in Transylvania, has

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:27.257
called you to his castle to finalise a property transaction.

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:33.497
The journey has been very long, cold, and quite frankly, creepy.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:39.087
When passers-by learn of your destination, you can sense their terror.

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:47.687
Their skin turned pale, their eyes widened, and they held up crucifixes while they prayed to God.

00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:53.267
You don’t speak their language, but you think you heard the words ‘devil’,

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:59.157
‘hell’ and ‘vampire’, and you begin to get a sinking feeling in your stomach.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:04.427
Your anxiety only increases as you endure your final stretch of

00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:07.647
the journey in your open horse carriage in the dead of night.

00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:13.687
You can’t see much around you but you are sure you saw your driver’s eyes were a

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:19.687
bright red colour, and you can hear the howling of wolves getting closer and closer.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:26.227
Cold and tense, you finally see the black silhouette of the giant castle.

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:31.647
You might be at your final destination, but you are by no means happy about it.

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:38.737
When you reach the enormous wooden doors, you are met not by servants, as you expected,

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:46.917
but one single old man who introduces himself as Count Dracula and invites you inside.

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:50.197
He speaks with a strong accent.

00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:52.417
His face is long and thin.

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:58.937
When he speaks, his red lips move to reveal sharp fang-like teeth

00:02:59.187 --> 00:03:02.457
that are in surprisingly good condition for such an old man.

00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:09.937
He has a long pointed nose and chin, a large forehead and bushy arched eyebrows.

00:03:10.637 --> 00:03:14.887
His hair is dark and thick, not what you expect for a man of

00:03:14.887 --> 00:03:19.817
his age, and through it you could see his peculiar pointed ears.

00:03:20.927 --> 00:03:26.997
Out from his cape you are shocked to see hairy hands with unusually long nails.

00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:32.737
As he places his hand on your back to guide you through the silent castle,

00:03:32.747 --> 00:03:38.607
you shiver, unsure if it’s from his unsettling touch or his horrible breath.

00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:44.337
And off you go, taking your first steps through a castle

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:48.757
from which you will only just manage to escape alive.

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:54.457
This is a summary of the beginning of the most famous vampire story

00:03:54.587 --> 00:04:00.327
of all time, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which was written in 1897.

00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:06.957
As the account suggests, Stoker’s novel is full of all the things you’d expect from a

00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:14.127
vampire story: fangs, sharp teeth, blood sucking and haunted castles, to name but a few.

00:04:14.747 --> 00:04:19.037
These are the fundamentals, the key features, of vampires.

00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:25.997
Vampires are, of course, the undead, people who have died but can come back to

00:04:25.997 --> 00:04:30.637
life, and who must suck the blood of the living at night in order to survive.

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.135
Stoker’s novel even includes details that have become

00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:38.800
modern stereotypical characteristics of vampires.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:45.345
For example, how they can shape shift [they can change, usually into bats], they can’t

00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:51.275
be seen in the reflection of mirrors, how garlic can be used to keep them away, and

00:04:51.475 --> 00:04:57.355
that they can only be killed by stabbing a stake, a wooden post, through their heart.

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:06.125
With his book, Bram Stoker brought vampires into mainstream popular culture and helped to create

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:11.775
those unmistakable Halloween costumes that you may see people dressed up in in late October.

00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:16.465
But although he refined many of their characteristics,

00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:20.925
Stoker certainly hadn’t invented the concept of vampires.

00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:26.485
So if we are to take for granted that vampires don’t actually exist,

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:31.105
where did he get his ideas, where did the inspiration come from?

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:38.995
Well, legends similar to vampires have existed throughout cultures across the globe for millennia.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:47.325
There are the Chinese Jiang Shi, the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who and the Brazilian Jaracas.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.875
All of these are creatures that must suck the blood of their victims to survive.

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:58.065
But it was European folklore which primarily inspired Stoker.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:04.755
In Europe, we had Vrykolakas from ancient Greece, a dangerous creature

00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:09.735
of the undead which feasts in particular on its victims’ livers.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:16.325
Greek myth also gave us the Strix, a bird, usually an owl, believed

00:06:16.455 --> 00:06:20.215
to be a bad omen which would feast on human flesh and blood.

00:06:21.155 --> 00:06:25.445
In Slavic folklore, there were the demon creatures, Upiór.

00:06:26.165 --> 00:06:29.845
These creatures could appear if a person was cursed during

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:33.955
their life, or if their corpse was desecrated, or abused.

00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:39.895
The Upiór had a detached head, glowing eyes, and they drank

00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:43.855
human blood which gave them super strength to kill more victims.

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:49.035
But they could also kill with their poisonous breath or deafening screams.

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:56.505
Even closer to Transylvanian Count Dracula was the Romanian mythical creature, the Strigoi.

00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:00.990
These are troubled spirits that have risen from the grave

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.540
to feast on the blood of victims and gain great strength.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.070
As you can see, many cultures across the globe have these somewhat

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.670
similar vampire-like creatures, with slightly different characteristics.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.810
But they all have one thing in common - they need to drink the blood of the living.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.790
You might think that this is a perfectly reasonable thing for a monstrous creation

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:32.380
to want to do but, according to some scholars, the human invention of blood-sucking

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:37.330
mythical monsters all comes down to a misunderstanding around how bodies

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.090
decompose, or break down, essentially, what happens to the human body after death.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.223
Okay, this next bit is a little graphic, so if you happen to be eating

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.800
you might want to press pause on this episode, or put down your sandwich.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.970
When internal organs break down inside a corpse it

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.200
creates a dark, pungent liquid, called ‘purge fluid’.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.080
This fluid can leave the corpse through the nose and the mouth.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.810
Historians believe that people thought this fluid was blood and a

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.600
sign that the corpses had been drinking the blood of the living.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.820
But why were people digging up corpses, digging up dead bodies?

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.530
Well, again this comes down to a misunderstanding about the

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.520
way that the human body, and in particular, disease, works.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:38.400
Especially in the Medieval era, when there were epidemics, such as the plague, the black

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.980
death, vampires, or vampire-like monsters, were often blamed for spreading disease.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:51.420
When there were a large number of deaths happening in one area, instead of saying “this is

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.790
a disease, it has spread”, people especially in rural communities feared that there was a

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:05.120
new supernatural killer on the loose, a vampire being a commonly blamed culprit - though, as

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.600
we will see in part two, there were instances of this being blamed on werewolves, as well.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.930
The villagers would dig up the dead bodies, they would see the purge fluid,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.040
they would think that this was proof that the person had drunk the blood of

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.520
the living, and had spread disease, and this was all the proof they needed.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.110
In some cases, they would even take drastic action to stop these

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.000
dead people from being able to rise again from their graves.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:41.010
In Venice, archeologists have uncovered buried plague victims from

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.240
the 16th century and among them is one body with a brick in its mouth.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.120
Historians believe this to be an attempt to prevent the individual

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.630
from rising from their grave and feasting on the living.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:02.790
Of course, superstition and the belief in dark magic was common during the Middle Ages and vampires

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:09.220
were just one of the many strange beliefs in Europe at this time, as our next episodes will show.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:15.310
But across Europe, stories of vampires continued to grow both in volume and

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:20.160
in popularity while beliefs in witches and werewolves were starting to fade.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.010
During the 18th century increasing accounts of vampire sightings were reported,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:34.060
and the period of 1725 to 1755 has been dubbed “The Great Vampire Epidemic”.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:43.730
One of the earliest and most sensational instances was in 1725, when a Serbian peasant called Petar

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.280
Blagojević was accused of having transformed into a vampire and killed nine of his neighbours.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:58.800
On their deathbeds, the villagers had insisted that Petar had risen up and choked them in the night.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.320
Petar, it should be underlined, was dead himself.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.220
The accusations were against a dead man.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.050
After his death, so the allegations went, Petar had

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.420
returned to his home and demanded food from his son.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.740
Terrified, the son refused, which led to Petar

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.310
murdering him by biting him and then drinking his blood.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.870
Following these stories, the villagers decided to exhume Petar’s

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.520
body, to dig it up, to inspect it for signs he had become a vampire,

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.760
such as long fingernails, growing hair and a lack of decomposition.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.710
These were all signs that people believed were associated with

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.560
vampirism, with being a vampire, but they are actually signs of people

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.960
not understanding the process that a body goes through after death.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:57.350
Again, this is a little bit gory, but after someone dies, their skin begins

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:02.460
to shrink on their body, which makes their fingernails and hair appear longer.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.220
So, you may not be surprised to find out, that when they dug up Petar’s body

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:13.960
the villagers did, in fact, see these signs and also the delightful display of

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.770
purge fluid, and they had all the evidence they needed that he was a vampire.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.340
The village then had no options other than to destroy Petar once

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.420
and for all before he killed every single inhabitant who remained.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.980
So, they burnt Petar’s body to ashes, ensuring he could never rise again.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.144
Petar’s story spread rapidly throughout Europe, translated into German, French and English, and it

00:12:43.154 --> 00:12:49.294
did much to accelerate the contemporary vampire craze, which was particularly strong in rural areas.

00:12:50.454 --> 00:12:55.644
Hysteria grew to such a point that by the mid-18th century, the Pope

00:12:55.774 --> 00:13:00.444
was forced to declare that vampires were “fictions of human fantasy”.

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:07.554
The ruler of the Hapsburg Empire, Maria Theresa, was forced to intervene as well and she would

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:13.264
send her personal physician to investigate whenever someone was accused of being a vampire.

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:20.384
He concluded, perhaps unsurprisingly, that vampires were absolutely not real and so

00:13:20.514 --> 00:13:26.044
she too announced that vampires were nothing but “superstition and fraud”, and she

00:13:26.084 --> 00:13:30.434
outlawed the practice of digging up graves and examining the bodies of the dead.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:36.194
Many other European countries followed the Hapsburgs’ stance on vampires and

00:13:36.394 --> 00:13:41.394
developments in science certainly helped to prove that vampires simply didn’t exist.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:49.554
But none of this could put a dent in, could damage, the popularity of vampire stories, and though

00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:56.354
the belief in real vampires did start to decline the popularity of their stories certainly did not.

00:13:57.654 --> 00:14:02.371
And vampires soon became a source for novelists and storytellers.

00:14:02.944 --> 00:14:08.614
The first vampire novel published in English was John Polidori’s 1819 story, The

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:13.524
Vampyre, which was inspired by the scandalous life of the famous English poet

00:14:13.714 --> 00:14:19.524
Lord Byron, who is imagined as the suave, or charming, vampire, Lord Ruthven.

00:14:20.244 --> 00:14:24.034
As a quick side note - if you would like to learn more about the scandalous

00:14:24.034 --> 00:14:28.634
life of Lord Byron, check out episode 244 if you haven’t done so already.

00:14:29.664 --> 00:14:33.321
OK, back to vampires, and Polidori's The Vampyre.

00:14:33.928 --> 00:14:40.314
This book was immensely influential and set a trend of other vampire stories coming to press.

00:14:41.314 --> 00:14:46.874
But none were as popular as Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which combined features

00:14:47.004 --> 00:14:52.794
from all these stories, real and fictional, but with an added sensuality and

00:14:52.964 --> 00:14:57.634
horror that was clearly a recipe for success in Victorian England and beyond.

00:14:58.484 --> 00:15:05.244
Indeed, Stoker’s novel has never actually been out of print since it was first published in 1897.

00:15:06.774 --> 00:15:11.974
But aside from tales of peasant vampires across Europe, Stoker’s Dracula is believed

00:15:12.014 --> 00:15:17.764
to be inspired by one more infamous figure from history, Vlad the Impaler, and

00:15:17.904 --> 00:15:21.904
it is here where some descriptions will get a little graphic again, I’m afraid.

00:15:22.814 --> 00:15:27.464
This brutal ruler of fifteenth century Romania got his nickname from his

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:32.914
preferred method of torture, impaling his victims on a wooden or metal

00:15:32.924 --> 00:15:38.474
pole alive and leaving them there to die, for hours or sometimes even days.

00:15:39.214 --> 00:15:41.004
Truly, a horrific way to go.

00:15:42.257 --> 00:15:47.534
Vlad’s other preferred methods of torture included beheading, skinning or

00:15:47.664 --> 00:15:52.984
boiling victims alive, and even paying diseased men to infect his enemies.

00:15:53.624 --> 00:15:59.274
There are even stories that Vlad would invite enemy families over for feasts only

00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:04.984
to stab them all and continue to dine, continue to eat, amongst their dying bodies.

00:16:05.624 --> 00:16:10.334
Some even said that he dipped his bread in their blood, and it is this

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:14.544
bloodthirstiness, as well as their shared homeland, that has led to

00:16:14.544 --> 00:16:18.884
Vlad the Impaler’s identification with the world’s most famous vampire.

00:16:20.274 --> 00:16:25.824
Now, moving to the more present day, with the invention of film, the story

00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:31.614
of Dracula, and the idea of the vampire would gain an even wider audience.

00:16:32.364 --> 00:16:36.924
In 1931, Stoker’s novel was put on the big screen, with

00:16:36.924 --> 00:16:40.394
the release of the hugely influential “Dracula” movie.

00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:45.524
It was also around the same time as the Dracula movie that the mass

00:16:45.524 --> 00:16:50.204
production of Halloween costumes began in the US, which further helped to

00:16:50.354 --> 00:16:54.874
secure the image of this portrayal of Dracula in the minds of the public.

00:16:56.034 --> 00:17:00.634
And as vampires became better-known figures in Western popular culture,

00:17:00.904 --> 00:17:05.244
they received more varying treatments in both literature and film.

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:11.824
In the 1970s, with the boom of science fiction, vampires became a common feature.

00:17:12.854 --> 00:17:20.664
And moving into the 1990s and to the modern day, vampires almost went full circle, becoming

00:17:20.754 --> 00:17:26.504
human again, or at least with human hopes and dreams, through films and series like

00:17:26.574 --> 00:17:32.644
Interview with a Vampire, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and more recently the Twilight series.

00:17:33.794 --> 00:17:39.154
Vampires, along with   which we will discuss in our next episode, were rebranded

00:17:39.174 --> 00:17:44.084
for a teen-girl audience and it was an incredibly successful enterprise.

00:17:45.094 --> 00:17:49.294
No longer were vampires like Stoker’s unsettling description,

00:17:49.584 --> 00:17:53.344
they were young, attractive and had moral dilemmas.

00:17:54.224 --> 00:17:59.504
Indeed, many of the tropes such as garlic, crucifixes and holy

00:17:59.504 --> 00:18:04.064
water are totally removed from the modern idea of vampires.

00:18:04.774 --> 00:18:08.554
They are almost unrecognisable when compared to the original

00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:12.224
portrayal of Dracula on the big screen, back in 1933.

00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:19.144
But despite their modern makeovers, every year for Halloween streets are lined

00:18:19.154 --> 00:18:24.234
with children dressed as the classic and unmistakable Dracula-like vampire.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:29.284
And now you know of the grim history behind these costumes, you

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:32.534
may not be able to look at that fake blood the same way again.

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:40.184
Ultimately, the story of vampires is the story of humans trying to ascribe a spooky,

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:45.304
supernatural explanation for something that is completely natural and rational.

00:18:46.244 --> 00:18:53.144
Whether it be decomposition, disease or demonising a neighbour, when people did not fully understand

00:18:53.144 --> 00:19:00.084
something, vampires offered them an explanation, albeit one that was very gruesome indeed.

00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:07.684
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on vampires, part one

00:19:07.804 --> 00:19:11.404
of our three-part mini-series with the theme of Halloween.

00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:16.634
In our next episode, we will be delving into the monstrous stories surrounding

00:19:16.654 --> 00:19:21.654
another Halloween favourite, the werewolf, which much like the blood-sucking

00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:26.164
protagonists of this episode, also caused some shocking public scares.

00:19:26.704 --> 00:19:29.894
And in our final part, part three, it will be the

00:19:29.934 --> 00:19:33.574
unfortunate lives of women accused of being witches.

00:19:34.204 --> 00:19:37.394
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:37.714 --> 00:19:39.804
Have you read Bram Stoker’s Dracula?

00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:43.504
Why do you think we have this obsession with vampires?

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:47.928
Are there other vampire-like creatures or myths in your country?

00:19:48.248 --> 00:19:51.768
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

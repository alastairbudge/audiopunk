Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:15.935
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.945
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:24.605
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to continue talking about

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:29.005
The Trial of Amanda Knox, or rather, the murder of Meredith Kercher.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:35.125
This is very much a follow up episode, so if you haven’t listened to part one of this story,

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:40.885
the episode before this, then now is the time to press pause and go back and listen to that one.

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:46.755
And, like the last one, this episode does come with the same parental guidance

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:50.675
warning, as we are going to be talking about the murder of a young woman.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.665
OK then, the Trial of Amanda Knox.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.135
As we heard in the last episode, Meredith Kercher

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.380
was found brutally murdered in her house in Perugia.

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:08.188
She was 21 years old, and the police soon honed in on Kercher’s

00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:12.675
housemate, Amanda Knox, and her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:18.635
Knox was American, on a study abroad programme, and Sollecito

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:22.335
was Italian, from a city called Bari in southern Italy.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:31.611
Not to recap too much on what we already covered in the last episode, but Knox and Sollecito

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:38.045
were arrested days after the murder, they were found guilty in court not once but twice,

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:46.635
but they were finally declared innocent of all charges in 2015, 8 years after the murder.

00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:52.805
And during those 8 years, their names and the most intimate details of

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.625
their lives were splashed all over the newspapers in Italy and the United

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:02.755
States, where they were from, but also in the UK, where Kercher was from.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.985
This is the first area to discuss in more detail.

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:14.465
The sheer amount of media coverage and attention on the trial was unprecedented.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:19.335
130 different newspapers and TV channels applied for

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:22.755
press passes to the courtroom, to report on the trial.

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:28.265
The grim reality of this, given that a young woman had been

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:32.815
brutally killed, was that this case was of huge public interest.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:41.165
And depending on the media outlet, and what country it was from, the coverage was very different.

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:47.455
The US press tended to be supportive of Amanda Knox, pointing

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:51.635
at holes or inconsistencies in the Italian justice system.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:57.895
She was our girl, she is a victim here, she is unjustly accused.

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:05.805
The Italian press tended to be highly critical of Knox, focussing on her sexual history

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:12.315
and painting her as a sort of classic young American who comes to Italy, behaves in a very

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:18.795
non-traditional and unacceptable way, having multiple sexual partners and taking drugs.

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:24.425
And the British press, especially the tabloid press, was

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:28.795
relentless in its pursuit of saucy stories about Knox.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:34.835
As you may know, or you might remember from the couple of episodes we made last year

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:40.855
on the British tabloids, the British press is one of the most invasive in the world.

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:46.725
There are basically no limits, and in the case of someone who has been accused

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:51.595
of such a heinous crime, especially when the victim was a young British

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:57.295
girl, every intimate detail of Knox’s life was made available to the public.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:02.865
And according to the British tabloid press, Knox was guilty.

00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:11.075
So, you had this sort of bizarre situation of the press from three different countries all

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:17.375
having different agendas, picking sides and defending their fellow citizens in the trial.

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:25.465
And under Italian law, newspapers were allowed to continue publishing these stories full of

00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:31.855
theories about why Knox and Sollecito might have committed the murder while the trial was ongoing.

00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:39.015
In the UK, for example, there are very strict laws about what the media can

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:43.345
publish when there is a trial, in order for the people on the jury not to

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:48.695
be swayed, their opinions changed, by evidence from outside the courtroom.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:54.285
And in the UK, jurors are told that they are not allowed

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:58.235
to read about the case or do any kind of external research.

00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:07.695
In Italy there are some similar laws, but they are a lot less strict, and given the scale

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:13.965
of the media coverage, unless a juror went to live in a cave for a year, it was practically

00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:20.395
impossible for them not to have read or watched stories about the two people being accused.

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:24.235
Now, why was there so much interest?

00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:29.995
People, unfortunately, get murdered all the time, but there was something

00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:34.635
about this case that meant it was orders of magnitude of more public

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:38.805
interest than practically any other murder case in the past 20 years.

00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:46.225
When looking through all of the coverage, and trying to understand why people were and

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:53.335
still are so fascinated by it, my main conclusion is that it has all of the elements of

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:59.745
what people are used to seeing in TV murder mysteries or detective shows, so it was like

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:05.675
watching a murder mystery in real life, or at least that’s how it was reported in the press.

00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:13.935
In a murder mystery you have the victim, of course, and there is the obvious suspect, the person

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:20.275
who has the criminal record, who was there at the time, and looks to have been caught red handed.

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:27.705
But then, something doesn’t quite add up, and the talented but slightly unhinged

00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:33.685
detective comes along and says “aha, it was actually this other, completely

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:38.265
unlikely person, someone who nobody would have thought could have done it, but

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:43.675
did it because of some very unusual motive that nobody would have expected”.

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:49.805
The detective is celebrated as a hero, the wrongly accused person is

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:55.125
freed, and the unlikely suspect is put in handcuffs and sent away.

00:06:56.285 --> 00:07:01.815
And of course, this all takes place in an unlikely setting, a peaceful

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:08.095
and happy place, like a hotel or a village…or an Italian hilltop town.

00:07:09.355 --> 00:07:11.625
It is a familiar theme to us all.

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:15.605
And the case of Meredith Kercher was no different.

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:18.995
The obvious candidate was Rudy Guede.

00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:24.195
He was a well-known criminal, he was known to carry a knife, and he had

00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:27.852
been caught breaking into houses in the weeks leading up to the murder.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:33.775
He fled the country, and signs of his presence were all over the murder scene.

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:39.195
There was the DNA evidence, his semen inside poor Meredith Kercher, his

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:42.945
handprints all over the bedroom, a bloody footprint in the bathroom.

00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:49.905
And, sorry for the scatalogical reference here, but he also left a large poo in the toilet.

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:56.585
He was clearly at the murder scene while Meredith was murdered, there is no question of this.

00:07:57.595 --> 00:08:01.935
And when the police presented him with this evidence, he admitted as

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:06.625
much, but claimed that he was in the bathroom, listening to loud music,

00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:11.175
and during that period someone broke into the house and killed Meredith.

00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:19.725
And when Guede emerged from the bathroom, he saw the killer, but the killer didn’t immediately flee,

00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:27.955
nor did he attack Guede, but he took the time to say to him “black man found, guilty man found”.

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:34.065
You would have to have quite a vivid imagination to believe that Guede was telling the truth here,

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:41.175
and that Meredith being murdered by someone else during the time Guede was on the toilet was more

00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:48.035
likely than by Guede, a career criminal who was known to break into houses and carry a knife.

00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:54.015
But this is where we need to talk about the next character in this real-life

00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:59.497
TV drama: the man with the vivid imagination, the “brilliant but eccentric

00:08:59.507 --> 00:09:05.137
detective”, who in this case was the lead prosecutor, Giuliano Mignini.

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:10.867
Mignini, by the way, has a history of inventing strange and unorthodox

00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:15.267
stories, and was already well-known in the region for reopening

00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:19.047
an investigation into the death of a wealthy doctor from Perugia.

00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:24.647
The doctor was found dead in a nearby lake, Lake Trasimeno, back

00:09:24.657 --> 00:09:29.797
in 1985, and it was initially believed that he had simply drowned.

00:09:30.797 --> 00:09:36.447
But Mignini didn’t believe it, instead deciding that this drowning must be

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:41.697
connected to the infamous Monster of Florence serial killer, who brutally killed

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:48.667
young couples in Tuscany between 1968 and 1985, and–importantly–was never caught.

00:09:50.017 --> 00:09:57.687
The point is, Mignini had a bit of a track record of eccentricity, of looking at a case where the

00:09:57.687 --> 00:10:04.717
answer might be simple, or a case that might not be a case at all, coming to his own fantastical

00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:11.157
conclusions about it and refusing to acknowledge any evidence that disproved his hypothesis.

00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:18.247
And, moving onto the next item on our recipe for a good murder mystery, we

00:10:18.247 --> 00:10:23.287
need our unlikely characters who at first seem completely unconnected to

00:10:23.287 --> 00:10:29.457
the crime, but who are duly unmasked as vicious, cold-blooded murderers.

00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:35.767
Knox, as you heard, was a young, attractive female student.

00:10:36.477 --> 00:10:40.977
Sollecito was a quiet, Harry Potter-esque computer science student.

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:46.577
They had only met weeks before, and neither had a criminal record.

00:10:47.377 --> 00:10:52.397
They did not fit any kind of stereotype about what violent murderers should be.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:59.187
What’s more, there was very little evidence putting them at the scene of the crime, until,

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:04.407
magically, their fingerprints were found on the murder weapon and on Meredith’s bra strap.

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:10.487
And then, for our final element, we had the unlikely setting for the murder.

00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:15.817
The picturesque hilltop city of Perugia, just a hundred metres

00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:19.653
from an Etruscan arch dating back to the third century BC.

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:26.957
So, to put all of these elements together, we have the unlikely setting for the crime, the very

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:33.667
likely guilty party, in the form of Rudy Guede, the unlikely suspects, in the form of Amanda

00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:39.707
Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, and then the genius investigator who manages to figure out that

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:46.097
the obvious answer is the wrong one, and in fact, the true answer is much more fantastical

00:11:46.097 --> 00:11:53.167
and bizarre than any normal person would have thought: in fact, Knox and Sollecito killed

00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:59.747
Meredith Kercher as part of some sex game or bizarre perhaps Halloween-related sexual ritual.

00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:07.337
When put like this, it's not hard to see why it was such a popular case for the media, and why

00:12:07.337 --> 00:12:13.357
it was in the media’s interest to continue pushing forward Mignini’s theories, because they

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:19.297
were much more interesting and would sell many more newspapers than the more obvious answer.

00:12:20.837 --> 00:12:26.247
As you heard in the last episode, even the BBC got involved, doing a profile on

00:12:26.707 --> 00:12:32.207
“who is the real Foxy Knoxy?”, writing: “a pretty young victim, brutally murdered

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:37.007
in mysterious circumstances, whose murderers were both wealthy and attractive.

00:12:37.667 --> 00:12:42.337
But what fascinated us most of all”, the BBC continued, “was the

00:12:42.337 --> 00:12:47.427
beautiful young murderess, and what was really going on behind her smile.”

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:54.887
An interesting linguistic note here is that “murderer” is not normally a word that you change

00:12:55.067 --> 00:13:00.997
depending on the gender of the person doing the murdering, but the journalist did it here to

00:13:01.007 --> 00:13:08.707
highlight the fact that, yes, Knox was a woman, she was not just a murderer, but a murderess.

00:13:09.677 --> 00:13:15.117
Now, there is one more linguistic element from this case that I’d like to draw your attention to.

00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:21.757
If you remember from part one, after 50 hours of interrogation, Knox

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:26.667
had broken down and accused her boss, Patrick Lumumba of the murder.

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:31.043
This was not, in fact, unprompted.

00:13:31.527 --> 00:13:35.567
The police had suggested to her that Lumumba was involved, and

00:13:35.807 --> 00:13:40.517
this all hinged on a text exchange that she had had with Lumumba.

00:13:41.647 --> 00:13:46.910
She worked in his bar, and was scheduled to work on the evening of Meredith’s murder.

00:13:47.781 --> 00:13:52.217
But the bar was quiet, not busy at all, so Lumumba had

00:13:52.257 --> 00:13:55.817
told her, in Italian, that she could have the evening off.

00:13:57.347 --> 00:14:01.287
She responded, in Italian, with “ci vediamo più tardi.

00:14:01.517 --> 00:14:04.987
Buona serata”, literally “see you later.

00:14:05.357 --> 00:14:06.177
Have a good evening”.

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:14.327
Remember, Knox had only recently arrived in Italy, so her Italian was not very good.

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:21.367
What she wrote was a very literal translation of what she wanted to say in English “see you later.

00:14:21.717 --> 00:14:22.557
Have a good evening”.

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:28.017
What Knox didn’t know, however, and what the police

00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:31.337
didn’t care to acknowledge, was that she made a mistake.

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:36.287
Not a grammatical mistake, but a contextual mistake.

00:14:37.707 --> 00:14:41.567
In English, if you say “see you later”, it doesn’t

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:45.657
necessarily mean that you have plans to see that person later.

00:14:46.577 --> 00:14:51.157
I can say to a friend “see you later”, and that might mean tomorrow,

00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:55.097
it might mean next week, it might mean “whenever I next see you”.

00:14:56.197 --> 00:15:00.917
“Ci vediamo più tardi”, “see you later” in Italian, has a literal

00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:05.887
sense, it implies that there is a fixed plan to meet later on..

00:15:07.057 --> 00:15:11.977
The police interpreted this as Knox saying that she had arranged to meet Lumumba later

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:16.687
that evening, but they should have realised that for someone who had just arrived from

00:15:16.687 --> 00:15:22.367
the United States and knew very little Italian, this was a very understandable mistake,

00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:28.587
and shouldn’t be taken at face value, let alone considered a smoking gun in the crime.

00:15:30.037 --> 00:15:35.977
Now, as you’ll remember, Lumumba had a clear alibi, and was released a

00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:41.447
couple of weeks after this, but by this time the police had already widely

00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:46.117
publicised the theory that Knox and Sollecito were involved in the murder

00:15:47.387 --> 00:15:52.307
And here we need to underline something very important about the timeline.

00:15:53.507 --> 00:15:59.517
The DNA evidence linking Rudy Guede to the murder only came back from the laboratory

00:15:59.717 --> 00:16:04.997
a couple of weeks after the crime, after Knox and Sollecito were already the main

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:10.877
suspects, and Mignini had been building up his theory of a sex game gone wrong.

00:16:12.007 --> 00:16:17.807
The DNA evidence of Guede’s involvement, his subsequent arrest in Germany and his

00:16:17.807 --> 00:16:22.627
completely implausible account of what happened on the evening of the murder, this

00:16:22.697 --> 00:16:27.997
should really have meant that Mignini put his hands up in the air and said, “ok, it

00:16:27.997 --> 00:16:33.927
looks like our first hypothesis was incorrect, the case now seems more clear cut”.

00:16:35.117 --> 00:16:39.107
Instead, he doubled down, assuming Knox and Sollecito’s

00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:43.797
guilt and interpreting their every move as a sign of it.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:49.497
Instead of Knox having to be proved guilty, she had to prove her innocence.

00:16:50.567 --> 00:16:55.637
This is an important distinction, as the only witnesses that Knox and

00:16:55.637 --> 00:16:59.517
Sollecito had that they weren’t at the scene of the crime were each other.

00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:06.077
And as they both stood accused of the murder, their witness statements weren’t considered

00:17:06.077 --> 00:17:11.997
reliable; they said they were innocent but they had no way to prove their innocence.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:18.437
Combined with the media circus and the impossibility for any juror to approach

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:23.897
the case with an unbiased opinion, and the evidence that was falsely presented as

00:17:23.897 --> 00:17:28.917
true in court, it's hardly surprising that Knox and Sollecito were found guilty.

00:17:29.557 --> 00:17:34.357
They were tried and convicted by the media long before the legal system.

00:17:35.577 --> 00:17:41.767
Now, since Knox and Sollecito have been released, what has happened to the characters in this story?

00:17:43.064 --> 00:17:47.217
Sollecito is reportedly living a quiet life working in

00:17:47.217 --> 00:17:51.117
Milan, just keen to put the entire episode behind him.

00:17:51.997 --> 00:17:55.267
Knox is back in Seattle, in the United States.

00:17:55.747 --> 00:18:00.527
She has written a book about her experience, and has become a justice campaigner,

00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:05.127
standing up for people who have been forced to make confessions under duress.

00:18:06.367 --> 00:18:12.307
Rudy Guede has served his time in prison, and is now a free man, although he

00:18:12.307 --> 00:18:17.777
was back in court in 2023 for charges of raping and beating up his girlfriend.

00:18:19.046 --> 00:18:23.546
Giualiano Mignini has now retired, and is apparently spending

00:18:23.546 --> 00:18:26.106
his days writing and studying the history of Perugia.

00:18:26.936 --> 00:18:31.626
And, presumably, keeping a close eye on the local criminal news and dreaming

00:18:31.626 --> 00:18:35.586
up new and fantastical explanations for whoever the suspects might be.

00:18:36.906 --> 00:18:41.406
The family of Meredith Kercher, unfortunately, has no real closure.

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:48.466
Yes, Rudy Guede served 16 years in prison, but he never admitted to the crime.

00:18:49.636 --> 00:18:54.956
And Meredith’s parents both died within 4 months of each other in 2020.

00:18:56.326 --> 00:19:01.806
The reality of this entire story is that, if you ask me at least, it was blown

00:19:01.806 --> 00:19:06.726
completely out of proportion, it is a lot less interesting than it was made out to be.

00:19:07.826 --> 00:19:14.416
Two innocent people were sent to prison, and if we count Patrick Lumumba’s two weeks in jail, three.

00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:20.296
And one poor young woman, who is often an afterthought in

00:19:20.296 --> 00:19:23.126
the reporting of this whole story, was brutally murdered.

00:19:24.516 --> 00:19:31.146
And to this day, looking through websites and forums analysing the case, there are still plenty

00:19:31.146 --> 00:19:37.466
of people who simply do not believe that Knox and Sollecito are innocent, mainly citing their

00:19:37.506 --> 00:19:44.686
odd behaviour and at times contradictory statements, taking these as proof of their guilt rather

00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:49.876
than two young and naive people who found themselves at the centre of a murder investigation.

00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:56.756
For these people, it’s clear that nothing Amanda Knox can ever do will prove her innocence..

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:04.686
OK then, that is it for this follow up, bonus episode on the Trial of Amanda Knox.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:08.146
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:08.496 --> 00:20:11.606
This show is particularly popular in Italy, so for

00:20:11.606 --> 00:20:14.526
the Italians among you, do you remember this trial?

00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:16.456
What do you remember about it?

00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:19.897
What do you believe happened on the night of November 1st?

00:20:20.396 --> 00:20:25.146
Is Amanda Knox innocent, or is there more to this story than has ever come to light?

00:20:25.606 --> 00:20:28.866
I would love to get your thoughts, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.160
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.680
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.580
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to talk about Tax.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.920
Now, the word ‘tax’ provokes differing reactions to different people.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.350
Boredom.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.390
Fear.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.710
Theft.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.560
Duty.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.440
Whatever one thinks of tax, it’s something that none of us can escape.

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:51.920
And as Benjamin Franklin famously said, all the way back in 1726 “In

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.560
this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.”

00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:01.555
So today we are going to dive right into it.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:08.913
From a very brief history of taxes, to how different countries approach the question of how

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:15.853
much is the right amount of tax to pay, and what effects this has on the society we live in.

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:20.913
It won’t all be theoretical though, we'll learn about all of this through

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:27.313
the story of two pen-pals, Arlette from Paris, and John from Austin, Texas.

00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:33.963
We’ll also confront the increasingly popular, but controversial, idea of a wealth tax.

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:40.405
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can follow along to

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:46.375
this episode with the subtitles, the transcript and its key vocabulary, so you don’t miss a

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:52.745
word and build up your vocabulary as you go, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:58.425
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:04.105
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:09.395
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:13.215
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:17.315
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:21.315
OK then, tax.

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:28.405
Throughout history, going all the way back to the ancient Egyptians in the year 3000

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:35.145
BC, people in power have required that people contribute to the society they live in,

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:41.625
sometimes through labour, through working, or through direct payments, through money.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:48.715
This episode would go on for hours, days, perhaps even weeks if we talked about

00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:55.385
the entire lengthy history of taxation, but the broad idea hasn’t really changed.

00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:02.055
Whoever is in charge of a society, be that the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs, or an

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:08.595
elected government in the year 2021, it provides certain services to its people.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:15.535
To do that, it needs money or labour, and it requires people or businesses to give it to them.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.715
Of course, you know that.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:24.065
You are one of the billions of people who pay these taxes, through your income, through the

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:30.815
money you earn as a salary, through things you consume, things you buy in shops, and through

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:36.525
everything from the tax that businesses pay on profits through to taxes you pay on your

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:42.365
houses, there are thousands of different types of taxes that people pay all over the world.

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:51.375
Today though we are going to focus on tax on income, the taxes that you pay on the money you make.

00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:57.355
This is going to be our focus because it is normally the largest tax, in

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:02.275
most countries the majority of the tax that you pay will be income tax.

00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:09.105
In the UK, the combination of income tax and something called social security

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:15.325
contributions makes up 41% of all the tax revenues that the government makes.

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:20.215
And, as I’m sure we all know, depending on where you live, and how

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:24.925
much money you make, the amount you pay in taxes can vary greatly.

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:31.135
If you live in Europe, your taxes are relatively high, compared to the rest of the world.

00:04:31.575 --> 00:04:38.195
If you live in a country like Bermuda or the United Arab Emirates, or even if you live

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:45.155
in the US state of Texas, your taxes are very low, sometimes completely non-existent.

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:51.925
These differences start small, but as people earn more, they become a lot more extreme.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:57.755
Let’s dig down into a couple of examples here, to illustrate this point.

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:05.025
Let’s take two pen-pals, Arlette in Paris, and John, who lives in Austin, Texas.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:10.855
For the sake of simplicity, let’s say that they both earn a salary

00:05:11.035 --> 00:05:17.365
of €50,000, which is around $60,000 for our friend John in Texas.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:23.405
John is going to end up paying just under 14% of his income

00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:27.685
in federal income taxes, taxes to the central government.

00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:34.555
Importantly, he doesn’t pay any state income taxes, taxes to the state of Texas on his income.

00:05:35.395 --> 00:05:40.625
And he’ll pay just under 8% in Social Security and Medicare,

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:46.275
meaning he will pay about 21% of his total salary in taxes.

00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:52.685
Meanwhile his pen-pal over in Paris, Arlette, if she is

00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:58.825
earning €50,000 will pay just under 27% of her salary in taxes.

00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:03.447
So, Arlette pays more, but not a vast amount more.

00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:08.627
Let’s say that both Arlette and John have some excellent luck,

00:06:08.707 --> 00:06:12.877
they get a fantastic promotion, and their salary doubles.

00:06:13.327 --> 00:06:17.827
Lucky them, they are now both earning €100,000 a year.

00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:26.757
John pays a little more as a percentage, now paying 24.2% of his salary in taxes.

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:32.277
Meanwhile in Paris Arlette is paying around 35%.

00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:38.807
Now, as anyone who owns a business in France will know, the French system

00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:44.237
requires the company to pay extra social security contributions on top

00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:49.547
of the salary that they pay Arlette, which can easily be another 50%.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.987
So, lucky Arlette, her salary was €100,000.

00:06:54.357 --> 00:07:00.547
But the real cost of employing her for her company could reach €150,000,

00:07:00.897 --> 00:07:07.077
and from that, Arlette might only get €65,000 or so, less than half.

00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:13.827
Now, on a personal level, most people might like the idea of needing to

00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:18.227
pay fewer taxes, and having more money to spend at the end of the month.

00:07:18.807 --> 00:07:21.917
So you might think, lucky John in Texas.

00:07:22.647 --> 00:07:25.897
But John pays less, so he gets less.

00:07:26.687 --> 00:07:32.387
And ultimately, the question of what is the right amount of tax comes down to how

00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:37.267
much involvement you believe a government should have in the lives of its citizens.

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:44.247
If you believe a government should do the bare minimum, keep low taxes, and require

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:50.617
individuals to pay for almost everything, then you’d probably be happy with John in Texas.

00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:58.307
But if you think that as part of our social contract it’s the government’s job to redistribute money

00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:05.217
to create a more equal and prosperous society, then you’d probably be happy with Arlette in Paris.

00:08:05.907 --> 00:08:10.897
And when it comes to tax, there is obviously no right answer, no

00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:16.597
right number, it is the job of a government to set taxes at a level

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:20.727
that allows them to deliver the services that their citizens expect.

00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:26.977
If we return to our friends Arlette and John, in Paris and Austin, we

00:08:26.977 --> 00:08:31.757
can see some differing expectations of what the government will and

00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:36.357
won’t do, in terms of getting involved with the lives of its citizens.

00:08:37.077 --> 00:08:41.989
Let’s go first to Texas, and to our friend John in Austin, who

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:47.009
is happy to pay very low taxes, and zero state income taxes.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:53.919
We might think that his expectations about what the government will do to help him should be lower.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.939
But is this actually the case?

00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:01.449
Well, it certainly does seem so, and we can illustrate

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:04.759
this point through a relatively recent example.

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:10.549
You may remember that a huge storm hit Texas in February,

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:14.399
and millions of houses were left without electricity.

00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:20.079
At the start, Texan politicians blamed renewable energy,

00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:23.849
saying that they couldn’t cope with the extreme weather.

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:30.609
But further investigations revealed that one of the major reasons that the energy

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:36.889
grid wasn’t able to cope with the surge in demand was because of the deregulation

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:43.179
and privatisation of Texan energy that had taken place over the last two decades.

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:51.289
Rather than opt for higher taxes and more government involvement, Texans had gone the other way.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:57.299
And when the storm hit, as the former Mayor of a Texan town wrote on

00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:02.419
Facebook, “No one owes you or your family anything; nor is it the local

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:06.589
government’s responsibility to support you during trying times like this!

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:09.159
Sink or swim, it’s your choice!”

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:13.009
So, with taxes come expectations.

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:19.639
If taxes are low, like they are in somewhere like Texas, then so are expectations.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:23.649
You pay the government relatively little, so you expect

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:26.639
it to be involved relatively little in your life.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:33.509
And when taxes are higher, for example in France, with Arlette, so are expectations.

00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:40.859
As you might know, France takes great pride in providing for its citizens through good and bad.

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:47.649
There’s generous support for the unemployed, it is very hard to fire someone, and French

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:53.679
employees are entitled to very generous pensions, especially in the case of state employees.

00:10:54.369 --> 00:11:00.439
So, Arlette in France, because she pays so much more tax than John in Texas,

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:06.659
especially with her great new pay rise, she is likely to be much more engaged, and

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:12.619
have much higher expectations for things like healthcare, schooling, and transport.

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:20.234
And if Arlette feels like she isn’t getting value for money, if the state isn’t delivering for her

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:27.579
in the way that she feels it should, then she will probably be more frustrated than John in Texas.

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:33.409
Again, we can see some examples of this in relatively recent French history.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:40.279
You may remember the Gilet Jaunes movement that started at the end of 2018.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:47.019
To briefly remind you what happened, around November 2018 there was a popular

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:53.379
movement in France of people wearing bright yellow jackets who took to the streets.

00:11:53.969 --> 00:12:02.099
Initially, they were protesting a proposed new type of tax on fuel, but it was a reaction to what

00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:08.689
was felt to be a disproportionate tax burden on the lower and middle classes, they thought that

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:15.519
taxes were too high on lower and middle earners, and not high enough on the richest in society.

00:12:16.549 --> 00:12:20.859
As some further background to this, the French president, Emanuelle

00:12:20.859 --> 00:12:28.719
Macron, had removed a wealth tax, which was a tax on wealth over €790,000.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:36.539
Against these rising prices and the view that French taxpayers weren't getting good enough value

00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:43.231
from the government,  hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, saying enough is enough.

00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:50.801
Eventually, Macron backed down, and agreed to many of the demands of the Gilets Jaunes.

00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:56.231
So, why is the Gilet Jaunes movement relevant to tax?

00:12:57.091 --> 00:13:02.511
Because it is a great example of the correlation between tax rates

00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:07.471
and citizen engagement, that the protestors were paying all this money

00:13:07.491 --> 00:13:11.381
in taxes yet they didn’t think the government was supporting them.

00:13:12.421 --> 00:13:18.641
Then, contrast that with the reaction in Texas, which was basically “you’re on your own, guys”.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:24.311
Now, this episode is certainly not meant to be saying that one system

00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:29.121
is better than the other, or that there is a right way to do taxation.

00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:35.731
Clearly, there are thousands of different views, and in a democracy we all have the ability

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:42.621
to have our say by electing political parties that align best with whatever we believe.

00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:49.928
But what is certainly true in almost all countries is that taxation does create a

00:13:49.948 --> 00:13:55.828
much closer bond, a much closer relationship between the individual and the state.

00:13:56.648 --> 00:14:00.278
On one level, this is obvious - the more you pay for

00:14:00.278 --> 00:14:04.048
something, the more you are likely to care about its quality.

00:14:04.828 --> 00:14:10.068
But if there is a complete breakdown of this bond, if taxpayers

00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:14.718
don’t feel like they are getting value for money, then the more tax

00:14:14.718 --> 00:14:19.378
they pay, the more they are likely to express their dissatisfaction.

00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:25.508
The Gilet Jaunes protests may have been relatively peaceful, but throughout

00:14:25.518 --> 00:14:32.025
history there have been instances of riots, rebellions, and revolutions all due

00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:38.485
to people rising up against what they believed were unfair and unjust taxes.

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:46.245
While, to repeat, there is no ‘right’ answer on tax, I’d like to end this episode with a

00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:53.461
brief discussion of a type of tax that has become more and more debated in recent years.

00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:59.566
A wealth tax, a tax on your total wealth, a tax on all of the stuff you have.

00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:04.951
Although there have been different versions of it proposed throughout history,

00:15:05.341 --> 00:15:10.491
it was brought back into discussion after the publication of a book by a

00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:15.664
French economist called Thomas Piketty, called Capital in the 21st Century.

00:15:16.474 --> 00:15:19.634
You may well have read the book - it has been translated

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:23.694
into dozens of languages, and has sold millions of copies.

00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:31.264
In it, one of the main ideas proposed by Piketty is a global wealth tax, a tax on the

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:38.984
richest people in the world, which would start at 0.1% and rise to 2% on large fortunes.

00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:43.141
It would be what’s called a progressive tax, so the

00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:46.401
more you had, the higher the percentage you would pay.

00:15:47.231 --> 00:15:52.481
And he also suggested a much higher top rate of income tax, with the

00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:57.131
government taking up to 80% of the income of the highest earners.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.641
I don’t think our friend John in Texas would like that idea very much.

00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:07.721
One of the reasons that Piketty’s book was so successful was that he wasn’t just

00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:13.101
someone on the street corner saying “we should raise taxes”, he was one of the world’s

00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:18.731
most respected economists, and his research was based on serious economic study.

00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:23.451
There were, of course, plenty of people who opposed it, saying that he

00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:28.651
had got it all wrong, and that his ideas would destroy economic growth.

00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:36.061
But it caused a lot of debate, and even by those who disagreed with it, it was taken seriously.

00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:43.691
When he published it, in 2013, it was referred to as ‘right time, right message’.

00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:51.191
Inequality had been increasing in much of the western world, particularly in the United States, and

00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:58.341
what Piketty was proposing was a solution based on economic theory, not just a political message.

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:03.641
And since then, similar taxes have been proposed in countries

00:17:03.841 --> 00:17:07.761
one might have never thought would be open to a wealth tax.

00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:13.761
In the United States, the land of the brave and home of the free, Elizabeth Warren

00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:19.321
and two other Democratic senators proposed a wealth tax on the ultra wealthy.

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:23.431
This one really was for the ultra ultra wealthy.

00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:29.991
it would only start at $50 million, meaning that if your net worth was less than

00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:36.388
$50 million, which is the case for 99.9% of Americans, you wouldn't have to pay it.

00:17:37.434 --> 00:17:44.194
Yet still, it was met with fierce resistance, labelled as an attack on American liberty,

00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:50.524
and yet another way for the federal government to get its hands on your hard-earned money.

00:17:51.344 --> 00:17:57.764
What the popularity of such ideas does tell us though is that the idea of tax is

00:17:58.084 --> 00:18:04.304
evolving, the idea of who should pay tax, and how much they should pay, is still

00:18:04.314 --> 00:18:10.484
very much up for discussion, both as the gaps between rich and poor grow wider,

00:18:10.808 --> 00:18:16.308
and as countries are figuring out how to pay the bill for the cost of COVID-19.

00:18:17.258 --> 00:18:22.188
There is of course no right answer, so I’ll leave you with two quotes about

00:18:22.188 --> 00:18:27.128
taxes, and you can choose which one you feel aligns more with your beliefs.

00:18:28.158 --> 00:18:35.548
We’ll start with the American Judge, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who once said “I like to pay taxes.

00:18:35.998 --> 00:18:38.028
With them, I buy civilization.”

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:43.939
Or, from another American, the TV broadcaster Arthur Godfrey,  who

00:18:43.939 --> 00:18:48.179
once said “I am proud to be paying taxes in the United States.

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:52.499
The only thing is I could be just as proud for half of the money.”

00:18:55.479 --> 00:19:01.822
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the actually quite interesting world of Tax.

00:19:02.002 --> 00:19:06.982
I hope it's been a thought-provoking one, that you've learnt something new, and whether

00:19:07.052 --> 00:19:12.142
it’s looking at your payslip at the end of the month, or doing a tax return at the end

00:19:12.142 --> 00:19:16.602
of the year, you might think about the numbers on there in a slightly different way.

00:19:17.582 --> 00:19:21.162
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:21.492 --> 00:19:24.512
What do you think of the tax system in your country?

00:19:25.002 --> 00:19:31.142
Would you rather pay a higher rate of tax and feel like you have a stronger bond with your

00:19:31.142 --> 00:19:37.442
fellow citizens, or would you rather pay lower taxes and be a master of your own destiny.

00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:38.782
I would love to know.

00:19:39.442 --> 00:19:43.632

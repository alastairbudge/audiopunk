Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:16.297
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:20.377
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:26.717
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the news from 2023.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:32.287
In this episode, we’ll come across lavatorial thefts, kings, lost

00:00:32.297 --> 00:00:37.457
sheep, beer goggles and a very unexpected top-rated tourist attraction.

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:41.947
We made one of these episodes last year, and it was a really popular one

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:47.427
so here you go, by popular demand, the Very Unusual British News of 2023.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.227
Blenheim Palace is a huge stately home just north of Oxford.

00:00:56.427 --> 00:01:00.447
It was the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston

00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:05.917
Churchill, it’s over 300 years old and has 187 rooms.

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:11.697
In fact, it’s now open to the public, and you can tour the house

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:15.497
and the over 8 kilometre square of gardens that it sits in.

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:16.827
I’ve been.

00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:21.737
It’s wonderful, and if you ever find yourself in the Oxford area, you should go.

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:28.307
But in the early hours of the 14th of September 2019,

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:31.647
there was a break-in at the palace, there was a robbery.

00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:38.687
A group of thieves broke into the premises in a carefully targeted raid.

00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:41.637
The object they were after?

00:01:42.347 --> 00:01:45.067
Not a fine painting or gold necklace.

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:52.757
It was, in fact, a toilet, a working toilet that was used by visitors of the palace.

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:56.057
But this was no ordinary toilet.

00:01:57.087 --> 00:02:00.831
It was a toilet worth a reported $6 million.

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:07.497
Not because it had some great historical significance or had a wonderful painting.

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:13.067
It was because it was made entirely from solid gold.

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:20.477
Now, this wasn’t some ostentatious display by British aristocrats, showing that

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:24.567
they had so much money that their lavatories were literally made from gold.

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:30.477
It was a piece of art by an Italian artist called Maurizio Cattelan.

00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:35.517
It was not being guarded, with the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation

00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:40.637
telling a newspaper “Firstly, it’s plumbed in; and secondly, a potential

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:44.297
thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate.

00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:46.977
So no, I don’t plan to be guarding it.”

00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:54.667
Clearly, that was a mistake, as the thieves were able to rip the entire toilet out.

00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:59.667
And when the security guards arrived in the morning, back in

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:04.047
September of 2019, they were met by an unpleasant surprise.

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:07.887
There was water all over the floor, because the toilet

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.387
that had actually been attached to the mains plumbing.

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:12.357
It was a working toilet, remember.

00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:18.497
It was quite the mess to clear up, but the more pressing issue was

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:24.486
that the 103 kilogram gold toilet had disappeared into thin air.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:31.006
A hefty reward was issued, but it wasn’t until this year,

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:35.986
on November the 6th of 2023, that there was some good news.

00:03:37.164 --> 00:03:42.396
A group of four men were charged with the theft, but, as of the

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:46.206
time of recording at least, there is no sign of the toilet itself.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:50.036
And police investigators fear the worst.

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:57.436
The second-hand market for a solid gold toilet is quite limited but the

00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:04.384
second-hand market for 103   kg of 18-carat gold is, well, it’s enormous.

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:10.324
So the prevailing belief is that the toilet was quickly melted down after it

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:15.894
was stolen, and it is now most likely in necklaces and rings and earrings,

00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:20.434
all over the world, far removed from its original purpose as a toilet.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.170
Now, our second unusual piece of news relates to something very

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.870
unusual in that it hasn’t happened in Britain since June 2nd of 1953.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.370
There are no gold toilets in this news story, but there was plenty of gold.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.390
If you haven’t guessed what I’m talking about yet, it was the

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.180
coronation of King Charles III, which happened on the 6th of May 2023

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.870
Now, I’d be pretty confident that you knew something about this already, but let

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.180
me share with you some unusual facts about this most unusual of British events.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.820
Firstly, the actual process of the coronation has hardly changed in 1,000 years.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.634
There are six phases: recognition, the oath, the anointing, the investiture

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:18.064
[which includes the crowning], something called the enthronement and then

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:24.054
the homage, and these have been the same since William the Conqueror in 1066.

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:31.744
The second unusual element about the coronation is something that happens in the third phase of

00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:38.456
it, "the anointing”, which involves using a 12th century silver spoon to drip oil on the king.

00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:44.126
But the unusual fact to mention about this holy oil is that King

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:49.406
Charles did modernise the recipe, he updated the ingredients of the oil.

00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:57.276
Previously, this holy oil included a mixture of sesame seed and olive oil, rose,

00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:04.306
jasmine, cinnamon, an array of other unusual oils, as well as amber and orange blossom.

00:06:05.216 --> 00:06:10.186
But King Charles requested that the holy oil didn’t include something

00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:15.796
called ambergris, which is an expensive substance found in whale intestines.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:22.063
He is known for his support of animal welfare, and he decided that it would be a bit

00:06:22.093 --> 00:06:27.953
excessive for a whale to be killed so that a tiny bit of its oil could be spread on his head.

00:06:28.983 --> 00:06:34.253
So, there you go, that’s one modernisation of a very unmodern tradition.

00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:41.653
And our third unusual element to mention about the coronation is to do with a particularly

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:47.273
unlikely food that many British people would have made while watching the coronation on TV.

00:06:48.773 --> 00:06:54.413
This is something called “coronation chicken”, which might sound a little disgusting

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:59.353
when I describe it to you, but it is about as traditionally British as food can get.

00:07:00.623 --> 00:07:08.683
It is a cold cooked chicken marinated in sour cream, mayonnaise, chutney and

00:07:08.753 --> 00:07:15.513
curry powder, and served with dried apricots, red onions and toasted almonds.

00:07:16.493 --> 00:07:19.883
It’s an unusual yellow colour, which comes from the curry

00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:24.203
powder, but in my opinion at least, it is remarkably tasty.

00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:33.443
It was invented for Queen Elizabeth’s coronation back in 1953, and has remained popular ever since.

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:38.213
Although I should add that it isn’t popular with the King, who opted

00:07:38.213 --> 00:07:41.883
for a vegetation quiche at his post-coronation banquet instead.

00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:48.463
Now, moving on to another unusual piece of British news from 2023,

00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:53.733
this one comes from right at the north of Scotland, above Inverness.

00:07:55.423 --> 00:07:58.583
A lady was out kayaking a few years ago when she paddled

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:01.693
past a sheep on a remote beach at the bottom of a cliff.

00:08:02.543 --> 00:08:07.793
Nothing particularly unusual about that; the area is full of sheep farms, and the lady presumed

00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:12.673
that the sheep had just got separated from its flock and would make its way back shortly afterwards.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:19.453
But, in October this year, two years after first seeing this sheep,

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:24.453
the kayaker returned to the area and saw the sheep in the same place.

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:29.823
The sheep’s fleece had grown so long that it was touching the ground.

00:08:30.923 --> 00:08:36.103
As the kayak went past, the sheep followed it along, jumping from rock

00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:41.573
to rock and bleating, making noises, as if it were calling out for help.

00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:46.053
She thought the sheep must have got stuck at the bottom

00:08:46.053 --> 00:08:49.363
of the cliff, separated from the rest of its flock.

00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:55.503
When she returned home, the kayaker called out to various animal rescue

00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:59.843
services, but was told that there was no case for saving the sheep.

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:08.563
After all, it seemed happy and healthy and was in no danger, it was just isolated and on its own.

00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:14.503
What happened next was nothing less than a media frenzy.

00:09:15.213 --> 00:09:21.513
The story was picked up by national newspapers, it was on the BBC, and journalists descended on the

00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:27.663
area, keen to catch a glimpse of an animal that was being dubbed “The loneliest sheep in Britain”.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:33.903
It took a few weeks, but a rescue team was assembled, and a group

00:09:33.913 --> 00:09:38.783
of men went down the cliff to rescue “Fiona”, as she'd been called.

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:44.293
They managed to drag her up, which was quite the task, given that

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:49.883
she had grown very fat and had a 10kg fleece, but eventually she was

00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:54.063
saved, much to the relief of armchair watchers across the country.

00:09:55.663 --> 00:10:00.733
She has even been rehoused at an animal welfare farm, and after a

00:10:00.743 --> 00:10:05.173
serious haircut she is now accepting visits from members of the public.

00:10:06.223 --> 00:10:09.433
Although she is now completely indistinguishable from any other

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.833
sheep, so if you make a trip expecting to see something other than

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:17.763
a very normal-looking sheep, well you’ll be a little disappointed.

00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:25.223
Now, moving on, our penultimate piece of very unusual news was a research paper

00:10:25.373 --> 00:10:30.343
released in September this year about what are colloquially called “beer goggles”.

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:36.773
“Goggles” are the kind of glasses, the eye protectors, that you wear if you go

00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:43.183
underwater, and “beer goggles” is an expression used in English to describe the

00:10:43.183 --> 00:10:48.273
phenomenon where you perceive someone as more attractive after you have drunk alcohol.

00:10:49.513 --> 00:10:52.823
Perhaps this is a phenomenon you have experienced yourself,

00:10:53.223 --> 00:10:57.533
perhaps it isn’t, but it is a fairly widespread term in English.

00:10:58.263 --> 00:11:04.000
You can say that someone had their beer goggles on, or you were looking through your beer goggles.

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:12.103
Scientists have done quite a lot of research into this, for example giving alcohol to animals to see

00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:18.273
if that affects their mating habits, but there was an important paper published in September this

00:11:18.273 --> 00:11:26.133
year that suggested that “beer goggles”, in the traditional sense of the term, simply don’t exist.

00:11:27.635 --> 00:11:33.635
In this paper, which was published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, the authors

00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:40.335
suggested that alcohol doesn’t change how attractive we perceive people to be; it only lowers

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:45.045
your inhibitions, meaning that you are more likely to go up to someone you were already

00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:50.185
attracted to and try to start a conversation than you would be if you hadn’t drunk any alcohol.

00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:56.865
In other words, alcohol doesn’t make you attracted to people you would otherwise not be attracted

00:11:56.865 --> 00:12:03.645
to, it only reduces your inhibitions and can amplify your preexisting attraction to someone.

00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:09.765
And if you are wondering how this study was completed, it was actually done in a

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:15.505
very professional manner; 36 young adults were given drinks, and not told whether

00:12:15.505 --> 00:12:20.815
they contained alcohol or not, and wethen re asked to rate different people in

00:12:20.815 --> 00:12:25.615
terms of their attractiveness and the levels of proximity they felt to them.

00:12:27.112 --> 00:12:31.822
What the study found was that people’s ratings of how attractive people were

00:12:32.262 --> 00:12:36.812
didn’t change depending on their alcoholic consumption; the only thing that

00:12:36.812 --> 00:12:41.652
changed was that the more alcohol a person had consumed, the more likely

00:12:41.652 --> 00:12:44.792
they were to say that they would approach one of the more attractive people.

00:12:45.862 --> 00:12:51.692
So, alcohol doesn’t give you “beer goggles”, but instead “liquid courage”,

00:12:52.052 --> 00:12:56.142
to use the colloquial term, courage that is brought on by alcohol.

00:12:57.612 --> 00:13:03.782
Now, our final “unusual British news from 2023” is about one of the top-rated tourist

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:08.912
attractions in the entire country, but one that I would be very confident that

00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:13.382
you have never been to, and I think it’s very unlikely you have even heard of it.

00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:20.692
It’s something called the “Bude Tunnel”, and it is a plastic tunnel in the

00:13:20.722 --> 00:13:26.952
car park of a Sainsbury’s supermarket in a town in Cornwall called Bude, it

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:31.552
is nothing other than a plastic shelter protecting shoppers from the rain.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:36.492
And the reason I mention it in this episode is because

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:40.612
it was in the news as a prime example of British humour.

00:13:42.342 --> 00:13:46.262
You probably know that TripAdvisor is a popular website where

00:13:46.262 --> 00:13:49.492
you can review restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions.

00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:54.722
And it has an algorithm that bumps up attractions with good reviews.

00:13:55.372 --> 00:13:58.922
You know, if you own a hotel or restaurant, having a bunch of

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.892
good reviews on TripAdvisor is important for your business.

00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:09.182
But British people have a tendency to club together and manipulate things

00:14:09.202 --> 00:14:14.992
like votes and search rankings, especially when the results can be humorous.

00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:22.752
For example, back in 2016 there was a poll where members of the public

00:14:22.982 --> 00:14:28.022
could vote on the name for an important research boat, and there was a

00:14:28.032 --> 00:14:33.992
huge campaign so that the comic name “Boaty McBoatface” ended up winning.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:41.407
Anyway, manipulating the democratic process, or manipulating an algorithm for humorous

00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:48.777
effect has become something of a British tradition, and in October of 2023 residents of

00:14:48.777 --> 00:14:55.257
the small town of Bude came together to flood TripAdvisor with reviews of this supermarket

00:14:55.277 --> 00:15:00.597
plastic tunnel, turning it into one of the top-rated tourist attractions in the region.

00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:06.177
So, if you were in Cornwall and you opened up your TripAdvisor app to look

00:15:06.177 --> 00:15:11.067
at “things to do” in the area, you might have seen museums, lovely beaches

00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:16.337
and theatres, and then this plastic tunnel in a Sainsbury’s supermarket.

00:15:17.577 --> 00:15:22.557
In fact, if you search “Bude tunnel” on TripAdvisor you can see all of these for

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:28.667
yourself, but let me read you out now some of the almost 1,500 reviews of this tunnel:

00:15:30.317 --> 00:15:34.437
Daniel W said, “We went with high expectations and I'm

00:15:34.477 --> 00:15:36.957
pleased to say that the Bude Tunnel met all of them!

00:15:37.477 --> 00:15:41.567
Every individual will find something unique to admire and be inspired by.

00:15:41.967 --> 00:15:47.397
For me it was the beautiful stained glass that took my breath away and left me wanting more.

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:51.717
We will be returning as will our children and their children's children.”

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:58.067
Then user Chris4u111 added, “Well, what can I say?

00:15:58.347 --> 00:16:02.617
We have held back from visiting this iconic eighth wonder of the world until today.

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:09.227
We are still coming down from the elation and euphoria of the genuinely breathtaking experience.

00:16:09.277 --> 00:16:13.067
Life will never quite be the same but we shall visit again and again.”

00:16:14.584 --> 00:16:19.894
and what is perhaps even better than reading the clearly ironic 5* reviews

00:16:20.034 --> 00:16:25.007
from thousands of British pranksters is reading the 1* reviews from people who

00:16:25.224 --> 00:16:29.334
have fallen for it, have travelled there, only to be slightly disappointed.

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:35.794
Or, as user Debs B put it, in her 1 star review, “I thought this would be

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:39.374
something special when I was searching for things to see in and around Bude….

00:16:39.754 --> 00:16:45.624
How wrong I was ! Its a Perspex tunnel which was very dirty . It did get me from

00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:49.054
Sainsbury’s car park to the entrance of Sainsbury’s though, without getting wet.

00:16:49.244 --> 00:16:53.384
So one star for that . Don’t bother coming to look , there’s nothing here

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:58.971
.”
And then she added, “Ps what happened to all the pretty lights as in the pictures

00:17:00.271 --> 00:17:07.411
?“
So, there you have it, five unusual very lighthearted British news stories from 2023.

00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:12.251
From stolen golden toilets to lost sheep, coronation chicken

00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:16.261
to silver spoons, beer goggles and supermarket tunnels

00:17:17.101 --> 00:17:21.631
But if there's one thing I hope you take away from all of this, it’s that if you are

00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:27.441
visiting Britain and you like to use TripAdvisor, it’s best to remember the Russian proverb.

00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:32.101
“Doveryay, no proveryay, “trust but verify”.

00:17:32.971 --> 00:17:36.311
If not, you might find yourself slightly disappointed.

00:17:39.271 --> 00:17:45.424
OK then, that is it for today's lighthearted episode on Unusual British News from 2023.

00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:48.871
I hope it was a fun one, and you learned about a few things

00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:51.851
I guess wouldn’t have made it into the news in your country.

00:17:52.354 --> 00:17:55.344
This episode is actually set to be released on Boxing Day, December

00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:59.274
26th, so if you are listening on the day it is released, I hope you are

00:17:59.274 --> 00:18:02.954
having a wonderful day, whatever that might be and wherever you might be.

00:18:04.064 --> 00:18:08.534
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:09.034 --> 00:18:14.014
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

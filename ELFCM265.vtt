Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:17.003
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.283
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:25.303
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:25.303 --> 00:00:29.363
talking about Fentanyl, the drug devastating America.

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:37.273
It’s the story of how one synthetic drug went from relative obscurity to being the number

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:45.503
one cause of death for Americans aged 18-45, overtaking guns, car accidents, and suicide.

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:51.543
In this episode we’ll talk about the drug itself, what fentanyl does to the body

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:56.523
and why it is so dangerous, we’ll look at how it managed to spread so quickly

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:00.913
through the country, and what the US authorities are trying to do about it.

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:05.700
I should add that this episode is going to be followed by another

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:10.553
standalone episode on San Francisco, a city that has been ravaged

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:15.453
by fentanyl, so these two episodes will form quite a nice duo.

00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:20.093
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:31.023
In 1960 a Belgian pharmacist named Dr Paul Janssen developed a new kind of drug to relieve pain.

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:35.983
He called it fentanyl, and it was incredibly effective.

00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:42.693
Just a small dose was required to relax a patient and relieve pain.

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:49.853
As a result, it was quickly adopted by the medical community as a way to relieve

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:55.353
pain and suffering, especially for patients suffering from terminal conditions.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:02:03.283
And for many years fentanyl remained a tightly controlled drug used in a medical setting.

00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:08.763
Administered correctly it helped countless patients relieve pain and suffering.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:19.043
And when Dr Paul Janssen died in 2003 at the ripe old age of 77, his obituary mentioned

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:26.113
fentanyl only once, it was practically an afterthought in a glowing career that included

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:33.213
being awarded more than 100 patents and authoring more than 850 scientific papers.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:39.417
Clearly, Dr Janssen was a talented scientist, but he died knowing

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:43.747
very little about the true impact that his creation would have.

00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:51.783
It wouldn’t be until 2013, 10 years after Dr Janssen’s death, that illegally

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:58.383
produced fentanyl burst onto the scene in the United States, and by 2016,

00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:04.103
just three years later, fentanyl had become a household name and the most

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:09.133
deadly opiate in the country, killing more Americans than any other drug.

00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:15.133
Now it isn’t just the most deadly drug, a fentanyl overdose is

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:19.513
the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 45.

00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:25.143
To put it another way, for any American who dies before their

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:30.713
46th birthday, a fentanyl overdose is the most common cause.

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:36.533
The problems started when fentanyl moved from being in the hands

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:40.553
of trained medical professionals to the hands of criminals.

00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:46.063
See, in the right hands, produced in a medical setting and

00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:50.153
administered correctly, fentanyl isn’t particularly dangerous.

00:03:50.783 --> 00:03:56.223
In fact, it has a relatively high what’s called “therapeutic index”, which

00:03:56.373 --> 00:04:00.903
is a medical term for the difference between the amount of a drug needed

00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:04.773
to have a positive medical effect and the amount that can be dangerous.

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:13.303
In clinical conditions, fentanyl is normally administered via a patch or a nasal spray, where

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:19.743
very small amounts of the drug go slowly into the bloodstream, so it is relatively safe.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:28.313
But the problems arise when it is produced and sold outside a clinical environment, and taken

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:34.133
recreationally by people who don’t know exactly what it is they are putting into their bodies.

00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:39.733
See, the potency of fentanyl, its power, its strength, is

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:45.353
around 50 times that of heroin and 100 times that of morphine.

00:04:46.183 --> 00:04:53.843
Just two milligrams of fentanyl, like a couple of grains of salt, can kill a full-grown adult.

00:04:54.843 --> 00:04:59.883
It’s typically smoked, snorted, or injected, with injections being

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:04.073
particularly dangerous because the user has very little idea about

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.803
the strength of what they are putting directly into their bloodstream.

00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:15.483
As one director of a police laboratory said, “You’re injecting yourself with a loaded gun.”

00:05:16.363 --> 00:05:22.446
It has a similar effect to drugs like heroin or morphine, a rush, a high, a

00:05:22.446 --> 00:05:28.556
feeling of euphoria as the chemicals bind to the opioid receptors in the brain.

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:35.006
It feels good, blocks out pain, and gives its users a temporary sense of happiness.

00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:42.286
But it is highly addictive, the high is shorter and more intense than other

00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:48.056
opiates like heroin, meaning it can completely consume its users lives.

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:53.586
It appeared on the illegal drug scene in the US really

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:58.396
in the mid 2010s to fill an existing demand for opiates.

00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:05.146
Increasing numbers of Americans had become addicted to prescription opioids and as there

00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:10.926
was a tightening of restrictions on who was prescribed opioids, an increasing number of

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:16.886
opioid addicted people were left without any legal opportunities to feed their addiction.

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:23.116
Heroin was one option, and the number of heroin addicts skyrocketed.

00:06:23.736 --> 00:06:27.836
But heroin isn’t cheap, and there was still stigma surrounding

00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:32.386
it from its association with the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:38.456
The stage was set for a new drug, one that could be produced

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:43.246
cheaply, easily, and didn’t necessarily need to be injected.

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:45.946
That drug was Fentanyl.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:52.140
It’s a completely synthetic opioid, meaning it can be produced in a laboratory and

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.679
making it much cheaper to produce than other natural opiates like heroin or morphine.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:07.309
Heroin, on the other hand, needs to be harvested from poppies, processed, and transported often

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:13.789
thousands of miles across land and smuggled in ships before it reaches its final destination.

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:19.479
Illegal fentanyl is thought to have a much simpler supply chain.

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:25.599
Initially, it was first produced in China, and then often sent via normal

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:30.599
mail, in shipments of under 1 kilo, to the United States, where it would

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.429
go almost directly onto the streets, and into the hands of addicts.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:43.079
1 kilo of the drug can be bought for around $3,000 wholesale, and this 1 kilo,

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:50.019
given how pure the drug is, would be enough fentanyl to kill 500,000 adults.

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:56.249
After increasing pressure from the United States on the Chinese government, there has been a

00:07:56.279 --> 00:08:03.169
crackdown on fentanyl laboratories in China, and a subsequent reduction, or at least believed

00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:08.479
subsequent reduction, in the amount of Chinese-produced fentanyl arriving in the United States.

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:15.419
But this crackdown opened the doors for Mexican cartels, which buy the chemicals

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:20.349
required to produce fentanyl directly from Chinese suppliers and then produce

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:25.509
the fentanyl in Mexico, before smuggling it northwards to the United States.

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:33.529
Given that it is so much more powerful than drugs like heroin or meth, it takes up a lot less space,

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:40.789
so you might only need a small handbag to supply an entire city’s addicts with fentanyl for a month.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:47.149
As you can see, the logistics of producing, transporting, and

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:51.179
selling fentanyl are just so much simpler than other drugs.

00:08:52.069 --> 00:08:59.069
And the result of this is that it is very cheap for the end user, for the drug addict to get high.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:05.489
Indeed, a hit of fentanyl, enough to get a user high, or kill someone who isn’t

00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:10.999
used to it, typically costs just a few dollars, the same price as a cup of coffee.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:15.889
There are several effects of the drug being so cheap, effects

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.229
that you will no doubt be able to anticipate, to guess.

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.209
Firstly, it has increased the demand for it.

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:28.489
As it’s so cheap, people can afford to take it frequently, and having

00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:33.749
enough money to pay for it is less of a problem than more expensive drugs.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:40.659
Secondly, it has meant that people have switched from other, comparatively safer opioids,

00:09:40.729 --> 00:09:46.829
from prescription drugs like OxyContin or even illegal drugs like heroin, to fentanyl.

00:09:47.489 --> 00:09:51.629
It’s stronger, it’s cheaper, and there’s more of it around.

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:59.229
Thirdly, drug dealers often add fentanyl to other drugs precisely because it’s cheaper.

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:06.649
From cocaine to methamphetamine, police are increasingly finding that dealers are cutting these

00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:13.019
more expensive drugs with fentanyl because they make more money and the end user still gets high.

00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:17.389
The result of all of this is that there are more and more

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:21.688
people taking fentanyl, both knowingly and unknowingly.

00:10:22.368 --> 00:10:24.578
And both cases are problematic.

00:10:25.268 --> 00:10:28.828
When someone buys illegal fentanyl, knowing it’s fentanyl,

00:10:29.038 --> 00:10:31.908
it’s very hard for them to know how strong it is.

00:10:32.828 --> 00:10:40.418
2mg of fentanyl, which can be a fatal dose is, as we said, just like a couple of grains of sand,

00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:47.558
so it's very easy to accidentally overdose, or for a batch of fentanyl to be made too strong.

00:10:48.598 --> 00:10:52.228
This is dangerous enough for people who know they’re taking fentanyl,

00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:57.388
but it’s even more so for people who think they’re taking something else.

00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:05.088
For the heroin user who thinks he is taking heroin, if he takes a “normal” amount of what

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:10.978
he thinks is heroin and it is in fact partly or completely fentanyl, it can be lethal.

00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:16.308
And even for people who think they are taking a completely different drug, not an

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:22.018
opiate, they are increasingly fatally surprised to find it has been cut with fentanyl.

00:11:23.218 --> 00:11:31.258
There was a famous case in March of this year, March of 2022, where five young military cadets died

00:11:31.258 --> 00:11:37.278
on a spring break when they took what they thought was cocaine, but it was laced with fentanyl.

00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:42.988
And an even more famous case of someone taking what he thought was

00:11:42.988 --> 00:11:47.918
another drug but it was in fact fentanyl was of the musician Prince.

00:11:48.418 --> 00:11:52.518
He thought he was taking Vicodin, a type of prescription painkiller,

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:56.678
but it was actually a pill that had been laced with fentanyl.

00:11:57.358 --> 00:12:00.968
He was found dead in an elevator six hours later.

00:12:02.218 --> 00:12:06.758
Fentanyl was no longer something that was restricted to people living on

00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:11.898
the street, people forgotten by mainstream society; it was something that

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:16.848
drug dealers were putting everywhere, and the death toll was increasing.

00:12:17.918 --> 00:12:23.418
In 2003, when the inventor of fentanyl, Dr Janssen, died, there were

00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:30.258
only 1,400 fentanyl deaths in America compared to 2,080 from heroin.

00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:37.978
In 2014, the year of the so-called “third wave” of fentanyl into the country, this

00:12:37.978 --> 00:12:49.338
had climbed to 5,544, in 2020 it had gone up 10 times again, to 56,516, and although

00:12:49.338 --> 00:12:55.568
the statistics haven’t yet been released, it looks like over 70,000 Americans died

00:12:55.688 --> 00:13:02.228
from a fentanyl overdose in 2021, so that’s almost 200 people every single day.

00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:10.118
Or to put another way, it’s 8 people an hour, so statistically during the time you’ve

00:13:10.118 --> 00:13:15.568
been listening to this episode, at least one person has died from a fentanyl overdose.

00:13:16.768 --> 00:13:23.258
And, to state the obvious, these are all human beings, sons, daughters, fathers, mothers,

00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:29.308
brothers and sisters, people who love and who are loved, people who, for one reason

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:35.178
or another, have fallen into a cycle of addiction and paid the ultimate price for it.

00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:42.978
Because fentanyl addiction is so gripping, because it is so hard to escape, and because the

00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:50.078
drug is so cheap, fentanyl addiction is for many a one-way street, one which starts with

00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:56.888
a loss of family and a roof over your head and ends on the street, dead after an overdose.

00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:02.888
In terms of who is falling victim to fentanyl, it’s overwhelmingly

00:14:02.938 --> 00:14:09.508
a male problem, with men making up 73% of fentanyl deaths in 2020.

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:16.778
Although white Americans make up the majority of fentanyl deaths, it’s a drug that affects

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:22.398
people of all ethnicities and ages, not all proportionally, not all to the same extent.

00:14:23.608 --> 00:14:30.418
In fact, the most at risk group is black men aged over 55, a group which

00:14:30.418 --> 00:14:35.378
is four times more likely to overdose on fentanyl than any other group.

00:14:36.728 --> 00:14:42.348
Of course, the drug doesn’t discriminate, but its potency and low price makes

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:47.088
it the drug of choice for people who have hit rock bottom, people who are

00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:52.548
often struggling with homelessness, mental illness, and other forms of personal

00:14:52.568 --> 00:14:57.968
problems which are then compounded by falling into a cycle of fentanyl abuse.

00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:02.748
Now, with the country in the middle of this grip of addiction,

00:15:03.158 --> 00:15:06.418
what is actually happening, and what can be done about this?

00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:12.298
Well, in the next episode we’ll look at the specific case of San Francisco,

00:15:12.548 --> 00:15:17.178
a city that is practising a harm reduction approach, where the use

00:15:17.178 --> 00:15:22.574
of hard drugs including fentanyl has been effectively decriminalised.

00:15:23.138 --> 00:15:27.698
But San Francisco is an anomaly, it’s unusual in this respect.

00:15:28.668 --> 00:15:33.178
The US government is, as you would expect, full of plenty of words,

00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:37.678
policies and ideas about how to solve the issue of fentanyl addiction.

00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:43.658
Its strategy is primarily based on stopping the supply of fentanyl in the first place,

00:15:43.948 --> 00:15:49.248
stopping the drug getting into the country, and taking it off the streets when it's there.

00:15:50.138 --> 00:15:56.828
From cracking down on drug cartels to increased police presence on the streets to prosecuting

00:15:56.838 --> 00:16:03.308
dealers, the overall policy is in line with the country’s War on Drugs policy, the movement

00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:10.338
that started in the 1970s and advocates a total crackdown on drug trafficking and use.

00:16:11.697 --> 00:16:15.245
At least in terms of the number of people dying from

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:18.265
fentanyl overdoses, it doesn’t look like it’s working.

00:16:19.205 --> 00:16:24.155
More and more people are dying, and there doesn’t seem to be any reversal in the trend.

00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:32.335
The problem is that fentanyl is pretty much the perfect drug from a drug trafficker’s point of view.

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:38.585
You can produce it in a laboratory, meaning there’s no need for fields, farmers, the

00:16:38.585 --> 00:16:44.095
right weather, and it’s much easier to hide from the authorities than a large field.

00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:49.165
It’s incredibly powerful, which means that small volumes can

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:52.705
be transported easily without customs officials realising.

00:16:53.705 --> 00:16:57.645
All this means that it can be sold very cheaply, thereby

00:16:57.805 --> 00:17:00.595
increasing the amount of people who are able to take it.

00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:08.565
The result of this is that it is an incredibly lucrative business to be in, the fentanyl business.

00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:15.325
A drug trafficker can buy or produce a kilo of the drug for around $3,000.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:22.005
This is enough to make half a million fentanyl pills, enough to kill 500,000

00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:27.795
people who haven’t used the drug before, or get 500,000 experienced users high.

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:33.618
If a pill is sold for only $4, this means the 1 kilo of

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:38.068
fentanyl can be turned into $2 million of street fentanyl.

00:17:38.938 --> 00:17:44.338
Obviously, there are some costs involved, but you can see how much money is involved.

00:17:45.278 --> 00:17:51.398
The only problem with fentanyl, from the drug trafficker's point of view, is that it’s a drug

00:17:51.398 --> 00:17:56.738
that kills its users, although there seems to be no shortage of people who are willing to try it.

00:17:57.908 --> 00:18:02.778
All this being said, the problem of fentanyl is only one part of America’s

00:18:02.828 --> 00:18:07.938
opioid crisis, a subject which we covered in detail in episode 230.

00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:14.308
It might be the most potent part, the most deadly part, and it is the drug that is

00:18:14.308 --> 00:18:19.818
responsible for the greatest number of deaths, but it is only one piece of the puzzle.

00:18:20.578 --> 00:18:24.248
After all, fentanyl emerged as a product to meet the

00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:27.688
demands of America’s increasingly addicted population.

00:18:28.578 --> 00:18:33.548
After tens of millions of Americans first got hooked on prescription opioids,

00:18:34.018 --> 00:18:39.088
fentanyl was there as a cheaper, more powerful and more available alternative.

00:18:40.098 --> 00:18:46.618
The reality is, and even American officials have admitted as much, that fentanyl is so cheap

00:18:46.818 --> 00:18:53.338
to produce, so easy to transport, and so profitable to sell, that it will be incredibly

00:18:53.338 --> 00:18:59.208
difficult, nigh impossible, to completely eliminate from the streets of American cities.

00:19:00.158 --> 00:19:06.488
It might be destroying lives by their hundreds of thousands, but it is here to stay, and

00:19:06.658 --> 00:19:12.908
the sad reality is that there doesn’t seem to be any coherent plan to do anything about it.

00:19:14.718 --> 00:19:21.108
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Fentanyl, the drug devastating America.

00:19:21.558 --> 00:19:24.988
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:19:25.228 --> 00:19:30.298
I’m sorry to not finish on a high note, so to speak, but when it comes to

00:19:30.328 --> 00:19:34.608
this particular subject there isn’t a huge amount of good news to report.

00:19:35.498 --> 00:19:40.888
As a reminder, next up we’ll be looking at what’s happening in San Francisco, a city that

00:19:40.918 --> 00:19:46.688
has been ravaged by fentanyl, and one where there were more deaths from fentanyl than COVID.

00:19:47.288 --> 00:19:49.218
So keep a look out for that one.

00:19:50.068 --> 00:19:53.488
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:53.908 --> 00:19:56.818
Is fentanyl something that you’ve heard about in your country?

00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:02.628
What do you think could, or should be done, about the issue of fentanyl in the United States?

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:03.898
Who is to blame?

00:20:04.148 --> 00:20:08.518
The pill-prescribing doctors, the drug traffickers, the people taking

00:20:08.518 --> 00:20:13.378
drugs, or is it a product of structural problems in American society?

00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:17.608
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:17.928 --> 00:20:20.948

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.910
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.010
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.520
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are talking about the story

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.980
of an alleged jihadi conspiracy to take over British schools.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.850
It was a scandal that all started with an anonymous letter, but

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.489
developed into a national scandal, appearing on the front pages of every

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.570
national newspaper, and calling for a response from the Prime Minister.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.440
This scandal would be dubbed “The Trojan Horse Scandal”, and it’s

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.860
a story that asks questions about multiculturalism, Islamophobia,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.920
journalistic standards, and, ultimately, what is the role of a school.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.710
It’s even more fascinating because, it would turn out, it might all have been a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.199
massive hoax, the letter that started it all off might have been completely fake.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:16.364
The story is long, and so full of twists and turns, that we are going to split it into two parts.

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:23.554
In this part, part one, we’ll focus on the letter and scandal itself, and in part-two we’ll

00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:28.364
take a look at the investigations into it all, and the broader legacy of the whole affair.

00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:35.574
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about The Trojan Horse Scandal.

00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:41.894
It was November 2013 in Birmingham, England.

00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:46.644
The post had just arrived at Birmingham City Council’s office.

00:01:47.794 --> 00:01:52.194
Birmingham is the second biggest city in the country, and–as you

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:56.454
might expect–the council receives hundreds of letters every day.

00:01:57.324 --> 00:02:02.344
Normally these letters aren’t particularly interesting or important - Dear local

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:07.184
council, please fix the broken lightbulb on my street, Dear local council, I

00:02:07.184 --> 00:02:11.504
would like to volunteer to start a community club for kids, you get the picture.

00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:18.544
But that one day in November, the council received a letter that was…different.

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:24.343
A rather strange letter, with consequences that would go far beyond Birmingham.

00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:30.813
On the first page of the letter it said: ‘Very important: confidential,’

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:35.354
and instructions that it was to be destroyed after reading.

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:42.944
With the letter came a note saying that this letter had been found in the sender's boss’s office.

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:50.824
Inside were four poorly photocopied pages, with bits blocked out and the corners blurred.

00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:54.584
It seemed like it was part of a longer letter.

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:58.204
It was anonymous, not signed by anyone.

00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:04.794
Unusual, sure, but what was much more shocking was what was written in the letter.

00:03:06.304 --> 00:03:11.144
The letter, which appeared to be part of a correspondence between two people,

00:03:11.384 --> 00:03:17.994
or two groups perhaps, claimed that there was a conspiracy, a plot, to

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:24.134
gain control of British schools and implement hardline Islamic teachings.

00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:27.534
In fact, it was more serious than that.

00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:35.704
The plot, which the letter claimed was a five-step plan called ‘Operation Trojan Horse’,

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:43.744
was already well underway in Birmingham and, I quote, “totally invisible to the naked eye."

00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:49.358
“ We have caused a great amount of organised disruption in Birmingham,” the

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:54.918
mystery writer bragged, “and as a result we now have our own Academies and are

00:03:54.968 --> 00:04:00.178
on our way to getting rid of more headteachers and taking over their schools.”

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:05.428
And the plot was to be expanded, it said, into other

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:08.608
British cities including Manchester and Bradford.

00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:15.038
The idea, or the tactic, was to target schools where the majority of

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:20.528
students were Muslim with parents who were sympathetic to an Islamic agenda.”

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:25.438
But then came perhaps the most chilling line in the

00:04:25.438 --> 00:04:28.888
letter, the one that set in motion a national panic.

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:34.238
“Whilst sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way

00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:38.648
of doing things,” the letter said, “you must remember that this is a

00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:44.888
‘Jihad’ and as such all means possible to win the war is acceptable.’’

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:50.568
Now, before we get into the impact that this one letter would come

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:54.848
to have on the entire country, I want to explain three things.

00:04:55.508 --> 00:05:02.306
First, I want to talk about the term, “Trojan Horse”, second I want to give you some background to

00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:09.895
multiculturalism in Britain, and thirdly,  I want to explain, briefly, how schools in Britain work.

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:13.185
So, first, the term “Trojan Horse”.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:20.375
If you’re familiar with your Greek mythology, you’ll remember that the Greeks built a giant hollow,

00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:28.428
an empty, wooden horse and left it as a gift for the Trojans, the inhabitants of the city of Troy.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.380
It seemed like a harmless gift, but hiding inside the horse were Greek soldiers.

00:05:36.547 --> 00:05:40.372
The Trojans accepted it, and brought it into the city of Troy.

00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:45.628
In the dead of night the Greeks jumped out, attacked the Trojans,

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:50.848
and this resulted in the fall of Troy, the destruction of the city.

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:56.998
This term “Trojan Horse” has come to mean something that looks innocent

00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:01.908
and is accepted, but is actually intended to cause serious harm.

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:08.614
OK, with that definition out of the way, let’s talk about multiculturalism in Britain.

00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:14.304
Compared to many countries, Britain is a fairly multicultural place,

00:06:14.444 --> 00:06:18.684
with people from a broad range of ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.

00:06:19.784 --> 00:06:26.494
In the 1950s and 1960s, Britain, which was still recovering from the ruinous effects of the Second

00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:32.284
World War, invited thousands of people from its former colonies to come and live in the country.

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:40.434
Millions came, especially from places like India, Pakistan, and the West Indies, the Caribbean.

00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:47.074
With this huge influx of immigration, Britain, and especially British

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:52.724
cities, started to become increasingly diverse, with parts of some cities

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:58.504
where ethnic or religious minorities are not the minority, but the majority.

00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:04.554
In places like Leicester and Bradford, for example, the British-Asian

00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:08.264
community makes up as much as 40 percent of the population.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:13.794
And in certain neighbourhoods in places like London or Birmingham, where

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:18.354
this story is based, this figure can be in the sixties or seventies.

00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:24.094
As you might imagine, with this level of immigration to a country,

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.594
especially from places with different cultures or religious values,

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:33.371
it has not always been plain sailing, it has not always been smooth.

00:07:34.765 --> 00:07:40.355
Immigrants, whether first, second or even third generation, often

00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:45.405
face discrimination, racism, reduced job opportunities, and so on.

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:52.385
This discrimination often comes from a fear from parts of the supposed “indigenous” British

00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:59.695
population that their way of life is being changed, that British society is becoming less British.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:05.565
Now, I’m sure you'll be familiar with these arguments, as if you live in a country with

00:08:05.595 --> 00:08:10.275
any significant levels of immigration, no doubt it is a similar story where you live.

00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:15.785
But why this is relevant for our story is because of what

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:20.005
this means in terms of education, schooling for children.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:23.445
So, first, some background to this.

00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:27.935
In the UK, the government provides free education.

00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:34.765
There are private schools, schools where parents have to pay, but every child in Britain has

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:41.019
the right to go to a school, for free, provided by the government, between the ages of 5 and 16.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.965
There are secular schools, schools where no religion is officially taught, and there are

00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:53.925
religious schools, so-called “faith” schools, which follow the national curriculum, but

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:59.525
provide classes about the religious teachings of one religion - they could be Anglican,

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:06.075
otherwise known as the Church of England, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, and so on.

00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:12.365
So, the point to remember, the point to underline is that government schools,

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:17.225
state schools as they’re called, can be secular or they can be religious.

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:24.425
Schools in Britain are actually legally required to provide some form of daily worship, which

00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:30.835
can be Christian, it can be Muslim, it can be any religion, or some schools just ignore it.

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:36.065
So a parent can choose to send their child to a school that

00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:40.675
aligns with their religious values, or lack of religious values.

00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:46.315
You might think this is good, you might think it’s bad, but that’s beside the point.

00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:49.075
The point is that this is the case in Britain.

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:56.035
Now, back to our story, back to Birmingham, and in fact, back to a particular

00:09:56.215 --> 00:10:02.145
area of Birmingham called Alum Rock, which is an inner-city suburb of Birmingham.

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:08.895
60% of people in Alum Rock have Pakistani heritage, with the

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:13.415
vast majority of those people of Pakistani heritage being Muslim.

00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:23.295
And it’s a particularly deprived area of the city - high unemployment, low income, and, importantly

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:30.265
for our story, schools were historically very low quality, they did not provide a good education.

00:10:31.605 --> 00:10:38.185
At one school, Park View, in 1997, only 1 in 20 students

00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:42.175
got good enough exam results to be considered a “pass”.

00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:45.915
This was one of the worst-performing schools in the country.

00:10:47.435 --> 00:10:52.215
As you might imagine, this led to entire generations leaving school

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:56.365
with little-to-no qualifications, and subsequently struggling to

00:10:56.365 --> 00:11:01.165
break out of a cycle of low income and poor educational outcomes.

00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:03.785
So, back to the letter.

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:10.015
In the letter, it was claimed that there was a plot, a plan, by

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:15.545
radical Islamists to infiltrate and take over schools in Birmingham.

00:11:16.915 --> 00:11:23.365
According to the letter, schools in Alum Rock and other parts of East Birmingham were implementing

00:11:23.605 --> 00:11:30.815
gender segregation, keeping boys and girls apart, and sex education classes were being banned.

00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:37.142
There were claims of homophobic and misogynistic comments from teachers, and

00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:41.862
even that anti-western speakers had been invited to speak to the children.

00:11:43.232 --> 00:11:47.732
Now, as shocking as this might sound, if this was just in one

00:11:47.732 --> 00:11:52.022
school, it could probably have been dealt with at a local level.

00:11:53.162 --> 00:11:57.442
But what was different, what was important, was that the letter

00:11:57.442 --> 00:12:03.102
claimed that this was all part of a bigger plot, a “Trojan Horse”.

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:10.902
This conspiracy was what would take it from a local story to a national scandal.

00:12:12.242 --> 00:12:19.092
The mystery whistleblower claimed that there was a five-step plan to infiltrate the schools.

00:12:20.432 --> 00:12:26.122
In the letter it said, and I quote directly, "I have detailed the plan we

00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:30.142
have in Birmingham and how well it has worked and you will see how easy

00:12:30.142 --> 00:12:35.052
the whole process is to get the head teacher out and your own person in.”

00:12:36.442 --> 00:12:40.962
The first step was to find schools where most of the pupils were Muslim.

00:12:41.632 --> 00:12:48.032
Then, find parents in the local community supportive of an Islamic agenda in schools.

00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:54.302
Next, the aim was to install or put in place governors

00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:57.632
who also had these conservative Islamic beliefs.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:04.922
The next step was to cause problems from within the schools by approaching teachers sympathetic to

00:13:04.922 --> 00:13:12.272
the plan, and slowly change rules and challenge any colleagues who got in the way, or opposed them.

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:18.952
Then once that was all in place, ‘Step Five’ of the plan was to

00:13:18.952 --> 00:13:24.282
begin sending anonymous letters designed to undermine and damage the

00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:29.082
headteacher’s reputation until they were forced to resign, to quit.

00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:37.172
This plan, the letter claimed, “is tried and tested within Birmingham,” and it even

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:42.542
gave some examples of schools where this plan had already been successfully implemented.

00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:51.172
It was a serious allegation, and was passed from Birmingham City Council to the Home Office,

00:13:51.252 --> 00:13:58.852
the central government essentially, and then it was leaked to the British press early in 2014.

00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:07.472
As you might imagine, this resulted in a media scandal, it was all over the newspapers and TV.

00:14:08.612 --> 00:14:13.802
Especially the right-wing media outlets delighted in stories of rumours of

00:14:13.922 --> 00:14:19.532
Jihadi plots and Islamists brainwashing British children, with journalists

00:14:19.602 --> 00:14:24.222
flocking to the area to try to interview local residents and students.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:30.352
And in the following few weeks, former staff members from several of the schools

00:14:30.362 --> 00:14:36.292
named in the letter went to the press and added to the idea that there was an Islamic

00:14:36.322 --> 00:14:42.762
conspiracy to take over schools, not only in Birmingham, but all over the country.

00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:50.132
These included claims that there were expensive speaker systems installed in schools for calls to

00:14:50.132 --> 00:14:57.262
prayer, and of teachers stopping couples holding hands and segregating boys and girls in class.

00:14:58.252 --> 00:15:01.752
This was some pretty hardline, radical stuff.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:08.362
The scandal was so serious, in fact, that the Prime Minister at the time, David Cameron,

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:14.102
called a special meeting of the government’s extremism task force to look into the matter.

00:15:15.642 --> 00:15:19.832
First things first, track down the person who seemed to be

00:15:19.832 --> 00:15:24.529
the mastermind named in the letter, a so-called “Tahir”.

00:15:25.702 --> 00:15:31.022
Now, as you may know, “Tahir” is a relatively common Arabic name,

00:15:31.562 --> 00:15:35.922
but fingers were quickly pointed at one Tahir in particular.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.532
A man named Tahir Alam.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.449
So, who was Tahir Alam?

00:15:41.921 --> 00:15:43.522
A Jihadi extremist?

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:46.062
An anti-British ISIS recruiter?

00:15:46.682 --> 00:15:48.242
Well, not exactly.

00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:52.652
Tahir Alam was a well-respected school governor in Birmingham

00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:56.102
known for turning around poorly-performing schools.

00:15:56.852 --> 00:16:01.912
He was a British-Pakistani man who had come to Britain as a child not knowing a

00:16:01.922 --> 00:16:06.792
word of English and had gone on to become a community leader in East Birmingham.

00:16:07.672 --> 00:16:11.662
He was well-respected, and liked in the local community.

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:16.081
He had even been invited to Downing Street to celebrate his

00:16:16.081 --> 00:16:20.271
transformative educational policies with the Prime Minister, Tony Blair.

00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:27.441
His main achievement was turning around Park View school, the school in Alum Rock

00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:32.301
we heard about a few minutes ago where only 1 in 20 students passed their exams.

00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:41.391
When Tahir Alam became governor of the school, he set about implementing a new educational policy.

00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:47.841
Essentially, his hypothesis, his plan, was that communities

00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:51.411
should have more control of and better reflect their schools.

00:16:52.951 --> 00:16:57.851
Alam saw that, even though most students at schools like Park View were of

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:03.601
Pakistani heritage, many of them only had one or two teachers of Pakistani heritage.

00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:11.561
Alam thought that this was part of the reason that these schools performed so poorly, and believed

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:17.601
that if teachers and students had a shared culture and language, the results would improve.

00:17:19.116 --> 00:17:23.035
He implemented changes in the school, such as introducing a daily

00:17:23.035 --> 00:17:27.567
act of Islamic worship, and shortening the school day during Ramadan.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.650
I should stress that this was something the school was allowed to do, and it

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.610
was part of Alam’s idea that the school should better reflect its students.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.010
Indeed, 98% of the students of this school were Muslim.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.730
Now, you might agree with Alam’s hypothesis, you might not, but, as the expression

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:53.630
goes, the proof is in the pudding, meaning the results speak for themselves.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.540
His educational plan worked incredibly well.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.120
The school went from being one of the worst in the country to one

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:08.370
of the best, and went from a 5% to a 70% pass rate in key exams.

00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:14.687
When the British school inspection body, OFSTED, visited the school

00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:19.087
it concluded that ‘every school in the country should be like this.’

00:18:20.147 --> 00:18:24.957
In fact, Park View was even complimented for its “wide range of

00:18:24.957 --> 00:18:29.817
opportunities for spiritual development, including voluntary Friday prayers.”

00:18:30.957 --> 00:18:36.349
Alam hadn’t tried to hide the policies he had put in place - he had even been invited to

00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:40.967
Downing Street to be congratulated on the results that had been achieved in the school.

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:45.417
And he had also become involved with several other schools in Birmingham,

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:50.377
and implemented similar policies, after the success at Park View.

00:18:51.587 --> 00:18:53.537
So, why the scandal?

00:18:54.207 --> 00:18:59.567
Well, nobody, including Alam, really debated what changes had been implemented

00:18:59.627 --> 00:19:04.917
in these schools, but the scandal was about the motivation for these changes?

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:10.557
Had the schools become more Muslim because this would lead to better results

00:19:10.777 --> 00:19:16.137
for their pupils, or was it done because of some wider, “Jihad” reason?

00:19:17.107 --> 00:19:21.207
Clearly, better results for students are a good thing, but

00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:25.507
this letter placed a seed of doubt in many people’s minds.

00:19:26.237 --> 00:19:31.767
What if these results were just a byproduct of a sinister plan?

00:19:33.157 --> 00:19:39.447
And this was, I should add, against a backdrop of increasing anti-Islamic feeling in the UK.

00:19:40.937 --> 00:19:45.537
The year before, an off-duty British soldier called Lee Rigby had

00:19:45.537 --> 00:19:50.067
been murdered in broad daylight by two British converts to Islam.

00:19:50.997 --> 00:19:54.887
And this was around the same time that the Islamic State was winning

00:19:54.887 --> 00:19:59.307
territory in the Middle East and carrying out deadly terror attacks in Europe.

00:20:00.327 --> 00:20:05.097
For many in Britain, radical Islam was becoming a genuine fear.

00:20:06.137 --> 00:20:13.287
And this letter, if true, suggested that it had implanted itself within British schools.

00:20:14.837 --> 00:20:19.307
As you can probably imagine, this all added to the growing panic that

00:20:19.307 --> 00:20:23.907
there was an Islamic plot to take over not just British schools but Britain

00:20:24.077 --> 00:20:28.942
itself, and added to the fear that Britain was under attack from within.

00:20:30.452 --> 00:20:36.837
Soon the debate had grown from schools to the broader issue of multiculturalism and integration.

00:20:37.827 --> 00:20:43.947
In particular, Islam and the place of Muslims in British society became a talking point.

00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:49.595
For Islamaphobic people, the plot revealed exactly what they

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:54.107
already thought about Muslims and  justified their prejudices.

00:20:55.347 --> 00:20:59.907
These Muslims plotting in Birmingham, they said, were ‘un-British’,

00:21:00.037 --> 00:21:05.477
a threat to British society from within, a 21st-century Trojan Horse.

00:21:07.047 --> 00:21:09.837
But…was there actually a Trojan Horse?

00:21:09.867 --> 00:21:12.501
Was there really a Jihadi conspiracy?

00:21:13.054 --> 00:21:17.617
What if it was all a hoax, one massive lie?

00:21:18.557 --> 00:21:23.290
That, my dear listeners, is a question we will try to answer in part two.

00:21:25.098 --> 00:21:29.908
Ok then, that is it for part one of this mini-series on the Trojan

00:21:29.908 --> 00:21:34.578
Horse affair, the alleged Islamic plot to infiltrate British schools.

00:21:35.068 --> 00:21:40.108
Part two of this little exploration is going to come in two episodes' time.

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:42.358
So keep a lookout for that one next week.

00:21:42.822 --> 00:21:45.712
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:46.062 --> 00:21:49.365
What do you think about religion in schools?

00:21:49.462 --> 00:21:52.142
Should religion and education be kept separate?

00:21:52.702 --> 00:21:56.492
And how should schools and education adapt to the

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:59.052
cultural and religious backgrounds of their students?

00:21:59.662 --> 00:22:05.572
Big questions, I know, but I would love to get your opinion so let’s get this discussion started.

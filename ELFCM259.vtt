Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:17.147
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:21.397
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:26.307
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:31.247
Nikola Tesla, one of history’s most gifted and brilliant inventors.

00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:35.577
This is actually part three of this three-part series

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:39.077
on electricity in America in the late 19th century.

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:45.577
In part one we heard about the quintessential American robber-baron, Thomas Edison, and in

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:51.427
part two we heard about the War of the Currents and the battle to electrify the country.

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:57.857
You don’t have to have listened to part 1 or part 2 to enjoy part 3, this one,

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:03.907
but if you want a deeper understanding of the character of Edison or the events

00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:07.907
of the War of the Currents, then I’d recommend listening to the others too.

00:01:09.247 --> 00:01:12.167
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:21.107
If you Google the word “Tesla” now, you’ll find plenty of results about electric cars and Elon Musk.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:27.487
It might take you quite a bit of scrolling and clicking around to find anything

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:32.837
on the man who gave his name to the most valuable automotive company in the world.

00:01:33.637 --> 00:01:38.127
The man we’re talking about today is, of course, Nikola Tesla.

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:44.747
He was undoubtedly one of the greatest pioneers of modern electrical engineering and

00:01:44.977 --> 00:01:51.727
is perhaps most famous for promoting and improving the alternating current, or AC

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:57.627
system, a system that remains the global standard for power transmission to this day.

00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:03.067
Whenever you turn on a light at home or power up an electrical

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:07.217
appliance, the technology used can be traced back to Tesla.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:11.847
He also patented numerous inventions with breakthroughs in

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:15.977
wireless communication, fluorescent lighting and remote control.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:24.267
On paper, Tesla should have been one of the richest men in the world, a 19th century Elon Musk.

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:29.047
Yet he died penniless and alone in a New York hotel.

00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:36.817
A marginalised and underrated outsider increasingly fixated, or obsessed with pigeons.

00:02:37.997 --> 00:02:39.607
So, what went wrong?

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:45.237
To find out, let’s take a closer look at Tesla's life and the times he lived in.

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:54.647
Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in what is modern-day Croatia, during a fierce lightning storm.

00:02:55.857 --> 00:03:00.267
At the time, lightning was considered to be a bad omen,

00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:04.737
a bad sign, but Tesla’s mother didn’t see it that way.

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:12.277
She would later report that she was convinced that her son would be a “child of light”,

00:03:12.647 --> 00:03:18.747
and indeed electricity would forever be something that the boy would be associated with.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:27.297
From his early childhood, young Nikola exhibited signs of obsessiveness and extreme intelligence.

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:35.137
He had a photographic memory, was able to easily memorise entire books and excelled

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:40.447
in learning foreign languages, becoming fluent in at least eight different languages.

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:45.227
He was able to study intensely for hours upon end,

00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:48.547
rarely sleeping for more than a couple of hours in a row.

00:03:49.857 --> 00:03:54.997
Aged 19, Nikola Tesla enrolled in the course of electrical engineering

00:03:55.134 --> 00:04:00.507
at Graz in Austria where he was a frequently outspoken star pupil.

00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:07.207
He became obsessed with electricity, and what he perceived as design flaws,

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:12.567
imperfections, in the direct current electric motors that he studied in class.

00:04:13.477 --> 00:04:19.177
Just in case you need a quick brush up, a quick reminder on electricity, direct

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:24.957
current or DC means that the electrical charge only flows in one direction.

00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:29.107
It is now mostly used with low voltage applications

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:33.027
such as most modern electronic appliances and batteries.

00:04:33.677 --> 00:04:38.327
AC, or alternating current, continuously changes direction

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:43.107
making it unsuitable for powering sensitive modern-day devices.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:48.317
AC is, however, cheaper to generate and it results in

00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:51.937
less energy loss when transferred over long distances.

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:57.277
AC can also be easily converted into different voltages,

00:04:57.417 --> 00:05:00.687
making it the best choice for power distribution.

00:05:01.687 --> 00:05:07.284
Although early forms of electric lighting had existed since the early 1800s,

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:12.535
the first large-scale electrical power distribution centre was created in

00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:18.245
London in 1882, with New York and other cities following later the same year.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:23.435
One by one, the world’s greatest cities began to make

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:27.945
the switch from oil and gas lamps to electric ones.

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:34.225
These were exciting times and Tesla’s studies and obsession with

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:38.885
electricity put him at the very forefront of key developments.

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:45.365
For the next six years, Tesla devoted most of his life to thinking about

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:50.805
how he could improve DC motors, hypothesising about electromagnetic

00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:56.095
fields and how an electric motor driven by AC power would work.

00:05:57.035 --> 00:06:03.225
Despite his obvious talent, Tesla didn’t end up as a star university student.

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:08.915
His focus on this new type of electric motor dominated his entire

00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:13.145
life and he was unable to concentrate on his university studies.

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:18.585
It got so bad that his university professors warned his father

00:06:18.775 --> 00:06:23.355
about his son’s damagingly intense studying with very little sleep.

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:30.995
And Tesla paid the price, he suffered a nervous breakdown, and ended up gambling

00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:36.845
away much of the money he had, dropping out and never graduating from university.

00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:44.005
On recovering from this breakdown, the idea for a new AC electric motor

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:49.905
came to him like a vision one day in 1882 when he was out walking.

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:55.665
It was no doubt the fruit, the result, of years of intense

00:06:55.735 --> 00:07:00.775
reflection, but certainly there was an element of sheer genius to it.

00:07:01.895 --> 00:07:09.155
Unlike most other famous scientists, and certainly unlike Thomas Edison, Tesla would develop and

00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:16.795
perfect almost all of his inventions introspectively, inside his head, rather than writing notes.

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:24.315
It really was a case of him walking along and suddenly, almost in a flash of light,

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:30.734
he would figure out, in theory, how to fix an immensely complicated technical problem.

00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:37.811
With this new brilliant idea in his head, Tesla moved to Paris in 1882.

00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:45.914
In Paris, he found a job repairing direct current power plants with the Continental Edison Company.

00:07:46.964 --> 00:07:52.244
Thomas Edison, the American nine years Tesla’s senior, was by this time

00:07:52.254 --> 00:07:57.104
already an extremely famous inventor, and a very successful businessman.

00:07:58.074 --> 00:08:03.704
He was a major player in electrifying the first cities across the world, having invented

00:08:03.704 --> 00:08:09.634
the first commercially successful electric lightbulb, and had now moved on to electric

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:15.794
transmission systems to compete with and replace the existing gas lighting utilities.

00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:20.784
Tesla’s manager at Edison’s Paris office was sent

00:08:20.784 --> 00:08:24.274
back to the US to run Edison’s manufacturing division.

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:28.329
He was so impressed with Tesla’s work that he asked

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:31.464
for the young engineer to be transferred with him.

00:08:32.274 --> 00:08:40.514
So, in June of 1884, aged 28, Tesla moved to the United States, where he would eventually

00:08:40.514 --> 00:08:47.544
become naturalised, that is a US citizen, and carry out the vast majority of his inventions.

00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:54.928
However, Tesla's employment at the Edison Machine Works was short-lived, it didn’t last long.

00:08:55.978 --> 00:09:02.308
There are differing stories about exactly why Tesla left Edison’s company, but the general

00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:10.354
theory goes that he was promised a large bonus, $50,000 at the time, which would be about 1.3

00:09:10.354 --> 00:09:16.975
million euros in today's money, for designing improvements to Edison’s direct current dynamos.

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:24.335
Tesla produced these new improvements, but Edison refused to pay out, saying that

00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:29.835
the bonus offer had been a joke and Tesla did not understand American humour.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:36.565
Well, if I thought I was going to be paid 1.3 million euros, and my boss said,

00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:41.295
“hahaha, I was only joking”, I’m not sure I’d see the funny side of it either.

00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:45.415
Enough was enough for Tesla, and he quit.

00:09:46.215 --> 00:09:51.375
If you’ve listened to the episode on the War of the Currents, you’ll know that paying Tesla the

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:58.585
1.3 million Euro bonus would have been incredibly good value, as our genius’ protagonist’s next

00:09:58.585 --> 00:10:05.525
move was to branch out on his own, to set up his own company, and eventually compete with Edison.

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:10.565
The new company was called Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:17.705
He initially managed to raise some funding for it, but although its products, the new

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:24.505
lighting system and AC motor plans, showed some promise, his backers decided to pull out.

00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:31.175
His company was now worthless, and to make ends meet Tesla had to take on

00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:38.045
basic electrical repair jobs and even took a job digging ditches for $2 a day.

00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:44.665
Looking back on the year of 1886 as a year of hardship, he would later write:

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:48.345
“My high education in various branches of science,

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:52.405
mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery”.

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:58.365
However, word had already got out that Tesla was onto something with his

00:10:58.385 --> 00:11:03.665
AC powered motor, and before long companies started knocking at his door.

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:08.785
A wealthy businessman called George Westinghouse would be the

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:13.125
partner, or perhaps even client, that Tesla had been looking for.

00:11:14.415 --> 00:11:18.125
Westinghouse had made his money in the railway industry, but

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:22.775
in the early 1880s had turned his attention to electricity.

00:11:23.955 --> 00:11:29.405
When Westinghouse entered the electricity business for good, in 1884, the standard

00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:34.775
across cities in the United States was the DC current system provided by Edison.

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:41.115
Edison controlled all technical development and held all of the necessary patents.

00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:49.215
Rather than contenting himself with creating another DC system, Westinghouse developed an

00:11:49.315 --> 00:11:55.835
AC power system that was inspired by the progress made in AC power transmission in Europe.

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:03.095
As a reminder, DC is not good at travelling long distances, whereas AC is.

00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:11.425
Given the short range of Edison’s DC power plants, there was also a ready market of unsupplied

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:17.345
customers between each plant that Westinghouse could easily reach with his AC power.

00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:25.605
This made Westinghouse Edison's direct competitor in what was to become known as the “War of the

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:31.415
Currents” - the battle to develop the dominant electrical power transmission system in America.

00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:37.565
We went into this in great detail in the last episode, episode number 258,

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:41.575
so if you haven’t listened to that one yet I would recommend doing so.

00:12:42.635 --> 00:12:48.605
Long story short, Westinghouse’s system beat Edison’s, and as far as Tesla

00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:53.525
was concerned, the money he made from licensing his patents to Westinghouse

00:12:53.785 --> 00:12:59.175
meant he had the resources and money to devote to his own scientific interests.

00:12:59.985 --> 00:13:05.475
During the 1890s, Tesla went on to invent the famous Tesla Coil - a

00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:10.795
way to transmit electricity wirelessly that he often used to impress

00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:15.705
backers and the general public alike in a spectacular, show-like fashion.

00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:23.525
He also developed electric meters, oscillators and lights, as well as experimenting with X-rays.

00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:29.985
During a public demonstration with a radio-controlled model boat in Madison Square

00:13:30.325 --> 00:13:35.365
in New York, the people in the crowd assumed that a small monkey was actually

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:41.185
driving the boat, so novel or new, was Tesla’s remote control technology at the time.

00:13:42.775 --> 00:13:47.985
The year 1895, when he was not yet even 40, marked perhaps

00:13:47.985 --> 00:13:51.835
the summit of Tesla’s public recognition and popularity.

00:13:53.245 --> 00:14:00.015
Tesla and Westinghouse installed AC generators at Niagara Falls, fulfilling a

00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:06.625
childhood dream for Tesla and changing the way we look at such powerful natural forces.

00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:13.105
He had become the man who had managed to harness the immense power of North

00:14:13.155 --> 00:14:19.045
America’s most powerful waterfall and turn it into something brilliant, electricity.

00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:24.989
Sure, he had had success before, and was well-known, but this really

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:29.399
established his reputation as one of America's leading inventors.

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:34.959
Unfortunately, the good times were about to come to an end for Tesla.

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:41.439
While Westinghouse eventually won the “Battle of the Currents” with AC being

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:48.529
adopted, victory came at a steep price due to sky-high legal and competitive costs.

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:53.849
At the time competition between the three big energy companies,

00:14:54.229 --> 00:14:58.379
Edison, Westinghouse and Thomson-Houston was extreme.

00:14:59.229 --> 00:15:03.549
All three were trying to expand in what was an extremely

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:07.819
capital intensive, expensive, business, spending big money.

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:14.559
At the same time, they were trying to financially undercut one another, reducing

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:20.299
their costs to attract customers, meaning their profit margins were razor thin.

00:15:21.739 --> 00:15:29.429
What’s more, bank collapses and financial panic in 1890 had meant that investors in Westinghouse

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:35.779
Electric had started to call in their loans, meaning the company was dangerously short of cash.

00:15:37.089 --> 00:15:41.469
After refinancing, Westinghouse’s new lenders demanded that

00:15:41.469 --> 00:15:45.909
he cut back on spending, including on research and patents.

00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:53.689
Westinghouse was forced to ask Tesla to renege, to give up, his royalty agreement,

00:15:53.929 --> 00:15:58.309
under which Tesla would be paid for the electricity produced by his motors.

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:02.449
If Tesla didn’t agree to this, Westinghouse would

00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:06.279
risk losing control of the company and financial ruin.

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:12.159
At this point Tesla’s motor was still in development and keeping Westinghouse

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:16.429
on board to promote his motor probably seemed like the best option.

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:23.709
Tesla promptly tore up his contract and set Westinghouse free, walking away from

00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:28.969
millions of dollars he had earned and potentially billions more yet to be made.

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:34.169
If you’ve listened to the episode on Thomas Edison, or have some

00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:39.119
idea about the character of the man, it seems like this act by Tesla

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:43.119
tells you all you need to know about the difference between the two.

00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:48.959
After this, Tesla began to focus more exclusively on his wireless

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:53.569
transmission ideas, essentially the idea for the wireless radio.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:55.949
The banker J.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:56.199
P.

00:16:56.199 --> 00:17:00.219
Morgan, yes that’s the same person as the founder of the J.P.

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:06.249
Morgan bank, provided Tesla with $150,000 to begin work on a giant

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:10.359
tower with the aim of creating a worldwide transmission system.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:15.239
However, Tesla began to run out of money before the tower

00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:19.279
was finished and Morgan refused to provide any more.

00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:26.199
In the meantime, Tesla’s rival Marconi attracted increasing amounts of funding

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:32.519
and in 1901 succeeded in sending a radio signal from England to Newfoundland.

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:37.829
Despite Tesla’s complaints that Marconi was using 17 of his

00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:42.219
patents, Marconi was celebrated as the inventor of the radio.

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:48.929
Although he was famous, and still by no means poor, the latter years of

00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:54.309
Nikola Tesla’s life became more and more isolated and withdrawn from society.

00:17:55.139 --> 00:18:00.919
His personality quirks, his character, also became more and more strange.

00:18:01.969 --> 00:18:07.369
You can see some of this from accounts about what he actually spent his days doing.

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:13.969
After working from 09:00 until 18:00, he always dined at exactly 10

00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:18.249
minutes past 8 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he was living.

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:24.239
Not only did he somewhat bizarrely insist upon being seated at the

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:28.769
exact same table every night, he would also telephone through his

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:33.509
order to the head waiter - the only person he would allow to serve him.

00:18:34.689 --> 00:18:40.879
He was a complete germaphobe, he had an extreme fear of germs, having

00:18:40.879 --> 00:18:45.989
been ill with cholera as a young man, and ever since he insisted on having

00:18:45.989 --> 00:18:51.809
a stack of 18 napkins on the table and washing his hands three times.

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:57.109
After dinner, Tesla often continued to work on his inventions

00:18:57.419 --> 00:19:01.439
into the early hours, often until 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:08.279
Although Tesla was quite withdrawn from public life when he chose to focus

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:13.009
on his work, when he was in the mood for socialising, he was, in fact,

00:19:13.229 --> 00:19:18.039
great company, he was a lot of fun to be around, and he had many friends.

00:19:18.729 --> 00:19:23.839
At the height of his fame he threw lavish dinner parties and he counted Mark

00:19:23.899 --> 00:19:28.949
Twain and John Jacob Astor amongst his celebrity friends and benefactors.

00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:34.989
He was also a very dapper, or smart, dresser, believing that you had

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:39.589
to look and act like you were successful to actually become successful.

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:48.169
Ultimately popular success eluded Tesla, and his behaviour became more and more erratic.

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:53.559
For most of his life, Tesla had been fond of feeding pigeons.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:58.359
However, as he became even more reclusive, cut off from society,

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:02.309
the pigeons he fed became more and more important to him.

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:09.189
Tesla became fixated with a white bird in particular, with one particular pigeon.

00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:15.499
He once said, “I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them, for years.

00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:20.049
But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with

00:20:20.089 --> 00:20:23.679
light grey tips on its wings; that one was different.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:24.869
It was a female.

00:20:25.589 --> 00:20:29.089
I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me.

00:20:29.409 --> 00:20:33.659
I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me.

00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:38.119
As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.”

00:20:39.659 --> 00:20:43.749
According to Tesla, this bird visited him one night in his

00:20:43.749 --> 00:20:47.709
hotel with bright intense lights shining out from its eyes.

00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:55.099
As the pigeon died in his arms, Tesla said he knew that his life’s work had been finished.

00:20:56.539 --> 00:21:02.279
Although Tesla went on to make the front cover of Time Magazine in 1931, when

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:07.719
it ran a special feature on him and his inventions on his 75th birthday, he

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:16.057
lingered pretty much in obscurity and died in 1943, penniless and in debt aged 86.

00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:23.189
He never married or had children, believing that having a family would get in the way of his work.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.609
Indeed, he famously said, “I do not think you can name

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:31.049
many great inventions that have been made by married men.”

00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:36.909
And interestingly, this lack of any direct family meant that he

00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:40.799
became something of a political football during the Cold War.

00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:47.099
Upon his death, the United States government scrambled to quickly collect all of his

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:52.939
research to prevent any potentially important developments from falling into foreign hands.

00:21:53.999 --> 00:22:00.789
But in 1952, Tesla’s nephew, a man called Sava Kosanović, who was a prominent

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:05.629
Yugoslavian politician and the only relative that Tesla had maintained any

00:22:05.629 --> 00:22:11.099
contact with, arranged to ship all that remained of Tesla’s personal belongings,

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:17.069
documents, drawings, letters and photographs back to Belgrade in former Yugoslavia.

00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:23.809
While Tesla was celebrated as a national hero in communist Yugoslavia, with the

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:29.269
Iron Curtain and the Cold War, Tesla’s legacy was almost forgotten in the West.

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:35.479
His ashes and his personal effects, as well as thousands of historical exhibits and

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:41.029
photographs are all displayed in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, in Serbia.

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:46.729
Unfortunately, Western historians had limited access to important

00:22:46.739 --> 00:22:52.078
documentation and Tesla’s contribution to science was mostly overlooked.

00:22:53.118 --> 00:22:57.908
In recent years there has been a renewed interest in Nikola Tesla, with his

00:22:57.908 --> 00:23:03.708
inventions, predictions and life story portrayed in books and films, and of

00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:08.868
course his name being used for the most famous electric car company in the world.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:15.588
Streets around the world have been named in Nikola Tesla’s honour, with monuments erected not

00:23:15.628 --> 00:23:21.838
only in Croatia and Serbia, but also at Niagara Falls and his adopted hometown of New York.

00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:28.108
While he didn’t enjoy the recognition that he deserved towards the end of his life, it is

00:23:28.138 --> 00:23:33.568
perhaps fitting that he has risen again to prominence in the modern world, an electric world,

00:23:33.888 --> 00:23:40.268
one that might have been fundamentally different had it not been for the genius of Nikola Tesla.

00:23:42.428 --> 00:23:46.908
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Nikola Tesla.

00:23:47.228 --> 00:23:50.008
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned some new

00:23:50.008 --> 00:23:54.548
things about possibly one of the most underrated scientific geniuses.

00:23:55.078 --> 00:23:58.248
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:58.708 --> 00:24:02.178
Why do you think Tesla missed out on fame and fortune?

00:24:02.578 --> 00:24:03.908
Was he taken advantage of?

00:24:04.638 --> 00:24:07.278
Who is the 21st century Nikola Tesla?

00:24:07.738 --> 00:24:11.588
Or is that a bit of a silly question, as our Tesla is

00:24:11.588 --> 00:24:15.148
someone who will only be known years after his or her death?

00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:20.098
I would love to get your perspective, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:24:20.618 --> 00:24:21.268

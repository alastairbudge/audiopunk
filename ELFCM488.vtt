Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.460
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.520
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.770
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.640
talking about the story of a man called John Stonehouse.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.620
He was a charismatic British politician, once even tipped to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.050
be Prime Minister, who made a series of very bad decisions.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.609
I won’t give too much away, but this is a story that involves politics,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.250
the cold war, sexual affairs, secrets, spies, a beach in Miami and more.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.130
OK then, the story of John Stonehouse.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.760
In the winter of 1974, Britain was a nation grappling with uncertainty and upheaval.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.180
It was a time of economic strife and political instability,

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:09.780
which saw two general elections in the same year.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:15.090
Labour’s Harold Wilson had managed to secure a tenuous grip

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.930
on power in October, following a hung parliament in February.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:26.370
The spectre of industrial action loomed large, with miners’ strikes crippling the nation and

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:32.500
leading to the implementation of the three-day working week in an attempt to conserve electricity.

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:40.354
Amidst this backdrop of turmoil, two high-profile disappearances

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.120
captured the public’s imagination and dominated newspaper headlines.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:52.939
The first was one you may remember from episode number 354, or indeed from

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.715
a recent interview I did on Luke’s English Podcast, that of Lord Lucan.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.889
He was the aristocratic gambler who vanished in November 1974

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:08.873
following the brutal murder of his children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.370
Lucan’s car was found abandoned, spattered with blood,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.370
but the man himself seemed to have vanished into thin air.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.040
Just 12 days later, in November 1974, the nation was stunned once more when

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.130
John Stonehouse, a former Labour minister and MP, mysteriously disappeared.

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:40.670
Stonehouse was presumed drowned, or even eaten by sharks,

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:44.749
after his clothes were found neatly folded on a Miami beach.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.290
Both men had disappeared into thin air.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.790
Had they died at sea in tragic accidents, had they

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.489
killed themselves out of shame of what they had done?

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.940
Or was there another explanation?

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:06.650
The case of John Stonehouse seemed to be more clear cut, more obvious, and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.660
indeed he was declared dead, and his obituary was published in the newspapers.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.710
The case of Lord Lucan was less so, and he was the chief suspect in a brutal murder.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.000
Police around the world were told to keep a look out for a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.510
tall, handsome British man with a smooth, polished accent.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.139
He might have changed appearance, he might have even changed

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.680
name, and he would probably be behaving in an unusual way.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.189
On the other side of the world, in Melbourne Australia, in

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.500
December of 1974, a bank clerk did notice something a little odd.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.330
A tall and handsome British man had come into the bank one day and made a

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.400
large withdrawal, only to stroll across the street and go into another bank.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.849
The man had given his name as Clive Mildoon, and he seemed to have all of the required documents.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.000
But something seemed off, something just didn’t feel right.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.820
She asked around and heard from an associate working in the other bank

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:24.349
that the tall Englishman had given his name as “Joseph Markham”, not

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.039
Clive Mildoon, but again he seemed to have all of the required documents.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.839
The teller had read about the murdered nanny and the fugitive British aristocrat,

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:41.210
and suspected “Clive Mildoon” and “Joseph Markham” were in fact Lord Lucan.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.019
She called the police, and several days later the tall,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.439
handsome man was tracked down and stopped by the police.

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.820
The Australians had contacted their British counterparts before making the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.560
arrest, to ask how they could confirm whether it was indeed Lord Lucan.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.200
There was a way, they had been told.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.229
Ask him to pull down his trousers, the British police instructed them.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.430
Lucan had a large scar, 30 centimetres long, on his right thigh.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.340
Nobody could cover that up.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.510
Find the scar and you’ve found Lucan.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.850
So the Australian police politely asked this man, Clive Mildoon, to pull down his trousers.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.849
To their surprise, there was no scar.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.830
The man was not Lord Lucan, but if he wasn’t the disappeared suspected murderer, who was he?

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.239
It was only after they consulted photographs of the other

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.610
high-profile disappearance that year that they made the connection.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.130
Clive Mildoon was the spitting image, he was an exact match, for John Stonehouse, the Labour

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.530
politician who had either drowned or been eaten by sharks off the coast of Miami a month prior.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.790
Upon further questioning, Clive Mildoon cracked.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.660
Or rather, John Stonehouse admitted that there was no Mildoon.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.179
He had faked his own death and had been living in Australia under a fake name.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.419
He was brought back to Britain, bizarrely was allowed to continue as a

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.960
member of parliament before being sent to prison a year and a half later.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.420
And to think, this was a man who many had tipped to become the British Prime Minister.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.820
According to his university classmates, he had had

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.150
his eyes set on the top job since he was a young man.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.400
He came from a politically active family - his father was a trade union leader

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.069
and his mother was the mayor of Southampton, a city on the south coast of England.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.020
John Stonehouse had strong political beliefs from a young

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.109
age, and joined the British Labour party at the age of 16.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.099
After a stint in Uganda, where he worked with co-operative businesses, he entered the world

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:17.205
of politics, and successfully won a seat as an MP, a member of parliament, at the age of 32.

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:21.950
He was charismatic, decisive, and principled.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.890
People hung on his every word, and soon he found that people clung to him, believing that

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.679
this was not just a future leader of the Labour party, but a future British Prime Minister.

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:41.900
His political rise was not stellar, but he was rewarded with increasing responsibility.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.660
He became the Minister of State for Technology and then something called the

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.210
“Postmaster General”, which was a political role related to the post office.

00:07:52.469 --> 00:08:00.370
When the Labour party then lost the election in 1970 his ministerial career was over, but he

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.280
remained a member of parliament, representing the constituency of Wednesbury, in north Birmingham.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.930
He also had a busy life outside of politics.

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:15.330
He had got involved in numerous business interests, even attempting

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.230
to start his own bank and profit from London’s property boom.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:26.239
He was well-known around London for his snappy style, being well-dressed, good looking

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:31.739
and stylish, and he had all of the trimmings of a wealthy and successful businessman.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:39.260
But a combination of bad luck and poor judgement had meant that several of these businesses

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:46.350
were heavily in debt, and Stonehouse owed today’s equivalent of millions of pounds.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.650
He might have looked the part, but his finances were a mess.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.829
On a personal level, he had also made some bad decisions.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.900
He had been married since 1948, since he was 23.

00:09:02.369 --> 00:09:05.970
His wife had stood by him while he pursued his political

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.420
ambitions, and the pair had two daughters together.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.160
But some time in the late 1960s he had started an

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.929
affair with his secretary, a woman 21 years his junior.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:25.930
His wife had discovered the affair, was understandably furious, and had threatened to leave him.

00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:31.299
So, he was in deep financial trouble, his marriage was in tatters,

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:36.739
and he was having a now open affair with his secretary, who he had

00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:41.020
refused to leave even after his wife had discovered the affair.

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:48.550
His political ambitions had also been scuppered, they were over, because the then Labour leader,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.689
Harold Wilson, had decided that Stonehouse was “corruptible”, that he could be corrupted.

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:01.150
And it is here that we must go into some controversial territory.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:09.010
It would later be alleged that Stonehouse had been spying for Czechoslovakia since the late 1960s.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.759
He had been passing the Czechs information about British technology, he had

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:17.499
been asking questions in parliament that his Czech handlers had passed him,

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:23.389
he was a full-on spy, although it was never agreed how effective a spy he was.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:30.719
He had, reportedly, been targeted right at the start of his political career because the

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:36.760
Czechoslovakian intelligence agency had thought that this was a man who was “on the up”, someone

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.079
who could in theory ascend right to the top of British politics, becoming Prime Minister.

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:49.479
If they got him young, then by the time he was at the top he would be an invaluable asset.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:57.030
He had, again reportedly, been compromised because Czechoslovakian intelligence agents had taken

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:02.599
photographs of him in bed with another woman, and had threatened to show these to his wife.

00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:06.999
What’s more, they had paid him handsomely, which

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.129
partially helped explain his unusually lavish lifestyle.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:16.729
Now, I should add that he always denied this, and his

00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:20.433
daughter vehemently denied it in a book from 2021.

00:11:20.749 --> 00:11:25.660
He was no spy, she says, he was a “rabid anti-communist”, and

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.130
the claims that he was one come from his political enemies.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.079
Unfortunately for Stonehouse, and for his daughter, there is some

00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:38.579
evidence to suggest that he was passing secrets to the Czechs.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.869
There is a photograph of him strolling around London with a well-known Czech spy, and

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:51.010
there is the testimony of a high-ranking Czech spy, who had no discernible motive to lie.

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:59.609
Anyway, spy or no spy, John Stonehouse was in a bit of a pickle by 1974.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:05.959
He was drowning in debt, and was at risk of having to declare personal bankruptcy.

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:12.949
And the UK isn’t quite as forgiving as countries like the United States when it comes to bankruptcy.

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:17.589
If you declare bankruptcy in the UK there are several things you

00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:22.439
cannot do, including stand as an MP, as a member of parliament.

00:12:23.369 --> 00:12:28.259
So this was the backdrop to the “disappearance” of John Stonehouse.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.969
He was on holiday in Miami in November of 1974.

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:37.450
He had had lunch with a business associate, and the pair had arranged

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:41.249
to meet in the bar later that evening for a drink before dinner.

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:46.119
Stonehouse had told his friend that he was going to go for a quick

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:50.289
swim, and then perhaps do a bit of shopping for his wife and kids.

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:56.979
Afternoon turned to evening and his friend sat waiting in the bar.

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:59.980
But there was no sign of Stonehouse.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.909
His friend asked around, and the last anyone had seen

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:09.939
of him was at about 4pm, at the hotel’s private beach.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.689
Stonehouse was in his swimming trunks, he had handed his clothes

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:18.729
to an attendant, and waded out into the crystal clear water.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:25.380
And that was the last anyone had seen of him, until he was apprehended

00:13:25.569 --> 00:13:29.939
on the other side of the world, in Melbourne, just over a month later.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.560
It’s now believed that he swam a little out into the water and then swam along

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.310
the shore to the beach of another hotel, retrieved his “getaway kit”, which he

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:48.319
had stashed earlier, and then made a beeline for, he rushed to, Miami airport.

00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:54.089
He had a series of fake identities which he had created from recently deceased

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.980
members of his constituency, so he was able to get onto flights undetected.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:06.029
And when he was finally apprehended in Australia, he insisted that he'd done nothing wrong.

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:12.729
He said that he had been suffering a psychotic “episode” in which he was trying to escape

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:19.619
the problems at home and that he had tried to commit “psychiatric suicide”, killing the

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:25.600
identity of John Stonehouse and resurrecting himself with a completely new identity.

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:29.640
Few people bought this excuse.

00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:35.310
After some tense diplomatic negotiations, he was eventually extradited

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:41.000
to Britain in July of 1975, 8 months after he was found in Melbourne.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.709
And there was this utterly bizarre situation in which he was both on trial for the

00:14:47.729 --> 00:14:55.459
crime of conspiracy, fraud and theft AND acting as an MP, a member of parliament.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.410
Under normal circumstances, the Labour party would have most likely dismissed him

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:08.780
immediately, but they had a very small majority in parliament, a majority of only three MPs.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:15.259
It was a very tense situation, and although he might have committed a serious crime,

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:20.800
they couldn’t risk losing him as an MP otherwise they risked losing political power.

00:15:22.229 --> 00:15:27.550
Stonehouse clearly thought he was going to get away with it, and he even proudly announced

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:32.050
at his criminal trial that he didn’t need to be represented by a professional lawyer.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.559
Despite having no legal training, he was going to represent himself.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.400
It didn’t work.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.249
He was found guilty and sent to prison.

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:47.000
And this had knock-on consequences for British politics.

00:15:47.349 --> 00:15:54.569
It meant that he had to resign as an MP, Labour lost its majority and had to form a coalition

00:15:54.719 --> 00:16:01.040
with the Liberals, which–some argue–cleared the path for Margaret Thatcher’s route to power.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.650
He ended up serving just three years in prison, and was

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.900
released early because of good behaviour and health problems.

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:17.549
He died in 1988 at the age of 62, and to his last breath he insisted that

00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:22.380
he had done nothing wrong, and that he certainly had not been a Czech spy.

00:16:23.359 --> 00:16:28.359
Whether this is true or not, I cannot tell you, but what is undoubtedly true

00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:33.300
is that this is the story of a man who could have had it all, perhaps would

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:38.240
have had it all, but managed to blow it in the most spectacular fashion.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:45.000
He said he'd been overwhelmed and had created a parallel personality for himself.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.550
It certainly seems that he had lost all grip on reality.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:56.270
He assumed that he could keep both his marriage and his lover, that he could start a new life for

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:03.310
himself unnoticed, that he could simply “kill” John Stonehouse and re-emerge as Clive Mildoon.

00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:07.730
Perhaps the greatest example of his losing all grip on

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.985
reality was that he thought he would get away with it.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.119
OK then, that is it for today's episode on John Stonehouse,

00:17:17.389 --> 00:17:20.310
the potential future prime minister who faked his own death.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.839
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.059
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.849
Are there similar stories of politicians getting into

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:32.650
trouble and resorting to desperate measures in your country?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.970

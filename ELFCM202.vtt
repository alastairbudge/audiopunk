It is so dishonest.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.595
It is so fake.

00:00:04.595 --> 00:00:06.555
You know, I've really started this whole fake news thing.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:07.515
Now they've turned it around.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.025
And then now they're calling, you know, stories put out by diff- by Facebook,

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:17.175
fake and they're fake, what could be more fake than CBS and NBC and ABC and CNN.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:27.082
Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:32.032
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:36.572
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:43.907
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The History of Fake News.

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:49.077
For most people, the first person you will think about when you hear the

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:54.077
words “fake news” will be the man whose voice you heard at the start of

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:58.257
the episode, the former president of the United States, Donald Trump.

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:05.557
But while he might have popularised, and even weaponised, the term, as

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:10.617
we will discover the concept goes back a lot further than Donald Trump.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:16.787
So, in this episode we are going to explore the weird, interesting, and

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:22.967
dangerous world of Fake News, what “Fake News” actually means, who is creating

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:28.387
these fake news stories, and for what reason, and we'll see that for as long

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:34.777
as people have spread real news they've understood the power of fake news.

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:39.254
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:48.674
The term Fake News really came into the public eye in late 2016, after the US election.

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:53.487
There were 20 times more Google searches for the phrase

00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:58.147
“fake news” in February 2017 than a year beforehand.

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:05.117
The Collins Dictionary made “fake news” its word of the year for 2017.

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:12.807
In 2016, Oxford Dictionaries had selected “post-truth” as its word of the year.

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:19.857
There seemed to be an assault, an attack on the authenticity of the media.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:27.744
Its posterboy, the person most famous for it, might have been Donald Trump, but he has been

00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:33.694
followed by leaders from all over the world in attacking the truthfulness of the media.

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:39.774
From the US to Brazil, Hungary to the Philippines, political leaders have

00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:46.194
attacked the media for publishing what they claim to be fake, untrue, stories.

00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:50.434
And it’s not, of course, just authoritarian leaders.

00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:59.054
Politicians in almost every country in the world have seen how effective labelling a story as “fake”

00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:07.194
can be, and this tactic has been deployed to cast doubt over the authenticity of news stories.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:13.674
So, were these politicians bravely pointing out something that no politician had been

00:03:13.674 --> 00:03:20.494
brave enough to do, was the news really becoming more fake, or is the news not fake at all?

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:28.224
Well, in many cases, as we both know, the news stories are not fake, the stories just do

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:34.544
not reflect well on the political leader, and simply claiming that they are not true is,

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:40.954
unfortunately, an effective tactic to distract attention from reality, from the truth.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:45.084
But in other cases, the stories are fake.

00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:46.274
They are not true.

00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:47.284
They are lies.

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:54.414
And these stories, the “real” fake news, will be the centre of today’s episode.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:59.364
So what do we actually mean by “fake news”?

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:04.624
It is a term that has come under some criticism because it is

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:09.724
broad, and can be interpreted to mean a wide range of ideas.

00:04:10.694 --> 00:04:15.594
It can refer to misinformation, which is information that is

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:20.174
simply incorrect, but might not be intended to cause harm.

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:25.534
It can also refer to disinformation, information that

00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:30.354
is false and intended to mislead people and cause harm.

00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:35.904
And it can be misinformation that turns into disinformation.

00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:41.234
So, who is creating “fake news”, and for what purpose?

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:48.224
Let’s dive first into the why, then the who, and we will see that these reasons,

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:54.764
these incentives to create fake news, have been around since the dawn of time.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:59.774
The reasons for creating fake news are essentially

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:03.704
threefold, they can be put into three broad categories.

00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:07.034
Firstly, for political gain.

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:11.734
You want people to believe certain things, which will influence

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:16.714
their opinion on a subject, and they will vote or behave differently.

00:05:17.824 --> 00:05:19.834
Secondly, for money.

00:05:20.204 --> 00:05:25.599
You want to make money, and making fake news is an effective way of doing so.

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.119
And thirdly, to disrupt society.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:35.779
You get some sort of joy, satisfaction, or political benefit from

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:40.819
causing chaos, making people believe things that are not true, and

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.312
making it harder for people to distinguish between truth and falsehoods.

00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:52.822
With our first reason, for political gain, this is as old as time.

00:05:53.322 --> 00:05:58.102
Going back all the way to 33BC in Ancient Rome, there

00:05:58.102 --> 00:06:02.292
was a power struggle between Octavian and Mark Anthony.

00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:06.562
After Julius Caesar’s death, both wanted power.

00:06:07.642 --> 00:06:12.472
Mark Anthony was away in Egypt, while Octavian was in Rome.

00:06:13.522 --> 00:06:20.042
To win power, Octavian knew that he needed to have the public on his side, and

00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:26.252
he put out a vicious propaganda campaign portraying Mark Anthony as a drunk

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:32.042
womaniser who had been corrupted by his affair with Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen.

00:06:32.972 --> 00:06:37.908
He was having an affair with Cleopatra, they had even had three children

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:43.808
together, but a lot of what was written about Mark Anthony simply wasn’t true.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:52.408
Octavian had arranged for coins to be made with slogans about Mark Anthony’s behaviour, and the

00:06:52.408 --> 00:07:00.965
news spread throughout Rome about his bad behaviour, and unsuitability for the position of Caesar.

00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:09.355
Public opinion turned against Mark Anthony, Rome declared war against Cleopatra, and after

00:07:09.355 --> 00:07:15.635
Mark Anthony and Cleopatra’s suicide Octavian became emperor, becoming Augustus Caesar.

00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:20.585
So, there is Octavian, over two thousand years ago,

00:07:20.905 --> 00:07:24.665
understanding the power of fake news for political gain.

00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:31.355
And ever since, fake stories have been used for political gain, often

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:36.865
with far more tragic consequences than one man failing to become emperor.

00:07:38.095 --> 00:07:45.845
On Easter Sunday in 1475, in Trento, in modern-day Italy, a young boy went missing.

00:07:46.915 --> 00:07:51.835
A priest told his congregation that he believed the boy had been

00:07:51.835 --> 00:07:57.335
killed by Jews, who had drunk the boy’s blood to celebrate Passover.

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:01.875
Before long someone else claimed that the boy’s body

00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:05.205
had been found in the basement of a Jewish house.

00:08:06.045 --> 00:08:11.195
The entire Jewish community of Trento was arrested and tortured.

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:18.505
15 of them were burnt at the stake, publicly burned in front of the town’s residents.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:23.565
Even though the story was recognised as completely false,

00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:27.775
it simply didn’t happen, the news was spreading fast.

00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:34.225
The Gutenberg printing press had been invented in 1440, and it was easier

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:39.265
and cheaper than ever before to print pamphlets containing simple text.

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:46.555
The papacy had tried to get involved to stop the rumours, but it was too late.

00:08:47.515 --> 00:08:54.305
The story tapped into pre-existing anti-semitic feelings, anti-Jewish sentiment, and

00:08:54.525 --> 00:09:00.745
even though it was proved to be fake, it almost didn’t matter - the damage was done.

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.555
People believed what they wanted to believe.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:11.435
And indeed, to this day there are still some anti-Semitic websites that claim this story is true.

00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:18.865
Now, while we don’t know for sure the motivations of the priest who started these rumours,

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:25.035
it is probable that he did so for a combination of anti-semitic and political reasons.

00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:31.705
And this was, of course, not the first, the last, or the most tragic time

00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:36.415
the Jewish community has been targeted by fake news for political gain.

00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:44.045
No greater example of this exists than during the rise of the Nazis, and the successful

00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:50.435
portrayal of the Jewish community as being responsible for a large part of Germany’s problems.

00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:58.035
Stories were printed by the Nazi propaganda machine portraying Jews as an obstacle in

00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:05.245
the way of a united Arian population, and at the same time stories were suppressed, they

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:10.805
were hidden, about the atrocities that were being committed as part of the Holocaust.

00:10:11.535 --> 00:10:17.215
It’s hard to find a group in recent history that better understood the power

00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:22.945
of manipulating the media, and with more tragic consequences, than the Nazis.

00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:29.015
But there are other examples of politicians and countries using fake

00:10:29.015 --> 00:10:34.365
news for political gain that we look back on with a certain acceptance.

00:10:35.195 --> 00:10:40.065
In 1917, during World War I, the British government

00:10:40.255 --> 00:10:43.895
gave one particular fake news story to the press.

00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:49.665
The story claimed that Germans were using the bodies of dead British

00:10:49.675 --> 00:10:54.955
soldiers to make soap and margarine - a butter-like substance.

00:10:55.775 --> 00:10:59.555
The story was completely false, but was published

00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:03.115
by newspapers such as The Times and The Daily Mail.

00:11:03.675 --> 00:11:08.815
It was intended to build support for the ongoing war effort by

00:11:08.985 --> 00:11:13.815
portraying the German enemy as completely barbaric and inhumane.

00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:19.815
So, fake news for political gain is as old as time, it just so

00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:24.680
happens that in the 21st century it is easier than ever to spread it.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.160
We’ll explore this further in a minute, but let’s first

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.990
look at the second motivation for fake news: to make money.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.210
This too has been a motivation for fake news since the dawn of “news”.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.650
This is not the time or the place to fully explore how news has changed

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.820
through the ages, but the purpose of news has not always been simply to inform.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:58.920
Before the invention of the printing press in 1440, there was a very different concept of “news”.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:06.670
In Europe, you might hear information at a church service from a priest, or there would be a town

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:13.270
crier, someone who would stand in a square and read out official information in a loud voice.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:19.720
A little bit of slightly pointless but quite interesting vocabulary is that the way

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:26.660
a town crier would announce their presence in English is by saying “Hear Ye - Oyez,

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:32.820
Oyez, Oyez”, “Oyez” actually derives from the old Norman word for “to listen”.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.780
As literacy rates started to increase, and it was cheaper to print information

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:45.030
on pamphlets, information was increasingly shared in written form, but there was

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.960
not the same concept of “objective” journalism, of simply reporting the facts.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.950
The purpose of news was often to entertain and amuse, not simply to inform.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.520
By the early 19th century, newspapers were printing

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.910
increasingly fake stories to try to sell more copies.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:16.470
In 1835, for example, The New York Sun published a story over six days reporting that

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:22.370
a famous astronomer had looked through his telescope and discovered life on the moon.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.890
The article described the animals he had seen through the telescope,

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.820
and included detailed pictures of this society on the moon.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.860
It did wonders for newspaper sales, it sold a lot of copies.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.360
Of course, it was completely fake, completely invented, and - as an

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.760
indication of how unimportant the newspaper thought this was - the

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.170
newspaper never actually printed an apology admitting it was fake.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.450
Fast forward almost 200 years, and although the technology

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.510
has changed, the desire to make money from fake news hasn’t.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:10.140
For example, in the run up to the 2016 US election there was a headline with the title

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:16.320
“Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for President, releases statement”.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.150
This was completely untrue, it was completely fake, and had been

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.280
created by a group of teenagers in Macedonia, in Eastern Europe.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.880
They weren’t interested in getting Donald Trump elected.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.760
They couldn’t care less who was in the White House.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.930
They simply wanted to attract people to their website,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.900
which had advertising, which would make them money.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.060
The Pope Francis article wasn’t the only one.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:52.350
They would pump out dozens of articles that they knew would trigger people’s reactions,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:15:00.000
especially Trump supporters, they would then post them in pro-Trump Facebook groups, there

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.430
would be thousands of comments on the posts, which would mean Facebook’s algorithms would show

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:10.740
them to more people, it would be shared, millions of Americans would click on the link and

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:16.590
go to the website, and the teenagers would make tens of thousands of dollars in advertising.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.350
Now, this is an extreme example, because it was a

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.100
completely fake article, a story that had no basis in truth.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:32.940
Even more reputable news organisations are guilty of writing sensational headlines and

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.970
stories because they know that they will get clicks, and resonate with a certain demographic.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:45.100
The Guardian, for example, a left-leaning newspaper in the UK constantly

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.510
publishes articles on Amazon and its tax payments, mentioning only certain

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.810
types of taxes that Amazon pays, and always forgetting to mention other types of

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.850
taxes that it pays, because it knows that this will resonate with its audience.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:07.180
On the other end of the political spectrum, the right-leaning UK newspaper The

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.660
Daily Telegraph is full of negative articles about the European Union or Joe Biden,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:19.310
again not always mentioning the full truth about the subjects of its articles,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.880
because it too is a business that makes money from advertising and newspaper sales.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.180
I’m sure you can think of similar examples from your country.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.030
And our third, debatably most dangerous motivation for

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.760
creating fake news is to cause trouble and confusion.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.630
You will, no doubt be familiar with the Russian troll farms pumping out

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:50.600
fake news articles to try to influence the 2016 and 2020 US elections.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.580
Whether or not they did influence them is another

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.770
question, but it seems pretty clear that they tried.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.810
Part of this was no doubt for political reasons, but it was also

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:08.270
to cause chaos and increase distrust in American institutions.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.640
It seems to have worked.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:17.337
Trust in the media is at an all-time low in America, with only 46%

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.440
of Americans saying that they trust the media to tell them the truth.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.980
Naturally, this decline can’t completely be attributed to the

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:31.280
spread of fake news, but it certainly has not helped the situation.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.210
So, what is the future of fake news?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.560
Is it poised to become more and more of a problem, or have

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.250
we learned how to spot the difference between true and false?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.370
Certainly there are some new technological developments that will make

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.880
it harder than ever to spot the difference between truth and falsehood.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.940
For example, deep fakes, faked videos or audio clips that are made to

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.620
look and sound like someone, but are completely computer generated.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.150
You might have heard this one of Barack Obama:

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.610
we're entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:16.930
saying anything at any point in time, even if they would never say those things.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.040
How about this?

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.750
Simply president Trump is a total and complete dipshit.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.040
Now, you see, I would never say these things, at

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.400
least not in a public address, but someone else would.

00:18:31.804 --> 00:18:32.624
Creepy, right?

00:18:33.274 --> 00:18:37.744
You might think, well, I guess you need to have a large studio and hundreds

00:18:37.744 --> 00:18:41.414
of thousands of dollars of equipment to create something like that.

00:18:42.264 --> 00:18:42.794
You don’t.

00:18:43.174 --> 00:18:44.114
Just listen to this.

00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:46.515
This isn't actually me.

00:18:46.718 --> 00:18:47.948
This voice isn't real.

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:49.367
I didn't record this.

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:53.107
Ok, I’m back again, this is actually me.

00:18:53.427 --> 00:18:55.007
Can you tell that was fake?

00:18:55.837 --> 00:19:01.407
Maybe you could, but the point is that I was able to do it pretty easily,

00:19:01.657 --> 00:19:05.867
only from clips of my voice, which is freely available on the Internet.

00:19:06.617 --> 00:19:08.887
And it did sound a lot like me.

00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:13.219
So figuring out the difference between what is real

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:16.699
and what is fake is becoming harder than ever before.

00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:22.629
And it isn’t just technology like deep fakes that make Fake News harder to fight.

00:19:23.689 --> 00:19:28.769
The fact that half the world’s population has a smartphone means that anyone,

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:34.759
anywhere can start a rumour, they can spread information that can reach millions

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:40.399
of people in an instant means this means that these fake news stories can be

00:19:40.499 --> 00:19:45.549
read or watched by hundreds of millions of people before they are taken down.

00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:52.069
And even when they are removed, or proved to be false, as in the case of the Jewish

00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:57.629
community in Trento which was accused of killing a young boy, the damage is often done.

00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:01.289
So, what can be done to solve this?

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:05.809
Governments, as you will no doubt have seen in the news, are increasingly putting pressure

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:13.089
on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to stop the spread of fake news stories.

00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:19.009
Their response has typically been that they are a platform, not a media company.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:24.009
They also point out that there is not just one type of “fake news”,

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:29.639
and figuring out what is fake and what is not is a difficult task.

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:31.389
They are right.

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:37.479
This is not to say that they shouldn’t even try, but distinguishing between what is

00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:44.719
true and what is false is not easy, and the line is rarely as clear as the story about

00:20:44.719 --> 00:20:49.399
finding civilization on the moon or the Pope endorsing Donald Trump for president.

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:54.079
So, to summarise, fake news is nothing new.

00:20:54.639 --> 00:21:01.869
Since the dawn of time people have understood the power of lies to deceive people and acquire power.

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:07.969
It started out with whispers in the Roman Forum, the Gutenberg Printing

00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:14.179
Press made spreading it easier still, TV and radio made it even easier, and

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:19.119
social media and communication apps have made it easier than ever before.

00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:26.039
So, while the man most commonly associated with the term Fake News might

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:30.829
be long gone from The White House, as we’ve heard today, Fake News is

00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:36.679
nothing new, and the line between fact and fiction is more blurry than ever.

00:21:38.879 --> 00:21:43.829
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The History of Fake News.

00:21:44.229 --> 00:21:47.888
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:48.588 --> 00:21:54.578
A final point, which I think is quite an amusing one, is that Donald Trump wasn’t

00:21:54.638 --> 00:22:00.438
even the first US presidential candidate in 2016 to use the term Fake News.

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:04.338
It was Hillary Clinton, who used it on 8 December

00:22:04.338 --> 00:22:08.768
2016, a full month before Donald Trump first used it.

00:22:09.698 --> 00:22:15.768
So, Trump’s claim to have invented the term fake news is, itself, fake news.

00:22:16.528 --> 00:22:20.188

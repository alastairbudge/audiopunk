Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:16.495
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:20.805
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:26.705
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about American politics.

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:33.555
On November 5th, as anyone who has not recently emerged from a self-imposed period of

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:40.605
isolation in a cave will know, the United States voted to re-elect Donald Trump as President.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.455
But we aren’t going to be talking about that, or at least

00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:48.325
the US election isn’t going to be the focus of this episode.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:54.555
Instead, we are going to talk about the role of the vice president of the United States.

00:00:55.135 --> 00:01:01.325
We’ll look at what the Vice President actually does, how the role has evolved over time, and

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:07.245
why this vice president might just be one of the most influential ones in American history.

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:12.835
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk about Vice Presidents.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:20.725
In the hit political drama, House of Cards, the Machiavellian

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:25.755
protagonist, Frank Underwood, hatches a plot to become President.

00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:31.515
Through a mixture of political manipulation, blackmail,

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:35.785
and dealmaking, he manages to become Vice President.

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:41.172
He uses this as a position to weaken the sitting president,

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:45.235
his boss, and then claim the top job for himself.

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:51.795
He seems to be on top of the world but makes a fatal miscalculation

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:57.395
by choosing as his Vice President his equally ruthless wife.

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:02.365
I won’t ruin any more of the story for those of you who have never watched

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:08.255
it, but all I will say is that while the vice presidency seems to Frank

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:14.065
to be a supporting, semi-powerless role, it proves to be anything but.

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:19.335
If you haven’t ever watched House of Cards, I would highly recommend it.

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:27.845
Of course, it is fictional, so dramatic it seems hard to believe at times, but it is not

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:34.875
unrealistic in its depiction of the route from Vice President to President of the United States.

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:42.805
To be precise, out of the 46 individuals who have held the role of President of the United States,

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:51.445
15 of them–1 in 3–were previously Vice Presidents, or VPs, as they are more commonly known.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:58.355
And now is a particularly interesting time to talk about the Vice President.

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:05.665
Last month, the sitting Vice President Kamala Harris lost her bid to succeed Joe

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:12.585
Biden and become the 16th person to transition from Vice President to the Oval Office.

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:17.685
Even the fact that she ran for president was a matter of contest.

00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:23.925
Her president, Joe Biden–himself a former Vice President–had pulled out of

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:29.885
the race over questions about his age and mental agility, and there were

00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:34.135
commentators who complained that she had become the Democratic presidential

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:40.105
nominee almost by default, that there hadn’t been a proper leadership contest.

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:46.400
And, on the Republican side, it is an interesting time to talk about the role of the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.914
Vice President because when Donald Trump is inaugurated, on January 20th 2025, he will

00:03:53.914 --> 00:04:01.724
be 78 years and 220 days old, half a year older than Joe Biden was at his inauguration.

00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:09.504
Assuming that he finishes his four-year term, he will be almost 83 years old.

00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:14.104
No matter your opinion about Donald Trump, his politics and his character,

00:04:14.524 --> 00:04:19.644
there is no denying that this makes him an old man, and makes the choice of who

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:24.814
would replace him, were he unable to complete his term, all the more important.

00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:31.875
As you will know, there have been several presidents who have died in office, 8 to be precise.

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:36.895
Of these 8 presidents who died in office, all of them

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:40.755
were at least 10 years younger than Donald Trump.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.146
And yes, you might point out that of those 8 who died in office,

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.596
half were assassinated, so it has nothing to do with age.

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:53.386
But the counterpoint to this is that there have been at least two

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:57.336
assassination attempts on Donald Trump in the past year alone.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:03.486
So there are a few factors meaning that there is an even greater reason to

00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:08.286
pay attention to the person who is “a heartbeat away” from the Presidency.

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:12.986
This is, of course, the main role of the Vice President.

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:19.664
In the event of the President’s death, the Vice President automatically becomes President.

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:24.185
No debate, no election, the Vice President becomes President

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:27.395
for the remainder of the President’s term in office.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:33.495
But let’s assume that Donald Trump does serve out his term in office.

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:39.295
He cannot run for President again; the 22nd Amendment, which states that a

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:43.805
President can serve a maximum of two terms, prevents this from happening.

00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:51.315
And before there are murmurs about how this Amendment could be overturned, and Donald Trump’s

00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:56.752
throwaway comments about running for a third term, it would be immensely difficult for this to

00:05:56.752 --> 00:06:03.712
happen, and to my knowledge, no serious commentator has ever entertained this as a possibility.

00:06:04.642 --> 00:06:11.612
Donald Trump will not be able to run for President in 2028, and this will be his last term.

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:17.844
And the betting markets already have a clear favourite for who will be

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:23.644
the next President; JD Vance, Trump’s VP, his pick for Vice President.

00:06:25.212 --> 00:06:31.454
As of last week, so months before he will assume the Vice Presidency, betting sites

00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:38.444
are suggesting that JD Vance has a 40% chance of being elected President in 2028.

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:46.284
He is young, charismatic, the natural successor to Donald Trump, and he has the next four years to

00:06:46.304 --> 00:06:52.584
appeal to the American public and demonstrate his abilities in a way that Kamala Harris did not.

00:06:53.344 --> 00:06:56.494
That’s the reason to talk about the Vice Presidency today.

00:06:56.854 --> 00:07:00.234
It is, potentially, more important than ever before.

00:07:01.194 --> 00:07:05.694
So, what does the Vice President actually do, other than assume

00:07:05.694 --> 00:07:09.424
the duties of the President if they die or are incapacitated?

00:07:10.144 --> 00:07:14.574
Well, it’s a bit of a cop-out answer, but it really depends.

00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:21.824
The Vice Presidency is a strange sort of role – one that can be incredibly powerful, or

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:26.984
practically irrelevant, depending on the President and the political landscape at the time.

00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:31.695
In theory, it’s an essential part of American democracy,

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:35.145
a safeguard to ensure continuity of government.

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:39.235
In practice, though, it’s a position that’s evolved

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:42.945
in fascinating and, sometimes, contradictory ways.

00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:49.376
When the role of Vice President was first created, it was almost an afterthought.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.766
Originally, the Vice President wasn’t chosen by the

00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:57.406
President or running as part of a team, as they are today.

00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:02.226
Instead, the candidate who came second in the

00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:06.176
Presidential election automatically became Vice President.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.839
This often meant that the President and Vice President

00:08:11.044 --> 00:08:14.614
could be political opponents with very different ideas.

00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:22.458
Imagine, for example, Donald Trump having Kamala Harris as his Vice President—or vice versa.

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:29.298
Not surprisingly, the Founding Fathers didn’t envision the Vice President as a powerful figure.

00:08:30.028 --> 00:08:35.028
Since the role went to the runner-up, it wasn’t intended to hold much influence.

00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:40.758
To reduce the chances of two rivals ending up in office together, the

00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:46.138
process was changed 25 years later with the 12th Amendment in 1804.

00:08:47.537 --> 00:08:51.017
This amendment established that people would vote for the

00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:55.917
President and Vice President as a pair, much like they do today.

00:08:57.047 --> 00:09:01.577
Since then, the Presidential candidate has chosen a running mate who might

00:09:01.617 --> 00:09:06.637
appeal to a particular segment of the population—maybe younger voters,

00:09:06.717 --> 00:09:12.527
women, people from specific backgrounds, or voters in key electoral states.

00:09:13.877 --> 00:09:17.287
But what does the Vice President actually do?

00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:20.317
Constitutionally, what is their role?

00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:28.517
Well, partly as a hangover from when the role was created, there are only two mandated functions.

00:09:29.157 --> 00:09:34.728
If there was a job description, it would only have two “must do” items on it.

00:09:35.407 --> 00:09:39.507
The first is, as we’ve said, to act as a backup for the

00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:44.927
President, to step up if the President is incapacitated or dies.

00:09:46.117 --> 00:09:53.067
And the second is to preside over the Senate and cast a tie-breaking vote when needed.

00:09:54.564 --> 00:09:59.292
As a quick recap of how the American government works, there are three

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:04.735
branches: the Executive, which is the President, the House and the Senate.

00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:10.322
The Vice President has particular responsibility over the Senate,

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:14.812
in that they have the deciding vote in the event of a tie.

00:10:15.972 --> 00:10:22.662
The US has 50 states, each with two Senators, so there are 100 seats in total.

00:10:23.962 --> 00:10:29.492
If there is a vote on an issue and it is a tie, it is 50 votes for

00:10:29.702 --> 00:10:34.992
and 50 votes against, the VP casts their vote to decide the outcome.

00:10:36.142 --> 00:10:39.762
Perhaps it sounds unlikely, but it happens a lot.

00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:48.942
To date, there have been 301 times that a VP has been required to do this, and because the Senate

00:10:48.952 --> 00:10:56.634
was divided 50-50 after the 2020 Senate elections, Kamala Harris’s vote became incredibly important.

00:10:57.742 --> 00:11:04.992
As of the time of writing this, she has cast 33 tie-breaking votes, making her the most

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:10.672
influential VP in American history from a Senate legislation point of view at least.

00:11:11.794 --> 00:11:18.754
So, the VP is important when it comes to tie-breaking votes, but what else do they spend their

00:11:18.754 --> 00:11:24.284
days doing, when they don’t have to cast votes and the President’s heart is beating normally?

00:11:25.304 --> 00:11:30.604
Well, especially in the early days of the Vice Presidency, there was very little

00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:35.794
else, and certainly very little in the way of the day-to-day running of the country.

00:11:36.924 --> 00:11:41.858
This was famously summed up by the first Vice President, John Adams,

00:11:42.154 --> 00:11:46.494
who is reported to have said that the Vice Presidency was “the most

00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:50.624
insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived.”

00:11:51.914 --> 00:11:54.654
And, for quite a while, he was right.

00:11:55.494 --> 00:11:59.714
Vice Presidents, including Adams himself, were often kept at arm’s

00:11:59.714 --> 00:12:04.694
length by Presidents and largely excluded from major decision-making.

00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:10.678
It was seen as a job for those who'd either failed to win the presidency outright

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:15.681
or who needed to satisfy a particular political faction within the government.

00:12:17.691 --> 00:12:22.275
Fast forward a century or two, and things started to change.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:26.285
Throughout the 20th century, the Vice Presidency

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:30.595
gradually morphed into a position with real influence.

00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:33.315
Under Franklin D.

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:36.635
Roosevelt, for example, Vice President Harry S.

00:12:36.665 --> 00:12:42.255
Truman became deeply involved in wartime decision-making, a relationship that would prove

00:12:42.295 --> 00:12:49.065
crucial when Roosevelt’s sudden death thrust Truman into the role of Commander-in-Chief in 1945.

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:57.705
Then, in 1967, the 25th Amendment was ratified, clarifying what should happen if a

00:12:57.715 --> 00:13:03.535
President died or became incapacitated, and formally establishing the line of succession.

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:10.127
This amendment also allowed Presidents to fill the Vice Presidency if it

00:13:10.127 --> 00:13:15.277
became vacant, which added further importance to the role and established

00:13:15.277 --> 00:13:20.087
it as a clear second-in-command rather than just an afterthought.

00:13:21.097 --> 00:13:24.297
By the time we reach the late 20th century, we see

00:13:24.297 --> 00:13:27.717
Vice Presidents taking on even more responsibility.

00:13:28.577 --> 00:13:32.827
The first VP to be given real responsibility was a

00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:36.754
man named Walter Mondale, who was Jimmy Carter’s VP.

00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:42.012
He was given an office in the West Wing of the White House and was the first

00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:48.067
VP to really adopt the trusted advisor role, rather than honorary backup.

00:13:49.127 --> 00:13:54.667
It seemed, for once, that the President had understood that a powerful VP could be

00:13:54.667 --> 00:14:01.007
a great asset, not just to get elected but in the business of running the country.

00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:09.517
And moving into the early 21st century, Dick Cheney, who served as VP under George W.

00:14:09.517 --> 00:14:11.867
Bush, took things up a notch.

00:14:12.887 --> 00:14:17.257
When he became VP he was a seasoned and influential politician,

00:14:17.627 --> 00:14:21.957
much more so than his running mate and boss, President George W.

00:14:21.957 --> 00:14:22.397
Bush.

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:28.397
He became involved in everything from foreign policy to energy strategy

00:14:28.817 --> 00:14:33.857
and is often referred to as the most powerful Vice President in history.

00:14:35.137 --> 00:14:40.697
For better or for worse, he reshaped the expectations of what a Vice President

00:14:40.717 --> 00:14:47.097
could do and laid the groundwork for future VPs to wield substantial power.

00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:55.747
Most recently, as you will know, Kamala Harris was Joe Biden’s VP, and one of the criticisms

00:14:55.767 --> 00:15:01.857
levelled at her by her Republican opponents was that she was not a good VP, there were no

00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:07.677
major achievements that she could point at during her almost 4-years as Joe Biden’s number two.

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:15.087
Now, her supporters would argue that this is not a fair assessment at all, and that she

00:15:15.087 --> 00:15:21.011
did a lot of important and necessary behind-the-scenes work, especially around things like

00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:27.091
women’s reproductive rights, healthcare and small business investment, and that she didn’t

00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:32.981
use her role as Vice President to promote herself, but rather to carry out her duties.

00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:39.795
After all, she was not expecting to be the Presidential nominee until very late in the day.

00:15:40.435 --> 00:15:46.077
Joe Biden only dropped out in late July, so she had not much more than three

00:15:46.077 --> 00:15:51.577
months to convince the American public that she was up to the task of the top job.

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:54.520
As you know, it did not work.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:01.416
Donald Trump was re-elected, and with him, JD Vance, a man who will be the

00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:07.160
third youngest Vice President in US history, and the youngest since 1953,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.930
when a 40-year-old Senator called Richard Nixon became Dwight Eisenhower’s VP.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.290
Richard Nixon went from Vice President to President, his Vice President, Gerald

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.162
Ford, became President after Nixon was forced to resign, and since then George

00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:32.142
Bush Senior and Joe Biden have gone from the Vice Presidency to the Presidency.

00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:35.082
And this is not an anomaly.

00:16:35.612 --> 00:16:38.782
Out of the 46 individuals who have held the role of

00:16:38.782 --> 00:16:43.182
President, 15 of them were previously Vice Presidents.

00:16:43.852 --> 00:16:48.232
Some, like Theodore Roosevelt, ascended to the presidency

00:16:48.252 --> 00:16:52.362
after a tragic assassination, while others, like George H.W.

00:16:52.372 --> 00:16:57.522
Bush, George Bush senior, were elected directly following their term as Vice President.

00:16:58.282 --> 00:17:05.742
This pathway is one of the most unique aspects of the Vice Presidency: while of course it’s not

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:13.532
guaranteed, it provides a direct, often seamless route to the most powerful office in the land.

00:17:14.962 --> 00:17:19.222
And there is reason to believe that in the case of this President

00:17:19.482 --> 00:17:23.725
and this Vice President, the route is already being laid.

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:30.465
Donald Trump became a household name with The Apprentice TV Series, where

00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:35.915
various young people compete to win a one-year contract working for Donald Trump.

00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:41.455
The idea was they would learn from a master dealmaker, and

00:17:41.455 --> 00:17:45.415
then be able to strike out on their own, if they so chose.

00:17:46.602 --> 00:17:51.397
Trump cannot run for another term in office, so, in the public’s eye,

00:17:51.757 --> 00:17:57.487
it is his VP, JD Vance, who is his apprentice and natural successor.

00:17:58.717 --> 00:18:04.617
Just as candidates on ‘The Apprentice’ competed to learn from Trump and follow in his footsteps,

00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:11.026
JD Vance is seen as the political apprentice set to continue the movement that Trump started.

00:18:11.606 --> 00:18:16.916
Young, ambitious, and with a loyal base, he has the opportunity to use

00:18:16.916 --> 00:18:21.476
this role to cement his position as the natural and appointed successor.

00:18:22.724 --> 00:18:28.934
Politically, well you might believe he represents the dangerous and acceptable face of populism,

00:18:29.264 --> 00:18:34.994
you might believe he is a voice of common sense, but this isn’t a place to discuss his politics.

00:18:35.524 --> 00:18:42.284
He is undeniably ambitious, charismatic, well-connected, a confident public speaker, and

00:18:42.434 --> 00:18:48.445
with his own powerful story of overcoming poverty and abuse to achieve The American Dream.

00:18:49.738 --> 00:18:54.808
And with a President who isn’t getting any younger, one who cannot run for President

00:18:54.838 --> 00:19:00.948
another time, and one who is keen to continue his political legacy, at least the betting

00:19:00.948 --> 00:19:06.568
markets are suggesting that Donald Trump might just have found his next apprentice.

00:19:08.708 --> 00:19:13.478
OK then, that is it for today's episode on American Vice Presidents.

00:19:13.748 --> 00:19:16.958
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:17.668 --> 00:19:20.458
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:24.388
Had you heard of JD Vance before Donald Trump was elected?

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:31.108
What do you think about him, and what do you think about his chances of becoming President in 2028?

00:19:31.448 --> 00:19:34.678
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

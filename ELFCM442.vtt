Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.730
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.720
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.670
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a young British lady.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.720
Or to be precise, a young lady who used to be British, but had her British

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.530
citizenship revoked, taken away, after leaving the country to join the Islamic State.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.470
It's a fascinating story that gets you thinking about the age of responsibility,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.950
the nature of citizenship, and more, so I hope it’ll be an interesting one.

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:52.142
OK then, Shamima Begum, ISIS Teenage Bride.

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:58.242
Let me start this episode by asking you to do something for me.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:03.942
Think, for a minute, about the biggest mistake you ever made as a teenager.

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:11.102
Was there something you did that, when you think about it today, it fills you with pain and regret?

00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:17.452
Something you think about and think “Ah, I can’t believe I was so stupid to have done that?”

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:22.542
Perhaps it was something truly terrible, a decision that you made that

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:26.742
irrevocably changed your life and took you in a completely different direction.

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:30.842
Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to tell me what it was,

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:33.822
just think for a moment about what it might have been.

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:40.522
Whatever it was, let me tell you about one teenage decision that I am certain was

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:46.672
worse, or at least had more lasting and most certainly irreversible consequences.

00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:54.065
In February of 2015, a British-born teenage girl called Shamima

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:58.842
Begum decided to bunk off school with a pair of her friends.

00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:05.132
To be precise, she didn’t just bunk off school, skip school for the day, she

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:10.392
ran away from her hometown of London, got on a plane first to Turkey and was

00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:15.782
then smuggled over the border to Syria, where she joined the Islamic State.

00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:19.752
She was only 15 years old at the time.

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:25.982
In the weeks and months that followed, British politicians spoke publicly about

00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:30.592
their hope for a safe return for the girls, saying that they hoped that the

00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:35.862
so-called “ISIS trio” would come to their senses and return home to Britain.

00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:41.022
They were too young, they said, they didn’t know what they were doing, they were just kids.

00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:44.812
But, there was no sign of them.

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:49.822
In fact, the girls had no intention of returning, and

00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:53.692
their families wouldn’t hear from them for several years.

00:02:55.032 --> 00:03:00.017
It would later transpire that within 10 days of arriving, Shamima Begum

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:05.222
was married off to a Dutch man who had become radicalised and joined ISIS.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:13.432
Despite her young age, Shamima reportedly developed a reputation as something of an enforcer,

00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:20.602
making sure that other ISIS wives adhered to the strictest religious standards, and even trying

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:26.802
to recruit more young women from back home in Britain to come to Syria to join the Islamic State.

00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:32.312
Now, you probably need little reminder about the barbarism

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:36.002
of the Islamic State, but let me give you a very brief one.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:43.702
It was a fundamentalist Islamic group of varied origins that gained global recognition after

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:50.972
its militants gained control over large amounts of northwestern Iraq and Eastern Syria in 2014.

00:03:52.472 --> 00:03:56.462
Fighters flocked to join the so-called caliphate from all over the

00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:00.672
world, including several thousand radicalised individuals from Europe.

00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:07.312
And, as I'm sure you will remember, ISIS was known for its brutality and

00:04:07.342 --> 00:04:13.392
oppression: horrific punishments, mass executions and beheadings, destruction

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:18.122
of culturally important monuments, extreme violence, and suicide attacks.

00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:23.682
It purported to be some kind of paradise based on pure

00:04:23.712 --> 00:04:28.032
Islamic beliefs, but the reality was clearly very different.

00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:35.322
Shamima Begum, by all accounts, felt immediately at home, at least for a few years.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.032
She was happy, she said, it was like everything she'd

00:04:39.052 --> 00:04:42.332
hoped for and seen in the ISIS propaganda videos.

00:04:43.842 --> 00:04:50.332
Then in February of 2019, four years after arriving, something changed.

00:04:51.452 --> 00:04:57.652
She turned up in a refugee camp in Northern Syria, discovered by a British war correspondent.

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:02.652
Begum, so it would seem, had changed her mind.

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:05.482
She wanted to come home to Britain.

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:10.292
She gave an interview with the BBC in which she revealed that

00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:14.712
she had had two children, both of whom had died in their infancy.

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:18.582
And she was 9 months pregnant with a third.

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:23.662
She wanted to return to Britain for the sake of her unborn child.

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:31.282
A refugee camp was no place for a baby, nor was the crumbling Islamic State, and after

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:36.832
already losing two children, she was prepared to do anything to save the life of the third.

00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:42.012
She had changed her mind, she said, and she wanted to come home.

00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:48.132
Well, she did want to come home, but she hadn’t completely changed her mind

00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:54.402
about ISIS and her beliefs; in the interview she didn’t accept any responsibility

00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:59.252
for her actions, and was still expressing sympathy for the Islamic State.

00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:04.132
When the news broke, it was all over the front pages.

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:09.222
The Times website, which broke the story, crashed after

00:06:09.222 --> 00:06:12.512
publishing the story with the headline “Bring Me Home”.

00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:17.312
And then something very strange happened.

00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:23.672
The day after the news of her discovery was published, the British Home Secretary,

00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:29.592
a top member of the government, revoked her citizenship, he said that she was

00:06:29.602 --> 00:06:35.012
no longer a British citizen, and therefore she had no right to come to Britain.

00:06:36.552 --> 00:06:44.392
Suddenly this 19-year-old woman was stateless, she had no passport, no country to call her own.

00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:50.322
Now, for the absence of doubt, and putting aside whatever you might

00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:54.962
think about her beliefs and actions, Shamima Begum was legally British.

00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:58.752
She was born in London, her father was from Bangladesh

00:06:58.822 --> 00:07:02.062
but he had something called “indefinite leave to remain”.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:07.832
This meant that Begum was legally a British citizen, just like

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:12.532
any other, but she found her citizenship stripped from her.

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:20.342
And again, on a legal basis, the British state does have the right to remove someone’s citizenship.

00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:26.162
In this case, the Home Secretary did it on the grounds of national security.

00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:31.742
He said that she had done something so terrible, she had pledged her

00:07:31.772 --> 00:07:37.362
allegiance to a regime that was so abhorrent, with beliefs so contrary to

00:07:37.392 --> 00:07:42.202
British beliefs, that she had forfeited her right to British citizenship.

00:07:42.902 --> 00:07:46.822
She was not welcome in Britain, the Home Secretary said, it

00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:50.772
was no longer her home, and he would not let her return here.

00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:57.802
This was in February of 2019, and to this day, as of the time of

00:07:57.802 --> 00:08:02.232
recording this episode at least, the situation has not changed; she

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:06.962
is still in a Syrian refugee camp, without a state to call her own.

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:15.545
To some, this is fair and just; nationhood and citizenship are things that a country

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:21.851
can give out and take away, and in the case of Shamima Begum, she made her choice,

00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:27.921
she knew what she was doing, and she pledged loyalty to a state so horrific that

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:32.471
it is perfectly justified that she forfeited her right to call herself British.

00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:39.601
To others, it is a deeply unfair decision against a young woman who didn’t fully

00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:45.761
understand what she was doing, who made a teenage mistake and has already suffered greatly.

00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:53.491
Removing her citizenship is not only unnecessary and overly punitive, it is also illegal.

00:08:54.681 --> 00:09:00.231
So, to begin with, let’s explore the first position, the position of the British

00:09:00.231 --> 00:09:05.861
government, that Shamima Begum has forfeited her right to British citizenship.

00:09:07.341 --> 00:09:11.051
As you heard, the day after her first interview with the BBC, the

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:15.561
Home Secretary publicly declared that her passport had been revoked.

00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.111
The British government's position hinges on a few key points.

00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:25.981
Firstly, there is the argument of national security.

00:09:27.237 --> 00:09:31.842
The Home Secretary, in revoking Shamima Begum's citizenship, implied

00:09:31.972 --> 00:09:36.132
that her return could pose a threat to the security of the country.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:41.422
She had been in ISIS for 4 years, with reports about her

00:09:41.452 --> 00:09:44.552
being actively involved in the day-to-day operations.

00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:49.002
She would later deny that she was anything more than a housewife,

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:52.792
but not everyone was buying this, not everyone believed her.

00:09:54.172 --> 00:09:59.102
What’s more, she only left the caliphate after the Islamic State started

00:09:59.102 --> 00:10:04.262
to fall, and her first interviews seemed to show that she still believed

00:10:04.262 --> 00:10:09.762
in ISIS and showed no remorse for its actions or her actions by joining it.

00:10:11.242 --> 00:10:15.772
If she were to return to the UK, so the argument goes, it’s highly

00:10:15.772 --> 00:10:20.542
probable that she would radicalise others, help terrorist networks in the

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:25.522
country, or at least be held up as a poster girl for Islamic terrorism.

00:10:27.112 --> 00:10:29.342
Secondly, there's the legal aspect.

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:35.002
You might think that it is illegal for a country to simply decide that one of its

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:41.642
citizens is no longer a citizen, and it is in most cases, but there are some exceptions.

00:10:43.072 --> 00:10:50.242
One of these is if the person concerned won’t be stateless, so if they have another nationality.

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:56.822
In Begum's case, it was initially argued that she could claim citizenship

00:10:57.042 --> 00:11:01.392
in Bangladesh through her parents, who were both Bangladeshi by birth.

00:11:02.692 --> 00:11:08.422
But Bangladesh has rejected her outright, saying that she has no right to

00:11:08.422 --> 00:11:13.642
Bangladeshi citizenship, and if she attempted to enter the country, she would face

00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:18.632
the death penalty, due to the country’s zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism.

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:23.892
Bangladesh says it has nothing to do with her; she was born in Britain,

00:11:24.242 --> 00:11:29.462
it’s where she lived her entire life before going to Syria, she had British

00:11:29.492 --> 00:11:34.092
citizenship, it has no interest in her and she is Britain’s problem.

00:11:35.322 --> 00:11:39.342
In fact, she had even claimed that she was looking into obtaining Dutch

00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:44.032
citizenship through her husband, an ISIS fighter but technically a

00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:49.062
Dutch citizen, but the Dutch government has basically said “no way”.

00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:55.822
Clearly, for Shamima Begum, she is in this strange diplomatic vacuum,

00:11:56.422 --> 00:12:01.192
rejected by her country of birth, rejected by both countries that she could

00:12:01.202 --> 00:12:05.982
have some claim to be a citizen of, and stuck in a Syrian refugee camp.

00:12:07.462 --> 00:12:12.672
And, to take the other side of the argument for a moment, this is deeply unfair.

00:12:13.772 --> 00:12:18.122
Citizenship is a fundamental human right, not a privilege to

00:12:18.122 --> 00:12:22.242
be withdrawn, and Britain needs to take responsibility for her.

00:12:23.132 --> 00:12:26.672
She was British, she was radicalised in Britain.

00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:33.862
Leaving her to rot in a Syrian refugee camp is deeply unfair and sets a dangerous

00:12:33.892 --> 00:12:38.672
precedent, allowing the government to revoke citizenship based on certain criteria.

00:12:39.642 --> 00:12:42.372
What’s more, she was 15 when she left.

00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:45.252
Legally, she was still a child.

00:12:46.002 --> 00:12:47.832
We all make mistakes when we’re 15.

00:12:48.922 --> 00:12:52.852
Sure, we don’t all join the Islamic State, but she was

00:12:52.852 --> 00:12:56.252
a child and this should be taken into consideration.

00:12:57.682 --> 00:13:04.492
As a child, should the fault be put squarely on her, or on those who groomed or radicalised her?

00:13:05.922 --> 00:13:09.522
Yes, she made a mistake, and yes, it was a really bad mistake.

00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:15.232
But once she had made the decision to get on that plane to Turkey, and then get

00:13:15.232 --> 00:13:19.672
smuggled over the border, there was nothing more that she could have done to get out.

00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:26.122
She couldn’t really have run away, as that would have meant risking her life; if she'd

00:13:26.182 --> 00:13:31.932
been caught, she would undoubtedly have been put in prison, tortured and perhaps executed.

00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:39.212
Yes, she was there for 4 years, but she barely left the home, she wasn’t fighting on the frontlines.

00:13:39.982 --> 00:13:41.802
Or at least, she says she wasn’t.

00:13:43.382 --> 00:13:45.912
And what’s more, she suffered terribly.

00:13:46.712 --> 00:13:51.232
She fell pregnant five times, lost two babies during the

00:13:51.232 --> 00:13:55.992
pregnancies, and all three of her surviving children died.

00:13:57.572 --> 00:14:02.992
She was abused by her husband, so she says, she saw her friends killed, she has already

00:14:02.992 --> 00:14:09.122
experienced more than enough heartbreak and anguish, and she is still only in her early 20s.

00:14:09.992 --> 00:14:13.982
Bring her back to Britain to face justice here, some people say.

00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:20.992
Of course, she should pay for her actions, but it is much better to bring her back to her

00:14:21.002 --> 00:14:26.522
home country to face trial rather than leave her in a refugee camp with hundreds of other

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:32.832
former ISIS members, where she will remain as radical as ever, and might easily escape.

00:14:34.212 --> 00:14:39.732
In other words, perhaps counterintuitively, she poses a greater threat to

00:14:39.742 --> 00:14:45.032
Britain in an insecure refugee camp in Syria than she would safely behind bars

00:14:45.222 --> 00:14:49.612
in a British prison or under the careful watch of the police back in London.

00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:56.352
Whatever side you are more inclined to take, it's undeniable is Shamima Begum doesn’t

00:14:56.352 --> 00:15:00.432
seem to be doing herself any favours through the TV interviews that she's given.

00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:07.492
Especially during the early interviews, from 2019, she showed no remorse

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:12.642
whatsoever and continued to show sympathy for ISIS's values and beliefs.

00:15:14.242 --> 00:15:17.702
She even sort of boasted that she'd seen beheaded

00:15:17.762 --> 00:15:21.472
heads in the bin, the severed heads of enemy fighters.

00:15:22.662 --> 00:15:26.762
And when the journalist asked her what that felt like, she said

00:15:26.772 --> 00:15:29.982
that it didn’t “faze her at all”, she wasn’t bothered by it

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:37.631
Perhaps this just shows naivety, that she grossly misunderstood what might happen,

00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:43.911
and simply assumed that she could click her fingers and come “home” to Britain, and

00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:48.021
she got a nasty shock when she discovered that it was not going to be easy at all.

00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:56.181
Now, we've been speaking only about Shamima Begum today, but clearly she is just one example.

00:15:56.671 --> 00:16:00.381
Thousands of people left their European homes to join the

00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:04.971
Islamic State, and many are now holed up in refugee camps.

00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.251
What should happen to them?

00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:12.591
Of course, nobody is suggesting that they receive some kind of hero’s

00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:17.241
welcome, but should they be deprived of their citizenship and left in

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:21.691
permanent exile or should they be returned to their country of origin?

00:16:23.101 --> 00:16:26.811
And if they are returned, what happens next?

00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:32.521
How can you go from living under ISIS rule to living in a Western democracy?

00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:37.741
If the answer is “you can’t”, then what is the answer?

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:46.301
As the story of Shamima Begum shows, there are no easy answers, and while the Islamic State itself

00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:53.091
might now be toppled, the problem of what to do with its former citizens is far from solved.

00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:59.391
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Shamima Begum.

00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:02.821
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:06.511
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:06.871 --> 00:17:11.341
Are there stories of similar young girls from your country who ran away to join ISIS?

00:17:11.771 --> 00:17:14.861
What is happening to them now, and what is the policy

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:17.711
of your government towards former ISIS fighters?

00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:22.851
Do you think it's ever right and reasonable for someone to be stripped of their citizenship?

00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:26.651
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

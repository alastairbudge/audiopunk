Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.470
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.160
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.280
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The House of Medici, the Florentine

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.470
family that effectively controlled the city for several centuries, produced four popes, and has

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.050
had probably one of the largest influences on the world of art of any family that has ever lived.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.270
This is hot off the heels of another, member-only episode we did on

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.480
Caravaggio, the baddest of the bad-boy painters, and his turbulent life.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.820
That was actually episode number 89, which is available exclusively

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.520
on the website, which if you need a reminder, is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.190
And on that note, if you are interested in unlocking all of the bonus episodes, so that's

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.310
another 50 episodes or so, plus we do one bonus one every week, and if you'd like to get

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.210

So the place to go to for that is is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.800
Ok then, the Medici.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.070
Our story takes us back to the 13th century, when what we

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.210
now know as Italy was a series of self-governing city states.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.010
The Republic of Florence was one of these states, and it was unique

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.190
in that it was a republic, not a monarchy, there was no king or queen.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.110
Instead, it was governed by a sort of rotation system, where different noblemen,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.410
merchants, and aristocrats would govern the city for two to six months, then new

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.420
ones would be picked at random and they would take over for the next 2-6 months.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.810
The story of the Medici is the story of a rise to power without ever really seizing power.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.540
It’s the story of behind the scenes maneuvering, manipulation,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.578
and patronage, and it is inextricable, you can’t separate it,

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:53.768
from the rise of Florence as a powerhouse in the Renaissance era.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:59.348
And it all starts with a man called Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici.

00:03:00.718 --> 00:03:05.368
In 1397, he set up a bank, called The Medici bank.

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:10.688
He had married a woman from a wealthy family, and received

00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:14.818
a large dowry, a large amount of money for marrying her.

00:03:14.818 --> 00:03:19.148
And he chose to use the money from this dowry to start a bank.

00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:25.328
Banks back in 1397 were quite different to the sorts of banks

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:29.488
that exist nowadays, but there were a lot of similarities.

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:36.798
The Medici bank still made loans, it exchanged money, and held deposits, but

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:41.708
you could say that it was really in the business of ‘trust and information’.

00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:47.058
As a bank making loans, the more information you had about the

00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:51.038
person you were giving money to, the more efficient you could be.

00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:56.848
I guess the same is true with banks in 2020, but nowadays it’s a lot

00:03:56.898 --> 00:04:01.278
easier to get information about people than it was 600 years ago.

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:08.691
Giovanni di Bicci de Medici was a shrewd businessman, and the Medici bank grew under his

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:16.501
leadership, particularly because it became the bank of the pope, of the papacy, of the Vatican City.

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:23.901
Obviously, this was a pretty great client to have, not only because the Catholic church

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:30.321
wasn’t exactly short of money, but also because it was certainly not short of power.

00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:35.931
However, it wasn’t until the ascent of Giovanni di Bicci’s son,

00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:40.701
Cosimo, that the Medici family really started to get going.

00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:49.731
Cosimo expanded the bank, and it ended up having 9 different branches outside Florence, stretching

00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:56.241
from Venice to London, and dozens of other partner banks that it would do business with.

00:04:57.206 --> 00:05:02.946
Now, this isn’t going to be a boring episode about banking, but the point

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:09.126
is that the more branches this bank had, the more powerful it became.

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:16.206
Having different branches in all these different places was particularly helpful for its

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:24.006
biggest client, The Vatican, because one of the roles of the bank was to collect money on behalf

00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:30.096
of The Vatican from other branches of the Catholic church and send it back to The Vatican.

00:05:30.973 --> 00:05:38.523
Evidently, having a large, international banking network was very helpful for this particular task.

00:05:39.592 --> 00:05:44.362
Cosimo, and the Medici family, quickly became one of the richest in

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:49.962
Florence, but being rich didn’t automatically equal being powerful.

00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:56.795
It helped, of course, but Cosimo turned out to have a very good understanding of

00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:03.775
how to gain power indirectly, without murder, without force, and without crime.

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:12.095
Cosimo himself never actually held any real official position of political power, but

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:19.445
instead controlled others through putting his friends, family, and contacts into positions

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:25.805
of power, and doing favours for other people, and controlling Florence from the shadows.

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:32.685
He was incredibly effective at this, and it’s said that within a few years

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:38.895
of taking over from his father he had become the de facto ruler of Florence,

00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:44.255
controlling everything, although without any kind of official title.

00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:50.255
Interestingly though, while you might be listening to this and thinking that he was busy

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:56.775
arranging for people to be killed, exploiting the poor, and only interested in increasing

00:06:56.785 --> 00:07:03.325
the size of his own bank balance, he is remembered as a good, honest, and kind man.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.830
Rather than being interested purely in his own success, he was interested in

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.530
the success of Florence, of the Republic, and he has to take a large amount

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.400
of credit for the achievements of Florence during the Renaissance period.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.220
He was a great patron of the arts, and if you’ve visited Florence as a tourist you will

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.690
no doubt have seen great monuments and buildings that were commissioned by the Medici.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.730
Cosimo was a patron of Donatello and Fra Angelico, and you might not know the name

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.240
Brunelleschi, but he was the architect who designed the famous duomo, the cathedral of Florence.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.080
That was only made possible with the money from the Medici family.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:58.740
Despite being, overall, a good man who wanted to improve the lot of Florence, Cosimo de

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:05.730
Medici wasn’t without his enemies, rival families who felt that the Medici had stolen their

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:14.221
power, and Cosimo was exiled from Florence in 1433 by a rival family before being voted back

00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:20.961
in by a ruling government full of people that Cosimo had done favours for and lent money to.

00:08:21.654 --> 00:08:27.004
Cosimo understood the power of doing good things to people - you could say that

00:08:27.024 --> 00:08:33.004
this wasn’t always for completely altruistic reasons, but it certainly worked.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:35.914
Cosimo wasn’t to live forever though.

00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:45.364
When he died in 1464 the ownership of the bank, and with it, the non-official title of ‘most

00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:53.234
powerful man in Florence’ was passed to his son, who was a sick man, and only survived for 5 years.

00:08:54.804 --> 00:08:59.744
Where it becomes more interesting is when power is passed again to his

00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:05.184
son, Lorenzo, who will later be given the name Lorenzo The Magnificent.

00:09:06.224 --> 00:09:10.774
Lorenzo, if you are following, is the grandson of Cosimo, and the great

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:16.184
grandson of Giovanni di Bicci de Medici, the original founder of the bank.

00:09:16.913 --> 00:09:22.883
However, when Lorenzo first inherited power, he was far from magnificent.

00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:27.773
He lacked his grandfather’s skill at Florentine politics,

00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:32.383
and also proved to be not very good at running the bank.

00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:40.623
His opponents sensed an opportunity, and a conspiracy was hatched between three different groups.

00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:45.354
Firstly, a rival Florentine banking family called the Pazzi.

00:09:47.094 --> 00:09:49.994
They wanted some of the Medici power and influence.

00:09:50.964 --> 00:09:54.744
Secondly, the archbishop of Pisa, a city just to the

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:58.024
west of Florence that was under Florentine control.

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:03.664
He wanted to be free from Florence, and the Medici wouldn’t allow it.

00:10:04.984 --> 00:10:08.164
Thirdly, the pope’s nephew, and ultimately, the pope.

00:10:09.164 --> 00:10:13.644
The pope had transferred the Vatican City’s banking account away from the

00:10:13.644 --> 00:10:18.884
Medici to the Pazzi family, and the pope didn’t want the Medici around.

00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:24.394
So, these three conspiratorial groups hatched a plan.

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:34.544
On the 26th April, 1476, the Duomo of Florence was packed with 10,000 people attending Mass.

00:10:35.644 --> 00:10:42.594
Lorenzo de Medici and his family were there, at the front, in prime position, as you might expect.

00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:51.524
As the priest raised his hands, a group of attackers rushed forward, knives and swords in hand.

00:10:52.729 --> 00:10:55.969
Lorenzo and his brother Giuliano tried to flee.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:05.589
Giuliano was caught, and was stabbed 19 times, murdered in front of the crowd of 10,000 Florentines.

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:11.369
Lorenzo managed to lock himself in the sacristy, the room where the

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:17.389
priests get ready, and he escaped only with a few cuts and bruises.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:21.439
Giuliano was dead, but the plot had failed.

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:23.299
Lorenzo was still alive.

00:11:24.499 --> 00:11:30.479
The conspirators were rounded up and executed, their bodies left hanging

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:35.029
from various different buildings in Florence as a warning to others.

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:39.989
Although the immediate threat might have been over, the

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:45.459
ruling pope was still firmly anti-Medici, he wanted them gone.

00:11:46.619 --> 00:11:52.529
He excommunicated Lorenzo de Medici, he kicked him out of the Catholic church, and he

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:59.909
persuaded the King of Naples, Ferdinand the First, to march north and invade Florence.

00:12:00.873 --> 00:12:04.113
Understandably, Lorenzo didn’t like the idea of that.

00:12:05.073 --> 00:12:11.343
The Medici were bankers and politicians; war wasn’t their speciality.

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:16.593
Lorenzo decided to do something pretty brave, for which

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:19.843
he was given his nickname, Lorenzo the Magnificent.

00:12:20.753 --> 00:12:28.293
He traveled secretly to Naples, and offered himself as a prisoner to Ferdinand, the King of Naples.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:35.283
He could well have been killed on arrival, but he did what the Medici did best.

00:12:36.353 --> 00:12:42.803
He operated behind the scenes, wooing, persuading Ferdinand to stop his invasion,

00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:49.683
arguing that war between the two kingdoms would just help the French, who might see this

00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:56.443
as an opportunity to march down and invade a weakened Kingdom of Florence or Naples.

00:12:57.513 --> 00:13:02.553
Ferdinand, after 3 months of persuasion, agreed, allowing

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:06.223
Lorenzo to leave Naples and withdrawing his troops.

00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:12.753
Lorenzo returned to Florence a hero, he had saved the city, and

00:13:12.763 --> 00:13:17.153
was duly rewarded with this title of Lorenzo the Magnificent.

00:13:17.903 --> 00:13:23.273
If it hadn’t been abundantly clear before, this episode just underlined the

00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:29.443
extreme power of the pope, and Lorenzo decided that he needed his family,

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:35.673
The Medici, not just as bankers to The Vatican, but actually in The Vatican.

00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:41.951
After the previous pope died, Lorenzo persuaded the new one to make

00:13:41.961 --> 00:13:48.451
his son, who was only 13 years old at the time, a cardinal, a position

00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:52.721
you need to have in order to have any chance of becoming pope.

00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:59.431
Long story short, this strategy of placing family members within the Catholic

00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:05.841
church was incredibly effective for the Medici, and 4 Medicis became popes,

00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:11.881
starting with Lorenzo’s son, Giovanni, who will later be Pope Leo the Tenth.

00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:18.107
Although Lorenzo proved to actually be a skilled diplomat, he wasn't

00:14:18.127 --> 00:14:22.587
a skilled banker, and the Medici bank’s fortunes start to crumble.

00:14:23.602 --> 00:14:30.162
It had made a series of bad loans to European leaders, including King Edward the Fourth

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:34.045
of England, and these loans were never paid back, so the bank went bankrupt in 1499.

00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:43.285
Luckily, even though they were without their bank, The Medici story

00:14:43.395 --> 00:14:47.605
doesn’t quite end there, although it never manages to reach the kind of

00:14:47.605 --> 00:14:52.515
levels of power that it achieved under Cosimo, its first great ruler.

00:14:53.515 --> 00:14:58.875
As seems to be a theme with almost any rich, ruling family, there is

00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:04.805
a tendency for subsequent generations to be not such great custodians

00:15:05.035 --> 00:15:09.803
as their predecessors were, and the Medici family is no exception.

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:16.296
One thing that the Medici did incredibly well though was to make good marriage

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:23.306
matches, with sons and daughters married off into almost every European royal family.

00:15:24.255 --> 00:15:30.185
Indeed, if you look through the family trees of almost all aristocratic

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:35.045
European families, it would be strange not to see any Medicis in there.

00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:41.411
But, it would be a failure to produce a male heir, a boy, that would be

00:15:41.411 --> 00:15:45.951
the final undoing for the Medici, that would prove to be the thing that

00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:51.711
caused the bloodline to end, and the original Medici line died out in 1743.

00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:59.451
While the family may be gone, the legacy of the Medici certainly isn’t.

00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:06.841
Cosimo was the first great patron of the arts, but this was a tradition that was passed down

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:13.241
through the generations, and the family are responsible for commissioning some of the Renaissance’s

00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:20.571
most famous works, by Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Botticelli, as well as countless others.

00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:27.445
They are the fathers of modern philanthropy, and it’s been said that they really

00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:33.935
normalised this idea that if you were incredibly wealthy it was your duty to

00:16:33.935 --> 00:16:38.965
pay for great works of art, and to support the development of arts and culture.

00:16:40.055 --> 00:16:47.075
Now, this is sort of the expectation for the super wealthy, but it wasn’t before the Medici.

00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:52.795
And if you go to Florence, if you go to the Uffizi gallery, if you go to

00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:58.305
the Duomo, or even if you have read some of the works of Galileo, you have

00:16:58.325 --> 00:17:02.995
benefited from the patronage of the arts and sciences by the Medici family.

00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:06.385
And that is certainly quite a legacy.

00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:11.261
Ok then, that is it for the House of Medici.

00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:17.921
It is a pretty interesting story, and it’s always nice to hear a story where almost everyone

00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:22.751
seems to win, and nobody needs to have their head cut off or be stabbed in the back.

00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:29.131
Although those kinds of stories can be pretty great too, and if you like those, I’d recommend

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:34.211
you listen to our episode on Jack the Ripper, which is not short of people getting stabbed.

00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:38.109
As always I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:43.819
We now, for members of Leonardo English, have a lovely new community, where you can discuss

00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:49.789
episodes, ask questions about anything relating to learning English, and meet other curious minds.

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:56.129
And if you’re not a member yet, and want to get access to the community, to transcripts,

00:17:56.389 --> 00:18:03.479
subtitles, bonus episodes, and our live sessions, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.280
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:15.250
I’m Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I’ll catch you in the next episode.

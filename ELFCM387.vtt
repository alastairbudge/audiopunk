Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:16.667
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:20.737
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:27.427
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Flat Earth Theory, the

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:34.217
idea that the Earth is not in fact a circular ball, but a flat, pancake-shaped object.

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:39.717
It might sound ridiculous, given the fact that as a human race we

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:43.417
have never before had a better understanding of science and physics.

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:47.467
But there have never been more people alive who believed that

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:51.137
modern science  is simply wrong, it’s all a huge conspiracy.

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:57.797
So in this episode we are going to explore the Flat Earth Theory, we’ll look at where it came from,

00:00:58.177 --> 00:01:04.777
why people believe it, despite all the evidence, and why it is more popular now than ever before.

00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:09.067
OK then, the Flat Earth Theory

00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:16.807
On February 22nd, 2020, a 64-year-old American stood

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:20.337
in the Californian desert, looking up to the sky.

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:26.117
He boarded a homemade space rocket, getting ready for lift off.

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:31.067
It was a windy day, as the onlookers stood by,

00:01:31.277 --> 00:01:35.427
waiting for this daredevil to pull off his next stunt.

00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:39.717
The man in question was Mike Hughes.

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:44.617
His target that day was to reach the Karman line, the

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:48.827
boundary between the Earth’s atmosphere and outer space.

00:01:49.897 --> 00:01:54.057
The reason for wanting to do this, so he told the press and anyone

00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:59.427
who would listen, was because he wanted to see the Earth for himself.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:06.767
When he got all the way up there he was going to look down, and what he believed he

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:12.197
would see was not the circular globe that we see in geography or physics textbooks.

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:19.757
He thought he would see a big, round disc, like a large plate or a pancake.

00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:26.167
He had his camera with him, ready to take a picture and share it with the world.

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:30.417
He was going to be the first person to reveal the

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:35.587
truth, that the earth is, in fact, flat like a pancake.

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:40.017
Unfortunately he would never manage to take this picture.

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:45.167
Seconds after the space rocket took off there was a malfunction.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:50.657
A parachute burst out prematurely and ripped on a ladder.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.980
causing the rocket to be thrown off its trajectory.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.220
For a split second, it looked like the rocket might flip on its head and land directly into

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.580
the small group of spectators, but it looped the other way before crashing down in the desert.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.990
The entire flight took less than twenty seconds, and Hughes

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.880
was killed instantly when the rocket exploded on impact.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.960
Mike Hughes might have been a daredevil, prepared to put himself in all

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.190
sorts of dangerous situations, including one that would cost him his life.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.610
And, in fact, his press agent would claim that he only professed to believe the Flat

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.260
Earth theory in order to attract attention and funding to his amateur rocket-building.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.577
But there have never been more people who believe that the Earth is not

00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:48.990
round,  with one recent survey suggesting that 16% of Americans believe

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.390
that the Earth isn’t round, rising to 34% of Americans aged 18-24.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.460
That’s…a lot of people, right?

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.540
So how did we get to this point?

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.730
Well, there is a popular misconception that everyone thought the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.450
world was flat until relatively recently, anywhere from Christopher

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.210
Columbus in the late 15th century up to the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.650
And there is a myth that Christopher Columbus set out in 1492 to prove that the Earth was round.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.500
This simply isn’t true.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.350
Going back all the way to the ancient Greeks, mathematicians have hypothesised that the surface

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:41.960
of Earth is, in fact, curved, thereby making it one massive sphere, a globe, round ball.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.650
There were a few reasons they thought this, and they all come from

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.060
observing the world around them, seeing things that you or I can see

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.360
anywhere in the world without any kind of complicated scientific equipment.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.620
One is from looking at a ship sailing over a horizon.

00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:08.017
If you look at a ship as it’s sailing away from you and it appears to drop off the edge

00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:13.017
of the sea, but then it returns and you ask someone on the boat, “did you drop off the

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:18.217
edge of the Earth?”, and they say “err, no, we just sailed on a bit and then returned”.

00:05:19.577 --> 00:05:24.107
Or by looking at a lunar eclipse, where the Earth comes between

00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:28.047
the sun and the moon and forms a circular shadow against the moon.

00:05:28.747 --> 00:05:32.257
Or by climbing a tree or a high mountain and seeing

00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.967
that you can see further than you can on ground level.

00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:40.067
There are lots of different ways in which, even without any kind of modern

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:44.457
technology, using simply your eyes and a rudimentary understanding of

00:05:44.457 --> 00:05:49.367
mathematics, you can come to the conclusion that the Earth is spherical.

00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:54.247
Despite this, there were, of course, plenty of societies

00:05:54.247 --> 00:05:57.817
and cultures that did believe that the Earth was flat.

00:05:58.707 --> 00:06:04.207
From Early Greek philosophers to Chinese astronomers, many wise men and women

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:09.777
subscribed to the theory that the Earth was either flat or some kind of either

00:06:09.777 --> 00:06:16.457
circular or rectangular shape, normally with the heavens in a spherical shape above it.

00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:21.867
Again, you can understand why someone might have come to this conclusion.

00:06:22.517 --> 00:06:27.207
If you look at the Earth when you’re standing on it, it does look kind of flat.

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:32.157
The idea that it might be spherical is kind of scary.

00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:34.807
What happens on the other side?

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.587
Do you slide around?

00:06:36.947 --> 00:06:39.717
What happens if you go upside down?

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:45.677
The point is, it’s easy with the benefit of hindsight, a basic understanding of

00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:51.207
mathematics, and all the evidence that we have today, it's easy to look back and

00:06:51.207 --> 00:06:57.637
say “how did anyone believe it was flat?”, but at the same time, it’s not so hard

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:01.307
to understand why this might have been a tricky thing to get your head around.

00:07:02.437 --> 00:07:08.107
But, fast forward several thousand years, to the mid 19th century, it’s a

00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:12.507
bit harder to imagine why someone would believe the Earth was not round.

00:07:13.587 --> 00:07:19.757
Countless scientists and astronomers had proven it, map makers had charted much of the

00:07:19.757 --> 00:07:25.237
globe, we had a pretty robust understanding of gravity and of the movements of the planets.

00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:29.457
Debate over the shape of the Earth was almost

00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:33.757
non-existent, because there simply was nothing to debate.

00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:36.197
There was near unanimous agreement.

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:37.667
It was round.

00:07:39.107 --> 00:07:45.287
But this all changed with the ideas of an Englishman called Samuel Rowbotham.

00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:53.947
He published a 16-page pamphlet in 1849 called Zetetic Astronomy, which was

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:59.717
later turned into a book, and in it he proposed something revolutionary.

00:08:01.187 --> 00:08:05.347
According to Rowbotham, who was in fact writing under the pseudonym

00:08:05.707 --> 00:08:13.647
Parallax, the Earth was not a circular ball, but a pancake-shaped flat disc.

00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:21.917
This disc, according to Rowbotham, has the North Pole at its centre, the rest of the

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:28.187
world going out from there, and at the edge of the world going all the way around,

00:08:28.437 --> 00:08:33.168
the crust of the pizza might be one way of thinking about it, there is Antarctica.

00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:39.078
Now, what about the sun, moon, planets and the stars, you might be thinking?

00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:44.328
Well, they are only a few thousand kilometres above the Earth, and

00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:48.538
they’re much smaller than we think they are, this was Rowbotham’s theory.

00:08:49.548 --> 00:08:54.578
If you've seen The Truman Show, the film with Jim Carrey where he discovers that his

00:08:54.578 --> 00:09:01.558
entire life is a simulation for reality TV, that is essentially what Rowbotham proposed

00:09:01.558 --> 00:09:07.808
we all live in,  a flat surface with a dome above it where the sun, moon and stars were.

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:14.658
So, was Rowbotham mad, a fraud, some kind of religious

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:18.508
zealot, what was he trying to do by publishing this theory?

00:09:19.938 --> 00:09:25.008
Well, much like I described earlier, with the example of you or I being

00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:28.818
able to observe our surroundings and come to the conclusion that the

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:34.218
Earth is round, Rowbotham did the same but came to a different conclusion.

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:41.507
His was at least more scientific than our basic experiment of seeing a ship go over the horizon.

00:09:42.747 --> 00:09:47.767
Rowbotham found a long and straight canal outside Cambridge, in England.

00:09:48.657 --> 00:09:52.717
He got into the canal with his telescope, and watched

00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:55.867
as a boat went further and further away from him.

00:09:57.197 --> 00:10:03.637
If the Earth were round, Rowbotham pointed out, the boat would look like it was going down.

00:10:04.397 --> 00:10:09.097
But, shock horror, Rowbotham looked through his telescope and the

00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:13.557
boat seemed to be at a similar height no matter how far away he got.

00:10:14.387 --> 00:10:17.377
Therefore…the Earth must be flat!

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:22.627
Now, even though this can be explained through an understanding of

00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:28.387
physics, and how light refracts, Rowbotham was convinced that he was right.

00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:34.197
He got very excited about this idea, published this pamphlet, then

00:10:34.197 --> 00:10:38.777
the book, becoming the father of the modern “Flat Earth” movement.

00:10:40.227 --> 00:10:46.027
After him came people like Lady Elizabeth Blout, a social activist who founded

00:10:46.027 --> 00:10:50.377
something called the Universal Zetetic Society, and then Samuel Shenton,

00:10:50.777 --> 00:10:55.397
another Englishman who founded the International Flat Earth Research Society.

00:10:56.587 --> 00:11:01.507
Strangely, perhaps, the first and most influential trio of Flat

00:11:01.507 --> 00:11:06.407
Earthers were all English, but it would be across the pond, in the

00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:10.811
United States, where these ideas would be accepted most welcomingly.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:16.067
See, in the early days of modern Flat Earth ideas, it was

00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:20.657
a super fringe movement, with only a handful of supporters.

00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:25.037
But with the internet it spread like wildfire.

00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:31.797
Google Searches for “flat earth” had been relatively consistent, but

00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:39.167
started to grow quickly from mid 2015 or so, reaching a peak in late 2017.

00:11:40.217 --> 00:11:43.607
And flat earth videos on sites like Facebook and

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:47.447
YouTube would often gather tens of millions of views.

00:11:48.147 --> 00:11:54.537
Now, as to the question of why, well this brings us into some interesting territory.

00:11:55.527 --> 00:12:00.237
Firstly, with recommendation-driven algorithms, they will tend to show

00:12:00.237 --> 00:12:03.677
you videos which you will continue to watch for long periods of time,

00:12:04.127 --> 00:12:08.887
or which will lead you down rabbit holes to watch other, related videos.

00:12:09.837 --> 00:12:13.647
Often, these videos will contain shocking or surprising

00:12:13.657 --> 00:12:17.377
information, even if that information simply isn’t true.

00:12:18.257 --> 00:12:23.547
And what more shocking or surprising fact could you be presented with than someone

00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:31.797
proving that the planet you live on isn’t a ball, it isn’t round, but a flat pancake?

00:12:32.937 --> 00:12:38.277
YouTube, after all, is a business that exists to make money, the

00:12:38.277 --> 00:12:42.157
longer it can keep a user on the website, the more money it makes.

00:12:42.757 --> 00:12:47.677
Flat earth videos were very good at keeping users on the website, so

00:12:47.877 --> 00:12:52.097
YouTube had a strong incentive to recommend Flat Earth videos to people.

00:12:53.437 --> 00:12:59.357
Secondly, and on a related note, the fact that these videos were so popular

00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:03.597
meant that people knew that they could make money by creating new videos

00:13:03.627 --> 00:13:07.557
about them, even if they didn’t believe the flat earth theory themselves.

00:13:08.937 --> 00:13:12.477
People saw how many views other flat earth videos were getting

00:13:12.777 --> 00:13:16.587
and thought, well, I’ll create one too and get in on the action.

00:13:17.207 --> 00:13:21.937
So, it wasn’t just the YouTube algorithms that were pushing users to the

00:13:21.937 --> 00:13:27.157
videos, real people were making more flat earth explainer videos in order

00:13:27.157 --> 00:13:30.807
to profit from the interest that they knew there was in the subject.

00:13:32.237 --> 00:13:37.737
The end result was, as you might imagine, lots of people being suggested Flat

00:13:37.737 --> 00:13:41.427
Earth videos, which were excellent at converting new people to the movement.

00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:47.167
In fact, in one article where a journalist went to a Flat Earth

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:51.327
conference and asked the people there how they had got into the Flat Earth

00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:57.587
theory, 39 out of 40 said they had been recommended a video on YouTube.

00:13:59.117 --> 00:14:04.017
Now, it should be said that Facebook and YouTube have now started suppressing

00:14:04.027 --> 00:14:09.087
these kinds of videos, so they say, but for quite some time they were everywhere.

00:14:10.427 --> 00:14:16.547
And in terms of societal reasons for this increasing belief, well, as you’ll know

00:14:16.547 --> 00:14:21.507
the world over, but certainly in the United States, there is increasing distrust

00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:27.167
of authorities, and an increasing idea that people should "do their own research”.

00:14:28.277 --> 00:14:34.177
The end result is that there is now a small but growing proportion of the population that is either

00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:42.847
sceptical about whether the Earth is a sphere or is 100% sure, utterly convinced, that it is flat.

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:47.527
It has got to the stage that it is almost like a religion.

00:14:48.327 --> 00:14:55.097
Flat Earthers talk about going to Flat Earth conferences, socialising with other Flat Earthers, and

00:14:55.297 --> 00:15:01.547
losing friends and damaging relationships over their steadfast insistence that the world is flat.

00:15:02.767 --> 00:15:06.847
Now, this might be easy to ridicule if you don’t believe it.

00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:13.147
But if you believed something from the bottom of your heart, if you had spent hundreds

00:15:13.147 --> 00:15:19.007
of hours researching it, and this thing wasn’t a trivial question of how to make the best

00:15:19.017 --> 00:15:25.217
chocolate cake or how to improve your English pronunciation, you had “discovered” that what

00:15:25.227 --> 00:15:31.837
practically every human believes to be true about the planet they live on…is a lie, well I can

00:15:31.837 --> 00:15:37.972
certainly understand why you might want to share that information with people, and how it would

00:15:37.982 --> 00:15:43.832
become something that could take over your life, permeating every aspect of your existence.

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:50.452
And it would, I imagine, make life in normal society kind of tricky.

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:56.082
You might wander around and think “I can’t believe those people really believe the

00:15:56.102 --> 00:16:01.272
Earth is spherical”, and if you tried to talk to them they would probably say “I

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:05.622
can’t believe you think it’s flat”, and the conversation wouldn’t get anywhere.

00:16:07.202 --> 00:16:11.572
And then you have stories like the one you heard at the start of the episode, of the

00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:16.692
American daredevil who wanted to fly a rocket up into the sky so he could observe the Earth.

00:16:17.472 --> 00:16:23.152
Or there was a story on Reddit of a person who joined the Navy specifically so that

00:16:23.152 --> 00:16:28.692
he could sail the high seas and observe the Earth’s flatness for himself, only to

00:16:28.692 --> 00:16:33.532
spend some time at sea and reach the conclusion that the Earth was indeed round.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.040
It is, in some ways, the most seductive of all of the

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.570
conspiracy theories, simply because of its extremity.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.700
Other perhaps smaller scale conspiracy theories, involving things like the assassination

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:56.440
of JFK or the moon landing or 9/11 or even, more recently, theories about where COVID came

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:03.660
from, these are not quite so binary, there are different layers to them, where perhaps it’s

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.970
easy to believe that reality is slightly different from the official version of events.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.100
The Flat Earth Theory is completely different.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.240
There is no halfway point, no middle ground, between the Earth being a globe and it being a pancake.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.290
And the scale of it is unprecedented.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.330
It would be a conspiracy, a secret, that likely millions of people knew and were keeping secret

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:37.840
right now: the pilots who were flying over the flat Earth, the astronomers who pretended to

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.910
look at the solar system but knew full well that the truth was different, every employee of

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:48.360
NASA, it would be the most monumental conspiracy involving the very nature of our planet.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:56.000
And it’s for this reason that it’s said that once you go down the Flat Earth rabbit hole and decide

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.990
that you believe it, it’s harder to return to reality than almost any other conspiracy theory.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:08.170
Now, even within the Flat Earth theory, there are different theories about the makeup of the Earth.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.070
They all, as far as I can see, subscribe to the idea that it’s a disk

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.310
with the North Pole in the centre, the continents going out from it.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.850
But the differences come about what happens at the edge.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:28.530
Some people think that there is a snowy, icey wall, the Antarctic

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.290
wall, and that’s where it stops, that’s the end of the Earth.

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:37.680
Some people even think that there are armed guards at Antarctica,

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.870
stopping people from looking over the edge and discovering “the truth”

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.250
Others believe a similar thing, but that Antarctica

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.960
continues forever, there is no “end” of the Earth.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.370
Now, to wrap things up, it’s often said that the reason people believe conspiracy

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:03.150
theories is because they offer a unique framework to view the world, that they by

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:08.750
definition go against the mainstream view, that they can help people identify with

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.740
a particular group or belief, and give people a new way of looking at the world.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:20.060
If we take this as true, the Flat Earth theory is the ultimate conspiracy

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.310
theory, giving its believers a literal new way of looking at the world.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.830
In the case of Mike Hughes and his home-made space rocket, he was

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:35.280
prepared to go up as far as he could to look down and see for himself.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.160
Who knows, if he had made it all the way up there, what

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.300
he would have seen might well have changed his mind.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.220
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Flat Earth theory, the most seductive, the most

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.470
extreme and perhaps the most unusual of the popular conspiracy theories of the modern era.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.450
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.360
Do you know anyone who is a Flat Earther?

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.010
Are you a Flat Earther?

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.760
If so, why do you believe the Earth is flat?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.780
Why do you think that this conspiracy theory is so popular?

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.650
What do you think it tells us about modern society?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.420
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

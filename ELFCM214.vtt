Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.560
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.740
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.180
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Robert

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.230
Baden-Powell, and the organisation that he founded, The Boy Scouts, or simply, The Scouts.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.950
There are currently more than 31 million boys and girls in the world who

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.800
take part in The Scouts, spread across 216 countries and territories.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.790
And since its founding in 1908, hundreds of millions more

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.580
children have been in The Scouts, perhaps including you.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.830
So, in this episode we are going to look at the amazing history of this organisation and

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.740
its iconic founder, from the life of Robert Baden-Powell to why he started The Scouts in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.540
the first place, from the early days of The Scouts to how it spread all over the world.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.950
We’ll look at what being a Scout actually means, how the organisation

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.030
has changed, and some of the controversies it has had to overcome.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.099
OK then, The Boy Scouts.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.839
To understand the history of The Scouts, we must look at the childhood of its iconic

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.819
founder, an Englishman named Robert Baden-Powell, who was known to everyone simply as “B-P”.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.905
He was born to an upper class English family in 1857.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.949
His father was a well-known mathematician and Church of England

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.659
priest, and his mother was the daughter of a famous naval officer.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.969
B-P’s godfather was the famous railway engineer, Robert Stephenson, who invented the steam train.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.959
So, he came from a wealthy, prestigious family.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.039
He won a scholarship to a famous private school called

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:20.969
Charterhouse, where he developed his love for all things outdoors.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:28.909
Although he was a clever boy, he was reportedly not particularly interested in his academic studies,

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:37.049
and would prefer running around in woods, going on outside adventures, and being out in the open.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.069
As was not unusual for someone with B-P’s upbringing, an upper class young

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.829
Englishman at the height of the British empire, he joined the army, and

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.829
spent time out in India, which was, remember, a British colony at the time.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.559
He was posted to a variety of different British foreign territories including Malta,

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.819
South Africa and Zimbabwe, or Rhodesia as it was called during the colonial period.

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:12.479
He was clearly a talented soldier, and promotions came quickly.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:21.559
It wasn’t until the Boer War, which lasted from 1899-1902, that he really made a name for himself.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.369
As a quick reminder, The Boer War was the war between

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.069
Britain and two states in modern-day South Africa.

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:37.419
Although the British technically won the war, it shone a light on one of the very nasty aspects of

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:44.939
imperial rule, especially through the use of concentration camps to imprison the Afrikaans, or Boer,

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:51.809
population, and it was considered by many to be the start of the decline of the British empire.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.879
During the Boer War, Baden-Powell was in charge of defending

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.839
a town called Mafeking from the advancing Boer forces.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.359
This was a particularly important town to defend because the son of the

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.059
British Prime Minister, a man called Lord Edward Cecil, was stuck there.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.609
It would have been hugely embarrassing, a massive blow to British morale if he,

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.549
the son of the British Prime Minister, had been captured and killed by the enemy.

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.439
The British forces were surrounded, and under B-P’s leadership

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:34.899
they managed to defend the town for 217 consecutive days.

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:41.419
The word for when a town or castle is surrounded is “a siege”, and it

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.589
was during the Siege of Mafeking that B-P really made a name for himself.

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:51.729
Baden-Powell showed himself to be not only a talented

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:55.809
military leader, but also an excellent leader of people.

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.059
He managed to keep up morale up in the town, organising games and activities to

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.579
distract people’s attention from the reality that they were surrounded by enemy forces.

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.629
News of the siege of Mafeking was being broadcast back

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.499
in Britain, and B-P was becoming a household name.

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:22.399
It was a great morale-boosting story for the British public, which was sick

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.869
and tired of hearing about military defeats and the deaths of young soldiers.

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:35.339
When reinforcements finally arrived and the siege was over, Baden-Powell returned to Britain

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:43.009
a hero, greeted by adoring crowds, rewarded with promotions, and even meeting The King.

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.319
Although he was a soldier, his real passion wasn’t fighting,

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.579
he was a soldier more out of necessity than anything else.

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.899
After returning from Africa in 1903, and aged 46, he set

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:03.689
out on an idea for a training manual aimed at young boys.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.049
Baden-Powell believed that one of the reasons for the decline of the British

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:15.889
empire was that the youth of the time wasn’t prepared for adult life, they

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.289
didn’t know how to do things that young men should know how to do, and there

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:27.149
wasn’t a strict code or training for the proper behaviour of a young man.

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:34.179
B-P had written some previous training manuals for military recruits during

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:39.669
his time in India, but back in Britain he wanted to go one step further.

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.639
He wanted to test out his theories about activities that

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.499
young boys would not only enjoy doing, but would benefit from.

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.109
In August of 1907, four years after returning from

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:58.119
Africa, he decided to put these ideas to the test.

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:05.109
He took a group of 20 young boys to an island off the south coast of England, and put

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:11.309
them through a series of outdoor activities, activities that will be familiar to anyone

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:18.959
who has ever been a scout: camping, exercises, making fires, saving lives, and games.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.749
It was an immediate hit, the boys loved it.

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:28.409
The following year Baden-Powell published his ideas based

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.769
on these activities in a book called “Scouting for Boys”.

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:40.989
It was hugely popular from the outset and is thought to have sold 150 million copies since it was

00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:47.059
first published, which would make it the fourth most popular book published in the 20th century.

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:51.559
Soon scouting became a national movement, with

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.019
scouting organisations popping up all over the country.

00:07:55.989 --> 00:08:00.769
The following year, in 1909, B-P organised a mass

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.919
rally, called a Jamboree, at London’s Crystal Palace.

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:12.549
Tens of thousands of boys turned up, and controversially at the time, so did some girls.

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:21.439
Baden-Powell’s book was called “Scouting for Boys”; he had intended it to be for boys, not girls.

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:27.309
Not only did he have what we would now call pretty old-fashioned views

00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:32.469
about the role of women, but he also feared that allowing girls to

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:37.559
participate in The Scouts would make it less attractive to young boys.

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:45.339
While it’s easy to look back at this view and call him a terrible misogynist, women in Britain

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:52.479
still didn’t have the vote at this time, the Suffragette movement, which campaigned for Votes for

00:08:52.479 --> 00:08:59.319
Women, was only just getting started, and his views wouldn’t have seemed abnormal at the time.

00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:04.589
To his credit, he did encourage the girls, and asked his sister,

00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:10.059
Agnes, to lead the girls scouting movement, called The Girl Scouts.

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:18.049
While B-P’s views on gender equality might be something he is criticised for today, he showed

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:25.309
progressive views on social mobility, and right from the start made sure that being a Scout

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:31.789
was something that should be open to and encouraged for all boys of all social classes.

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:36.689
This was certainly not obvious, given the importance of

00:09:36.849 --> 00:09:40.859
social class in other aspects of British society at that time.

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:47.469
B-P’s special talent was speaking to boys in language they could understand.

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:55.049
He recognised the sort of things that boys like doing, and scouting activities reflected this.

00:09:55.999 --> 00:10:02.679
He believed that young boys like ritual, they like the idea of a ceremony being performed.

00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:07.539
They like the idea of having something that bonds people together.

00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:12.469
He also noticed that groups of young boys will normally

00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:16.808
elect some kind of leader, or a natural leader will emerge.

00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:25.419
And he saw that young boys love the idea of adventure, especially adventures they go on as a group.

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:29.579
All of this was woven into the Scouting movement.

00:10:30.619 --> 00:10:35.749
Plus, if you aren’t aware, when you become a Scout you make a promise.

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:40.779
The original promise from B-P’s 1908 handbook read:

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.399
'On my honour I promise that—

00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:46.729
I will do my duty to God and the King.

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:51.019
I will do my best to help others, whatever it costs me.

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:54.129
I know the scout law, and will obey it.'

00:10:55.749 --> 00:10:57.359
What's more, the book read:

00:10:57.739 --> 00:11:02.919
While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:08.699
level with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:13.369
the little finger and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards:—

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:17.349
This is the scout's salute and secret sign."

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:22.789
So, B-P knew that this would appeal to young boys.

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:27.359
A promise that they could make that would bond them together, unite

00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:32.819
them with each other, forming their own little secret adventurous gang.

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:39.549
What B-P seemed to not have understood though was that what he had created was

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:46.029
appealing not just for British boys, but for boys and girls from all over the world.

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:51.789
B-P intended his movement to be a British movement, but soon

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:56.209
enough scouting associations appeared all over the world.

00:11:56.869 --> 00:12:01.259
Within a couple of years there were Scouting groups in countries such as

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:06.809
France, the US, Argentina, India, Greece, Mexico, Chile, Russia, and Germany.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:13.639
Of course, Baden-Powell couldn’t control all of these new Scouting organisations directly,

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:21.049
and so adults were encouraged to lead these decentralised groups, based on B-P’s ideas.

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:27.858
It had a lot in common with religious movements, really, but the caveat was that

00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:34.789
the founder was alive and certainly didn’t claim any sort of divine special powers.

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:43.429
But, just as the Scouting movement was really starting to take off, The First World War broke out.

00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:51.599
Baden-Powell was almost 60 at the time, so no spring chicken, not a young man by any means.

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:56.039
He didn’t go to fight, he was too old, but tens of

00:12:56.039 --> 00:13:00.509
thousands of young Scouts, both former and current, did.

00:13:01.409 --> 00:13:07.939
Many of whom never returned, and this was an experience that was to scar Baden-Powell forever.

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:13.799
After the end of the First World War Baden-Powell started to see scouting

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:19.579
as a way to promote peace between countries, based on unity between Scouts.

00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:27.389
He had been a soldier himself as a young man, so he knew how wars worked, but he thought

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:34.589
he could use scouting as a way for boys to better understand boys from other countries, so

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:40.259
that when they grew up and became men they were less likely to go to war with each other.

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:46.159
The 1920s saw the start of the Global Scout Movement, with

00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:50.759
B-P being given the title of “Chief Scout of The World”.

00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:56.889
Great jamborees, large parties were organised, allowing boys and girls from all

00:13:56.909 --> 00:14:01.709
different countries and backgrounds to get together, united through Scouting.

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:07.899
By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts spread across 32

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:13.469
countries, a number that was to rise to over 3 million by 1939.

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:20.113
While the 1920s might have been a time for optimism, in much of the western

00:14:20.113 --> 00:14:25.853
world and also for the Scouts, the 30s were a different matter altogether.

00:14:26.703 --> 00:14:32.773
Starting with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression in the

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:39.003
United States and then the rise of totalitarianism in Europe, it was a very different world.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:45.993
As far as Scouting was concerned, Baden-Powell was horrified to see the Boy Scouts in

00:14:46.013 --> 00:14:52.783
Germany banned, and then swallowed up by the Hitler Youth, an organisation that numbered 8

00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:59.883
million at its peak, and with a much more military and sinister purpose than the Boy Scouts.

00:15:00.803 --> 00:15:05.653
Now, this is by no means saying that the Hitler Youth wouldn’t have been created

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:10.443
without The Boy Scouts, but the presence of The Boy Scouts in the country

00:15:10.673 --> 00:15:16.923
certainly gave it a headstart, and this was something that deeply troubled B-P.

00:15:18.103 --> 00:15:23.943
By the outbreak of the Second World War he was an old man, and had retired to Kenya.

00:15:24.693 --> 00:15:29.113
His health was failing, and he died on 8 January

00:15:29.113 --> 00:15:33.763
1941, less than a month away from his 84th birthday.

00:15:34.723 --> 00:15:38.713
Of course, the death of Baden-Powell was a great loss for the

00:15:38.723 --> 00:15:42.973
Scouting movement, but it was strong enough to continue without him.

00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:46.993
During the second half of the 20th century it continued

00:15:47.043 --> 00:15:51.603
to grow and grow, with over 31 million people worldwide.

00:15:52.663 --> 00:15:59.723
By 2023, so not so long from now, it aims to, and I’m quoting directly here,

00:15:59.983 --> 00:16:05.233
“enable 100 million young people to be active citizens creating positive

00:16:05.233 --> 00:16:10.093
change in their communities and in the world based on shared values”.

00:16:11.213 --> 00:16:14.653
Like any global movement with millions of people that

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:18.243
have taken part, it has had its fair share of criticism.

00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:25.613
Baden-Powell himself has been called a colonial oppressor, a murderer, a supporter of Hitler

00:16:25.743 --> 00:16:32.323
and fascism, a repressed homosexual, and someone trying to turn little boys into soldiers.

00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:39.413
And in terms of the Scouting organisation itself, it has a long list of controversies.

00:16:39.993 --> 00:16:44.813
For starters, the original promise required Scouts to pledge their allegiance

00:16:44.813 --> 00:16:49.993
to “God and the King”, which has had to be changed for people who don’t

00:16:49.993 --> 00:16:54.793
believe in a God, or don’t want to swear their allegiance to a monarch.

00:16:55.933 --> 00:17:03.803
In the US, until very recently, 2015 in fact, you couldn’t be gay and participate in the Scouts.

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:11.773
The relationship between boy and girl scouts is still being defined, and more importantly there

00:17:11.773 --> 00:17:17.973
are multiple cases of child abuse that continue to emerge over the long history of The Scouts.

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:23.693
The child abuse issue isn’t simply a moral or criminal issue,

00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:28.163
it is also an important financial one for the Scouts in America.

00:17:29.143 --> 00:17:37.963
There is an ongoing legal case against The Boy Scouts of America involving the abuse of 63,000 boys.

00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:46.463
As a result, the Boy Scouts of America is trying to declare bankruptcy in order to protect itself

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:53.053
from having to pay out literally billions of dollars, which would completely sink the organisation.

00:17:54.053 --> 00:17:58.943
And even all of these problems aside, there is a wider question mark

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:04.983
over whether being a Scout has the same appeal as it had 110 years ago.

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:11.113
There is now a lot more competition for children’s attention, whether that comes

00:18:11.313 --> 00:18:17.923
from video games, social media or simply other outdoor activities, such as sports.

00:18:19.403 --> 00:18:26.033
Membership numbers are dropping significantly in countries like the US, and the organisation

00:18:26.053 --> 00:18:31.333
is struggling to attract children in the same numbers as it was able to 50 years ago.

00:18:32.243 --> 00:18:38.383
If membership continues to fall at the same rate, then Scouting might become a thing

00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:45.123
of the past, a cultural relic that had its place but goes the way of the dinosaurs.

00:18:45.943 --> 00:18:52.243
Or, perhaps there might be a phoenix-like rebirth, a reinvention for the 21st

00:18:52.243 --> 00:18:58.973
century as children and parents look for a break from the always-on digital world

00:18:59.123 --> 00:19:05.053
and use Scouting as a way to reconnect with a more natural sense of adventure.

00:19:06.143 --> 00:19:12.073
Having spent many hours reading people’s reflections on their time Scouting, it’s clear

00:19:12.253 --> 00:19:18.263
that for some people it was a traumatic experience, and one that they would like to forget.

00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:24.413
But for many more, for upwards of a hundred million people, it was one

00:19:24.603 --> 00:19:29.033
that brought them great joy and happiness, long-lasting friendships

00:19:29.073 --> 00:19:34.053
and memories, and taught them how to be better, more balanced adults.

00:19:34.913 --> 00:19:40.373
And no doubt if Robert Baden-Powell knew how much of a positive impact

00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:46.023
he had on many people’s lives he would be a very happy man indeed.

00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:55.661
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Robert Baden-Powell and The Boy Scouts.

00:19:56.271 --> 00:20:01.461
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and even if you were a

00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:06.631
Scout when you were younger, then you learned something new about this amazing global movement.

00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:11.191
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:11.657 --> 00:20:15.561
Were you a Scout, and if so what was your experience like?

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:20.921
Is it something that you would like your children to take part in, or do you think it’s

00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:27.251
something that had its time and place but is no longer appropriate for kids in the 21st century?

00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:29.411
I would love to know.

00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:32.751

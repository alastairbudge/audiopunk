Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:15.798
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:19.818
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:26.068
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the north/south divide.

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:31.238
One way of dividing England is by whether you are a northerner or a

00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:34.858
southerner, whether you come from the north or the south of the country.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.198
But as you will see, it is not simple, not simple at all, and this story will

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:46.728
touch on British history, economics, politics, society, culture and more.

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:53.528
It is also, I should add, part of a three-part mini-series we’re making on British divisions.

00:00:53.868 --> 00:00:58.138
In part one, we talked about the thousand-year rivalry between Scotland

00:00:58.138 --> 00:01:02.428
and England, and in part three we talked about The Wars Of The Roses.

00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:08.618
OK then, let’s get started and talk about The Great British Divide.

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:17.608
In 2008, a professor at the University of Sheffield published a startling discovery.

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:27.278
Professor Danny Dorling had drawn, he had mapped out from west to east, a line that divided England.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:31.038
To the north of the line was “the North”.

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:34.028
To the south of the line, “the South”.

00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:38.688
Now, this wasn’t a revolutionary division, it wasn’t

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:41.748
a division that Professor Dorling created himself.

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:48.888
For centuries people in England had referred to themselves as either Southerners or

00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:55.808
Northerners, but nobody could quite agree on where the line that divided one from the other was.

00:01:56.978 --> 00:02:03.448
It probably started somewhere close to southern Wales, and then went east and north.

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:08.768
It was a fuzzy, unclear line, in people’s minds at least.

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:14.918
But some cities were unanimously agreed to be southern or northern.

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:17.518
London was southern.

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:21.668
Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle were northern.

00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:28.368
But there was no defining line, there was no geographical line, like a river

00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:34.318
or a range of mountains, no political line where one part started and another

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:39.848
ended, nothing that clearly marked where the north ended and the south started.

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:45.948
Wherever this line was, it was also not a straight line but one that

00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:51.918
went northeast at an almost 45-degree angle, so, strangely enough,

00:02:52.278 --> 00:02:57.328
some “northern” cities were further south than “southern” cities.

00:02:58.558 --> 00:03:05.198
Plus, there was the complication that there is a region of the country called “The Midlands”, which

00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:13.308
insisted it was its own region but was often called south by Northerners and north by Southerners.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:21.078
Anyway, the point is that any line, any division, was fuzzy, unclear.

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:27.858
Where there was unanimous agreement, however, was that there was a division.

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:31.088
The north was not the same as the south.

00:03:31.568 --> 00:03:36.018
Life was different, the people were different, people spoke with different

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:40.208
accents, they used different words, they did different jobs, they drank

00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:44.758
different types of beer, they wore different clothes, they had different lives.

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:50.728
Northerners and Southerners were both English, but they were very different people.

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:58.368
So, in this episode, we will explore the question of both what, where and why.

00:03:59.258 --> 00:04:03.578
What are some common differences between people from the south and the

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:09.578
north, how many of these are just stereotypes, and how many are really true?

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:14.308
Where does this division lie, and how can you tell

00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:17.518
whether you are in the north or the south of the country?

00:04:18.368 --> 00:04:20.888
And why do these divisions exist?

00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:28.448
Let’s start with some common differences between northerners and southerners, and for this we

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:33.848
are actually going to turn to the words of George Orwell, in his book The Road to Wigan Pier.

00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:37.468
“A Yorkshireman in the South will always take care

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:40.708
to let you know that he regards you as an inferior.

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:46.308
If you ask him why, he will explain that it is only in the North that life is 'real'

00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:51.148
life, that the industrial work done in the North is the only 'real' work, that the

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:56.838
North is inhabited by 'real' people, the South merely by rentiers and their parasites.

00:04:57.408 --> 00:05:03.638
The Northerner has 'grit', he is grim, 'dour', plucky, warm-hearted and democratic;

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:09.008
the Southerner is snobbish, effeminate and lazy - that at any rate is the theory.

00:05:09.738 --> 00:05:14.438
Hence the Southerner goes north, at any rate for the first time, with the vague

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:20.678
inferiority-complex of a civilised man venturing among savages, while the Yorkshireman,

00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:25.568
like the Scotchman, comes to London in the spirit of a barbarian out for loot.”

00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:32.738
In other words, the Northern man considers himself to be a real man doing real industrial work.

00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:37.898
And he considers Southern men to be snobs, doing easy work.

00:05:38.908 --> 00:05:43.468
And the Southern man looks down on his Northern counterpart

00:05:43.688 --> 00:05:47.838
as something of a savage, an uncivilised barbarian.

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:53.028
They are both British, both English even, but they

00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:56.618
feel little sense of kinship, given their differences.

00:05:58.178 --> 00:06:05.838
This was written in 1937, and this broad theme has continued to this very day.

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:11.288
There was a really good BBC documentary from 1970 with an

00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:14.968
interview of a southern woman who married a northern man.

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:22.668
She talks about her experience living in the north, and how none of the women cooked their children

00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:27.798
any proper food; they would either give them money for fish and chips or cook them something all

00:06:27.798 --> 00:06:34.058
in one pan, and then the poor children would have to eat out of the pan, they would have no plates.

00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:40.038
And then the BBC journalist went to the north to ask the northerners about

00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:45.598
their view of the south, and they responded that Southerners are snobs, they

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:49.518
go out to eat at restaurants because they can’t cook for themselves, and that

00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:54.348
they wouldn’t even dream of living in the south because it sounds so awful.

00:06:55.768 --> 00:07:01.938
And even to this very day, you can find videos on YouTube where people go to the

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:07.928
streets of London or Manchester, Leeds or Newcastle and ask people what they think

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:13.348
of their Southern or Northern counterparts and you will hear very similar things.

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:16.888
So, where does this come from?

00:07:17.348 --> 00:07:21.288
Well, to understand this we need to have a brief history lesson.

00:07:22.538 --> 00:07:26.728
For the purposes of this episode, we need to go back to the Industrial

00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:30.688
Revolution, which started in Britain in the mid-18th century.

00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:37.238
Long story short, people from the countryside flocked to the cities to

00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:42.668
work in factories, producing everything from textiles to tools to iron.

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:50.028
Britain transitioned from an agrarian, farming-based economy, to an industrial one.

00:07:51.628 --> 00:07:56.588
Although the capital and dominant city was London, the Industrial

00:07:56.588 --> 00:08:00.658
Revolution led to huge growth of cities outside the capital.

00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:07.278
And particularly so in the north of the country, which had better access to natural resources,

00:08:07.718 --> 00:08:13.348
better rivers to power the mills and later transport goods, and better access to ports.

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:21.548
Birmingham, for example, went from a population of 15,000 in 1700 to 75,000

00:08:21.888 --> 00:08:26.978
a hundred years later, and over half a million a hundred years after that.

00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:33.318
Manchester, Liverpool, and Newcastle, these were all cities at the heart of the Industrial

00:08:33.318 --> 00:08:39.998
Revolution, cities which grew both in size and wealth during the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:08:41.148 --> 00:08:46.528
The north was industrial, factories, mines, dominated by manual labour.

00:08:47.258 --> 00:08:53.508
Life was tough, long hours doing often dangerous work in a factory or down a coal

00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:58.788
mine, but at least it was predictable, once you had a job, it would be a job for life.

00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:03.774
But moving into the 20th century, especially after World War

00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:08.008
I, the industries that had powered the North were in decline.

00:09:08.858 --> 00:09:11.718
Coal mining, steel production, shipbuilding.

00:09:11.998 --> 00:09:15.578
These were industries that Britain had excelled in in the 19th

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:19.378
century and had been able to sell its products around the world.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:25.318
But in the 20th century, British products were no longer so competitive.

00:09:26.118 --> 00:09:29.618
Countries invested in their own steel and coal industries,

00:09:29.968 --> 00:09:33.248
and there was a diminishing need for British products.

00:09:34.338 --> 00:09:38.988
Initially, these British industries were supported financially by the government.

00:09:39.618 --> 00:09:42.968
If they went out of business, millions of jobs would be at risk,

00:09:43.128 --> 00:09:47.128
so the government continued to prop up these struggling industries.

00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:53.498
The south of England, on the other hand, which had never been so dominated by industry,

00:09:53.968 --> 00:10:01.238
transitioned into a more service-based economy: finance, law, technology, professional services,

00:10:01.648 --> 00:10:07.878
all sectors of the economy that were more profitable, and more competitive in a globalising world.

00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:14.948
Then, in the late 1970s, Britain got a new Prime Minister: Margaret Thatcher.

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:20.958
She was a Conservative, both by political allegiance and in her fiscal beliefs.

00:10:21.918 --> 00:10:27.008
In other words, she represented the Conservative party and she believed in small

00:10:27.028 --> 00:10:32.058
government, that individuals and businesses should be responsible for themselves;

00:10:32.618 --> 00:10:37.288
the government should not support them by subsidising their life or business.

00:10:38.488 --> 00:10:40.868
And you may know what happened next.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:45.608
Margaret Thatcher started the process of closing the coal

00:10:45.608 --> 00:10:49.358
mines, which were mostly found in the north of the country.

00:10:50.528 --> 00:10:55.328
There was a large battle between Thatcher and the coal miners, and eventually,

00:10:55.678 --> 00:11:01.148
after almost a year of strikes, Thatcher won, and then embarked on a series

00:11:01.148 --> 00:11:05.868
of privatisation measures, shutting down unprofitable mines and factories and

00:11:05.868 --> 00:11:11.248
selling off everything from railroads to utility companies to private investors.

00:11:12.508 --> 00:11:18.978
The result was a huge loss of jobs in these industries, which were concentrated in the north.

00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:28.398
Unemployment shot up, reaching 13% across the UK, as 2 million people in the UK were out of work.

00:11:29.468 --> 00:11:35.738
And this was particularly concentrated in towns and cities which had been dominated by

00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:41.248
coal mines, which were predominantly found in the north of England and in southern Wales.

00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:47.708
And in many cases, these areas have never recovered economically.

00:11:48.448 --> 00:11:54.268
There are stark wage and productivity gaps between the North and the South, with

00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:59.038
people in London earning an average of ⅓ more than their Northern counterparts,

00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:04.518
and productivity of workers in London being 40% higher than those in the North.

00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:09.958
We talked a bit in the previous episode about the resentment felt by

00:12:09.978 --> 00:12:14.108
some Scots towards the English for the perceived control that Westminster

00:12:14.118 --> 00:12:18.748
has over Scotland, but it is exactly the same in the north of England.

00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:26.308
The seat of political power is London, and people in the North often complain that politicians in

00:12:26.318 --> 00:12:32.678
Westminster do not care about them and that there is inadequate investment in the north of England.

00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:34.508
They have a point.

00:12:35.478 --> 00:12:38.968
The north of England is poorly connected from a public

00:12:38.978 --> 00:12:42.698
transport perspective, especially in smaller towns and cities.

00:12:43.468 --> 00:12:47.998
Education spending tends to be lower in the North than in the South

00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:53.418
.
And, as you might expect, this has a real knock-on effect.

00:12:53.968 --> 00:12:57.638
Salaries are lower, there are fewer job opportunities, fewer

00:12:57.648 --> 00:13:01.758
opportunities for investment or grants for starting new businesses.

00:13:02.778 --> 00:13:06.708
And there is a large gap between north and south not just in

00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:11.218
economic and educational opportunities, but in life expectancy.

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:17.358
In the southeast of the country, the most prosperous region of England, the life

00:13:17.358 --> 00:13:24.908
expectancy at birth is 80.1, whereas in the northeast, where it is lowest, it is 77.2.

00:13:26.248 --> 00:13:31.258
And if we drill down even further the differences are even greater.

00:13:32.438 --> 00:13:37.008
In Blackpool, which is incidentally where my father was born, the life

00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:43.838
expectancy at birth is 73, but in Cambridgeshire, in the southeast, it is 83.

00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:49.358
It is quite horrific to put it like that, but the average child in

00:13:49.398 --> 00:13:54.478
Blackpool will live 10 fewer years than one born in Cambridgeshire.

00:13:55.368 --> 00:14:00.448
Now, you might be listening to this thinking “Well, my country has divisions too”.

00:14:00.968 --> 00:14:03.738
The north vs south of Italy, or East vs.

00:14:03.768 --> 00:14:05.178
West Germany, for example.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:10.428
But neither of those are as extreme as in the UK.

00:14:11.758 --> 00:14:16.228
According to one report from 2019, ‘the UK is more

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:19.768
regionally divided than any comparable advanced economy’.

00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:25.678
In this report, the researchers found that rates of mortality vary more

00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:30.148
within the UK than in the majority of developed nations, and that there are

00:14:30.158 --> 00:14:35.428
some places in the UK, like Blackpool and Manchester, which have mortality

00:14:35.428 --> 00:14:40.828
rates that are worse than those in parts of Turkey, Slovakia and Romania.

00:14:41.698 --> 00:14:46.268
Now, no offence to any wonderful people living in Turkey, Slovakia or Romania,

00:14:46.658 --> 00:14:51.838
but the GDP per capita of the UK is more than double that of Slovakia, triple

00:14:51.838 --> 00:14:56.858
that of Romania and four times that of Turkey, so given the wealth that

00:14:56.858 --> 00:15:01.508
exists in the country, the health outcomes for citizens should be better.

00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:06.898
There have been various government initiatives to try to fix this

00:15:06.898 --> 00:15:11.568
disparity, and reduce the economic gap between north and south.

00:15:12.148 --> 00:15:16.938
Most recently, the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson campaigned on a message of

00:15:17.288 --> 00:15:22.178
“levelling up”, and increasing government spending in the north of the country, but

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:27.528
according to most northern commentators, very little real progress has been made.

00:15:28.868 --> 00:15:34.138
Now, we must move on to talk about language and culture, because I think this will be more

00:15:34.178 --> 00:15:39.948
interesting for you than me reciting figures about mortality rates or productivity statistics.

00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:44.978
I mentioned at the start of the episode that a university professor

00:15:45.338 --> 00:15:49.788
had produced a paper where he diligently mapped out the exact division

00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:54.258
between North and South, which was based on a complicated set of criteria.

00:15:55.498 --> 00:16:00.448
A polling company called YouGov once tried to draw the line based on a simple

00:16:00.448 --> 00:16:05.718
question: it asked people what they call the meal that they have at the end of the day.

00:16:07.018 --> 00:16:10.228
If they called it “dinner”, they were from the south,

00:16:10.748 --> 00:16:13.568
and if they called it “tea”, they were from the north.

00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:20.138
The polling company surveyed 42,000 people and split the country

00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:23.998
based on whether people were more likely to call it dinner or tea.

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:28.508
And the result was pretty similar to the map that the university

00:16:28.508 --> 00:16:32.658
professor had presumably spent thousands of hours carefully crafting.

00:16:34.038 --> 00:16:36.938
And this is just one vocabulary example.

00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:43.328
Accents are different, with southern accents typically having a long “a” in words

00:16:43.328 --> 00:16:51.281
like “bath” or “laugh”, and northern accents shortening them, like “bath” and “laff”.

00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:57.851
In several northern dialects speakers drop the direct article, or just shorten

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:05.071
it to “t”, so instead of saying “in the bath”, they might say “in’t bath”.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:11.351
What’s more, in several northern dialects people will drop the “h” at the start

00:17:11.351 --> 00:17:18.471
of a word, saying “ave” instead of “have”, “art” instead of “heart”, and so on.

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:21.431
Now, these are just a few examples.

00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:26.051
There is a huge variety of different vocabulary used not just in the

00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:30.461
south vs the north, but a variety within both regions themselves.

00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:37.861
And one of the reasons that some Northerners feel animosity towards their Southern counterparts

00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:43.961
was because of a presumed institutional prejudice that speaking with a Northern accent

00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:50.311
and using Northern vocabulary was somehow inferior to speaking with a Southern accent.

00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:57.581
For a long time, until really the early 21st century, the BBC, the country’s national

00:17:57.581 --> 00:18:04.021
broadcaster, required all of its broadcasters to speak in a certain way, in a southern

00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:08.521
way, similar to the accent that I have, as I am from the south of the country.

00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:14.401
Northern journalists knew that they needed to adjust their accent, to

00:18:14.703 --> 00:18:19.521
soften it to sound less Northern, in order to get ahead in their careers.

00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:26.941
This thankfully has now changed, the BBC encourages a variety of accents, and it

00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:32.311
now has a headquarters in Manchester, but while I was growing up at least, everyone

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:37.681
you heard on the BBC spoke in a particular way; they spoke like a Southerner.

00:18:38.861 --> 00:18:43.231
Now, every country, no matter how big or small, has its divisions,

00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:46.431
friendly rivalries between people from different regions.

00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:51.111
England is no exception, although the line between north and

00:18:51.111 --> 00:18:54.561
south is not nearly as clear as some people might think it is.

00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:59.431
There are no signs saying welcome to the north or welcome to the

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:03.391
south, no river you cross or mountain range you need to go through.

00:19:04.151 --> 00:19:07.891
If you are travelling in England and you are unsure whether you’re

00:19:07.901 --> 00:19:11.841
in the north or south, let me suggest to you a foolproof way.

00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:18.711
Take out a piece of paper and draw a picture of someone eating fish and chips in

00:19:18.711 --> 00:19:25.101
that white porcelain thing you wash yourself in, and ask a passerby what is going on.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:31.721
If they say that someone is having their dinner in the bath, you’re probably in the south.

00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:36.771
If they say they’re “aving ‘t tea in’t bath”, you’re probably in the north.

00:19:38.601 --> 00:19:43.021
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the north-south divide of England.

00:19:43.421 --> 00:19:46.491
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:49.811
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:51.991
What areas of England have you been to?

00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.291
Were you aware of a north-south divide?

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:57.201
What divisions are there in your country, if any?

00:19:57.591 --> 00:20:00.711
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

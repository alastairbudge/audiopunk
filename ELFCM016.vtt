Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:09.618
by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:11.148
I'm Alastair budge.

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:20.056
Hot off the heels of our mini-series about who owns the sea, the sky and space, we are doing another

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:24.166
mini-series on something a little bit different.

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:30.325
This mini-series is about the weird and wonderful history of British food.

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:38.635
Yes, Great Britain may not exactly have the same place in people's culinary imaginations as let's

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:46.705
say, France or Italy, and a lot of British food, quite rightly in many cases, gets a bad reputation.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:56.605
But the history of British food is fascinating, and the food itself, well, it's often a lot tastier

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:57.775
than you might think.

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:05.485
As always, with the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast, we want to cover weird and wonderful

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:13.390
stories, and so we're going to talk about the history behind some of Britain's most famous dishes.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.440
These are things you probably wouldn't find out about in a textbook or guidebook.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:29.230
So in this mini-series, we are going to talk about four very different dishes from British culinary

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.490
history and traditions.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.090
They are all weird and wonderful in their own way.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.880
So today in the first episode, it's oysters, and then in the second episode, which is coming out on

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.810
Tuesday, we are going to be talking about fish and chips.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.640
In part three, it's time to really fill our stomachs.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.120
So we'll be talking about the English breakfast.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.520
Then in the final part, it is the sandwich.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.690
So stay tuned, that is all to come.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:09.392
Before we get right into it, I just want to remind you that you can get the transcripts and key

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:14.382
vocabulary for this podcast on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:22.682
The transcripts and key vocabulary are very helpful in terms of helping you follow along, so I think

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:23.942
it's definitely worth checking out.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.996
Okay then, let's get cracking.

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:30.546
So oysters.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:37.686
If you don't know what an oyster is, it's the shellfish you find in a, in a hard shell, it sometimes

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:39.906
has a pearl hidden inside it.

00:02:40.686 --> 00:02:48.906
So today we are going to be talking about the rise and fall of oysters in British cuisine and find

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:57.801
out how it went from being the favourite of emperors to a cheap poor man's food, then how the events

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:05.601
of one evening meant that the oyster fell completely out of favour, and became distrusted by almost

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:07.401
every person in Britain.

00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:17.312
You probably now think of oysters as a luxury food, something you might imagine fancy lawyers or

00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:24.662
bankers slurping down in expensive bars of London or New York, and you'd be right.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:33.032
Now, oysters are a luxury food, something you might have for a treat, a luxury, certainly not

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:35.522
something that was a food of the masses.

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:38.102
But it wasn't always this way.

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:48.808
Oysters have in fact, been central to British food since the Romans arrived in 55 BC, so for over

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:50.308
2000 years.

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:59.745
As you may know, oysters grow in salt water beds, and the coast of Great Britain is almost the

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:02.655
perfect growing conditions for oysters.

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:11.415
Romans loved oysters, and I use the word love here as opposed to like is, it does seem like it

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:12.795
really was a love affair.

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:21.620
The Roman emperor Aulus Vitellius reportedly ate 1,200 oysters in one single sitting.

00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:29.480
I imagine that even those of you who like oysters might feel a little bit ill at the prospect of

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.040
eating 1,200 oysters.

00:04:31.728 --> 00:04:33.969
Anyway, the Romans loved them.

00:04:34.434 --> 00:04:41.044
And they were evidently pleased when they realised that they had found an island with perfect oyster

00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:42.114
growing conditions.

00:04:43.284 --> 00:04:50.934
So although the local Brits at that time didn't think much of the oysters, they were regarded as a

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:58.584
delicacy by the Romans, so much so that they were even exported back to Rome.

00:05:00.144 --> 00:05:08.364
After the Romans left in the fifth century oysters seemed to drift out of favour as a delicacy, but

00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:16.074
they required little actual farming, and so they continued to grow all across seabeds around Great

00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:16.374
Britain.

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:24.444
They were, for the most part, ignored by the British population for centuries, and it wasn't until

00:05:24.444 --> 00:05:29.364
around the 15th century that they started to drift back into fashion.

00:05:30.774 --> 00:05:34.404
But they weren't considered a delicacy though, quite the opposite.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:41.741
Remember, they are basically just picked up, plucked from the seabed, so require comparatively

00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.061
little cultivation.

00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:45.191
And so they were very, very cheap.

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:55.518
They were normally cooked with some ale, that's a kind of flat, English beer, so ale and pepper.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:06:02.359
If you've eaten oysters now, I imagine this is quite different to how you may have eaten them.

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:11.719
They were so popular and so cheap that some pubs in London would actually give them out for free as

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.339
a way of getting people in of drumming up business, of attracting customers.

00:06:17.448 --> 00:06:22.590
And the Victorian era was the heyday of the oyster.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:34.335
By the end of the mid 19th century, so that's 1850, it's estimated that Londoners alone ate 700

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:36.870
million oysters every year.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.990
If you think that London was about two and a half million people, that's almost 300 oysters per

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.280
person per year.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.065
Given that small children evidently weren't eating oysters, that's an average of more than one

00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:57.615
oyster per day for every adult.

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:04.631
Now, I know oysters are a sort of Marmite food - you either love them or you hate them.

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:11.086
If you're an oyster lover, then I guess the idea of eating one oyster a day could be quite

00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:17.555
attractive, but if you think they are horrible, slimy pieces of seawater, and, with a horrible

00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:22.745
texture, then I imagine you might be feeling a little bit uncomfortable right now.

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:27.875
Anyway, the Victorians obviously loved them, a little bit like the Romans.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:35.885
In fact, they were so popular and so cheap that they were often used as a substitute for beef.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:44.795
One of the most popular dishes at the time was beef and oyster pie, and the richer you were, the

00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:48.035
more beef and the fewer oysters you would use.

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:56.255
Charles Dickens, author of books like Oliver Twist and a Christmas Carol, he once wrote, in Pickwick

00:07:56.255 --> 00:08:01.685
Papers, he wrote "poverty and oysters always seem to go together".

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:03.305
That's weird, right?

00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:10.985
You fast forward two hundred years and it's completely the opposite with oysters being a symbol of

00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:12.245
wealth and riches.

00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:22.295
Producing this many oysters to feed the population of London was evidently a pretty intensive task,

00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:29.495
and the oyster industry employed about 120,000 people in 1864.

00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:39.165
To give you some context, in 2015 only 10,000 people worked in the whole of the UK's fishing

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:39.555
industry.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:48.740
So the oyster industry alone supported 12 times the number of people as now, or five years ago,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.340
worked in the fishing industry, even at a time when the UK had a population that was half the size.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:05.315
The heart of this oyster industry was in the English Channel, so that's the stretch of water between

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:07.145
England and France.

00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:15.905
Conditions here are great for oysters, and it's where the vast majority of the oyster cultivation

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:16.475
happened.

00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:25.445
It's also where just over a hundred years ago, one incident is considered by some to have been one

00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:30.245
of the main causes of the decline of the British oyster industry.

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:38.155
Now on the south coast of England near a city called Portsmouth, the local industry was dominated by

00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:38.965
two men.

00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:46.465
The first was called JF Foster, and the second was called John Kennett.

00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:54.672
As these two men were the most famous oyster farmers for miles around, when there was a local

00:09:54.672 --> 00:10:01.932
banquet, a huge celebration for a local mayor, it was only right that one of the men was chosen to

00:10:01.932 --> 00:10:03.852
provide the oysters for the meal.

00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:07.422
This task fell to JD Foster.

00:10:09.132 --> 00:10:17.082
Unfortunately, it transpired that the batch of oysters served by Foster was contaminated and the

00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:19.782
guests of the banquet were poisoned.

00:10:20.772 --> 00:10:27.831
Several died, poisoned by the oysters, including the Dean of Winchester, so that's the dignitary of

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:31.071
a local city, and he died of typhoid.

00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:33.441
How did this happen?

00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:38.571
Why would this local entrepreneur want to poison the local dignitary?

00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:47.781
Well, it turned out that he wasn't a murderer and he said that he was as confused as anyone about

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:56.811
why these oysters were so bad, about why he had served a batch of poisonous oysters to his esteemed

00:10:56.811 --> 00:10:57.471
guests.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:07.056
It transpired that the local council, so that's the local government, had moved some local sewers,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:15.838
where wastewater is piped away, so that the sewers emptied out just above the oyster beds owned by

00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:19.738
Foster and Kennett, the two local oyster moguls.

00:11:20.903 --> 00:11:30.382
Evidently, if you pour sewage and wastewater over a batch of fresh oysters, well, things aren't

00:11:30.382 --> 00:11:35.122
going to end very well, and that's why the oysters were contaminated.

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:44.082
People were understandably not very keen on eating oysters anymore and the oyster industry collapsed

00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:48.240
almost overnight, But the story does not end there.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.505
Foster made a claim for damages against the local council, for 1,500 pounds.

00:11:56.165 --> 00:12:03.755
He said that the workers putting in this sewer had ruined his business, and after several years of

00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:12.605
increasingly bitter litigation, fighting in the law courts, he increased his claim to 18,000 pounds.

00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:20.375
18,000 pounds in 1902 when this happened is around 2 million pounds today.

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:22.055
So that's serious money.

00:12:23.997 --> 00:12:29.937
Kennett, the other local oyster farmer, did not press charges, he didn't request money from the

00:12:29.937 --> 00:12:36.507
government as compensation, even though his own losses amounted to about 5,000 pounds.

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:39.267
Why would he do this, you might ask.

00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:48.522
Well, it turned out that both men had actually known about the switching of the sewers, and Foster

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:56.622
had actually moved his oyster farms so that they could make use of the extra nutrients that came

00:12:56.622 --> 00:12:57.282
from the sewer.

00:12:58.272 --> 00:13:05.682
He had thought that the waste would actually help his oysters grow, but the result was actually that

00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:07.722
it contaminated the entire lot.

00:13:09.327 --> 00:13:17.457
Foster's award was reduced to 3,300 pounds, and Kennett, the man who had testified against Foster

00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:25.437
became a local hero, as the town would have probably gone bankrupt if it had had to pay such a large

00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:27.717
sum as compensation to Foster.

00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:32.772
The townspeople were extraordinarily happy.

00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:39.162
They clubbed together to buy Kennett a gold watch inscribed with a message of thanks.

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:47.322
But the British oyster industry has never fully recovered, and as you might imagine, it took people

00:13:47.412 --> 00:13:50.652
a long time to trust eating oysters again.

00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:58.122
It wasn't just the fear of eating a dodgy oyster and dying of typhoid, though, although that's

00:13:58.362 --> 00:14:00.822
evidently a pretty valid fear.

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:08.352
Oysters were hugely overfished, so the stocks became seriously depleted.

00:14:09.252 --> 00:14:16.212
Oysters take three to five years to grow, so it's very different to most other farmed seafoods.

00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:21.732
When stocks are low, it takes a long time for them to recover.

00:14:23.512 --> 00:14:29.654
By 1964 only 3 million oysters were fished in the UK.

00:14:30.944 --> 00:14:40.754
Remember a hundred years ago, that number was 700 million, so it's gone down to 0.4% of its original

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:41.204
size.

00:14:42.964 --> 00:14:49.629
One thing that has bolstered the UK's oyster industry, though, is the introduction of something

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:57.279
called the Japanese rock oyster, which can be eaten all year round as opposed to just from September

00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.609
to April, like the native British one.

00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:08.799
The old rule for oysters before the introduction of the Japanese rock oyster was that you could only

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:16.689
eat oysters in months with the letter R in them, which is actually every month from September to

00:15:16.714 --> 00:15:17.214
April.

00:15:18.204 --> 00:15:21.294
If you count the months now, they've all got R's in them,

00:15:22.284 --> 00:15:28.524
So if you're eating an oyster and it's not a Japanese rock oyster, then make sure that the month

00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:30.504
you're eating it in has an R in it.

00:15:31.254 --> 00:15:37.344
It's January right now and so on the off chance that you're slurping down an oyster while you listen

00:15:37.344 --> 00:15:40.134
to this podcast, then you don't need to worry too much.

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:45.031
So then what's next in store for oysters?

00:15:45.481 --> 00:15:50.191
Well, as you probably know, they are still considered a luxury food in the UK.

00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:58.141
You might find them at an expensive restaurant served at a fancy cocktail party or at an oyster bar.

00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:05.386
What you certainly won't find is them being handed out for free outside pubs, although that would be

00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:09.916
no doubt, a cunning albeit expensive way of getting customers in.

00:16:11.626 --> 00:16:12.046
Right.

00:16:12.316 --> 00:16:14.566
That is it for oysters.

00:16:14.956 --> 00:16:21.916
Next up, we are going to be talking about another cult British food: fish and chips.

00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:27.226
And don't worry, this isn't just going to be a boring summary of fish and chips.

00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:34.636
In the next episode, you'll learn all about where they really came from, why they aren't served in

00:16:34.636 --> 00:16:41.236
newspaper anymore, and how they could have even helped the Allies win the second world war.

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:45.366
That's all to come in part two of this mini-series.

00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:48.730
As I said, also in the last episode.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:55.210
I want to know what you think of the show and as a little thank you, if you send in your feedback,

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:01.000
then I will correct the English of any feedback you send in no matter how long, and send it back to

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.700

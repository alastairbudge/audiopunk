Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.690
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.729
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three-part

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.420
mini-series on controversial sportspeople and sporting controversies.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.909
In case you missed it, part one was on the self-destructive footballing icon, George Best, part

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:40.509
three is going to be on Lance Armstrong, and today’s episode is going to be on Tonya Harding.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.230
She was a phenomenally talented figure skater and someone who

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.898
almost had it all, before a nasty incident changed everything.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.050
So, let’s not waste a minute and get talking about Tonya Harding,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.640
At half past two, on January 6th, 1994, a 25-year-old American lady called Nancy

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.750
Kerrigan had just finished practising her skating routine at Cabo Arena, in Detroit.

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:18.750
She was one of the best skaters in the country, and a camera crew was there to watch her train.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.840
You can see the footage on YouTube.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.579
Kerrigan is skating around in a white dress and black gloves to classical music.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.190
The camera follows her as she gets off the rink, and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.640
puts on the protective sleeves for her ice skates.

00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:42.164
With telltale 90s music in the background, she heads

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:44.894
through a blue curtain towards her dressing room.

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:52.134
The cameraman switches off his camera, no doubt thinking that he's got the footage he needs, and

00:01:52.134 --> 00:01:57.654
he can clock off for the day, or go and have a cup of coffee on a freezing January afternoon.

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:06.944
But seconds later, just after Kerrigan passed through the curtain, he heard a deathly scream.

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:08.674
It's Kerrigan.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:13.654
He switches on the camera again and rushes through to find

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:18.014
this star athlete on the ground, screaming out in pain.

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:23.954
Confused onlookers try to help her, asking “What happened”.

00:02:25.524 --> 00:02:31.684
All she can do is repeat “Why, why, why?” over and over.

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:38.554
The pain, the grief, it is plain to see on her face and hear in her voice.

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:44.904
This is the look of a young woman who has been viciously attacked for seemingly no reason.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:47.864
She describes what happened.

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:52.294
She was walking and she felt a huge pain in her right leg.

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:59.124
As she fell to the ground, she saw a guy rushing away carrying

00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:03.014
what she described as “some sort of hard black stick”.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:10.034
The video footage then follows men, presumably her trainers and coaches, who

00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:15.114
rush around the arena trying to track down this “white guy in a leather jacket”.

00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:18.674
To no avail, there is no sign of him.

00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:25.334
The attack resulted in serious bruising to her knee and damage to the tendons on her

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:31.154
right leg, her “landing leg”, the leg on which she would land first after a big jump.

00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:37.024
Fortunately, the blow didn’t break any bones, or shatter the knee.

00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:41.334
If it had, it could have meant she never skated again.

00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:47.674
Nevertheless, it was a bad injury and she was forced to pull

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:52.094
out of the tournament she was training for, the 1994 U.S.

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:56.464
Figure Skating Championships, which was scheduled for two days later.

00:03:57.484 --> 00:04:03.324
Kerrigan was one of the favourites to win, and instead, with Kerrigan unable to

00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:09.444
participate, the Gold Medal went to her main rival, 24-year-old Tonya Harding.

00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:14.475
Naturally, there was a police investigation into the assault.

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:20.035
The first question was the one that Kerrigan repeated again and again.

00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:21.585
Why?

00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:24.995
What reason would anyone have to attack her?

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:29.075
They weren’t trying to steal anything from her, it wasn’t like she

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:32.855
was involved in crime or this was the work of a jealous former lover.

00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:37.681
It seemed that the objective of the assault was to injure

00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:41.311
her, presumably so that she wasn’t able to compete.

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:46.401
Remember, the blow was struck to the right leg, her landing leg.

00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:51.101
And who would want her not to be able to compete?

00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:57.911
Well, all eyes turned to who would stand to benefit with Kerrigan out of the picture.

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:03.191
The obvious candidate was her main rival, Tonya Harding,

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.551
the woman who had taken first place in the competition.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:12.261
Harding and Kerrigan were fierce rivals, they were right at the top of

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:17.331
their game as two of the undisputed best skaters in the United States.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.511
But they were very different people.

00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:27.311
Nancy Kerrigan looked like how people expected a skating champion to look.

00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:32.141
She was a classic beauty, full of grace and style.

00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:37.131
A big smile, flowing dark hair, and a petite figure.

00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:43.761
She had not grown up with much money around her, and her father worked multiple jobs to pay

00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:51.071
for her skating lessons, but she was seen as a classy, a sort of fairy-like ice princess.

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:56.661
As a result, she was flooded with commercial deals to promote a

00:05:56.661 --> 00:06:01.151
wide range of products, everything from sportswear to watches.

00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:08.131
This was important because skating was and still is an expensive sport.

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:14.891
Not only is there all of the gear, the fancy clothes and sequined dresses,

00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:19.191
but there’s all the travel, the competitions, the hotels, and so on.

00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:26.331
At this point it was still a relatively poorly paid sport in terms of the money you got

00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:32.161
from winning competitions, so top skaters would take any commercial endorsements they could.

00:06:33.363 --> 00:06:38.613
Now, Tonya Harding, on the other hand, didn’t look like how the American

00:06:38.613 --> 00:06:43.603
public or the American Skating Association expected a skating champion to look.

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:52.253
She wasn’t a classic beauty, she was muscular, fast and strong rather than dainty and graceful.

00:06:53.223 --> 00:06:56.213
She didn’t behave how the American Figure Skating

00:06:56.213 --> 00:06:59.573
Association thought a champion skater should behave.

00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:05.363
She smoked, she drank, and she went on fishing and hunting trips with her father.

00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:12.263
She had grown up very poor, and as the media started to report on Kerrigan’s

00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:18.653
assault, and contrast the two women, Harding was branded as “white trash”,

00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:23.443
someone who shouldn’t be anywhere near the middle-class sanctuary of an ice rink.

00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:28.843
Her personal life in terms of her relationships also didn’t fit with

00:07:28.843 --> 00:07:33.083
the public expectations of what a young sportswoman should be doing.

00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:39.373
She had got married young, at 19, and had filed for divorce  a year later.

00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:45.172
She was, reportedly, talked out of it by the American Figure Skating

00:07:45.172 --> 00:07:51.322
Association, as being a divorced skating champion just didn’t fit the mould.

00:07:52.082 --> 00:07:57.042
In a country that prides itself on family values, this was unacceptable.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:02.552
See, particularly at the time we’re talking about, the late

00:08:02.562 --> 00:08:08.302
1980s and early 1990s, women’s skating was all about appearance.

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:14.642
Women had to meet certain standards not just of beauty and style but of

00:08:14.652 --> 00:08:20.812
lifestyle and behaviour and Tonya Harding didn’t look or act the part.

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:25.462
When she realised that she would never meet these ridiculous standards of

00:08:25.462 --> 00:08:32.182
femininity, she started to lean into her own more tomboy, bad-girl style.

00:08:33.172 --> 00:08:37.122
She wore blue eyeliner, she would dance to the Batman

00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:41.482
soundtrack, she was tired of pretending to be someone she wasn’t.

00:08:42.982 --> 00:08:48.122
Whatever her appearance, she was undisputedly an exceptional athlete.

00:08:49.382 --> 00:08:52.892
She was stronger and faster than most other skaters.

00:08:53.212 --> 00:08:59.842
She was the first American woman to successfully land something called a triple axel jump, where you

00:08:59.842 --> 00:09:09.072
spin around three times in the air, in fact, you spin around 3.5 times, doing a 1,260-degree spin.

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:16.222
Now, I am no skating expert, but to underline quite how amazing this is,

00:09:16.482 --> 00:09:22.442
and what an achievement it was, only 3 American female skaters have ever

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:27.162
successfully managed one in a competition, and Tonya Harding was one of them.

00:09:28.142 --> 00:09:32.402
It requires speed, strength and balance in very high quantities,

00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:37.492
and Tonya Harding had this extremely rare combination of all three.

00:09:38.862 --> 00:09:46.942
So, you have these two rivals, both very talented and skilful but completely different, and in the

00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:53.442
aftermath of the attack, the American media relished in comparing and contrasting the two women.

00:09:54.282 --> 00:09:59.622
Kerrigan, the graceful and flawless one, the one who looks like a princess and who

00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:04.532
ticks all the boxes about how a skating champion should look and should behave.

00:10:05.362 --> 00:10:08.052
And of course, the victim of a violent attack.

00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:15.072
And then Harding, the athletic and powerful one, but the one who has

00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:19.442
really had to fight to get to where she was, battle against the snobbery

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:23.575
of the American skating system and is still something of an outcast.

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:28.892
And the one who had all to gain from her rival being injured.

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.482
Now, back to our story.

00:10:32.192 --> 00:10:37.072
The assault took place on the afternoon of January 6th, and Nancy Kerrigan

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:40.472
was forced to withdraw from the National Figure Skating Championships.

00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:48.541
Two days later, her arch-rival, Tonya Harding, won first place and therefore qualified

00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:53.391
for a place on the US Olympic team that would go to Norway the following month.

00:10:54.865 --> 00:11:00.565
And a week later, on January 13th, the police made an announcement.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.380
They had made an arrest, or rather, arrests,

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:11.655
They announced that they had arrested two men in conjunction with the assault: Shane Stant

00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:16.835
was the man the police believed had carried out the attack, the man who had dealt the blow.

00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:21.809
And the second was a man named Shawn Eckardt.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:30.709
This man, the man who had facilitated the attack, just so happened to be…Tonya Harding’s bodyguard.

00:11:32.409 --> 00:11:36.739
Now, we won’t get into all of the details about the arrests and how

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:40.939
they were caught, but these two men were far from professionals.

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:44.709
They had left tonnes of clues and evidence behind.

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:51.639
The media referred to them as “hitmen”, but they were amateurs and opportunists.

00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:56.029
As a result, it didn’t take long for the police to track them down.

00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:02.989
With the arrest of Tonya Harding’s bodyguard, this set off all sorts of alarm bells.

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:07.259
Something about the attack had seemed fishy before.

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:12.969
But surely, surely this couldn’t have been the work of one of her fellow skaters?

00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:17.889
To arrange a violent attack on a rival so that she was out of the picture,

00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:23.239
this was the stuff of fiction, of Hollywood movies, not of real life.

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:28.529
In the days following the arrests, the dominoes started

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.939
to tumble, the suspects started to talk and tell all.

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:38.129
It was revealed that the ultimate architect of the plot was

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:42.759
none other than Tonya Harding’s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly.

00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:50.239
Now, I should tell you a bit about this relationship, because it's both important and complicated.

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:55.249
Tonya Harding had met Gilloly when she was 15.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:13:01.209
It was a passionate relationship, but, according to Harding, an abusive one.

00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:07.019
Her husband would physically and mentally abuse her, but Harding stayed with him.

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:12.679
At the time of the assault, January 1994, they were still

00:13:12.729 --> 00:13:16.159
living together despite having got divorced the year before.

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:25.559
And when Gillooly, the ex-husband, was questioned by the FBI, he broke down and admitted everything.

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:31.389
He was the mastermind, or at least the main organiser, of the entire thing.

00:13:31.969 --> 00:13:34.649
He had organised and paid for the attack.

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:41.229
But the question on everyone’s lips was “was he really acting

00:13:41.229 --> 00:13:44.749
alone, or was he covering up his ex-wife’s involvement?

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:49.159
How involved was the woman who stood to gain the most from it?”

00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:55.818
Gillooly claimed that it wasn’t his wife’s idea, but that she knew about it before

00:13:55.818 --> 00:14:01.658
it happened and had supported it when he told her, saying that it was a “good idea”.

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:09.088
To this day, Tonya Harding has denied having any knowledge of the plan before it took place.

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:12.248
She would have been horrified, she says, to have

00:14:12.248 --> 00:14:14.368
found out that they were planning to do such a thing.

00:14:15.238 --> 00:14:20.258
Harding and Kerrigan were competitors, not rivals, and she didn’t

00:14:20.258 --> 00:14:24.118
need to injure her competitor to win the competition fair and square.

00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:28.518
But, she hadn’t been telling the complete truth…

00:14:29.608 --> 00:14:36.918
On January 26th, 1994, 20 days after the assault, Tonya Harding gave a press

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:42.358
conference where she admitted that she had discovered that “persons close to her” were

00:14:42.358 --> 00:14:47.288
involved in the attack, but she didn’t immediately report this to the authorities.

00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:51.459
In other words, she had found out that her ex-husband

00:14:51.729 --> 00:14:56.139
organised the assault but she kept this hidden from the police.

00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:02.549
Now, while all of this was going on, there was still the big question of

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:06.219
who was going to go to the Winter Olympics in Norway the following month.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:11.709
Under normal circumstances, the first and second place in the U.S.

00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:14.609
Figure Skating Championships would have won a place on the team.

00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:20.969
But Kerrigan, one of the favourites, had been assaulted and therefore wasn’t able to compete,

00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:27.269
and Harding was living under this cloud of suspicion of being involved in the assault.

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:32.559
As you’ll remember, Tonya Harding did win the national championships,

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:36.699
she came first, so she automatically qualified for the Olympics.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:42.839
And a 13-year-old child prodigy called Michelle Kwan came second.

00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:48.149
As a quick side note, Michelle Kwan has had a super interesting life.

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:54.579
She has guest-starred in both The Simpsons and Family Guy, and is now the US Ambassador to Belize.

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:56.859
But that’s a story for another day.

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:03.489
Taking it back to 1994, it was decided, partly because Kerrigan had

00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:08.759
been assaulted, and also because Kwan was so young, to give Kwan’s place

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:12.649
on the Olympic team to Kerrigan, assuming she could recover in time.

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:18.239
After intense physio and rehabilitation and even more intense

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:22.419
training, she was considered fit enough to go to the Winter Olympics.

00:16:23.489 --> 00:16:28.029
As to Tonya Harding’s place on the team, there were some loud voices

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:32.629
pushing to revoke it, to kick her off the team, but as there was

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:36.329
no proof of her involvement in the assault, these came to nothing.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:41.889
She hadn’t been officially charged with anything; it was strongly suspected that she

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:48.789
was involved in some way, and it seemed incredibly fishy, but nothing was official.

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:53.559
The two representatives of the United States of America in the

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:58.579
Winter Olympics were, therefore, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.

00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:03.009
As you might imagine, or as you might remember from

00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:07.139
the time, this was a media story that wrote itself.

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:13.659
Nancy Kerrigan was the “good one”, the one who had recovered from this violent assault, and

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:20.019
Tonya Harding was the “bad one”, the one who many suspected had ordered the hit on her rival.

00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:22.889
So, what happened?

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:29.499
Well, Kerrigan put in an absolutely stellar performance on the ice, wowing the crowds.

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:35.809
And she almost claimed the gold medal, only narrowly losing out to the

00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:41.419
15-year-old Ukrainian skater, Oksana Baiul, who put in a jaw-dropping performance.

00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:48.099
As for Tonya Harding, she was disappointing, finishing in eighth place.

00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:54.939
And on her return to the United States, things went from bad to worse.

00:17:55.989 --> 00:18:00.669
Failing to tell the police about her husband’s involvement was a serious crime.

00:18:02.069 --> 00:18:07.769
On March 16, 1994, a couple of weeks after the Olympics, it was announced that

00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:13.139
Tonya Harding had pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to hinder prosecution”, which

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:19.564
included helping concoct a cover story for her ex-husband and lying to the FBI.

00:18:20.969 --> 00:18:28.979
She was given three years of probation, a $100,000 fine and 500 hours of community service.

00:18:30.439 --> 00:18:33.019
That was the official, criminal punishment.

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:39.259
But the bigger punishment was the complete obliteration of her skating career.

00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:43.769
She was stripped of her gold medal at the nationals and

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:47.019
given a lifetime ban from American professional skating.

00:18:48.369 --> 00:18:53.959
And throughout this entire story, she was hounded by the media, portrayed

00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:58.779
as the dark and angry woman who tried to cheat her way to the top.

00:19:00.229 --> 00:19:05.639
Given the time that has elapsed since the event, and how she was painted during

00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:10.919
this media circus, she is remembered by many as not just the person who ordered the

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:17.109
assault, but as the person who dealt the blow, the person who swung the baton herself.

00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:24.569
In recent years there has been a renewed interest in telling the truth of Tonya Harding’s story,

00:19:25.109 --> 00:19:32.799
and in many cases, she is painted more as an unwitting victim than as a violent and angry cheat.

00:19:34.189 --> 00:19:40.099
If she is to be believed–and for the absence of doubt, this is the official position of the

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:45.389
authorities–she never wanted this assault, she never knew about it before it took place,

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:51.129
and had she known about it beforehand, she would have done everything she could to stop it.

00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:56.329
The fault lies squarely with her ex-husband who thought this

00:19:56.329 --> 00:20:00.689
could be her ticket, and therefore his ticket, to riches.

00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:06.649
He did it without her consent, and the end result was that her career was

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:12.019
destroyed and she was publicly vilified as the woman who attacked her rival.

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:15.989
Tonya Harding was always an outsider.

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:21.929
She looked different, talked differently, behaved differently and skated differently.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:28.659
Yes, she could have told the police what she knew earlier, but is that enough for

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:33.709
a $100,000 fine and a lifetime ban from doing the only thing she had ever loved?

00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:36.379
I’ll let you be the judge of that.

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:43.189
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:48.899
As a reminder, this is part two of a three-part mini-series on controversial sportspeople.

00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:54.069
Part one was about the self-destructive footballer, George Best, and part

00:20:54.069 --> 00:20:58.899
three will be on another sportsperson who had a crashing fall, Lance Armstrong.

00:20:59.669 --> 00:21:02.709
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:07.039
Do you remember this event, and how the media treated Tonya Harding?

00:21:07.659 --> 00:21:11.929
Do you think she is telling the truth, and do you think her punishment was deserved?

00:21:12.429 --> 00:21:15.759
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

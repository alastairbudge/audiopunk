Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:16.236
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:20.856
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:27.876
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Cryptozoology,

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:34.486
the search for and study of animals that most people believe don’t exist.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:41.076
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of the

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:47.868
bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for this episode and

00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:54.408
all of our other almost 100 other episodes over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:58.778
This is where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:04.528
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:09.718
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:13.588
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:17.588
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:21.098
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:24.178
You’ve probably heard of zoology.

00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:28.748
It’s the scientific study of the behaviour, structure,

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:33.058
physiology, classification, and distribution of animals.

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:36.238
But you may not have heard of cryptozoology.

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:44.558
Essentially, it’s zoology, but for animals that humans haven’t yet officially discovered.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:50.188
It’s not technically a real science, it’s more of a hobby,

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:54.548
but it does have passionate followers all over the world.

00:01:55.588 --> 00:02:02.738
The origins of cryptozoology can be traced back to the 1960s, after a book was published

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:08.758
called “Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées”, or “On the Track of Unknown Animals“ in English.

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:16.378
It was published in 1958 by a Belgian-French zoologist, a man named

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:21.808
Bernard Heuvelmans, who was really the father of modern cryptozoology.

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:28.018
Now, the 1960s was almost the golden era for conspiracy

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:31.318
theories, and for questioning the status quo.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.738
If you’ve listened to the episodes on the Bermuda

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.778
Triangle or The Illuminati, you’ll be familiar with this.

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:45.698
In the post-war years, it wasn’t just the current social order that was

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:50.458
being questioned, with the publication of “On the Track of Unknown Animals“

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:56.168
Heuvelmans was also questioning the existence of certain animals, or rather

00:02:56.378 --> 00:03:01.258
he was suggesting that they did exist, while most people said they didn’t.

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:09.508
From a zoological point of view though, you can see why questioning the status quo might make sense.

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:17.018
Several animals that you or I will recognise today had only relatively recently been discovered.

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:22.148
The giant panda, for example, was only discovered by zoologists

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:27.758
in 1869, and the komodo dragon was discovered in 1910.

00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:35.518
In both of these cases, the existence of these animals was known by locals, but foreign

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:41.638
zoologists had never actually seen them, so they hadn’t officially been discovered.

00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:45.828
Was it so mad to think that there would be other animals that

00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:49.578
hadn’t been discovered by humans, Heuvelmans suggested in his book?

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:56.118
With the giant panda and the komodo dragon, locals had seen these animals and told

00:03:56.118 --> 00:04:02.548
stories about them, and only then had foreign zoologists come to see for themselves.

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:08.838
If these animals had proved to be real, surely there was a possibility that other

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:15.438
stories of sightings of other not-yet-discovered animals could also prove to be true.

00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:21.758
History is, of course, full of stories of sightings of mysterious

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:25.268
animals that have never been officially classified by zoologists.

00:04:27.338 --> 00:04:32.208
From things like The Loch Ness Monster to The Yeti, The Abominable

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:38.248
snowman, Bigfoot, Chupacabra, The Kraken or the giant squid, there

00:04:38.248 --> 00:04:42.608
are reports of sightings of these kinds of animals all over the world.

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:46.988
Don’t worry, though, this episode isn’t going to be about the

00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:50.868
sightings of these animals and telling you that they must exist.

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:55.858
What we are going to try to do is to unpack some of the problems with

00:04:55.898 --> 00:05:01.338
cryptozoology, and of course, there are quite a few, and then we’ll talk about

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:07.108
why it can actually be useful, and why it shouldn’t be dismissed so lightly.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:13.198
The easy answer to ‘what are some of the problems with cryptozoology’ would be

00:05:13.198 --> 00:05:17.318
something like ‘it’s mad and ridiculous - obviously the Loch Ness Monster doesn’t

00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:24.158
exist’, and although that might be true, let’s try to take a more scientific

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:29.428
approach, and give cryptozoology the benefit of the doubt for one minute.

00:05:30.588 --> 00:05:36.818
The first problem with cryptozoology is that, as it isn’t a real science, there’s no

00:05:36.818 --> 00:05:44.348
university degree or academic certification, anyone can do it and this means it often lacks

00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:50.588
a real, rigorous approach to how cryptozoological studies should actually be undertaken.

00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:57.448
In short, the field is filled with conspiracy theorists and amateurs,

00:05:57.518 --> 00:06:03.776
so even if what they were saying did make sense, more pure scientists

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:08.106
don’t take it seriously because it’s not considered a real science.

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:13.606
Our second problem is with the animals themselves, the cryptids, as they’re called.

00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:21.386
These mysterious, yet-to-be discovered animals are in most cases quite problematic.

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:26.676
The Loch Ness Monster, for example, is pretty improbable.

00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:31.766
I imagine you are familiar with the idea of the Loch Ness Monster, but

00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:37.706
essentially the view is that there is a huge sort of creature with a humped

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:44.056
back, that lives in Loch Ness, a long, thin lake in the Highlands of Scotland.

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:50.216
There have been numerous sightings over the years of Nessie, of the

00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:56.436
monster, but they have pretty much all been debunked, proved to be wrong.

00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:01.990
There have even been supposed photos of Nessie, but they

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.560
later turned out to be swans, or even an upside-down canoe.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.260
There have been thousands of sightings of Bigfoot

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.750
across North America, going back hundreds of years.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:23.897
Yet, as you probably know, almost all the sightings have been debunked, and when there have been

00:07:23.897 --> 00:07:31.297
photos taken of Bigfoot, they have proved to be either faked, or of a bear or something like that.

00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:37.267
This isn’t to say, of course, that everyone who thinks that they have

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:42.387
seen Bigfoot, or the Loch Ness monster, or a giant squid, or anything

00:07:42.387 --> 00:07:46.957
like that, this isn’t to say that they are a terrible person and a fraud.

00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:51.037
The sightings of these creatures normally take place

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:55.577
from a long way away, and are very brief and unclear.

00:07:56.407 --> 00:08:01.217
It’s completely natural, especially as we have a knowledge of these creatures

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:05.837
in popular culture that we jump to conclusions about what we’ve seen.

00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:12.747
If you’re at Loch Ness, you’ve heard of the Loch Ness monster and out of the corner of your eye

00:08:12.767 --> 00:08:18.717
you see something popping out of the water for an instant, then going back in, you might remember

00:08:18.717 --> 00:08:25.957
it as bigger than it actually was and jump to the conclusion that it was something that it wasn’t.

00:08:26.817 --> 00:08:34.757
That memory, with time, gets embellished, the thing that you saw gets bigger and bigger, and

00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:41.067
as our memory is far from perfect, you believe that what you saw was the Loch Ness monster.

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:44.607
In fact, it was just an eel or a large fish.

00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:52.837
So, given the fact that a lot of evidence for these cryptids relies on eye-witnesses,

00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:58.237
who can be very unreliable, that’s one reason to be sceptical of cryptozoology.

00:09:00.267 --> 00:09:05.177
Thirdly, and this is especially problematic with the large cryptids, the

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:10.057
large mythical creatures, if one exists, then there must be more than one.

00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:14.437
Most cryptozoologists don’t believe that these are actual

00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:18.837
monsters that live forever and don’t obey the rules of biology.

00:09:19.087 --> 00:09:23.357
They just believe that they are species that haven’t been discovered yet.

00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:28.757
And we know that for a species to continue to exist, they need to

00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:33.137
reproduce, and for that to happen, there needs to be more than one of them.

00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:38.877
And although they may not pay taxes, cryptids would also need to

00:09:38.887 --> 00:09:43.547
obey the rule of the only other thing in life that is certain: death.

00:09:44.397 --> 00:09:48.247
They would need to die, and their remains would need to go somewhere.

00:09:49.257 --> 00:09:55.997
With normal creatures in the wild, we find bones, or remains of these creatures, and that’s

00:09:56.007 --> 00:10:01.177
one of the ways in which we know they exist, even if we haven’t seen a living version.

00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:07.137
We know dinosaurs existed, even if they died out 65 million years ago.

00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:14.107
And from the Loch Ness Monster to the Yeti, from Bigfoot to Chupacabra, there

00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:18.707
are no remains that have ever been found that indicate that these animals ever

00:10:18.707 --> 00:10:19.397
existed.

00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:22.847
Admittedly for the cryptids that

00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:29.327
live in the sea, it’s a bit harder to find remains, but the fact that zoologists have never managed

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:35.277
to find any evidence of the remains of these animals makes it pretty implausible that they exist.

00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:40.347
Finally, from a geological point of view, the existence of

00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:44.007
something like the Loch Ness monster is hard to rationalise.

00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:49.417
If the Loch Ness monster is a sort of modern-day

00:10:49.427 --> 00:10:53.667
dinosaur, how did it get into the loch in the first place?

00:10:54.637 --> 00:11:00.747
The loch, the lake it supposedly lives in, would have been completely frozen over in

00:11:00.747 --> 00:11:08.467
the Ice Age, and the dinosaurs died out about 65 million years before the last Ice

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:15.417
Age, so if all of that is true, where did this huge dinosaur-type animal come from?

00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:17.577
How did it get into the loch?

00:11:18.717 --> 00:11:22.907
There are evidently a lot of problems with lots of these cryptids,

00:11:23.137 --> 00:11:27.287
these monsters, which make their existence pretty hard to believe.

00:11:28.497 --> 00:11:33.647
However, this doesn’t mean that we should denounce anyone who is interested

00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:39.437
in cryptozoology as a complete nutcase, a complete crazy person and fraud.

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:46.787
Indeed, being interested in cryptozoology doesn’t automatically mean that you believe the

00:11:46.797 --> 00:11:52.507
Loch Ness monster is real and that the deep ocean is full of giant squids and sea monsters.

00:11:53.517 --> 00:11:58.287
There are plenty of cryptozoologists who take a more scientific approach,

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:05.117
discounting the more improbable cryptids, so things like Nessie and Bigfoot, but

00:12:05.337 --> 00:12:10.284
being interested in the ones where the evidence for their existence is greater.

00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:18.004
And indeed, we haven’t ‘finished’ discovering new species; new species are still being discovered

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:24.084
every year, and the rate of discovery hasn’t slowed, contrary to what many people think.

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:30.354
In 2019, seventy one new animal and plant species were discovered,

00:12:30.944 --> 00:12:36.074
and it’s estimated that 90% of the animal and plant species that

00:12:36.074 --> 00:12:39.824
exist in the world are still unknown, we haven’t discovered them yet.

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:46.134
The majority of these are insects and plants, but not all of them.

00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:52.604
A paper from the Royal Society, so very much a serious scientific institution,

00:12:53.404 --> 00:13:00.514
this paper predicted that there are at least 160 land mammals that are yet to

00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:06.794
be discovered, and over 3,000 amphibian species that are yet to be discovered.

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:12.414
Will these contain the Yeti, The Loch Ness Monster and giant squids?

00:13:12.874 --> 00:13:19.404
Probably not, but there’s evidently still a lot of the natural world that we don’t fully understand.

00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:24.214
And one positive thing about cryptozoology is that it is an admittal

00:13:24.234 --> 00:13:30.234
that there is still a lot of the world that we are yet to discover.

00:13:31.174 --> 00:13:37.544
Of course, this may not be the golden era of Charles Darwin, or the time where an intrepid

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:43.774
young zoologist could head off on a mission into the jungles of the Congo, the Amazon

00:13:43.774 --> 00:13:49.554
rainforest, or Borneo and come back with a journal full of exciting new discoveries.

00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:55.504
The new animals and plants that are being discovered now are mainly insects,

00:13:55.524 --> 00:14:01.204
and there is a lot of ‘discovery’ that is essentially realising that two

00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:06.114
animals that we had thought were the same were actually two different species.

00:14:07.154 --> 00:14:13.054
It’s not exactly heading into the Himalayas and coming back with evidence of the Yeti, but

00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:19.274
it’s still a valid zoological discovery that helps us better understand the planet we live on.

00:14:20.274 --> 00:14:26.594
Sadly enough though, there are models that predict that a proportion of these yet-undiscovered

00:14:26.674 --> 00:14:32.087
but real animals will be extinct before we can ever discover them, that we will have

00:14:32.097 --> 00:14:37.597
driven them to extinction before they can be discovered and catalogued by zoologists.

00:14:38.947 --> 00:14:46.027
That certainly is a sad thought, but if an interest in mystery animals and cryptozoology can

00:14:46.027 --> 00:14:54.817
inspire a new generation of budding young zoologists to explore the natural world and help conserve

00:14:54.837 --> 00:15:01.277
these rare species that we might never even discover, then that surely has to be a good thing.

00:15:03.687 --> 00:15:11.097
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cryptozoology, the hunt for mysterious animals.

00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:14.937

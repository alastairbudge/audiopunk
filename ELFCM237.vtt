Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:17.156
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.576
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:29.356
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Amazing Names of British Pubs.

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:34.876
There are just under 50,000 pubs in the United Kingdom, and many

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:38.816
of them have amazing names with wonderful stories behind them.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:43.456
So in this episode we are going to look at some of the most

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:47.486
amazing stories behind some popular pub names in Britain.

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:51.616
We’ll learn about the stories of eight different pub names.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:58.916
Names you might know, such as The Royal Oak, and Eagle & Child, and we’ll even look at the stories

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:08.196
of some very strange names - The Drunken Duck, The Swan with Two Necks and The Bucket of Blood.

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:13.686
No matter whether you live in the UK and are a frequent pub goer or

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:17.586
you’ve never been to the country and can’t stand the smell of beer,

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:22.226
I hope you’ll enjoy this episode, as it is full of unusual stories.

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:28.464
OK then, The Amazing Names of British Pubs.

00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:35.264
This episode, as the title suggests, will be specifically about pub names.

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:41.514
We released another episode, episode number 111, just on the history of British

00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:46.354
Pubs, so I’d encourage you to listen to that one if you haven’t done so already.

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:52.464
But we will start with a very brief history of British pubs, to give

00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:57.014
you the background before we get into the question of their names.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:04.724
Pubs in Britain were first established by the Romans, after they invaded in AD 43.

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:11.104
These pubs, which were first called “tabernae”, served food and drink

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:16.284
for Roman soldiers, but were soon adopted by the local population too.

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:24.124
Initially they served wine, but soon after started to serve the local drink, beer.

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:30.474
When the Romans left Britain in the 5th century, the pubs stayed.

00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:36.724
These pubs were, compared to today at least, relatively unofficial.

00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:42.104
Typically one person in a village would be in charge of brewing

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:47.114
and selling beer, and people would come to their house to do so.

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:55.491
So that people knew where to go, the brewer, the owner of the “pub”, would hang something

00:02:55.651 --> 00:03:03.011
outside his house to indicate that it was a place people could drink - normally a green bush.

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:11.931
They used a green bush because the berries from this bush would be used to add flavour to the beer,

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:19.631
so whenever a thirsty traveller saw a green bush, they would know that was a place to get beer.

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:28.011
Fast forward a few hundred years, to 1393 in fact, and pubs had grown even more popular.

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:34.461
If there’s one thing that British people have always liked to do, it’s drink beer.

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:40.931
These pubs had become so popular that the king wanted a more effective

00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:46.191
way to collect tax from them, but given that not all of them had

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:52.241
names, and there wasn’t a centralised record of them, this wasn’t easy.

00:03:53.161 --> 00:04:00.621
So, in 1393, the king ordered that all pubs needed to put a sign outside their door.

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:05.661
This meant that when the royal tax collectors came through,

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.141
they could find the pubs and their lives would be easier.

00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:15.861
The problem was that in 1393 only a tiny proportion of the population

00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:21.501
was able to read and write, and most likely the pub landlord wouldn’t

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:25.731
have been able to write the sign himself, so what did they do?

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:31.845
They created signs with memorable images, and the names followed from that.

00:04:33.102 --> 00:04:38.205
Initially, the signs were typically of obvious things that people

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:44.027
would easily identify: The Star, The Bull, The Sheep, and so on.

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:52.747
But with time, and as new pubs opened, new landlords, new pub owners would name

00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:58.117
their pubs after what was going on in the country, or in the world, at the time.

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:06.847
So, if you are in the UK and you see a pub, you can often tell a lot by the sign hanging outside.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:12.377
You can take a good guess at when the pub might have been founded, you can

00:05:12.397 --> 00:05:17.917
often understand the history of an area from the names of its pubs, there is

00:05:17.927 --> 00:05:22.917
a lot of interesting information you can find just from the name of a pub.

00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:29.467
During the time of the Crusades, for example, it was popular for a pub

00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:35.987
to call itself The Turk’s Head, The Saracen’s Head or The Lamb & Flag.

00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:43.127
The lamb, by the way, represents Christ and the flag refers to the flag of the Crusaders.

00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:49.437
Later on there was a boom in the number of pubs called The Rose & Crown,

00:05:49.627 --> 00:05:55.127
which celebrated the end of the War of the Roses, which happened in 1487.

00:05:56.357 --> 00:06:02.407
When Henry VIII broke with Rome any pubs that had Catholic-sounding names had

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:09.937
to change, so The Ark became The Ship, and St Peter became the Crossed Keys.

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:16.657
You can also see the dominant industry in an area by the names of its pubs.

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:20.847
You’ll often find pubs called The Golden Fleece, The

00:06:21.127 --> 00:06:24.577
Carpenters’ Arms or The Bricklayers’ Arms, for example.

00:06:25.737 --> 00:06:32.447
And then as soon as people started to travel even greater distances around the country you found pub

00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:40.187
names that appealed to them: The Coach & Horses, The Station Inn or The Horse & Groom, for example.

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:47.727
So, without further ado, let’s talk about our first British pub name, The Royal Oak.

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:52.607
This is actually the third most popular pub name in the

00:06:52.607 --> 00:06:56.247
country, and it has an interesting history behind it.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:04.759
Charles I of England became the first and only English king to be executed in 1649.

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:12.139
A couple of years later his son, also called Charles, had tried to lead an army down

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:18.439
from Scotland to take back the throne and take revenge on the man he thought was

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:24.231
responsible for his father’s death, Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the Parliamentarians.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:29.399
The only problem was that Oliver Cromwell had a large and

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.109
disciplined army, and Charles the younger was easily overpowered.

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:40.589
He escaped with his life, but was pursued by the Parliamentarian soldiers.

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:51.316
Cromwell had also put a price on Charles’ head - £1,000, about €200,000 in today’s money.

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:56.266
The soldiers were closing in, they were getting nearer to Charles.

00:07:56.623 --> 00:08:03.066
He realised that his only chance at survival was to climb up a large oak tree

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:09.344
and hide, waiting for the soldiers to leave and praying that they didn’t look up.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:14.878
He hid there all day, while the soldiers searched for him below.

00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:23.218
It worked, he managed to escape to France, and in 1660 he returned and became King Charles II.

00:08:24.368 --> 00:08:31.238
To commemorate this event, and to honour the tree that saved his life, pubs were named after him.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:37.578
The sign typically has a picture of an oak tree, and in some of the

00:08:37.578 --> 00:08:42.588
pubs you can even see a little man hiding at the top of the tree.

00:08:43.508 --> 00:08:45.958
That man was the future king of England.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:53.313
Our second interesting pub name might be particularly amusing to the Italian listeners,

00:08:53.523 --> 00:08:58.907
as it is, if you are pronouncing the pub name correctly in English, The Garibaldi.

00:08:59.842 --> 00:09:03.742
Of course, in Italian it is pronounced more like Garibaldi,

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:07.793
after the revolutionary Italian general, Giuseppe Garibaldi.

00:09:08.473 --> 00:09:11.903
Now, you might be wondering, why are there British

00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:15.863
pubs named after an Italian revolutionary general?

00:09:16.543 --> 00:09:23.063
Well, it may surprise you to find out that while he was in exile from Italy, Garibaldi

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:29.003
actually did a brief tour of Britain, and was greeted as a revolutionary hero.

00:09:29.973 --> 00:09:37.983
He arrived in Tyneside, near Newcastle, in 1854, and was mobbed by adoring fans.

00:09:38.923 --> 00:09:44.663
He cemented his reputation as a man of the people by mixing not just

00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:48.873
with local leaders but also by spending time with the working classes.

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:52.903
He was greeted as a hero everywhere he went.

00:09:53.073 --> 00:09:57.333
There were huge crowds of people waiting to greet him.

00:09:57.773 --> 00:10:03.883
There are even accounts of servants taking his used bathwater, his dirty

00:10:04.013 --> 00:10:08.433
water from his bath, and putting it in little bottles and selling it.

00:10:09.353 --> 00:10:13.128
And of course, pubs changed their name in his honour.

00:10:14.436 --> 00:10:19.653
Our third pub is one whose name has an interesting story, and in which

00:10:19.663 --> 00:10:24.863
many no doubt fascinating conversations have happened: The Eagle & Child.

00:10:26.413 --> 00:10:29.363
Let’s start with the story of the name of the pub.

00:10:29.973 --> 00:10:35.333
It is thought to go back to the 14th century, a time where especially noble

00:10:35.383 --> 00:10:41.213
Englishmen needed to produce a male heir to inherit their title and land.

00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:46.813
A man called Sir Thomas Latham, however, was having no such luck.

00:10:47.763 --> 00:10:54.843
He had a daughter but no son, and try as they might, his wife wasn’t able to get pregnant again.

00:10:55.943 --> 00:11:01.283
He did what was pretty common at the time, and got his maid pregnant.

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:10.133
She did produce the male heir that Sir Thomas so desperately wanted, but this boy was illegitimate.

00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:13.063
So, what did Sir Thomas do?

00:11:13.783 --> 00:11:19.363
He needed a convincing story, and legend goes that he left the baby under a

00:11:19.393 --> 00:11:25.652
tree where he had seen eagles nesting, where there was a nest of baby eagles.

00:11:26.522 --> 00:11:32.722
He then pretended to randomly walk past and “discover” this miraculous

00:11:32.732 --> 00:11:38.162
baby, which he then took home to his wife to adopt as their own.

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:43.832
The wife reportedly accepted this story and adopted the boy.

00:11:44.562 --> 00:11:50.952
The child was brought up as their child, and was in line to inherit Sir Thomas’ estate.

00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:59.832
But on his deathbed, just as he was about to die, Sir Thomas confessed that he was

00:11:59.842 --> 00:12:04.042
actually his illegitimate son, and everything passed to the legitimate daughter.

00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:11.882
And there is one Eagle & Child pub that is particularly famous, and it’s in central Oxford.

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:17.212
It’s said that it was the favourite pub of the authors J.R.R.

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.672
Tolkein and C.S.

00:12:18.702 --> 00:12:22.562
Lewis, the writers of The Lord of The Rings and The Lion, The

00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:26.062
Witch and The Wardrobe, and they would meet there every Friday.

00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:35.542
Next up is a pub called The John Snow, and it is a pub you can find in Soho, in central London.

00:12:36.702 --> 00:12:41.552
If you are a fan of Game of Thrones you might think that this is a reference

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:46.992
to one of the characters in that series, but I’m pleased to tell you that

00:12:47.002 --> 00:12:52.082
this John Snow is significantly more historically important than that one.

00:12:53.492 --> 00:12:57.752
John Snow was in fact the first physician to realise

00:12:57.872 --> 00:13:01.892
that cholera was an infection carried by dirty water.

00:13:03.162 --> 00:13:07.088
In London, starting in the 1830s, there had been

00:13:07.138 --> 00:13:11.078
outbreaks of cholera, and nobody knew what was causing it.

00:13:11.868 --> 00:13:16.958
It was thought to be dirty air, but John Snow didn’t subscribe

00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:20.818
to that theory, he didn't believe that that was what it was.

00:13:22.428 --> 00:13:26.988
John Snow made a detailed map of a small area of Central

00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:30.788
London, and put dots where people had got cholera.

00:13:31.768 --> 00:13:37.568
He realised that all of the victims would have probably got their water from one

00:13:37.808 --> 00:13:43.988
particular water pump, and believed that must have been the source of the disease.

00:13:45.318 --> 00:13:50.748
He persuaded the local authorities to remove the handle from the water pump for a

00:13:50.758 --> 00:13:55.948
short period of time, to see whether this reduced the number of people getting cholera.

00:13:57.298 --> 00:14:03.238
It did, and it was later discovered that the well where the water was being pumped from

00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:09.358
had been contaminated by waste water, and that was where the disease was coming from.

00:14:10.758 --> 00:14:16.618
Although it took some time for Snow’s theory to catch on and to be accepted

00:14:16.728 --> 00:14:22.188
as how cholera was really transported, he is now remembered as a hero, and

00:14:22.198 --> 00:14:26.988
fittingly there is a pub right next to where the pump was named after him.

00:14:28.098 --> 00:14:32.578
We are going to move on to some really unusual names now, starting

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:35.898
with a couple of not particularly pleasant sounding names.

00:14:37.028 --> 00:14:41.038
First, it’s the Hung, Drawn & Quartered pub.

00:14:41.838 --> 00:14:46.308
Now, being hung, drawn and quartered was a particularly unpleasant

00:14:46.368 --> 00:14:52.364
punishment which has fortunately not been bestowed on anyone since 1782.

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:59.974
Long story short, it involves being hung by your neck, then taken down and bits of

00:14:59.994 --> 00:15:04.804
you being cut out of your body and then you’re chopped up into four different pieces.

00:15:05.554 --> 00:15:12.674
Not very nice at all, and it was reserved only for the most serious of crimes, typically treason.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:20.360
And it would normally happen in London, either inside or just outside The Tower of London.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:28.542
So, if you go to the area of The Tower of London today, to 27 Great Tower Street to

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:34.762
be precise, you can enjoy a pint of beer at a pub called The Hung Drawn & Quartered.

00:15:35.882 --> 00:15:40.732
The website for the pub reads “Lighter and brighter since its recent

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:45.285
refurbishment, it's the ideal spot to reflect on the history of the City.”

00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:50.565
I’d just advise not thinking too much about what you used to be able

00:15:50.565 --> 00:15:54.515
to see if you were standing outside this pub several hundred years ago.

00:15:56.075 --> 00:16:03.275
Continuing on our theme of “gory pub names”, next we have The Bucket of Blood,

00:16:03.605 --> 00:16:08.585
in the village of Pillack in north Cornwall, to the very south west of England.

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:14.615
Now, Cornwall in the 18th century was a centre for smugglers.

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:21.245
It had a large amount of coastline, and as ships would return from India and the far

00:16:21.245 --> 00:16:27.855
East, many would smuggle goods into Cornwall to avoid having to pay import taxes.

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:32.605
The government wanted to crack down on smuggling, and

00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:37.045
so sent tax collectors into Cornwall to investigate.

00:16:38.187 --> 00:16:42.535
As you might expect, these tax inspectors were not popular.

00:16:43.825 --> 00:16:49.075
The story goes that one morning, a pub landlord went to collect water

00:16:49.265 --> 00:16:55.165
from the well nearby and as he pulled his bucket up he looked inside and

00:16:55.165 --> 00:17:00.695
found the head of an unpopular tax collector, bobbing around in blood.

00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:08.485
This became a local legend, and in 1980 the new owner of the pub decided to

00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:14.885
change the name from the slightly boring “New Inn” to “The Bucket of Blood”.

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:20.245
Now, we have a couple more, and you will be glad to know that

00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:24.515
they are just unusual, and don’t involve anyone losing their head.

00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:30.795
Our penultimate one, our second last one is The Swan with Two Necks.

00:17:31.735 --> 00:17:37.045
Swans are considered by many cultures to be beautiful, stylish animals.

00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:42.685
It’s not hard to see why - they glide effortlessly across the water,

00:17:43.085 --> 00:17:47.075
they have a pristine white colour, they’re good-looking birds.

00:17:47.485 --> 00:17:52.675
And there was a law passed in Britain in the 12th century stating that

00:17:52.685 --> 00:17:58.155
the swan was a royal bird, and is owned by whoever is king or queen.

00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:04.555
In the sixteenth century, Queen Elizabeth I decided to give a license to

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:10.385
two other organisations, the Vintners and the Dyers, to own some swans.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:17.365
These were wealthy organisations that dealt mainly with importing wine from France.

00:18:18.585 --> 00:18:23.355
But how were you meant to see which swans were owned by the Queen,

00:18:23.925 --> 00:18:27.555
which were owned by the Vintners and which were owned by the Dyers?

00:18:28.245 --> 00:18:33.295
Well, before releasing the birds back into the wild, they made a small

00:18:33.295 --> 00:18:39.595
cut, a small mark, called a small nick, in the orange beaks of the swans.

00:18:40.585 --> 00:18:44.935
The swans that were given to the Dyers got one nick, and

00:18:44.935 --> 00:18:48.815
the swans that were given to the Vintners got two nicks.

00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:54.835
The Vintners, given that they were wine importers and had relationships with

00:18:54.845 --> 00:19:01.025
lots of pubs, encouraged pubs to put signs outside with swans with two nicks

00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:05.565
on their beaks, to show that wine from the Vintners was available there.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:11.085
But over time, as often happens, language becomes corrupted,

00:19:11.355 --> 00:19:16.335
and the swan with two nicks became the swan with two necks.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:22.865
And our final pub name also involves a bird, this time it is

00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:27.385
a Drunken Duck, and this is my favourite story of them all.

00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:34.565
Yes, you can go to a pub in Lancashire, in Northern England, called The Drunken Duck.

00:19:35.345 --> 00:19:40.765
It used to be called The Station Hotel, and legend has it that one

00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:45.833
day the wife of the landlord found a dead duck outside the pub.

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:51.945
She thought, poor thing, but it’s dead, and it would be nice for lunch.

00:19:52.695 --> 00:19:58.115
So she picked it up, took it inside, put it on the kitchen table, and

00:19:58.295 --> 00:20:03.585
started plucking it, pulling its feathers out, ready to put it in the oven.

00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:09.075
But as she was doing this, the duck started to wake up.

00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:14.985
It was nice and warm inside the kitchen, plus someone was pulling all of its feathers

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:22.275
out, so it woke up and was understandably pretty surprised and upset at what was going on.

00:20:23.215 --> 00:20:27.625
So was the landlord’s wife, so she went to see what could have happened.

00:20:28.385 --> 00:20:33.445
She saw that a barrel of beer had broken, and the alcohol

00:20:33.535 --> 00:20:36.945
had spilled out into where the duck was drinking from.

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:42.655
The duck wasn't dead, it was drunk, so drunk in fact

00:20:42.835 --> 00:20:45.975
that it had passed out and looked like it was dead.

00:20:46.865 --> 00:20:50.985
The lady was so sorry about what she had done that she made

00:20:51.005 --> 00:20:55.635
the now almost naked duck a little jumper to keep it warm.

00:20:56.905 --> 00:21:01.215
The story got out, people from far and wide came to see

00:21:01.215 --> 00:21:05.448
this drunken duck, and the pub was renamed in its honour.

00:21:06.955 --> 00:21:11.025
So that is that, a small sample of some of the

00:21:11.055 --> 00:21:14.235
amazing pub names that you will come across in the UK.

00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:22.705
My recommendation to you, if you do go to the UK, is to look out for a pub with an unusual name.

00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:26.065
Go inside, you don’t even need to order anything.

00:21:26.455 --> 00:21:31.485
Strike up a conversation with the person behind the bar about the name,

00:21:31.895 --> 00:21:36.305
and I guarantee you it will be a lot more interesting than you think.

00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:44.945
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Amazing Names of British Pubs.

00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:48.325
We have only had the chance to scratch the surface of

00:21:48.325 --> 00:21:52.095
pub names, and this episode could have been hours long.

00:21:52.795 --> 00:21:56.565
But I hope it has given you a taste, and perhaps you

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.525
might even like to continue this research on your own.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:04.745
There is a great book, by the way, on British Pub Names, called The Old

00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:09.965
Dog and Duck, by a guy called Albert Jack, so if you would like to read

00:22:09.975 --> 00:22:14.295
further into this, then I’d definitely recommend picking up a copy of that.

00:22:15.255 --> 00:22:18.635
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:19.025 --> 00:22:20.825
Have you been to a British pub?

00:22:21.095 --> 00:22:22.865
Do you remember what it was called?

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:28.105
And have you been to a pub called any of the names covered in this episode?

00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:34.985
The Royal Oak is the third most popular pub name in the country, so I’m sure someone out there has…

00:22:35.595 --> 00:22:39.665
Let’s go into this virtual pub and get this discussion started.

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:43.225

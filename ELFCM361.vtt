Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.430
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.530
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.130
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our mini-series on The Great American Con Artist.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.290
If you missed it, in part one we looked at Billy McFarland and Fyre Festival, and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.596
in the next episode we’ll talk about a fake German heiress called Anna Sorokin.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.960
And in today’s episode we are going to talk about a man called

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.590
Brian Johnson, a man better known by the name “Liver King”.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.840
To his millions of social media followers, he was a health and wellness guru, teaching people

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.690
how they too could live happier, healthier lives by returning to an ancestral lifestyle.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.590
Beneath the surface, behind the plates of bull testicles

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.079
and raw meat, the reality was somewhat different.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.100
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about Liver King.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.690
Now, the internet is full of people who will promise to help you become a different person.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.149
Get a better job, make more money, get fitter, be happier,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.119
be a better husband or wife, or even learn English.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.390
Self-improvement, this broad category, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.539
And, as you will no doubt know, everyone has their

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.999
own unique methods and strategies to help you do this.

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:46.812
Learn English in 30 days by joining my unique programme.

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:50.622
Get a beach body in 2 weeks with these 12 steps.

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:54.822
Follow my 10-step program to get the job of your dreams.

00:01:55.912 --> 00:01:56.692
You get the picture.

00:01:57.962 --> 00:02:02.222
And, as you will know if you’ve taken any of these courses, most

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:06.262
of the time the steps are not particularly unique, you will find

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:10.692
the same stuff recycled and repackaged in a slightly different way.

00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:17.132
This is the case most of the time, but sometimes, just sometimes,

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:21.452
someone will come along who has a different proposition altogether.

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:25.982
A proposition so unique, so different to what everyone

00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:29.740
else is saying, that people sit up and take notice.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.494
One such person first appeared on social media in August of 2021.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.776
He was an American called Brian   Johnson.

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:43.626
He would never tell you his name was Brian Johnson,

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:46.556
though, there would be no reference to Brian Johnson.

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:49.126
Brian Johnson was dead.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.236
This man was Liver King.

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:59.176
Now, just in case you need a reminder, “liver” is the large organ that regulates

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:03.569
chemical levels, cleans the blood, and does all sorts of important things.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.669
And the reason he was called “Liver King” is because he would eat

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:16.499
up to half a kilo of raw liver, uncooked liver, every single day.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.359
That wasn’t all.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:24.089
Liver King’s entire philosophy, his entire message to anyone who followed

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.939
him on Instagram, TikTok, or any of his social media channels, was that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.939
the modern world, and modern food, was making people soft and weak.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.899
By returning to an ancestral lifestyle, Liver King claimed,

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.385
you would be happier, healthier, and live a better life.

00:03:46.773 --> 00:03:50.637
An ancestral lifestyle essentially meant going back to how

00:03:50.637 --> 00:03:54.517
people lived thousands of years ago, without any modern comforts.

00:03:55.937 --> 00:04:01.224
And like any good seller of dreams, Liver King distilled this

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:07.215
down to 9 different ideas, ideas that he called the 9 tenets.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:18.365
These are, in order, sleep, eat, move, shield, connect, cold, sun, fight and bond.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.190
And when put together, they all combine for a simple mission, and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.460
I’m quoting directly, “To put back in what the modern world left out”

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.240
Now, what did this mean in practice?

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.033
It meant rejecting much of the modern world, modern food, and modern comforts,

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:44.603
and instead behaving more like a caveman than a 21st century American.

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:51.203
And Liver King’s social media was full of videos of him doing exactly this.

00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:55.693
If you see a video of Liver King–and there are no shortage

00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:59.413
of them online–you’ll first be struck by how he looks.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:06.363
Firstly, he is incredibly muscly, he has a huge chest and huge

00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:10.453
biceps, which are always easy to see because he never wears a shirt.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:14.786
I mean, never, I’ve tried very hard to find a picture of him in a

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:19.386
shirt, but whether it’s TV interviews or even walking around New York

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:24.646
City in the winter, he always wears shorts and no shirt, he is topless.

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:32.203
He also has a big beard and long hair, which makes him look like the stereotype of a caveman.

00:05:33.763 --> 00:05:37.493
But, you might be thinking, there are plenty of people who are muscly

00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:41.759
and look a bit like a caveman, what makes Liver King so special?

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.039
Well, it’s about what you see him doing in these videos.

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:52.929
The most notable thing, which makes up around half of the videos, is of Liver King eating.

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.479
And, of course, he isn’t sitting down with a pizza and coke.

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:04.129
He eats bull testicles, tongue, tail, heart, bone

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.869
marrow, cow’s head, and, of course, plenty of raw liver.

00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:14.118
His philosophy is that humans should eat the whole animal,

00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:19.728
nose-to-tail, horns-to-hooves, and that is what he seems to eat.

00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:23.518
Now, you might think, good on him, if you are going to

00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:25.768
eat meat then you should eat every part of an animal.

00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:32.538
Or you might think, “eugh”, I don’t like the idea of eating raw, cold bull testicles.

00:06:34.038 --> 00:06:36.728
Liver King’s view is certainly the former.

00:06:37.558 --> 00:06:42.898
He believes, and says in practically every interview he does, that processed foods

00:06:43.108 --> 00:06:48.278
are one of the worst things about the modern world, and that by cutting these

00:06:48.298 --> 00:06:54.438
out entirely, by returning to an ancestral diet, our bodies will be healthier.

00:06:55.868 --> 00:06:58.498
You might say, sure, he does have a point.

00:06:59.078 --> 00:07:05.138
The health dangers of processed foods, especially super-processed foods, are well documented.

00:07:05.898 --> 00:07:10.898
And let’s remember that Liver King is American, his audience is mainly

00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:16.358
American, and the US is the capital of super processed, unhealthy food.

00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:21.699
So, it’s hardly surprising that this message resonated with his audience.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:25.469
And what else would you see Liver King doing?

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:28.749
Well, following the other eight tenets.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:33.377
He seems to spend a lot of time lifting heavy weights, challenging

00:07:33.377 --> 00:07:37.397
people to arm wrestles, and showing off his very large muscles.

00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:46.058
He even invented a gruelling workout called The Barbarian, which involves walking one mile, about

00:07:46.218 --> 00:07:53.778
one and a half kilometres, pulling a 50 kg sledge, with a 30 kg backpack on his back, carrying a 30

00:07:53.798 --> 00:08:02.038
kg weight in each hand, and–as if that wasn’t hard enough–he has 10 kg of weights added to each leg.

00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:09.788
So, he ate lots of organs, he lifted heavy weights, what else did this modern caveman get up to?

00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:16.838
He would have ice baths, he would walk around his ranch with his dogs, and throw axes at trees.

00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:23.508
He was on a global mission to advance this “ancestral lifestyle”, going from place to

00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:29.238
place to connect with tribes in everywhere from central Asia to the plains of Africa.

00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:36.966
Along the way, of course, he would stop off for interviews on TV shows and podcasts,

00:08:37.108 --> 00:08:42.518
still topless, of course, where he would talk about his diet, his mission, and how

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:47.988
everyone would benefit from taking a leaf out of his book, from doing what he did.

00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:55.488
Oh, and one thing which I just must add is that if he ever needed a haircut, he would only need to

00:08:55.508 --> 00:09:02.638
ask his wife, his so-called “Liver Queen”, who could cut it with a machete, a large hunting knife.

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:09.721
So, why did he do all of this, what turned Brian Johson into Liver King?

00:09:10.691 --> 00:09:14.251
If you listen to any of his interviews, he would talk about the fact that

00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:19.201
he developed this ancestral lifestyle as a way of surviving after his

00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:23.601
kids were ill, after one had allergic reactions to “the modern world”.

00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:30.055
He realised, so he said, that by feeding his children the traditional

00:09:30.075 --> 00:09:34.725
American diet he was, and I’m quoting directly, killing them.

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:39.755
His kids couldn’t breathe, they turned blue, and the only

00:09:39.755 --> 00:09:43.795
way to save them was by returning to the diet of a caveman.

00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:47.265
Clearly, it’s a powerful message.

00:09:47.635 --> 00:09:51.715
Everyone wants to do the right thing for their kids, Liver King

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:56.675
looked happy and healthy, and he soon gathered millions of followers.

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:02.365
TikTok was his main channel, with almost 5 million followers at the

00:10:02.365 --> 00:10:06.765
time of recording, and Instagram came shortly after, with 2 million.

00:10:07.505 --> 00:10:09.915
He was getting very popular indeed.

00:10:11.265 --> 00:10:15.485
Clearly, for some people it was all a bit of fun, watching this

00:10:15.695 --> 00:10:19.955
slightly strange man eating unusual things and lifting large weights.

00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:25.025
But for plenty of people, it was a powerful message.

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:31.025
What if they too could become happier and healthier by doing what Liver King did?

00:10:31.595 --> 00:10:35.735
Why not give this ancestral living thing a shot, why not give it a try?

00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:40.655
Liver King knew, of course, that simply switching to

00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:44.025
ancestral living isn’t a feasible option for most people.

00:10:44.785 --> 00:10:48.695
You can’t just decide, ok, I’m going to eat fresh bull testicles

00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:53.065
every day from a bull I’ve just killed, and my boss will probably be

00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:57.465
a bit cross if I turn up topless to work every day and stop shaving.

00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:02.515
But no problem, Liver King had a solution.

00:11:03.835 --> 00:11:09.935
If you go to liverking.com, you will find all manner of supplements and snack bars,

00:11:10.155 --> 00:11:14.925
vetted by Liver King himself, that allow you to get all of the nutrition you need.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:19.185
And, as you might imagine, it’s not cheap.

00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:23.825
A bag of protein supplements would set you back $64,

00:11:24.265 --> 00:11:29.095
and a case of 12 Liver King bars costs a mere $42.

00:11:29.945 --> 00:11:35.225
And both were, I quote, “guaranteed to help you dominate your environment”.

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:40.105
Now, it’s not clear quite how much money Liver King made

00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:45.225
selling these, but he claimed more than $100 million per year.

00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:52.165
Whatever the number, it's certainly enough to fund a pretty lavish lifestyle, a private

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:58.085
chef, trips around the world, and a seemingly constant camera crew to film his every move.

00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:03.775
The problem was, was he really practising what he preached?

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:09.555
Yes, there were plenty of videos of him taking ice baths, wandering around with

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:15.115
no shoes and shirts, and, lest I forget, gulping down uncooked bull testicles.

00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:20.355
But something seemed off, something seemed unlikely.

00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:28.305
His muscles were so big, so large, could this really all come down to his lifestyle choice?

00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:33.245
Could you too become like him just by following his lifestyle?

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:38.795
Well, as you have probably guessed given this is part of a series on

00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:42.975
The Great American Con Artist, there was something off with Liver King.

00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:49.425
Many people had claimed that he was on steroids, most famously the podcaster Joe

00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:55.745
Rogan, who said, and I’m quoting directly, “that guy has an assfull of steroids”.

00:12:57.115 --> 00:13:02.805
As a result, as Liver King toured the world, going on podcasts and giving interviews,

00:13:03.075 --> 00:13:08.025
he was constantly asked about this, asked flat out, “do you take steroids?”

00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:12.215
And again and again, he denied this.

00:13:13.215 --> 00:13:18.365
In fact, he embraced it, he seemed to loved being asked about his steroid

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:22.985
use, because it gave him an opportunity to, yet again, promote his

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:27.285
ancestral lifestyle, and his extensive line of products that you could buy.

00:13:28.385 --> 00:13:32.145
Every denial was another opportunity to promote his

00:13:32.315 --> 00:13:35.745
alternative way, to get more customers, to make more money.

00:13:37.145 --> 00:13:41.648
The problem was, at the end of 2022, fewer than  18 months

00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:46.118
after his social media took off, some private emails leaked.

00:13:47.318 --> 00:13:50.088
And these emails were explosive.

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:56.188
It turned out that Liver King was putting something non-ancestral into his body.

00:13:57.248 --> 00:14:03.458
Yes, he was on large quantities of steroids, spending around $11,000

00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:08.088
every month on a wide variety of different drugs to build his muscles.

00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:15.148
This body he had, that he claimed was only possible because of the strict ancestral

00:14:15.148 --> 00:14:20.298
lifestyle that he followed, was in fact made possible by large amounts of drugs.

00:14:21.238 --> 00:14:27.688
He had lied, and it wasn’t just a small lie about accidentally eating a chocolate bar or a hot dog.

00:14:28.228 --> 00:14:32.448
His entire brand, his entire message, everything he

00:14:32.448 --> 00:14:35.648
stood for, was about being natural and ancestral.

00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:40.908
And there he was, pumping his body full of steroids every day.

00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:47.708
The emails were conclusive, they were between him and a private doctor, there was no way he

00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:53.628
could deny them, and he was forced to issue a public apology to his millions of followers.

00:14:54.988 --> 00:15:00.538
Some of whom vowed to never buy anything from him again, others were more forgiving.

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:07.238
And of course, Liver King being Liver King, he also took the opportunity to go on a

00:15:07.308 --> 00:15:12.958
PR blitz, a tour of different shows and podcasts, where he talked about his steroid

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:18.788
use but again, portrayed himself as a victim, someone who only wanted to promote

00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:24.508
this amazing ancestral lifestyle, and someone who got caught up in his own success.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:30.754
Since all of this, which came out in December of 2022, he has

00:15:30.754 --> 00:15:35.874
pledged to be Liver King 2.0, Liver King without steroids.

00:15:37.044 --> 00:15:41.494
And if you go to his social media channels, you can still find him doing

00:15:41.494 --> 00:15:46.224
exactly the same stuff: eating liver, heart and testicles, lifting heavy

00:15:46.224 --> 00:15:51.450
weights, throwing axes at trees, and of course promoting his supplement brands.

00:15:52.824 --> 00:15:58.294
To someone who didn’t know about the steroid revelations, nothing has changed, and no

00:15:58.294 --> 00:16:03.634
doubt he is still selling tens of millions of dollars of Liver King products every month.

00:16:05.034 --> 00:16:09.504
Now, why was Liver King’s message so appealing to so many people?

00:16:10.464 --> 00:16:13.894
Firstly, it was unique, it was strange.

00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:18.294
After all, if you are scrolling through social media and you see a

00:16:18.304 --> 00:16:23.394
video of someone holding a raw cow’s liver, you probably stop and watch.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.594
Secondly, it seemed obvious.

00:16:28.064 --> 00:16:32.804
We know that highly processed foods can be bad for us, and a raw

00:16:32.814 --> 00:16:37.144
bull’s testicle is the polar opposite of a highly processed hot dog.

00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:40.114
Thirdly, it was simple.

00:16:40.714 --> 00:16:44.144
Eat, sleep, connect with nature, do exercise.

00:16:44.634 --> 00:16:48.274
These are all easy things to do, we kind of already know that

00:16:48.274 --> 00:16:51.664
they’re good for us, and it’s an easy message to understand.

00:16:53.034 --> 00:16:57.034
In fact, even disregarding the steroid revelations, much

00:16:57.034 --> 00:17:00.264
of what Liver King was preaching was good, common sense.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:05.414
Fourth, Liver King had a powerful personal message.

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:10.834
He said that he did this to save his kids, and anyone can connect with that.

00:17:12.084 --> 00:17:16.944
Now, given what we know about Liver King’s commitment to the truth, who knows whether

00:17:16.944 --> 00:17:22.354
this was a fabrication to sell more supplements, but to many it was a genuine message.

00:17:23.514 --> 00:17:27.634
And finally, Liver King was living proof of the results.

00:17:28.194 --> 00:17:31.474
You just needed to look at him to see what you could look like

00:17:31.474 --> 00:17:35.274
too if you followed his advice and bought his supplements.

00:17:36.244 --> 00:17:38.784
Except, of course…he wasn’t.

00:17:39.964 --> 00:17:43.994
There might have been some positive elements to Liver King’s message, but his

00:17:43.994 --> 00:17:50.174
entire brand of health and happiness was underpinned by something very un-ancestral.

00:17:51.414 --> 00:17:59.424
To quote Joe Rogan, he had an “assfull of steroids”, it was, after all, one big lie.

00:18:02.234 --> 00:18:06.644
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Liver King, the

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:10.594
pioneer of ancestral living, but occasional steroid junkie.

00:18:11.534 --> 00:18:14.554
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:14.904 --> 00:18:17.564
Had you heard about the story of Liver King before?

00:18:18.234 --> 00:18:20.994
Why do you think Liver King’s message was so appealing?

00:18:21.494 --> 00:18:25.564
What do you think about the idea of eating bull testicles and raw liver?

00:18:26.424 --> 00:18:29.744
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.559
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.640
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.390
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.879
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.050
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.120
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.910
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.120
part two of our mini-series on the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.280
Five Families of New York City.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.410
In part one we looked at the different

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.599
Italian-American crime gangs that

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.713
roamed New York’s streets and warred

00:00:34.713 --> 00:00:36.269
with one another in those early

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.940
days, and how one man betrayed his

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.260
boss and then united the competing

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.280
groups into one criminal network.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.920
In today’s episode, we’ll look a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.710
little more closely at what the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.119
Five Families actually did: their

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.009
businesses and how they made their

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.900
money, their roles in politics

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.450
and trade unionism, and how things

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.710
started to take a turn for the worse.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.430
So, let’s get right into it and talk about

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.540
the Five Families of New York, part two.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.560
It was April 1992, in New York City.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.032
Down in Brooklyn, the streets were

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:17.050
abuzz with activity and anticipation.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.430
Hundreds of reporters, TV crews,

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.409
passersby and police officers

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.340
crammed around the courthouse doors.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.040
Inside, the courtroom was stuffed full

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.790
of lawyers, reporters, guards, and in the

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:35.310
middle of it, a silver-haired man with

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.637
an expensive suit, a smirk on his face.

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:42.717
His name was John Gotti - the Dapper

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:45.857
Don - he was boss of the Gambino

00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:48.227
crime family and the most powerful

00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:51.367
man in New York’s criminal underworld.

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:55.737
Gotti was on trial for multiple murders,

00:01:55.937 --> 00:01:58.797
racketeering, tax evasion, extortion,

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:01.577
loansharking, and illegal gambling.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:05.487
It had been, as you might imagine, a

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:09.007
very high profile case, and Gotti had

00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:11.537
lived up to his persona by waving to the

00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:14.387
crowds and television cameras, even making

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.927
comments to prison guards about how he had

00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:19.317
attracted celebrities to the courtroom.

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:23.107
It had also been a dramatic trial,

00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:25.347
with interruptions for bomb scares,

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:28.157
an attempted hit, or assassination,

00:02:28.407 --> 00:02:30.227
of the sister of a witness, and

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:32.537
even a woman bursting into the

00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:34.447
courtroom screaming that someone

00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:36.997
called ‘Gravano’ had killed her sons.

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:41.257
Sammy ‘The Bull’ Gravano, one of Gotti’s

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:43.557
associates in the Gambino family, was

00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:47.467
on trial for 19 murders and had agreed

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:50.277
to testify against him, claiming that

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:52.717
Gotti had ordered some of the hits.

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.667
Gotti, despite the severity of the

00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:58.067
charges against him, didn’t seem

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.357
to take any of it very seriously.

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:05.057
He smirked and dismissed Gravano, mocked

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.897
the prosecutor’s hairstyle, and even

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:10.617
muttered comments towards the judge, who

00:03:10.817 --> 00:03:12.887
threatened to throw him out the courtroom.

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:16.597
As you might imagine, Gotti was

00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:19.267
no stranger to criminal trials.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.357
That’s how he earned his other

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:23.957
nickname - ‘The Teflon Don’ - because

00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:25.777
nothing ever ‘stuck’ to him.

00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:28.877
Teflon, by the way, is the material

00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:30.717
used on saucepans and cooking

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:33.237
material to stop food sticking to it.

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:37.107
But this time, things were different

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.327
- Gotti’s luck was running out.

00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:43.757
Due to Gotti’s profile, the jury

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:45.997
were kept anonymous during the trial

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:47.737
so they couldn’t be intimidated

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:49.967
or killed, with the prosecutor

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.517
telling them that they shouldn't be

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:54.307
frightened to convict a man like Gotti.

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:56.277
It worked.

00:03:57.177 --> 00:03:59.287
On April the 2nd, Gotti was

00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:02.137
found guilty of all charges and

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:03.967
sentenced to life in prison.

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:07.167
In a press conference shortly after,

00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:09.467
the assistant director of the FBI's

00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:12.057
New York Field Office proudly told the

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:14.967
American people: "The Teflon is gone.

00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:17.687
The don is covered with Velcro,

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.347
and all the charges stuck."

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:24.167
As we learned in part one of this

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.684
mini-series, by the mid-1930s

00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:28.417
the rival factions within New

00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:30.207
York’s Italian-American underworld

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.517
had been carefully, and rather

00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:34.067
professionally organised.

00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:36.877
Instead of being constantly at war

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:39.177
with each other and not only attracting

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:41.107
the attention of law enforcement but

00:04:41.317 --> 00:04:44.437
damaging business, Lucky Luciano called

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:46.287
together the bosses of crime families

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.637
from across the country and established

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:50.617
something called ‘The Commission’.

00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:54.697
Instead of being rivals, the Commission

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.907
put the various Italian-American

00:04:56.907 --> 00:04:58.917
criminal families into one group,

00:04:59.387 --> 00:05:01.707
known as La Cosa Nostra, which was

00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:03.817
run like a business, even having

00:05:03.817 --> 00:05:05.687
an official board and a chairman.

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:09.657
As New York dominated the criminal

00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:11.657
underworld at the time, this

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:15.077
meeting in 1931, also officially

00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:17.607
created New York’s Five Families.

00:05:18.577 --> 00:05:20.861
They were then the Luciano,

00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:23.487
Bonanno, Profaci, Mangano,

00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:25.167
and Gagliano crime families.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.307
These Five Families are, in fact, still

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:31.627
in operation today, although their names

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:33.677
are slightly different - they’re known

00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:36.597
today as the Genovese, Bonanno, Colombo,

00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:38.917
Gambino, and Lucchese crime families.

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:42.737
So if these Five Families were so

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:44.757
strong that they lasted almost a

00:05:44.757 --> 00:05:47.387
century and counting, how did they

00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:49.667
manage it, what did they actually do?

00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:53.337
Well, as a general rule, the more

00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:55.627
illegal the product, the more likely

00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:58.027
the Five Families were to be involved in

00:05:58.027 --> 00:06:00.498
its production, distribution and sale.

00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:04.308
And, as you may know, or remember from

00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:07.598
episode number 261, the US government

00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:10.938
handed organised criminals a bonanza,

00:06:11.098 --> 00:06:13.978
a huge money-making opportunity, when

00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:16.788
alcohol was made illegal in 1920.

00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:20.748
In fact, bootlegged alcohol was the

00:06:20.758 --> 00:06:22.958
first business of the criminal gangs

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.748
that became the Five Families, and

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:27.648
it is how the original gangsters like

00:06:27.798 --> 00:06:30.558
Masseria, Maranzano, Al Capone and

00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:32.668
Lucky Luciano, who we heard plenty

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:34.888
about in the last episode, it's how

00:06:35.048 --> 00:06:37.638
they all made their names in the 1920s.

00:06:38.868 --> 00:06:41.708
These smugglers, or bootleggers, as

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:43.698
they were known, used all sorts of

00:06:43.698 --> 00:06:46.158
ingenious ways to transport alcohol

00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:48.568
from Canada and from the Caribbean

00:06:48.618 --> 00:06:50.558
islands into the United States.

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:54.098
Think fake deliveries, empty trucks

00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:56.688
to confuse the authorities, barrels

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:59.018
with secret bottoms, and all sorts

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.088
of other creative hiding places.

00:07:02.148 --> 00:07:04.518
Once in the United States, the Five

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:07.208
Families organised transportation along

00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.538
rivers to avoid the authorities and

00:07:09.748 --> 00:07:12.111
they smuggled booze between states.

00:07:13.368 --> 00:07:15.578
In those early years, some of the five

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:17.858
families’ other businesses included

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.918
prostitution - which was the thing

00:07:19.918 --> 00:07:21.588
that Lucky Luciano would eventually be

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:24.148
arrested for - as well as pornography,

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:27.058
fraud, and loan-sharking - which is the

00:07:27.058 --> 00:07:29.498
practice of offering loans at incredibly

00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:31.978
high interest rates and getting the money

00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:34.248
back through violence and intimidation.

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:36.658
Another of their major

00:07:36.678 --> 00:07:38.548
businesses was illegal gambling.

00:07:39.528 --> 00:07:42.828
In fact, in 1967 a commission designed

00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:45.618
to investigate organised crime concluded

00:07:45.618 --> 00:07:47.688
that gambling was the main source

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:49.488
of income for the Five Families.

00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:52.564
Some estimates suggest that over

00:07:52.564 --> 00:07:55.128
half of their revenue came from

00:07:55.128 --> 00:07:57.188
their ‘bookmakers’, that is, their

00:07:57.458 --> 00:07:59.648
employees who oversaw the bets.

00:08:00.488 --> 00:08:02.748
They mainly took bets on sporting events

00:08:02.828 --> 00:08:05.363
such as American football, baseball and

00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:08.688
basketball, but also horse racing - which

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.488
is something that was very popular,

00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:13.058
particularly among the Irish community.

00:08:13.898 --> 00:08:16.288
They also ‘fixed’ sporting events,

00:08:16.368 --> 00:08:18.648
meaning bribing players to ensure an

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:20.918
outcome favourable for their bookies.

00:08:22.358 --> 00:08:24.378
And it’s impossible to talk about the

00:08:24.388 --> 00:08:26.808
Five Families and their gambling without

00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:28.988
talking about one place in particular.

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:30.838
And I don’t mean New York.

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.928
I am talking about a city on the

00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:35.488
other side of the country, a city in

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:37.618
the middle of the desert: I’m sure

00:08:37.758 --> 00:08:39.618
you’ve guessed it, it’s Las Vegas.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:42.238
A quick side note is that we have

00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:44.488
an entire episode on Las Vegas,

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:47.708
it’s episode number 154, so if you

00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:49.248
haven’t listened to that one yet, I’d

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:50.958
definitely encourage you to do so.

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:53.608
Bringing it back to the story

00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:55.788
at hand, though, the growth and

00:08:55.788 --> 00:08:58.338
expansion of Las Vegas as the home

00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:00.688
of American gambling is critical to

00:09:00.688 --> 00:09:02.698
the success of the Five Families.

00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:05.158
They worked closely with Jewish

00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:07.688
mobsters like Bugsy Siegel and Meyer

00:09:07.688 --> 00:09:10.898
Lensky, and financed, or paid for, the

00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:12.628
construction of some of the biggest

00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:15.008
hotels and casinos in Las Vegas.

00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:18.508
They also ran them, which was particularly

00:09:18.518 --> 00:09:20.768
profitable as it allowed them to take

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.818
money - known as ‘skimming from the

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:25.498
top’ - before it was declared for taxes.

00:09:26.878 --> 00:09:28.778
Back in New York, the Five

00:09:28.778 --> 00:09:31.518
Families dominated certain sectors,

00:09:31.848 --> 00:09:33.638
sectors that were, on the face

00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:35.418
of it at least, perfectly legal.

00:09:36.748 --> 00:09:39.078
To give you just some idea of how

00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:41.188
dominant the Five Families were in

00:09:41.188 --> 00:09:44.558
certain industries, in 1987 a court

00:09:44.558 --> 00:09:47.478
case concluded that four of the five

00:09:47.478 --> 00:09:50.308
families ran a concrete contractors firm

00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:52.648
together, in conjunction with each other.

00:09:53.898 --> 00:09:57.181
This company, S&A Concrete, was

00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.161
made up of firms connected to the

00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:01.874
Gambino and Genovese families, and

00:10:01.904 --> 00:10:03.755
it was so powerful  that it was

00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:06.145
effectively the only concrete company

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:08.135
in New York that could get contracts

00:10:08.145 --> 00:10:10.336
for jobs worth $5 million or more.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.765
But even that wasn’t enough.

00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:16.625
The smaller contracts, those

00:10:16.635 --> 00:10:19.574
between $2 million and $5 million,

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.445
were given to contractors that

00:10:21.445 --> 00:10:23.565
the Five Families had connections,

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:25.925
and often financial interests, in.

00:10:26.925 --> 00:10:29.295
Any company that won a concrete

00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:31.545
construction contract was forced

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:34.475
to pay a tax of 2%, known as a

00:10:34.685 --> 00:10:36.635
‘kick back’, to the Five Families.

00:10:37.815 --> 00:10:40.045
Essentially, if you wanted to use

00:10:40.045 --> 00:10:42.605
concrete in New York, and clearly

00:10:42.665 --> 00:10:44.675
using concrete is a fundamental part

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:46.685
of building anything in a city, then

00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:49.775
some if not all of the money involved

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:52.445
flowed directly to organised criminals.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.605
And it wasn’t just concrete.

00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:58.085
This system was common in countless

00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:00.815
different sectors, including dry cleaning

00:11:01.085 --> 00:11:03.535
and of course waste disposal - which

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:06.125
is what the fictional mafia boss Tony

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.315
Soprano claimed he did for a living.

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:12.889
Many Five Families members, ‘made men’,

00:11:12.969 --> 00:11:15.519
as they were called, also ran seemingly

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:17.859
legitimate, or legal, businesses

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:19.719
alongside their criminal activity.

00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:23.289
Often these were restaurants, bars, and

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:25.519
nightclubs, and would become hangouts

00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:27.989
not only for New York City’s underworld

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:30.849
but also its celebrities and politicians.

00:11:31.969 --> 00:11:34.349
If you’ve seen any gangster films like

00:11:34.479 --> 00:11:36.769
the Godfather or Goodfellas, you’ll have

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:38.429
an idea of what I’m talking about here.

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:41.759
Think champagne, women in beautiful

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:44.019
dresses, men in expensive suits,

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:46.129
famous singers and celebrities.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:49.509
Perhaps the most famous of all these

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.939
singers was, of course, Frank Sinatra,

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:54.319
whose father was Sicilian and ran

00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:56.299
a bar during the Prohibition era.

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:59.809
His uncle, many believe, was a ‘made

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:01.889
man’ in the Genovese crime family.

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:05.899
But despite all the glitz and glamour of

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.849
the Five Families’ bars and restaurants,

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.819
these were the exception, not the rule.

00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:13.359
For the most part, they were

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:15.669
involved in more boring businesses.

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:18.949
They owned or controlled supermarkets,

00:12:19.099 --> 00:12:21.259
petrol stations, trucking companies,

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:24.029
waste disposal, or trash collection, as

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.239
they would say, and delivery companies.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:29.309
Often these were simply ways of

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:31.434
cleaning, or laundering their ‘dirty

00:12:31.434 --> 00:12:34.039
money’, that's to say, taking their

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:36.079
illegal profits and ‘cleaning’

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:38.159
them by putting them into legal, or

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.599
supposedly legal, business fronts.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:45.129
So, how did the Five Families get away

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:46.469
with all this, you might be thinking?

00:12:47.179 --> 00:12:48.939
Well, clearly there was the threat

00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:51.579
of violence and murder, but they were

00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:54.549
also so deeply embedded in so much

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.089
of American society that they became

00:12:57.089 --> 00:12:59.379
part of the furniture, they greased

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:01.909
the wheels of industry and society.

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:05.449
From trade unions to local government,

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:07.689
the Five Families had their

00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:09.719
fingers in practically everything.

00:13:10.839 --> 00:13:13.469
By the post-war years the Five Families

00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:16.399
had grown so powerful that bosses often

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:20.279
acted as fixers, or middlemen, to settle

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.629
disputes between politicians, trade

00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:25.879
unions, police and other criminal gangs.

00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:28.689
They were like the criminal underbelly

00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:31.519
of society that bound, or held,

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:33.269
all the different parts together.

00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:36.209
What’s more, they held great

00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.199
political influence, bribing

00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:39.879
and corrupting politicians and

00:13:39.929 --> 00:13:41.929
police officers, and threatening

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:43.859
those who didn’t to fall in line.

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:47.669
Frank Costello, for example, the boss

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:49.899
of the Genovese family, was closely

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:51.599
connected to figures in the Democratic

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:54.309
party in New York, and is believed to have

00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:57.049
played a pivotal role in helping William

00:13:57.049 --> 00:14:00.169
O’Dwyer become the city’s mayor in 1945.

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:03.299
But the connection between the

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.409
mafia and politics wasn’t just

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:07.269
a local, or New York, thing.

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:10.809
Incredibly, the Five Families also

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:12.989
played a role in the Second World War.

00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:16.239
In fact it was Lucky Luciano himself,

00:14:16.609 --> 00:14:18.569
the man who created the Commission and

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:20.469
established the Five Family structure.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.719
During the war, the U.S government

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:26.139
requested the help of mafia bosses like

00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:29.179
Luciano to identify potential Italian

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:32.069
spies working on American soil, to use

00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:34.499
their trade union connections to maintain

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:36.809
order in the factories and docks, and

00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:40.149
also, amazingly, to provide Sicilian mafia

00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:43.289
contacts to the US Navy in order to help

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.839
produce maps of Sicily in preparation

00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:48.185
for the Allied invasion in 1943.

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:52.619
Luciano was released from prison as part

00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:54.959
of this deal, which is known as ‘Operation

00:14:54.979 --> 00:14:57.489
Underworld’, and it’s such a good story

00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:59.649
that it probably needs its own episode.

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:04.059
So from local politics all the way up

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:07.239
to wartime operations, politicians and

00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:09.729
mafia members have always had a rather

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:11.739
uncomfortably close relationship.

00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:14.549
And, what did the Five Families

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:16.129
want in return for all of this?

00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:19.039
Well, of course it was a case of “you

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:21.149
scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”.

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:24.279
In return for cash payments or

00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:26.799
political support, the Five Families

00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:28.189
were allowed to go about their

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:30.759
business without fear of interference.

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:35.469
But it wasn’t to last, and as

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.589
so often happens, they got too

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:39.295
successful and too confident…

00:15:40.802 --> 00:15:43.802
Whereas in the past, the original bosses

00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:46.622
and ‘made men’ were more subtle, more

00:15:46.772 --> 00:15:49.172
secretive about who they were, in the

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:52.062
post-war years mafia men started to

00:15:52.062 --> 00:15:54.402
become more like local celebrities.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.702
Like Gotti years later, mobsters began

00:15:58.702 --> 00:16:01.152
to show off their wealth, drive the

00:16:01.152 --> 00:16:03.732
best cars, and wear expensive suits.

00:16:05.072 --> 00:16:07.492
Mafia men increasingly enjoyed the status

00:16:07.492 --> 00:16:08.922
that came with being a member of the

00:16:08.922 --> 00:16:11.532
Five Families - of being ‘made men’.

00:16:12.402 --> 00:16:14.522
All of this was hard for

00:16:14.522 --> 00:16:15.882
the authorities to ignore.

00:16:16.812 --> 00:16:18.822
Government and law enforcement

00:16:18.872 --> 00:16:20.772
took notice, and began to

00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:22.982
crack down on organised crime.

00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:27.262
In 1968, the US Congress passed

00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:29.032
something called the Omnibus Crime

00:16:29.032 --> 00:16:30.622
Control and Safe Streets Act.

00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:33.502
This allowed the use of electric wire

00:16:33.502 --> 00:16:35.912
taps and meant law enforcement could

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.772
listen to the mafia’s conversations.

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:42.037
And crucially, in 1970, Congress

00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:43.677
passed the Racketeer Influenced

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.657
and Corrupt Organizations Act.

00:16:46.387 --> 00:16:49.237
This became known as RICO, which you

00:16:49.237 --> 00:16:51.327
might’ve heard of if you’re into mafia

00:16:51.327 --> 00:16:53.177
movies because it was something that

00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:55.057
wise guys were always worried about.

00:16:56.157 --> 00:16:57.527
And with good reason.

00:16:58.507 --> 00:17:01.697
RICO essentially put into law very strict

00:17:01.737 --> 00:17:03.687
punishments for mafia-type criminal

00:17:03.687 --> 00:17:06.787
activities, and was intended not only to

00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:09.647
put organised criminals behind bars, but

00:17:09.667 --> 00:17:12.187
to frighten others into cooperating with

00:17:12.187 --> 00:17:14.667
the police to avoid serious jail time.

00:17:15.497 --> 00:17:16.647
And it worked.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.587
That same year, in 1970, the Witness

00:17:20.587 --> 00:17:23.027
Security Program, which relocated

00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:24.887
and created new identities for

00:17:24.887 --> 00:17:26.657
former mob members who cooperated

00:17:26.657 --> 00:17:28.187
with the government, was created.

00:17:29.337 --> 00:17:33.017
From 1976 to 1982, the undercover

00:17:33.037 --> 00:17:36.257
FBI agent Joe Pistone managed to

00:17:36.307 --> 00:17:38.840
infiltrate the   and Colombo families

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.270
using the alias ‘Donnie Brasco’.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.910
If that name sounds familiar it’s

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.050
because it’s another iconic mafia

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.110
movie, and an extremely good one, if

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.970
you haven’t seen it, with Johnny Depp

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.880
as the FBI agent and Al Pacino as a

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.530
member of the Bonnano crime family.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.960
Based on Pistone’s, or rather,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.370
Donnie Brasco’s undercover operation,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.480
dozens of Five Family members

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.160
were arrested and convicted.

00:18:06.178 --> 00:18:08.753
Another major blow to the Five Families

00:18:08.893 --> 00:18:11.183
was the legalisation of casinos outside

00:18:11.183 --> 00:18:14.273
Nevada which happened in 1978, and

00:18:14.483 --> 00:18:16.393
was something that removed the mafia’s

00:18:16.393 --> 00:18:18.553
firm hold over the gambling industry.

00:18:19.743 --> 00:18:22.373
As the 1980s rolled along, practically

00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:24.793
every Five Family boss and capo

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:27.543
was in jail or awaiting trial.

00:18:28.903 --> 00:18:31.563
And as law enforcement tightened its

00:18:31.563 --> 00:18:34.213
grip on the mob, the mafia began to

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:37.543
turn on one another and Omertà, their

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.173
code of silence, began to break down.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:45.113
In 1991, Alphonse D’Arco, the acting

00:18:45.113 --> 00:18:47.193
boss of the Lucchese family, became

00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:49.303
the highest-ranking member to break

00:18:49.303 --> 00:18:52.523
the code, and his evidence put dozens

00:18:52.543 --> 00:18:54.323
of Five Family members in prison.

00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:58.373
By the mid-1990s, hundreds of Five

00:18:58.373 --> 00:19:00.503
Family members and associates began

00:19:00.523 --> 00:19:02.423
giving each other up, that is to say,

00:19:02.593 --> 00:19:04.523
giving evidence against one another,

00:19:04.883 --> 00:19:07.333
including a Colombo family capo and

00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:09.883
consigliere, and a Lucchese family capo

00:19:09.883 --> 00:19:12.733
and underboss - high ranking, made men.

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:17.433
This was an important step, as for anyone

00:19:17.503 --> 00:19:20.283
found, or even suspected, to be talking

00:19:20.283 --> 00:19:22.733
to the police, the punishment was swift.

00:19:23.513 --> 00:19:26.463
In 1990 the acting boss of the

00:19:26.463 --> 00:19:28.453
Lucchese family, a man known as

00:19:28.513 --> 00:19:30.833
‘Louie Bagels’, had murdered a man

00:19:31.013 --> 00:19:33.003
called Bruno Facciolo in Brooklyn.

00:19:33.896 --> 00:19:36.413
Facciolo, it would transpire, was a

00:19:36.413 --> 00:19:38.623
member of the Lucchese family who was

00:19:38.623 --> 00:19:40.953
cooperating with the authorities, breaking

00:19:41.003 --> 00:19:43.573
the strict code of silence, of omertà.

00:19:44.713 --> 00:19:46.893
Just like the death card was placed in

00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:49.403
Joe ‘The Boss’ Masseria’s dead hand back

00:19:49.413 --> 00:19:52.313
in 1931, as you might remember from the

00:19:52.313 --> 00:19:55.133
introduction to episode one, Louie Bagels

00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:57.933
stuffed a dead bird into Facciolo’s

00:19:57.933 --> 00:20:01.003
mouth to send a message: “you sing to the

00:20:01.003 --> 00:20:02.973
feds, you’re going to get your head blown

00:20:02.973 --> 00:20:05.573
off,” as it was described in the trial.

00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:09.403
But the authorities were winning,

00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:11.333
the Five Families were shrinking.

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.103
By the early 21st century, the

00:20:14.103 --> 00:20:16.173
Italian-American mob was a fraction

00:20:16.323 --> 00:20:18.593
of the size it used to be, and the

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:21.603
FBI even began to cut funding from

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:23.533
the organised crime task forces that

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:25.363
were investigating the Five Families

00:20:25.543 --> 00:20:28.283
to instead focus on anti-terrorism.

00:20:29.383 --> 00:20:32.823
And as the 2000s became the 2010s, the

00:20:32.823 --> 00:20:35.593
Families were down but not completely out.

00:20:36.613 --> 00:20:39.133
They remained active in New York, mostly

00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:40.833
in their traditional businesses like

00:20:41.023 --> 00:20:43.053
loan-sharking and illegal gambling,

00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:46.003
but their power bases in trade unions

00:20:46.003 --> 00:20:48.023
and politics, and their monopoly

00:20:48.023 --> 00:20:50.473
of industries, was all but gone.

00:20:51.763 --> 00:20:53.973
Whereas in the past each family would

00:20:53.973 --> 00:20:56.113
have had hundreds or even thousands of

00:20:56.113 --> 00:20:59.933
associates, in 2019 the FBI estimated

00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:02.503
that there were just 3,000 members

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:04.323
and affiliates of Italian-American

00:21:04.373 --> 00:21:06.473
organised crime in the entire country.

00:21:07.523 --> 00:21:09.543
Changing police tactics and technology,

00:21:09.783 --> 00:21:11.773
and the imprisonment of hundreds of ‘made

00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:14.903
men’ in the 1980s and 1990s, along with

00:21:14.903 --> 00:21:17.243
the legalisation of gambling, the decline

00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:19.343
of trade union power, the shrinking of

00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:21.393
traditional Italian neighbourhoods and

00:21:21.393 --> 00:21:24.043
the arrival of new waves of migrant groups

00:21:24.223 --> 00:21:26.453
- and their criminal gangs - this all

00:21:26.463 --> 00:21:29.653
squeezed the original “Five Families” out.

00:21:30.933 --> 00:21:34.083
So, today, this stereotyped idea of

00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:35.973
the Italian-American gangster, it

00:21:35.973 --> 00:21:38.233
has been largely relegated to our

00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:40.493
imaginations, and to the big screen.

00:21:41.643 --> 00:21:44.293
When the going was good, it was very good.

00:21:44.873 --> 00:21:46.853
But it wasn't to last forever.

00:21:48.023 --> 00:21:49.813
As the head of the Gambino family,

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:52.443
Paul Castellano, once put it, “this

00:21:52.473 --> 00:21:54.833
life of ours, this is a wonderful life.

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.083
If you can get through life like this

00:21:57.203 --> 00:21:59.473
and get away with it, hey, that’s great.

00:21:59.943 --> 00:22:01.963
But it’s very, very unpredictable.

00:22:02.303 --> 00:22:03.543
There are so many ways

00:22:03.693 --> 00:22:04.533
you can screw it up.”

00:22:05.803 --> 00:22:07.893
That is to say, Castellano and

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.713
other members of the Five Families

00:22:10.003 --> 00:22:11.753
knew the type of life they were

00:22:11.753 --> 00:22:13.713
signing up for, and that, for

00:22:13.713 --> 00:22:16.213
most of them, it would never last.

00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:21.083
OK then, that’s it for part two

00:22:21.093 --> 00:22:22.803
of this mini series, and this

00:22:22.823 --> 00:22:24.983
exploration into the Five Families.

00:22:25.313 --> 00:22:26.613
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:22:26.913 --> 00:22:28.523
and whether you knew a lot about

00:22:28.523 --> 00:22:30.103
the Five Families or the New York

00:22:30.143 --> 00:22:32.063
mafia, or this was the first time

00:22:32.063 --> 00:22:33.733
you’d heard anything about it, well

00:22:33.913 --> 00:22:35.243
I hope you learned something new.

00:22:36.373 --> 00:22:38.433
As always, I would love to know what

00:22:38.433 --> 00:22:40.003
you thought about this episode, and

00:22:40.123 --> 00:22:41.763
about this mini-series in general.

00:22:42.283 --> 00:22:43.593
How many Italian-American

00:22:43.593 --> 00:22:45.253
mafia movies have you seen?

00:22:45.553 --> 00:22:47.533
Have you watched them in the original?

00:22:48.013 --> 00:22:49.253
How many of the characters in

00:22:49.253 --> 00:22:51.213
today’s episode had you heard about?

00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:53.083
Why do you think we have such

00:22:53.083 --> 00:22:54.763
a fascination with this part of

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:56.183
New York history and culture?

00:22:56.563 --> 00:22:58.533
I would love to know, so let’s

00:22:58.533 --> 00:22:59.923
get this discussion started.

00:23:00.294 --> 00:23:01.256

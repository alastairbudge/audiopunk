Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:16.089
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.969
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:25.042
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a game.

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:31.362
It’s a game that anyone can play, it’s a game that anyone can win, a game that everyone has the

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:37.392
same chance of winning, and what’s more, it's a game that can make you spectacularly wealthy.

00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:40.072
It is, of course, The Lottery.

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:42.812
Now, perhaps you play the lottery.

00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:43.912
Perhaps you’ve won.

00:00:44.692 --> 00:00:48.802
Even if you’ve never played the lottery, you probably have some idea

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:53.242
about how they work, but in this episode we’ll go a little deeper.

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:59.152
We’ll look at how the money from lotteries is actually distributed, why this is

00:00:59.232 --> 00:01:03.372
at times controversial, we’ll look at what we can learn from the lottery about

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:08.282
human decision making, and hear about some people who have scooped the jackpot.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:12.302
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:21.642
On November 6th last year, November 6th of 2022, a 30-year old man with a long black

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:28.092
ponytail walked into a petrol station called Joe's Service Center in Altadena, California.

00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:41.242
He picked up a lottery ticket and chose his numbers: 10, 33, 41, 47, 56, and 10 for the powerball.

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:50.135
The odds of winning the jackpot were small, 1 in over 300 million, but Edwin Castro

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:56.615
no doubt crossed his fingers, hoping that that night might just be his lucky night.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:03.965
The draw for the numbers was slightly delayed, but a day later the winning numbers were announced.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:11.185
10, 33, 41, 47, 56, and 10 for the Powerball.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.195
Castro’s numbers exactly.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.325
The jackpot was over 2 billion dollars.

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:26.215
Now, almost nothing was known about Edwin Castro, as he preferred to remain anonymous.

00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:32.095
His cover was blown, however, when another person came forward and claimed that the

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:36.625
winning ticket was actually his, although Castro has been fighting this tooth and nail.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:41.115
I guess you would if you stood to lose almost a billion dollars,

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:44.035
which was what he was left with after paying his tax bill.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:52.625
When Edwin Castro became the biggest lottery winner in history, his life changed overnight.

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:58.915
He bought a $25 million house, sports cars, and hired a team of bodyguards.

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:05.175
He might have been in the headlines, but he wasn’t the only winner that night.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:09.575
The federal government collected almost a billion dollars in taxes,

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.585
the Californian school system hundreds of millions in new funding.

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:20.335
Even the owner of the gas station that sold the ticket pocketed a cool one million dollars.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:26.635
His advice to Castro was “be smart, watch your money, no

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:30.025
matter how much money you have, don't go with bad people”.

00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:37.055
Time will only tell whether Castro heeds his advice, whether he follows these

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:42.395
wise words, but one thing is for sure: his life will never be the same again.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:47.445
Now, lotteries exist in countries all over the world.

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:51.845
Statistically speaking, there is probably some form of lottery

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:55.895
where you live, and you probably know something about how they work.

00:03:56.955 --> 00:04:01.405
In case you need a reminder of what a lottery is, a lottery is a form

00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:06.595
of gambling that involves the drawing of numbers at random for a prize.

00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:12.155
Participants buy tickets, and the winners are selected through a random draw.

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:17.605
Prizes are normally cash, money, and they can be very large.

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:24.700
Of course, the size of the prize depends on how many people buy tickets, but the general

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.820
idea is that it’s possible to win smaller sums of money for getting some but not all

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.620
of the numbers right, while the top prize will be a life-changing amount of money.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.207
In terms of the history of the lottery, it might surprise you to find out

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.620
that lotteries in some form or other have existed for over two thousand years.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.970
There are records of a form of lottery that date back to the second century BC in Han Dynasty China.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.070
Even back then they were used to finance major state projects,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.590
major works that needed the financial support of the population.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.870
And they were a pretty efficient way to do this.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.130
Clearly, a ruler who tells their population, ok, we need everyone to contribute a

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.070
Euro because we need to build a big bridge they are not going to be very popular.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.390
And someone who raises taxes isn’t going to be so popular either.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.080
But someone who says, ok, we are going to run a competition.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.190
You can pay a Euro to enter it and you might win a million Euros.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.000
Well, humans are humans, and people in ancient China liked that idea as much as

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.020
Californians do in the 21st century, and there are records of this kind of state-organised

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.710
lottery that go back to the Han Dynasty, 100 years before the birth of Julius Caesar.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.400
And some form of lotteries can be found all over the world, throughout history.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.730
The ancient Romans had one, the Low Countries had them in The Middle Ages.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.300
Queen Elizabeth I of England even established a state lottery in the 16th century to pay for major

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.940
infrastructure projects, and the founding fathers of the United States used lotteries to raise

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.620
money for everything from founding universities to buying cannons during the revolutionary war.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.220
They were an important part of nation building.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.620
Thomas Jefferson even wrote, about lotteries, “far from being

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.410
immoral, they are indispensable to the existence of man.”

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.850
And today they are big business, with hundreds of millions of people playing the lottery each week.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:44.230
So, the first question to address is how likely is it that you will win the lottery if you play?

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.650
If we’re talking about Edwin Castro type amounts, of winning the

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:56.180
US Powerball, the odds are incredibly low, one in over 300 million.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:05.050
To put it another way, if you live to the age of 80, you are 20,000 times more likely to

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.860
be struck by lightning during your lifetime than you are to win the Powerball jackpot.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.760
And most people who win don’t win large amounts of money.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:24.230
In fact, as far as the UK national lottery is concerned, the average prize is £9, around €10.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.730
This is skewed by the fact that there are tens of thousands of smaller

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.970
winners every week, winning as little as a £2 ticket, which is not exactly

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.530
what most people think of when they think about “winning the lottery”.

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:44.158
To state the obvious, if you play the lottery, like any form

00:07:44.158 --> 00:07:47.368
of gambling, statistically speaking you will lose money.

00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:53.268
In fact, if we look at the lottery purely through the lens of “what is a

00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:57.308
cost efficient way of gambling”, what gambling options mean you are most

00:07:57.308 --> 00:08:02.418
likely to make money, lotteries are some of the worst ways to make money.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:08.231
Betting on Blackjack can return up to 99%, meaning that

00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:13.631
for every €10 you bet, you get on average €9.90 back.

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:24.031
Roulette is between 95% and 97%, betting on sports typically returns 90-95%, Slot machines

00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:32.091
tend to be between 80-95%, scratch cards between 60-75%, but betting on the lottery?

00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:38.651
It can be as little as 40%, so for every €10 of lottery

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.671
tickets you buy, statistically you’ll get €4 back.

00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:49.871
And if you live in a country that taxes lottery winnings, well, the amount will be even less.

00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:57.791
And to underline, this is certainly not me advocating other forms of gambling, far from it.

00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:04.439
As is abundantly clear, the house always wins, but lotteries are typically down

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:08.669
there with the least efficient forms of gambling when it comes to winning money.

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:16.139
So, if the money doesn’t go back into the pockets of people who play the lottery, where does it go?

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:22.129
Well, much like in Elizabethan England and Han Dynasty China, a

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:26.309
large chunk of the money gambled goes back into government projects.

00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:33.159
With the UK lottery, just over 50% goes towards the prize winners,

00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:38.619
25% goes towards “good causes” as set out by the British parliament.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:43.039
12% goes directly to the UK government as a tax.

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:50.769
4% goes to the shops that sell the tickets, and 5% goes to the private company that runs

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:56.339
the National Lottery, which is allowed to make a profit of a total of 1% of total sales.

00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:03.050
The numbers to focus on here are firstly the 50% number, so only

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.170
50% of the total amount wagered goes into the pot for winners.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.900
And then the second number, the 25% that goes towards “good causes”.

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:21.487
Of these “good causes”, 40% of the money is awarded to health, education, environment

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:29.637
and charitable causes, 20% goes to Sports, 20% to Arts and 20% to Heritage.

00:10:30.777 --> 00:10:37.367
And in the UK at least, these “good causes” do a lot of good, from buying

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:41.537
books for schools through to helping refugees assimilate in Britain.

00:10:42.637 --> 00:10:47.087
Because of how popular the Lottery is in Britain, a lot of money

00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:51.677
goes into these good causes, €2 billion a year to be precise.

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:57.347
And it’s a similar story in most countries around the world where lotteries are allowed:

00:10:57.877 --> 00:11:02.987
they are heavily regulated by the government and there is a requirement that a sizable

00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:08.397
chunk of the money raised through ticket sales goes into some form of community project.

00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:15.397
But, and there is always a but, as you may know, one of the main criticisms of

00:11:15.397 --> 00:11:21.347
the lottery, at least the UK national lottery, is that some of these “good causes”

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:25.897
involve projects that are unlikely to be used by people who play the lottery.

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:34.367
In the UK, there is a clear inverse correlation between income and national lottery participation.

00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:40.184
In other words, the higher your income, the less likely you are to play the lottery.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:46.534
Yet the National Lottery continues to fund projects like the National Opera House in London,

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:53.024
giving money to organisations used by people who typically do not participate in the lottery.

00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:59.314
Indeed, there have been several reports that have looked at exactly where national lottery funding

00:11:59.324 --> 00:12:06.594
goes, both in terms of geographical area and type of organisation, and found that areas with the

00:12:06.674 --> 00:12:13.174
highest rates of participation in the lottery are often the least likely to receive lottery funding.

00:12:14.584 --> 00:12:20.594
And this, at least in the UK, is one of the main criticisms of how the funding works,

00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:26.414
that it is a tax on those who are least able to pay it that goes towards projects enjoyed

00:12:26.414 --> 00:12:31.834
by those who need the least financial support, and further contributes to inequality.

00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:36.004
Essentially, it is a stealth tax on the poor.

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:44.554
But, and here’s another but, the counterargument to this is that by characterising it as such one

00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:50.814
assumes that people buying lottery tickets are in some way being tricked, taxed against their will.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:57.824
As far as the UK is concerned, most surveys show that people have a pretty good idea

00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:02.144
about where their lottery ticket money is going, and they are very happy with it.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:07.674
24% of lottery players in the UK say that a major reason

00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:11.704
for playing the lottery was that “it goes to good causes”.

00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:17.694
And this brings us on to a particularly interesting element of the national lottery,

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:23.714
and it’s what economists, psychologists and sociologists believe we can conclude

00:13:23.744 --> 00:13:28.764
about human behaviour and decision making from the global popularity of the lottery.

00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:36.104
Firstly, there is an economic theory called the Rational Choice Theory, which suggests

00:13:36.264 --> 00:13:41.284
that human beings make rational choices based on the information available to them.

00:13:42.484 --> 00:13:47.334
If you only have one Euro in your pocket and you can choose to buy either a bottle

00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:52.724
of water or a chocolate bar, if you are hungry you’ll buy the chocolate bar and

00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:56.644
if you are in the middle of a desert and thirsty you’ll buy the bottle of water.

00:13:57.454 --> 00:14:00.714
You make the best decision, the rational decision.

00:14:02.034 --> 00:14:07.494
The National Lottery in some ways, disproves this theory, or at least shows

00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:12.924
that humans make decisions irrationally, based on emotions rather than reason.

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:18.410
As we discussed a few minutes ago, the return from the lottery is one

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.800
of the worst forms of gambling, so participation in the lottery is

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.210
confusing to economists because it is, in economic terms, irrational.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.550
But this brings us onto our second point, which is

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.000
an economic theory called “Expected Utility Theory”.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:45.130
This theory suggests people make decisions based on the expected outcomes of these decisions.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:52.000
In other words, they consider the utility, or overall satisfaction, that each potential

00:14:52.218 --> 00:14:57.434
outcome would provide, weighing this by the probability of each outcome occurring.

00:14:58.744 --> 00:15:03.754
This probably sounds like economic jargon, so let me explain it more plainly.

00:15:05.024 --> 00:15:08.762
When taking any decision, economists suggest  that a

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:12.342
person considers all of the benefits of that decision.

00:15:13.572 --> 00:15:18.992
When it comes to playing the lottery, the benefits might include winning money, but

00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:24.142
also include the enjoyment and thrill of seeing whether your numbers come up, they

00:15:24.142 --> 00:15:28.712
include the ritual of doing something every week, perhaps with friends or family.

00:15:29.702 --> 00:15:32.532
They also include enjoying the choice of numbers.

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:37.682
Perhaps that’s enjoying choosing new numbers every week, perhaps it is remembering

00:15:37.682 --> 00:15:41.522
the same dates or numbers that have a particular significance for them.

00:15:42.532 --> 00:15:47.842
And, as you heard earlier, for one in four lottery ticket buyers in the UK, there

00:15:47.842 --> 00:15:52.162
is also the knowledge that a proportion of their money goes towards good causes.

00:15:53.082 --> 00:15:57.142
So, when viewed through the eyes of this particular economic

00:15:57.152 --> 00:16:00.842
theory, playing the lottery can be very rational indeed.

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:08.132
Now, our third economic theory to look at the lottery through is the sunk cost fallacy.

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:13.742
This is the idea that many people tend to continue to do something because they

00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:18.122
have already spent time or money doing something and they don’t want it to be

00:16:18.432 --> 00:16:23.932
wasted, even though, rationally speaking, they would be better off simply stopping.

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:31.062
As far as the lottery is concerned, it is a prime example of the sunk cost fallacy.

00:16:32.222 --> 00:16:39.482
Many players who play every week state that the reason to do so is to recoup, to get back, some

00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:44.042
of the money that they have spent in the past, thinking that if they haven’t won anything for

00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:49.846
months, their numbers are bound to come up soon and they will be able to recoup their losses.

00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:54.326
As you’ll know, the probability of winning does not

00:16:54.336 --> 00:16:57.066
depend on how many times you have lost in the past.

00:16:57.796 --> 00:17:03.006
A person who has spent €10,000 on the lottery and not won a cent will have

00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:06.916
exactly the same probability of winning as someone who has never played.

00:17:07.966 --> 00:17:12.846
Yet the first person will often think that they must win soon, hence

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:16.816
they keep on buying tickets to try to recoup their earlier losses.

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.896
So, that is the sunk cost fallacy.

00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:25.126
Now, I want to finish this episode with a story about one of the most famous

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:31.483
lottery winners in the UK, a story with a perhaps surprising and confusing twist.

00:17:33.004 --> 00:17:38.716
In 2002, when he was only 19 years old, a man called Michael Carrol

00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:44.626
won almost £10 million, something like €20 million in today’s money.

00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:51.701
When he won the jackpot, he was working as a rubbish collector, and he even needed to

00:17:51.711 --> 00:17:56.471
open his first bank account to receive the money; he didn’t have a bank account before.

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:02.541
Needless to say, the win changed his life overnight.

00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:09.191
One day he didn’t have a bank account, the next he had one with a seven-digit balance.

00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.291
He was completely hounded by the British tabloids,

00:18:14.501 --> 00:18:17.971
with stories of his life splashed all over the papers.

00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:21.821
There was, in fact, a lot of material.

00:18:23.021 --> 00:18:27.521
After he won, he splashed out on a large mansion, and held

00:18:27.611 --> 00:18:32.001
almost constant drink and drug fuelled parties with prostitutes.

00:18:33.381 --> 00:18:37.691
And things started to go downhill quickly for Michael Carrol.

00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:42.941
His wife left him, he was sent to prison for drink and drug related crimes.

00:18:43.517 --> 00:18:47.423
He was blackmailed repeatedly, and in one horrible incident

00:18:47.733 --> 00:18:52.241
criminals killed five of his dogs in an effort to get money from him.

00:18:53.721 --> 00:18:55.581
And the money started to run out.

00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:59.571
Indeed, 9 years later it was completely gone.

00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:04.441
He was declared bankrupt, he became homeless, and only later

00:19:04.631 --> 00:19:08.561
managed to get a job delivering coal on a minimum wage.

00:19:09.371 --> 00:19:13.061
So, what’s the story, the moral, the lesson here?

00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:18.511
Well, many newspapers were quick to point fingers and say, “what a

00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:22.821
terrible person, he must regret squandering this opportunity, he must

00:19:22.821 --> 00:19:26.791
live in a constant state of remorse, winning the lottery is a curse!”

00:19:28.211 --> 00:19:32.301
In fact, there is a somewhat happy ending to this tale.

00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:37.041
He got back together with his wife, and apparently lives

00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:40.511
a very happy life now, albeit a very different one.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.447
In an interview with one of the very tabloids that hounded him,

00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:50.047
he declared “I don’t look back with any regrets that’s for sure.

00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:54.057
It was 10 years of fun for a pound, you can’t go wrong with that.

00:19:54.687 --> 00:19:56.267
I wouldn’t want to turn the clock back.

00:19:56.387 --> 00:20:01.847
But I live a good, free lifestyle now and I’m happier because I’ve got my life back.”

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:03.367
End quote.

00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:08.817
In other words, yes he is happy now, but no, he doesn’t

00:20:08.827 --> 00:20:12.797
regret a minute of the 10 years of lottery-fueled hedonism.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:18.507
Indeed, he even says that he still plays the lottery, hoping to win big

00:20:18.507 --> 00:20:23.067
again, but warned the journalist that “money is the root of all evil”.

00:20:24.427 --> 00:20:29.027
I’m not quite sure what to make of this, but I am sure that the story of

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:33.907
Michael Carrol doesn’t fit neatly into any economist or psychologist’s model.

00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:41.729
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration of the lottery, how it works,

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:46.929
the economic theories behind it, and a brief look at some of the lucky winners.

00:20:47.499 --> 00:20:50.639
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:54.799

Do you know anyone who has?

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:04.979
What are some stories, happy or unhappy, of lottery winners from your country?

00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.669

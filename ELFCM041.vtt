Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.924
English.

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:17.464
The show where you can learn fascinating things about the world and listen to weird and wonderful

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:21.274
stories at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:28.834
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Great Train Robbery.

00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:40.699
In 1963, just outside London, a train carrying today's equivalent of 55 million pounds, 65 million

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.319
dollars, was stopped.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:52.564
A group of men got onto the train and 15 minutes later they had managed to escape with all of the

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:53.044
money.

00:00:54.514 --> 00:01:02.944
Today we are going to tell this story - the story of one of the greatest thefts in British criminal

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:03.574
history.

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:11.464
Before we do that, though, this is just my chance to remind those of you listening to this podcast

00:01:11.464 --> 00:01:19.474
on Spotify, iVoox, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts that you can

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:26.149
get a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.629
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.249
If you haven't yet tried listening to the podcast with the transcript in front of you, well you are

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:41.659
missing a trick, it means that you can follow every single word and improve your English way faster

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.939
than you would do just by listening.

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:51.469
And it also comes with the key vocabulary, which means that you can learn new words and expressions

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.529
at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:56.779
So go and check that out.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.089
It's at Leonardoenglish.com

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.799
Okay then let's talk about this fantastic crime.

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:17.959
At about three o'clock in the morning on the 8th of August, 1963 a Royal Mail train was on its way

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.939
from Glasgow to London.

00:02:22.034 --> 00:02:30.434
It was carrying about 2 million pounds in cash, that's about 55 million pounds in today's money.

00:02:31.304 --> 00:02:38.804
It was carrying so much cash because there had just been a bank holiday, a public holiday, in

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:39.434
Scotland.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:50.334
The cash it was carrying was a whole load of old bank notes, old money, and it was carrying this old

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:55.134
money to London to be burned and taken out of circulation.

00:02:57.294 --> 00:03:06.014
So, at three o'clock in the morning, the train slowed down as the driver saw a red signal telling

00:03:06.014 --> 00:03:07.274
the train to stop.

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:11.354
They stopped, but the signal was still red.

00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:16.394
So the driver got out of the train to investigate.

00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:25.784
When he went to look at the light, he was grabbed from behind and a man said, in a harsh voice, 'if

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:27.974
you make a sound, I'll kill you'.

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:31.604
They took him back to the train.

00:03:32.354 --> 00:03:40.951
They tied up the other workers in the first two carriages of the train and then they detached the

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:47.341
first two carriages, they separated the first two carriages of the train from the rest of the train.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.682
And then the first two carriages were driven for a few miles further up the track.

00:03:56.132 --> 00:04:02.852
What this meant was that the workers in the rear part of the train, the bit behind, they didn't have

00:04:02.852 --> 00:04:06.062
any idea that anything was wrong.

00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:11.612
They thought they had just stopped because of a routine, a normal problem.

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:21.158
When the train had moved a few miles up the track, the gang of robbers, they managed to get into the

00:04:21.158 --> 00:04:25.748
second carriage where all of the cash, all of the money, was being kept.

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:31.029
They overpowered the guards and got all the money out.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:41.949
They threw the 120 bags full of cash down an embankment to their accomplices, their fellow robbers,

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.939
who were waiting with cars nearby, the getaway drivers.

00:04:47.178 --> 00:04:56.640
In a matter of 15 minutes, the thieves had escaped with over 2 million pounds, as I said, about 55

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.890
million pounds in today's money.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.620
And this was all cash, right?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.580
It was all paper.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.620
It weighed about two and a half tonnes.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.260
So that's heavier than the average car.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.210
That was how much money they stole.

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:19.665
So it was pretty impressive to get all of that out of the train in under 15 minutes.

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:27.881
The police were alerted as soon as the guards in the back section of the train realised that

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:28.931
something was wrong.

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:35.171
And of course the police spent the next day on the hunt for the criminals.

00:05:36.621 --> 00:05:39.441
But the gang was nowhere to be found.

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:41.811
The police tried everything.

00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:47.241
They spent all day asking around in the local houses and farms.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:55.791
They sent a special robbery squad to the area - this was a team of people who were familiar with the

00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:58.731
criminal underground to see if they would have any luck.

00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.981
They searched the houses of known criminals.

00:06:03.221 --> 00:06:12.401
They questioned the girlfriends and known associates of some of the UK's most infamous criminals.

00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:15.731
But still they had no luck.

00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:25.928
Five days after the robbery, though, on August the 13th they received a tip-off, a suggestion, from

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:34.973
a local farmer that they should go and look into a place called Leatherslade farm, a farm which was

00:06:34.973 --> 00:06:40.163
about 20 miles or 30 kilometres, from the scene of the crime.

00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:49.043
The farmer said that he had seen lots of people coming and going, there had been an increase in

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:52.973
activity, and it was definitely abnormal.

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:55.650
So he said to the police, you should go and have a look at it.

00:06:56.957 --> 00:07:01.112
When they arrived at the property, they found it deserted.

00:07:01.902 --> 00:07:06.342
But they knew pretty soon that they were onto something.

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:16.082
They saw 20 of the Royal Mail bags, with no money inside of course, and they also found the getaway

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:19.412
vehicles, the cars used for the robbery.

00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:24.194
But the thieves had been pretty careful.

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:32.504
They had wiped everything down, they had cleaned the property, to avoid leaving any fingerprints or

00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:35.384
things that would be clues for the police.

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:43.944
However, the police found a game of Monopoly alongside real money.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:53.026
The men had so much cash that instead of playing with Monopoly money, with the fake money, they just

00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:53.986
played with real money.

00:07:54.316 --> 00:07:58.906
I mean, they had two tonnes of it, so why not?

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:08.446
Anyway, while playing Monopoly was no doubt good fun, it wasn't a good idea because on one of the

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:16.981
Monopoly pieces, on the game pieces, the police found fingerprints which helped identify some of the

00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:17.371
men.

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:27.294
A week later, they managed to track down and arrest one member of the gang and within the next two

00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:34.674
weeks, thanks to tip-offs, thanks to people telling the police about the identity of some of the

00:08:34.674 --> 00:08:39.534
others, they had managed to start tracking the rest of the gang.

00:08:40.164 --> 00:08:45.684
They'd managed to identify a lot of the men and they'd managed to locate some of them.

00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:55.076
The police discovered that the gang consisted of a total of 17 people, 15 of whom were actually

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.296
physically present at the robbery

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.356
So who were these men?

00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:01.466
What did they all do?

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:10.061
Well, it really was a bit of a mix, a motley crew, and they all played a slightly different role.

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:17.051
There were the big guys, the guys who were there to threaten the drivers, to be the muscle.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:23.441
There were the getaway drivers, the men who were waiting in the cars.

00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:32.291
Then there were those responsible for things like dividing up the money and for buying the farm.

00:09:34.091 --> 00:09:44.751
We know who they all are now apart from one person, and that man was the man inside, the person with

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.481
the inside knowledge of the Royal Mail.

00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:55.001
The person who knew exactly when and where the train would be, the person who knew where the money

00:09:55.001 --> 00:10:00.671
would be and who told the gang how to actually get away with the attack.

00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:10.691
The true identity of that man, although there are some theories, the true identity has never been

00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:11.411
revealed.

00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:18.871
And now that all of the men who took part in the robbery are no longer around, they've all passed

00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:22.921
away, his identity will never be revealed.

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:29.721
But the rest of the men were captured, they were arrested by the police.

00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:37.886
This didn't happen at the same time, and it wasn't until April of the next year that they were

00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:40.916
actually sentenced, that they were sent to prison.

00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:46.826
But the story most certainly does not end there.

00:10:48.026 --> 00:10:56.306
Several of the men escaped from prison, running away to places like Belgium, France, Canada,

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:58.226
Australia, and Brazil.

00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:07.831
The most famous escapee, the most famous of the men who managed to escape, was called Ronnie Biggs.

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:16.971
He was only 32 when he was caught and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:27.069
But after 15 months in prison, he managed to escape, climbing over the prison walls of a maximum

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:28.929
security prison in London.

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:39.379
He fled, he ran away, first to Brussels and then to Paris where he had plastic surgery to change his

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:41.389
appearance, for obvious reasons.

00:11:42.659 --> 00:11:50.099
He then fled to the other side of the world, to Australia, and when the police got close to him

00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:57.299
there, he fled on a passenger ship with a fake passport to Panama and then to Brazil.

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:07.469
In Brazil, he was safe, comparatively speaking, as Brazil didn't have an extradition treaty with the

00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:07.919
UK.

00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:15.689
This meant that the Brazilian government didn't have to deport him, to send him back to the UK, to

00:12:15.689 --> 00:12:16.589
be tried.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:23.009
So he lived pretty openly in Brazil for almost 30 years.

00:12:23.813 --> 00:12:28.941
He couldn't work though, given his status as a known criminal.

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:33.801
So he used to host barbecues at his house.

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:41.961
Tourists could pay to go and have a barbecue with one of the most famous robbers of all time.

00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:51.711
However, the story doesn't end particularly happily with Caipirinhas on the beach for Ronnie Biggs.

00:12:53.091 --> 00:12:59.946
His health deteriorated, it got worse, and he longed to return to the UK.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:07.284
And in 2001 he did return, but he was immediately arrested.

00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:16.914
Even though he was in his seventies he had committed a pretty serious crime, and he still had 28

00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:19.734
years to serve of his sentence.

00:13:20.694 --> 00:13:25.599
So he was put back in prison, and he served another eight years.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:35.589
In 2009 he was released from prison on what's called 'compassionate grounds', basically he was very

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:35.889
ill.

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:40.269
And he died four years later in 2013.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:49.459
I should add that although this crime has gone down in history and has been romanticised quite a

00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:56.244
lot, including I guess what we're doing here on this podcast, it was obviously a pretty serious

00:13:56.244 --> 00:13:59.924
crime and not completely victim-free.

00:14:01.364 --> 00:14:09.254
During the robbery, one of the guards of the train, a man called Jack Mills, was hit over the head

00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:10.964
with an iron bar.

00:14:12.364 --> 00:14:19.564
Although he wasn't killed, he suffered severe brain damage and never properly recovered from his

00:14:19.564 --> 00:14:20.014
injuries.

00:14:21.009 --> 00:14:24.459
So it was definitely not victimless, the crime.

00:14:26.062 --> 00:14:28.716
And it obviously was a pretty serious crime.

00:14:29.226 --> 00:14:37.656
It was the biggest cash robbery, the biggest theft of physical money in Britain for 40 years, until

00:14:37.656 --> 00:14:42.846
it was eclipsed by a robbery in Northern Ireland in 2004.

00:14:44.496 --> 00:14:52.416
In any case, The Great Train Robbery has gone down in history, and you will find references to it

00:14:52.686 --> 00:15:02.586
throughout British pop culture, from Beatles lyrics to Agatha Christie, from Inspector Clouseau to

00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:11.706
James Bond, it's everywhere and it has had an impact on British culture like no other crime, I

00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:12.066
guess.

00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:20.841
Not just because it's a huge robbery, but it's also a story of escapes from prison, a global

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:26.511
manhunt, and then the ultimately sad end for many of the robbers.

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:31.971
Okay then, that is it for today's episode.

00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:38.691
I hope you've enjoyed it and I certainly hope that it hasn't inspired you to start robbing trains.

00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.901
As I said, the story doesn't end well.

00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:49.521

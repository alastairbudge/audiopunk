Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:16.025
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.295
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:27.755
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our four-part mini-series on the theme of Scotland.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.865
In case you missed them, part one was on “weird Scotland”,

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:35.235
where we talked about unusual Scottish facts and traditions.

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:40.635
Part two was the amazing story of when Donald Trump tried to build a golf course in the north

00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:45.215
east of the country, only to come up against stiffer opposition than he had bargained for.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:50.482
Part there, today's episode is going to be on Scottish independence  and

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:54.802
part four, the last part, will be on the gruesome Glencoe Massacre.

00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:02.894
OK then, let’s ask ourselves a big question: “will Scotland ever be independent?”

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:08.614
As you may remember from part one, I am not just partly

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:12.324
Scottish, but I spent part of my childhood living there.

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:18.494
From the age of 7 to 13, I lived just outside Edinburgh, the capital.

00:01:20.154 --> 00:01:26.364
One of my great friends at school was a boy called Josef, and he had a dream.

00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:32.994
Most of the other boys at our school wanted to be footballers or firemen or

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:39.094
police officers, but he wanted to be the first ever Scottish Prime Minister.

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:46.804
Unfortunately, he wouldn’t achieve this goal, mainly because in 1999, when he

00:01:46.804 --> 00:01:52.454
and I were 12 years old a 61-year-old Scottish politician called Donald Dewar

00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:57.234
got there before him, becoming the so-called “First Minister” of Scotland.

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:05.004
Importantly, this was not of an independent Scotland, but of a devolved one.

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:10.544
In other words, Scotland had the ability to make some decisions about

00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:15.564
how it was governed, but it did not become an independent state.

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:20.554
The independent state is the United Kingdom, which

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:24.494
consists of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:31.824
But, as you may well know, there is a growing movement in Scotland not just for

00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:38.404
further autonomy, but for complete independence, to become a state of its own.

00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:45.994
Now, in just a single episode we don’t have time to go into all of the history between Scotland

00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:52.844
and its neighbours, but to cut a very long story short, Scotland and its nearest rival,

00:02:53.294 --> 00:03:00.814
England, fought for centuries before uniting as a single country in 1707, creating the Kingdom

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:06.423
of Great Britain, the precursor to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:14.373
So the “Scottish” have been “British” for over 300 years, but if you

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:19.133
go to a pub almost anywhere in Scotland and you ask 10 people their

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:24.383
nationality, I would be very surprised if even one said “British”.

00:03:25.093 --> 00:03:26.433
They would say “Scottish”.

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:32.333
People in Scotland have a fierce sense of their heritage, they are

00:03:32.353 --> 00:03:37.233
proud to be Scottish, and a sizable proportion of the country feels

00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:42.273
that the nation should take the next step and become fully independent.

00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:47.822
To be precise, “sizable” here means almost half.

00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:54.383
In September of 2014, the people of Scotland were given the opportunity to

00:03:54.383 --> 00:03:59.923
have their say on the matter; there was a referendum on Scottish independence.

00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:07.873
It was tense, but 55% of the population voted against it, saying that life

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:12.213
would be better as part of the United Kingdom than as an independent country.

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:18.833
Now, that was 10 years ago, and a lot has changed since then.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.683
Although there hasn’t been a second referendum on the matter, there is still

00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:28.903
a strong push both from the grassroots and from mainstream politicians.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:34.563
In fact, the current First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, is

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:38.703
a supporter of another referendum, and of Scottish independence.

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:45.623
So, let’s start with the why, why do supporters of independence feel

00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:49.368
that the country would be better off without its southern neighbours?

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:56.493
As you might imagine, the reasons are many, they are both emotional and practical, and they

00:04:56.493 --> 00:05:03.283
vary in importance by individual, but I’ll try to give you a broad overview of the key reasons.

00:05:04.423 --> 00:05:08.463
The first category of reasons has to do with cultural identity.

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:14.093
Scotland is a different country, with different traditions and heritage.

00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:19.213
It is not the same country as England, it’s not the same as Wales or Northern Ireland,

00:05:19.443 --> 00:05:25.263
it has its own distinct culture therefore it should be its own distinct country.

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:29.383
The second is to do with the Scottish economy.

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:35.163
Although, like the rest of the UK, there are parts of Scotland that are very

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:40.023
economically deprived, there is a lot of optimism about Scotland’s economy.

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:45.883
It has oil reserves in the North Sea, a strong financial services centre in

00:05:45.883 --> 00:05:51.973
Edinburgh, strong exports in the form of whisky and food products, and a thriving

00:05:51.993 --> 00:05:56.773
tourism industry, with 14 million people visiting the country every year.

00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:04.063
But, Scotland isn’t an independent country, so the majority of the taxes

00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:09.963
collected in Scotland first go to Westminster, to the UK government, before

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:14.483
being given back to the Scottish people according to certain calculations.

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:19.833
This makes no sense, say the proponents of independence.

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:25.693
Imagine a family where there is one child who is very talented and works hard,

00:06:26.103 --> 00:06:31.103
does paper runs, works on Saturday and also tutors other children at their school.

00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:35.423
They make a lot of money every week, but they need to give it to their

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:39.203
mother, who then distributes it between all of her four children.

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:46.813
If Scotland were an independent country then it could have full control over its tax revenues,

00:06:47.163 --> 00:06:53.163
meaning that they were spent more efficiently, and delivered better value for Scottish people.

00:06:54.723 --> 00:06:59.503
And on the subject of politics, this brings us onto our third category of

00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:06.123
reasons, that as part of the UK, Scottish people have to live under laws and with

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:12.303
decisions made by people outside Scotland, often ones that they do not agree with.

00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:19.683
At the moment, as part of the UK, Scottish voters elect members of parliament

00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:23.743
who represent their interests in Westminster, in the British parliament.

00:07:25.243 --> 00:07:30.253
But given that Scotland is a small country compared to the rest of the UK,

00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:37.883
just 5.5 million out of 67 million, these MPs are always in the minority.

00:07:39.213 --> 00:07:45.323
Now, Scotland actually has more MPs per person than England does, with Scotland having

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:51.203
just under 9% of the total seats in the British parliament but only 8% of the population.

00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:58.313
Yet there is still the feeling that decisions are made in London, not for the benefit of

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:04.413
Scottish people, and often decisions that Scottish people do not agree with and do not want.

00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:08.693
There are a few clear cases of this.

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:15.673
For example, the UK’s nuclear submarine programme, Trident, is operated from Scotland.

00:08:16.803 --> 00:08:21.813
But nuclear weapons, and nuclear power, are generally unpopular in Scotland.

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:27.433
The ruling Scottish party, the Scottish National Party, have said in

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:32.233
no uncertain terms that if Scotland becomes independent, these nuclear

00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:36.823
submarines and all nuclear plants will be removed from the country.

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:42.513
Or, about a very different subject, the Scottish parliament recently proposed

00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:47.093
a new law that would make it easier for people to legally change their gender.

00:08:47.803 --> 00:08:53.513
And this was blocked by the UK parliament in London, meaning it was stopped in its tracks.

00:08:54.953 --> 00:08:59.913
And of course, the biggest one in recent years was the Brexit referendum.

00:09:01.253 --> 00:09:08.043
The UK overall voted to leave the European Union, but the split between the four countries

00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:14.543
within the UK, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, was stark, it was large.

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:24.173
In the largest country, England, 53.4% of people voted to leave, but in Scotland,

00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:32.463
that number was only 38%, with 62% of the population voting to remain in the EU.

00:09:33.753 --> 00:09:38.313
But England is much larger than Scotland, so the end result

00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:43.973
was 52% of the UK population voting to leave, and leave we did.

00:09:45.223 --> 00:09:50.893
Now, this episode isn’t going to be about the rights and wrongs of leaving the EU, but the

00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:57.813
point is that it was an irreversible decision, and one that Scottish voters did not support.

00:09:58.823 --> 00:10:05.023
Independence is the only solution, its supporters say, of taking back democratic control.

00:10:06.313 --> 00:10:13.893
And for those with particular EU sympathies, independence would be the only way to rejoin the EU.

00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:20.363
Now, these are some of the key arguments for Scottish independence.

00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:24.333
As you’ll see, they are both emotional and practical.

00:10:25.753 --> 00:10:30.513
On the “better together” side, the people who support Scotland remaining part

00:10:30.523 --> 00:10:35.383
of the United Kingdom, the reasons tend to be more practical than emotional.

00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:41.623
Sure, there are some people who put forward this idea of British identity

00:10:41.623 --> 00:10:45.733
and the fact that England and Scotland belong together, but these

00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:50.113
arguments are much more infrequent than on the “independence” side.

00:10:51.663 --> 00:10:55.533
Those in favour of staying part of the UK tend to point to

00:10:55.533 --> 00:11:00.063
practical reasons, and put these into two broad categories.

00:11:01.343 --> 00:11:05.413
The first is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the economy.

00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:10.633
One of the main reasons that the Scottish economy is so strong, so the

00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:16.613
anti-independence argument goes, is that it is seamlessly integrated into the UK.

00:11:17.663 --> 00:11:23.883
If Scotland became an independent country, it would be tiny, and in a much weaker position

00:11:24.113 --> 00:11:29.343
without the negotiating power and size of its southern sibling, the United Kingdom.

00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:34.193
Or realistically, its biggest and richest component, England.

00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:40.103
There are also question marks over whether Scotland would be able to continue to use

00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:45.573
the British pound, its currency, if it gained independence, and what might happen if it

00:11:45.573 --> 00:11:50.503
were forced to either create its own currency, or wait until it was accepted into the

00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:55.773
European Union, which could take many years to happen and was not guaranteed to happen.

00:11:57.193 --> 00:12:04.763
Ultimately, breaking up with the UK would be a huge economic risk, and a completely unnecessary

00:12:04.763 --> 00:12:10.633
one, given the great economic value that Scotland gets from being part of a larger union.

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:14.133
At least, that’s the economic argument.

00:12:15.393 --> 00:12:22.303
And similar but not exactly the same is about what this would do to Scotland’s place in the world.

00:12:23.883 --> 00:12:28.703
As I mentioned before, the population of Scotland is 5.5 million.

00:12:29.763 --> 00:12:35.373
The UK is not huge, just under 70 million people, but if Scotland became

00:12:35.383 --> 00:12:39.813
independent it would go from being part of the 22nd biggest country in

00:12:39.813 --> 00:12:46.373
the world to the 117th, comparable to Norway or Lebanon in population.

00:12:47.483 --> 00:12:53.183
Scotland had a place on the world stage as part of Britain, but as a small

00:12:53.323 --> 00:12:57.863
independent country it would be in a far weaker position when it came to

00:12:57.863 --> 00:13:01.733
negotiating with other countries, attracting foreign investment, and so on.

00:13:03.253 --> 00:13:08.323
Now, I imagine that you will recognise many of these arguments, on both sides, as

00:13:08.323 --> 00:13:13.143
being similar to those used in other areas where there are pushes for independence.

00:13:14.123 --> 00:13:18.776
We have lots of listeners from Spain, and you might be sitting there in Catalonia

00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:23.673
or the Basque country nodding your head, thinking that Scotland is not all so

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:28.703
different, and these are arguments repeated by people on both sides in your country.

00:13:30.213 --> 00:13:35.673
But where some differences may lie is on what comes next.

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:42.583
As you heard, the Scottish people have already been given their opportunity to vote on

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:49.923
the matter; there was a referendum in 2014, and 55% of the population voted against it.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:55.323
It was billed as a “once in a generation” opportunity by the

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:59.643
Scottish National Party, a chance to shape Scotland’s destiny.

00:14:01.203 --> 00:14:05.113
The language here was clearly used to encourage people to

00:14:05.163 --> 00:14:09.753
take a chance and vote for independence but it backfired.

00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:16.063
When there were pushes for another referendum just a few years later, the British government

00:14:16.103 --> 00:14:21.933
pushed back and said “hey, you can’t have a once in a generation opportunity every five years”.

00:14:23.453 --> 00:14:29.183
The reason to push for it so soon after the first one was because of Brexit, because there

00:14:29.183 --> 00:14:34.983
had been a material change in the situation of Scotland, but nevertheless, it was rejected.

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:38.493
So, what comes next?

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:43.473
The two parties in the Scottish parliament that hold a majority both support

00:14:43.533 --> 00:14:48.273
holding a referendum on Scottish independence, and they would push for independence

00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:53.423
in the event of a referendum, but they need the UK parliament to agree.

00:14:54.473 --> 00:14:55.913
And it doesn’t.

00:14:57.373 --> 00:15:01.853
In Scotland itself, overall the attitude towards independence

00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:06.183
has not changed dramatically since the referendum in 2014.

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:12.733
In the aftermath of the Brexit vote there was an increased appetite for independence, but

00:15:13.003 --> 00:15:19.643
since then things have reverted back to where they were before, with most polls still showing

00:15:19.643 --> 00:15:24.933
that a slim majority of Scottish voters would prefer to remain part of the United Kingdom.

00:15:26.223 --> 00:15:29.783
But there is an important demographic shift happening.

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:36.273
Younger voters tend to be more nationalistic, more likely to vote for independence.

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:40.343
I can tell you firsthand that my Scottish cousins,

00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:44.923
especially the younger ones, are vehemently pro independence.

00:15:46.143 --> 00:15:49.623
And these will be the next generation of voters.

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:52.673
So, what’s going to happen?

00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:57.883
At the moment it is not of huge concern for Westminster, for the British

00:15:57.883 --> 00:16:03.223
government, but if the tide turns, and polls start to show that the

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:07.963
prevailing attitude is pro independence, no doubt action will be taken.

00:16:09.323 --> 00:16:13.823
Commentators tend to suggest that first would come concessions for Scotland

00:16:14.143 --> 00:16:18.973
to have more power to govern its own affairs, more freedom to manage taxes and

00:16:19.153 --> 00:16:23.993
make its own laws, rather than giving it another referendum on independence.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:31.123
Whether this will be enough to placate the younger, more nationalistic and idealistic generation

00:16:31.473 --> 00:16:37.593
that has never had the chance to have its say on the matter, well that is anyone’s guess.

00:16:40.093 --> 00:16:44.523
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Scottish independence, the

00:16:44.533 --> 00:16:48.443
third in our mini-series on this wonderful country that is still, as

00:16:48.443 --> 00:16:52.293
of the time of recording this episode, not an independent nation state

00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:57.473
As a reminder, in case you missed them, part one of this mini-series was on

00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:01.363
weird Scotland, where we looked at unusual Scottish traditions and facts.

00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:06.023
Part two was on Donald Trump’s battle to build a golf course, and how realised

00:17:06.023 --> 00:17:08.993
that the locals were going to put up more of a fight than he expected.

00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:15.953
And part four will be on one of the bloodiest events in Scottish history, the Glencoe massacre.

00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:21.243
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:21.813 --> 00:17:27.223
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

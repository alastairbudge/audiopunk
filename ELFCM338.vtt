Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.629
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.730
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.789
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.370
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.650
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.880
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.780
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.189
start of another mini-series on queens.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.249
But not just any queens, we are

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.310
going to look at three remarkable

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.220
women who became queen against

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.640
all the odds, unlikely queens.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.180
Women who fought against misogyny

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.300
and manipulative men, men who

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.720
were often far less capable than

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.500
the brave and intelligent female

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.070
subjects of this mini-series.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.699
So, who are these women then?

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.729
First up, in today’s episode, it’s

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.459
Anne Boleyn, the unfortunate second

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.570
wife to the English King, Henry VIII.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619
In part two, we'll talk about her

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.819
daughter, Elizabeth I of England.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.179
And then in part three we’ll move over to

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.419
Russia and talk about Catherine the Great.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.679
But first, Anne Boleyn.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.439
There are few women in British history

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.119
who have a more divisive reputation.

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:19.009
To some, she was a scheming,

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.579
manipulative power-hungry temptress

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.169
who bears responsibility for Britain

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:26.119
breaking with the Catholic Church.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.069
To others, she was an innocent victim

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.869
of powerful men, someone whose only

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.019
crime was her beauty, wit and intellect.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.679
And in this episode, we’ll tell her

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.989
story and you can decide for yourself.

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:44.288
OK then, Anne Boleyn.

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.958
On the 19th of May 1536, a young

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.758
woman was led to Tower Green, in the

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:54.298
grounds of the famous Tower of London.

00:01:55.618 --> 00:01:58.388
She wore a red dress, a symbol

00:01:58.388 --> 00:02:00.528
of martyrdom and innocence.

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:04.818
She spoke, her voice strong and proud:

00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:08.608
“Good Christian people, I am come hither

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:11.458
to die, for according to the law, and

00:02:11.658 --> 00:02:14.308
by the law I am judged to die, and

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.588
therefore I will speak nothing against it.

00:02:16.988 --> 00:02:19.648
I pray God save the King … for

00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:21.828
a gentler nor a more merciful

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:23.368
prince was there never.”

00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:26.968
She knelt down on two knees.

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.258
Moments later, the French swordsman

00:02:30.488 --> 00:02:32.348
standing behind her brought his

00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:33.948
blade swinging through the air,

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:36.358
the cold steel detaching the

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:38.128
young woman’s head from her body.

00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:42.618
The “king”, the merciful prince, the woman

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:45.108
had prayed for was no stranger to her.

00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:48.338
Not only was this king the man

00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:50.388
who had ordered her execution,

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:53.338
but he had also been her husband.

00:02:54.748 --> 00:02:57.128
The King’s name was Henry, Henry

00:02:57.308 --> 00:02:59.378
VIII, and the young woman’s name

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.758
was, of course, Anne Boleyn.

00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:05.178
So, how did it come to this?

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:07.518
What could possibly cause a man to

00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:10.878
order his wife’s public execution, and

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:14.208
how much responsibility, if any, does

00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:16.828
Anne Boleyn have for her own fate?

00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:19.728
Let’s start by digging

00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:20.858
into her early life.

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:24.958
She was born sometime between 1500

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.349
and 1507, and by 1513, following

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.739
the tradition for noble families at

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.389
the time, she was sent overseas to

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.029
complete her education and turn her

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.889
into an eligible wife for a nobleman.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.759
Originally, Anne was destined for Austria,

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.799
the most celebrated court in Europe, but

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.169
she was quickly moved to France, where

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.129
she became good friends with the French

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.379
Queen, who was a similar age to her.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.959
After almost 10 years of learning

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.829
languages, mathematics, fashion, dance

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.389
and how to play the lute, and turning her

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.249
into a young woman with a wide array of

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.559
enviable talents, in 1522 Anne returned

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.379
to England, and joined the royal court.

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.120
At court, she became an attendant, a

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.949
so-called lady-in-waiting, to Henry

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.489
VIII’s first wife, Catherine of Aragon.

00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:25.389
From the historical records that do

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.149
exist, it seems that Anne Boleyn was an

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:31.239
intelligent, funny and witty young woman.

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:34.019
Clearly, she was someone that people

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.209
liked to be around, she was not

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:39.119
only fun and entertaining, but she

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:41.029
had all of the qualities that a

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.419
nobleman might look for in a wife.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.809
As you might expect, she turned heads at

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.099
court, there were plenty of young men who

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.389
took note of her, thinking that she was

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.239
indeed, high quality marriage material.

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:57.989
Initially, though, these did

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:59.979
not include the King, Henry.

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.469
In fact, at this time Henry had a

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.809
romantic relationship with Anne’s

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.159
older sister Mary, “the - so

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.829
called - other Boleyn girl”.

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:13.799
Mary, as far as historians believe, was

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:16.129
a very different person to her sister.

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.319
She was more beautiful, or so

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.379
the theory goes, but she wasn’t

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:23.459
as smart as Anne, her sister.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.079
As such, some historians hypothesise

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:30.149
that Mary had quickly fallen

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:32.499
into bed with Henry without fully

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.789
understanding the ramifications,

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:36.569
the consequences, of doing so.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.879
Anne wouldn't make the same mistake.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.899
Or at least, she wouldn't make the

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.229
same mistake as quickly as her sister.

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.489
In any case, she had plenty of

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.039
potential suitors at court, plenty of

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.297
other men who were interested in her,

00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:55.749
but only one really caught her eye.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.679
His name was Henry Percy.

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.079
Going against tradition, which would

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:04.219
have meant that their parents and the

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.319
king had to give their permission and

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:09.359
blessing, Anne and Henry Percy secretly

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.539
got engaged without asking anyone.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.359
When Henry VIII found out about

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:17.319
their secret engagement he ordered

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.219
his trusted statesman Thomas

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.949
Wolsey to put an end to it.

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:24.419
Some have speculated that Henry may

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.529
have stopped the marriage as he began

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.829
to see Anne as another potential

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.779
mistress, yet another girl at

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.139
court to add to his list of lovers.

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.419
And sometime in around 1526, after

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:41.039
he had lost interest in Mary Boleyn,

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:43.599
historians believe that Henry

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:46.239
started to become infatuated with,

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.499
obsessed with, her sister, Anne.

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:53.789
Now, was this true love, or did he simply

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.639
wanted to take her to his bed and add

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.859
her to his long list of mistresses?

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.179
He certainly declared undying

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:04.659
love for her, writing love letters

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.909
and sending her expensive gifts.

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.689
But Anne wasn’t like her sister, and she

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:13.109
wasn’t like the other women at court.

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.899
She said “no”, or at least,

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:17.619
“not until we’re married”.

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.639
Anne would not become the King’s lover.

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:25.129
As you might imagine, this came as quite

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.859
a shock to Henry; he was king of England,

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:30.499
he was not a man used to rejection.

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:34.079
And, resolving this for Henry wasn’t

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.079
quite as easy as simply marrying Anne.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:39.939
In case you had forgotten, during this

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:42.642
very public declaration of love for Anne

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.179
and affair with Anne's sister, Henry was

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:49.109
still married to his first wife, Catherine

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:51.399
of Aragon, Anne’s boss, essentially.

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.359
But he had grown tired of this marriage.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.699
Catherine had borne him a daughter,

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.079
Mary, but had failed to produce a son.

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:04.959
A son was crucial for Henry, as a

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.729
male heir would secure the future

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:09.139
of England and prevent future wars

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.499
over the succession – the type of

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:13.549
war that had won his father the crown

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.149
but left him in a dangerous position.

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.549
So, Henry needed a son, and

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:21.979
for that to happen, he needed a

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:24.299
wife capable of giving him one.

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:27.539
Catherine, so Henry believed,

00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:29.419
was not the woman to do so.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.199
So he needed a new one, a new

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:34.469
mother to this dreamed-of son.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.059
Of course, back in the 16th century,

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:41.679
at least before 1534, England was

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.839
Catholic, you couldn’t simply divorce

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:45.849
someone if you’d grown tired of them.

00:08:46.849 --> 00:08:48.729
Henry might have been the King of England,

00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:51.829
the most powerful man in the country and

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.199
therefore one of the most powerful men

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.809
in the world, but there was something

00:08:57.089 --> 00:09:00.099
even more powerful: the Catholic church.

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:04.294
For a marriage to be annulled, an

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.919
annulment, a nullification, needed

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:09.279
to be given by the Pope himself.

00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:12.879
Henry wrote to the pope, protesting

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:14.619
that his marriage to Catherine was

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:17.889
wrong in the eyes of God because she

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.809
had been married to Henry’s brother.

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:23.219
But the pope did not accept, telling

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:25.769
Henry that he would be excommunicated,

00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:27.759
he would be kicked out, of the

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:29.849
Catholic Church if he remarried.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:34.059
Now, this process, of Henry and his

00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:37.049
advisors trying to find theological

00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:38.519
reasons for him to get out of

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:40.589
the marriage, went on for almost

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:43.019
a decade, with no hope in sight.

00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:46.239
Suffice it to say that,

00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:49.427
By the starts of start of 1533, 9 years

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:52.407
after Henry had first lost interest in his

00:09:52.437 --> 00:09:55.707
wife, something important had happened.

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:59.197
Anne was pregnant, but the

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:01.157
pair still weren’t married.

00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:04.437
Some historians think that Anne must

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.697
have got nervous about Henry losing

00:10:06.727 --> 00:10:09.327
interest in her, others that this was

00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:11.507
her way of speeding up the process.

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:15.047
In any case, pregnant she was,

00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:17.007
there was no going back now.

00:10:17.737 --> 00:10:20.257
The clock was ticking, and Henry

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:22.457
needed to move fast to make sure

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.057
that the child she was carrying

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:27.037
would become his legal son and heir.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.407
And there was no doubt in

00:10:29.427 --> 00:10:31.727
Henry’s mind that this was a son.

00:10:32.687 --> 00:10:35.187
After all, God had cursed him for

00:10:35.197 --> 00:10:37.177
marrying Catherine, God would now

00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:40.147
reward him with a son from his new wife.

00:10:40.957 --> 00:10:42.347
That was the way things worked,

00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:43.877
at least in Henry’s mind.

00:10:45.197 --> 00:10:48.767
But, first things first, Anne needed to

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:51.647
become his wife, so the pair married in

00:10:51.647 --> 00:10:55.016
a secret ceremony in January of 1533.

00:10:56.007 --> 00:10:58.427
There was, however, the complication

00:10:58.847 --> 00:11:00.827
over what to do with his current wife.

00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:03.687
He had been effectively separated

00:11:03.707 --> 00:11:05.977
from Catherine for several years,

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:08.667
but she was still legally his wife in

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:11.057
the eyes of the law and the church.

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:15.117
Fortunately, in the almost decade

00:11:15.117 --> 00:11:17.527
since Henry had grown tired of her, he

00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:19.747
had started the process of separating

00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:22.027
from Rome, from the Catholic Church,

00:11:22.317 --> 00:11:24.647
and Henry was the head of his own

00:11:24.647 --> 00:11:27.307
church by now, the Church of England.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:31.687
So, in May of 1533, he ordered

00:11:31.837 --> 00:11:34.307
his own archbishop to declare his

00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:36.787
first marriage to be null and void.

00:11:37.607 --> 00:11:40.327
Ta-da, Anne was his wife, Catherine

00:11:40.327 --> 00:11:42.546
was not, so Anne could become his

00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:44.866
queen, their child would be his heir,

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:48.116
everything was all lining up very nicely.

00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:50.736
Except…it wasn’t.

00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:54.286
On June the 1st, 1533, the

00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:56.626
pregnant Anne was crowned queen.

00:11:57.526 --> 00:11:59.276
She might have been happy, Henry

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:01.326
too might have finally been happy,

00:12:01.706 --> 00:12:04.186
but the crowd at her coronation

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:07.136
was not cheering but deadly silent.

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:10.286
It was not only the Pope and Catherine

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.476
that were against Henry’s new marriage.

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:15.366
Catherine had been a popular queen,

00:12:15.616 --> 00:12:19.036
and many people saw Anne as snatching

00:12:19.036 --> 00:12:22.076
the King away, and what’s more, forcing

00:12:22.086 --> 00:12:24.516
a break with Rome in the process.

00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:28.246
As a result, Anne Boleyn was

00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:30.486
a deeply unpopular queen.

00:12:31.556 --> 00:12:33.646
And it would not be long before

00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:36.236
Henry himself would become even

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:38.356
more disappointed than his subjects.

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:42.646
In September Anne gave birth to a baby.

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:45.826
No doubt Henry was waiting outside

00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:48.226
with bated breath, ready to announce

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.956
the birth of a baby boy, a prince,

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:53.946
the heir he had craved so desperately.

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:57.676
This child would grow up to be an

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.716
intelligent, brave and powerful

00:12:59.716 --> 00:13:01.986
leader, and indeed one of the

00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:03.966
greatest monarchs in British history.

00:13:05.196 --> 00:13:07.216
But the child was not the

00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:08.436
son he was hoping for.

00:13:09.636 --> 00:13:10.536
It was a baby girl.

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:14.256
Her name was Elizabeth, she would go on

00:13:14.296 --> 00:13:17.446
to become Elizabeth the First, but Henry

00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:19.796
wouldn’t know the queen she would become.

00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:23.316
For him, her gender alone

00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:24.676
was disappointment enough.

00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:28.286
Henry had been so sure he was having a

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:31.526
son that all the proclamations, the royal

00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:33.656
announcements, had already been written

00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:36.236
to announce the arrival of the ‘prince’.

00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:40.336
Two s’s had to be quickly added to all the

00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:42.826
documents so they would correctly inform

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:45.676
the country of the ‘princess’ instead.

00:13:46.746 --> 00:13:49.036
Now, Anne was still young when

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:51.186
Elizabeth was born, likely in her

00:13:51.356 --> 00:13:54.286
late 20s or early 30s, so there was

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:56.216
plenty of time for her to try to have

00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:59.316
another child, the illusive male heir.

00:14:00.336 --> 00:14:03.176
But the birth of Elizabeth was only the

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.556
first of a series of disappointments.

00:14:06.256 --> 00:14:08.376
Indeed, some historians have

00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:10.586
suggested that, although this didn’t

00:14:10.606 --> 00:14:13.016
seal her tragic fate, it was the

00:14:13.016 --> 00:14:15.306
beginning of the end for Anne.

00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:19.536
Once Henry had got what he couldn’t have,

00:14:19.876 --> 00:14:22.416
once he had finally made Anne Boleyn his

00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:25.556
wife, taken her to his bed, and she had

00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:28.026
only provided him with a disappointing

00:14:28.026 --> 00:14:30.926
daughter, his eyes began to wander.

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:34.046
Within a year of their marriage,

00:14:34.296 --> 00:14:36.646
Henry had begun affairs with not

00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:39.406
one but two of Anne’s servants.

00:14:40.386 --> 00:14:43.166
For Henry, this was nothing new.

00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:45.116
Indeed, he had done exactly the

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:46.606
same thing with Catherine when

00:14:46.766 --> 00:14:48.316
he started his affair with Anne.

00:14:49.186 --> 00:14:51.746
And what's more, Catherine, his

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:54.796
first wife, had turned a blind eye

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:56.966
to it, she had accepted that he was

00:14:56.966 --> 00:14:58.846
going to have mistresses and there

00:14:58.846 --> 00:15:00.346
was little she could do about it.

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:04.806
But Anne Boleyn wasn’t like Catherine.

00:15:05.486 --> 00:15:07.126
She was furious with Henry,

00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:09.766
and grew jealous and insecure.

00:15:10.196 --> 00:15:12.816
She wasn't happy to be embarrassed like

00:15:12.816 --> 00:15:14.806
that in front of everyone at Court.

00:15:15.886 --> 00:15:19.106
Now, clearly this to us probably

00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:21.176
seems like perfectly reasonable

00:15:21.176 --> 00:15:23.536
behaviour - if your husband is having

00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:26.146
a poorly-hidden affair, it seems

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:28.956
pretty acceptable to be angry with him.

00:15:29.916 --> 00:15:32.686
But 500 years ago, to state the

00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:34.726
obvious, men held the power.

00:15:35.296 --> 00:15:37.206
A woman, even the wife of the

00:15:37.206 --> 00:15:39.976
king, was expected to tolerate

00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:41.176
this kind of behaviour.

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.776
Now, why wasn’t Anne?

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:46.496
Some have suggested that it

00:15:46.496 --> 00:15:48.266
was because she was strong,

00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:50.696
independent and forward-thinking.

00:15:51.136 --> 00:15:53.596
She knew this wasn’t right, and despite

00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:56.576
the uneven power dynamic, she did what she

00:15:56.576 --> 00:15:58.886
could to stop her husband’s infidelity.

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:01.746
Others have suggested that it was

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:03.646
because of her strong religious

00:16:03.646 --> 00:16:06.646
faith; when they married, Henry had

00:16:06.646 --> 00:16:08.736
made a promise in front of God to

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:11.116
be loyal, so Henry shouldn’t do it.

00:16:12.256 --> 00:16:14.876
And others have suggested that she didn’t

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:17.166
want to lose her position and Henry’s

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:20.226
favour - she knew all too well what

00:16:20.356 --> 00:16:22.506
had happened to Henry’s first wife, and

00:16:22.786 --> 00:16:24.986
she didn’t want to meet the same fate.

00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:28.966
Whatever the true reason, or

00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:31.216
combination of reasons, looking

00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:33.516
back on it, it’s hard to deny that

00:16:33.616 --> 00:16:35.386
it reflects well on her character.

00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:39.066
And clearly, it reflects very badly on

00:16:39.076 --> 00:16:42.256
Henry, who tried to justify his affairs by

00:16:42.516 --> 00:16:44.866
blaming his wife for not giving him a son.

00:16:46.176 --> 00:16:47.916
But shortly after, good

00:16:47.926 --> 00:16:49.436
news, a ray of hope!

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:52.636
Anne was pregnant again, and in

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:53.826
fact it's thought that she got

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:56.416
pregnant again at least three times.

00:16:57.146 --> 00:17:00.136
But in two cases she had late-term

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.726
miscarriages, she lost two babies.

00:17:03.896 --> 00:17:07.376
And in 1536, Anne fell pregnant again.

00:17:07.886 --> 00:17:10.896
She gave birth, miraculously, to a boy.

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:14.006
But tragically, the boy was

00:17:14.196 --> 00:17:16.876
stillborn, he was dead on arrival.

00:17:18.056 --> 00:17:20.756
Now, these miscarriages and the birth

00:17:20.786 --> 00:17:23.356
of a stillborn baby must not only have

00:17:23.356 --> 00:17:26.406
been hugely traumatic on an emotional

00:17:26.406 --> 00:17:28.726
level, but they would also be the

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:31.036
nail in the coffin for her fortune.

00:17:32.226 --> 00:17:34.686
Within five months she would be dead.

00:17:35.956 --> 00:17:38.236
Henry believed that the reason for

00:17:38.236 --> 00:17:39.776
Anne’s failure to give him a son

00:17:40.086 --> 00:17:42.596
was because God was unhappy with

00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:45.246
their marriage and so, much like he

00:17:45.246 --> 00:17:47.616
had with Catherine, he decided that

00:17:47.626 --> 00:17:49.736
this marriage too was a mistake.

00:17:50.626 --> 00:17:52.976
It’s said that every time Anne lost a

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:55.326
baby, Henry loved her less and less,

00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:58.076
and he finally convinced himself that

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:01.066
she was physically unable to provide him

00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:03.216
with the son he so desperately wanted.

00:18:04.096 --> 00:18:07.526
He kicked Anne out of Court and moved in

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:10.216
with his new love interest, Jane Seymour.

00:18:11.756 --> 00:18:15.066
By now, she had truly fallen from grace.

00:18:15.776 --> 00:18:17.446
She not only had to fight against

00:18:17.456 --> 00:18:19.566
those who despised her because

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:21.486
of Henry’s divorce and saw her

00:18:21.486 --> 00:18:23.436
responsible for the break with Rome,

00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:26.286
but also against Henry, who was

00:18:26.286 --> 00:18:28.666
plotting to remove all trace of her.

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.546
But how would he get rid of her?

00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:34.986
There was no real grounds for divorce,

00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:37.676
so he had to try something more sneaky.

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:41.256
And it’s here that I need to introduce

00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:43.786
you to another character, a minister

00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:45.936
of Henry’s called Thomas Cromwell.

00:18:46.716 --> 00:18:48.476
He was more than a minister, really,

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:51.766
he was Lord Chancellor, a man Henry

00:18:51.766 --> 00:18:53.656
relied on to do his dirty work.

00:18:54.846 --> 00:18:57.154
Cromwell had been an old enemy of

00:18:57.154 --> 00:18:59.084
Anne's several years beforehand,

00:18:59.414 --> 00:19:01.064
as they had clashed over what

00:19:01.064 --> 00:19:02.434
to do with the money from the

00:19:02.444 --> 00:19:04.334
monasteries that Henry had dissolved.

00:19:05.094 --> 00:19:08.074
In another episode that reflects well

00:19:08.074 --> 00:19:10.524
on Anne, she had suggested that the

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:13.074
money go to the poor, and Cromwell

00:19:13.074 --> 00:19:15.074
had suggested that it go to the King.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.204
She also disagreed with Cromwell’s

00:19:18.214 --> 00:19:20.484
foreign policy and she wanted to

00:19:20.484 --> 00:19:22.514
create peace with France, which

00:19:22.514 --> 00:19:24.264
was the opposite of his plans.

00:19:25.504 --> 00:19:28.044
Henry asked Cromwell to try to find

00:19:28.204 --> 00:19:30.614
some kind of crime that he could charge

00:19:30.614 --> 00:19:33.254
his wife with, and Cromwell, being

00:19:33.384 --> 00:19:36.484
both cunning and ruthless, got to work.

00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:40.264
He instructed his network of spies to

00:19:40.264 --> 00:19:42.714
find anything incriminating about Anne

00:19:42.854 --> 00:19:45.064
that he could use to bring her down.

00:19:46.214 --> 00:19:47.724
It did not take long to

00:19:47.724 --> 00:19:49.014
gather some information.

00:19:49.604 --> 00:19:51.964
Apparently, someone had overheard

00:19:52.004 --> 00:19:54.214
Anne speaking in a way that

00:19:54.304 --> 00:19:55.994
hinted at the king’s death.

00:19:57.114 --> 00:19:59.824
Reportedly, she had imagined herself with

00:20:00.014 --> 00:20:02.584
another man if Henry happened to die.

00:20:03.484 --> 00:20:06.614
And this was highly illegal, it was

00:20:06.614 --> 00:20:09.274
a criminal offence to speak of, to

00:20:09.444 --> 00:20:11.594
even think of, the king’s death.

00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:15.824
As a result, Cromwell arrested

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:17.964
Anne’s musician and brought

00:20:18.014 --> 00:20:19.234
him in for questioning.

00:20:20.144 --> 00:20:21.404
Except it wasn’t

00:20:21.434 --> 00:20:23.224
questioning, it was torture.

00:20:24.364 --> 00:20:26.144
Cromwell accused the musician

00:20:26.354 --> 00:20:27.974
of having sex with Anne and

00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:30.134
tortured him until he confessed.

00:20:31.034 --> 00:20:32.924
Cromwell then asked him to

00:20:32.924 --> 00:20:34.404
give him names of other men

00:20:34.404 --> 00:20:36.064
who had had affairs with Anne.

00:20:36.914 --> 00:20:38.994
He even accused Anne of plotting

00:20:38.994 --> 00:20:40.614
Henry’s death with those men.

00:20:41.524 --> 00:20:44.444
Exhausted and in agony, the tortured

00:20:44.574 --> 00:20:47.254
musician gave Cromwell a list of men

00:20:47.434 --> 00:20:49.884
who had reportedly slept with Anne.

00:20:50.814 --> 00:20:53.324
All five of these men, which even

00:20:53.324 --> 00:20:56.574
included her own brother George, just so

00:20:56.574 --> 00:20:59.094
happened to be serious political enemies

00:20:59.114 --> 00:21:01.694
of Cromwell’s, which certainly suggests

00:21:01.814 --> 00:21:04.404
that Cromwell used this as an opportunity

00:21:04.404 --> 00:21:07.054
to advance his own political interests.

00:21:07.884 --> 00:21:10.134
Now, armed with this information,

00:21:10.474 --> 00:21:12.244
Cromwell began to put together

00:21:12.294 --> 00:21:14.884
evidence that he could use at a trial.

00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:19.514
This evidence was weak at best, it made

00:21:19.514 --> 00:21:22.314
little sense, and historians now believe

00:21:22.444 --> 00:21:25.874
it was all a conspiracy, a set-up to

00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:28.004
provide an excuse to get rid of Anne.

00:21:29.184 --> 00:21:32.564
But 500 years ago, justice consisted

00:21:32.564 --> 00:21:34.514
of whatever the King wanted, really.

00:21:35.304 --> 00:21:38.054
Anne was arrested on the 2nd of May

00:21:38.334 --> 00:21:41.584
1536 and taken to the Tower of London.

00:21:42.554 --> 00:21:44.594
The charges against her were for

00:21:44.654 --> 00:21:47.324
adultery, incest and treason.

00:21:48.704 --> 00:21:51.054
Although she put up an admirable

00:21:51.064 --> 00:21:53.904
battle, it was a show-trial in effect,

00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:56.114
there was no way she would win.

00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:59.334
The jury, which even included

00:21:59.474 --> 00:22:01.234
her own uncle, could never go

00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:02.474
against the wishes of the king.

00:22:03.834 --> 00:22:06.204
Unsurprisingly, Anne was found

00:22:06.214 --> 00:22:09.014
guilty of all charges, and she

00:22:09.014 --> 00:22:10.984
was sentenced to death, along with

00:22:11.114 --> 00:22:13.184
all the men who were also accused.

00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:16.514
She was distraught and terrified.

00:22:17.024 --> 00:22:19.324
So terrified that she asked to be

00:22:19.364 --> 00:22:21.614
executed with a sword, rather than

00:22:21.744 --> 00:22:23.994
an axe, because she was afraid

00:22:24.014 --> 00:22:25.604
the axe would not be quick enough.

00:22:26.684 --> 00:22:29.874
Henry did grant her this one wish.

00:22:30.164 --> 00:22:32.594
An expert executioner was

00:22:32.604 --> 00:22:34.004
brought over from France.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.101
As you heard at the start of

00:22:37.244 --> 00:22:39.434
the episode, the Frenchman was

00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:41.854
accurate, and the sword was quick.

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:45.114
He picked up her head and declared

00:22:45.504 --> 00:22:47.554
‘God save the king!’ before the

00:22:47.584 --> 00:22:49.964
crowd reportedly gasped in horror

00:22:50.224 --> 00:22:52.264
as Anne’s eyes were still moving.

00:22:53.674 --> 00:22:57.024
It was a truly gruesome and inglorious

00:22:57.074 --> 00:22:59.614
end for a woman who Henry had once

00:22:59.614 --> 00:23:02.264
claimed to have been so in love with, so

00:23:02.264 --> 00:23:04.454
much so that he had caused the biggest

00:23:04.604 --> 00:23:06.814
religious split in his country’s history.

00:23:07.964 --> 00:23:10.944
And without anyone left to defend

00:23:10.954 --> 00:23:13.354
her reputation after her execution,

00:23:13.764 --> 00:23:16.124
she increasingly was portrayed and

00:23:16.304 --> 00:23:19.634
described as an evil, manipulative woman.

00:23:20.944 --> 00:23:22.694
People began to spread rumours

00:23:22.724 --> 00:23:25.854
that Anne had been a witch, and one

00:23:25.874 --> 00:23:27.864
even claimed that she had eleven

00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:30.494
fingers and was covered in warts.

00:23:31.294 --> 00:23:33.914
People proposed that she had used spells

00:23:34.074 --> 00:23:36.784
and magic to get Henry to fall so deeply

00:23:36.784 --> 00:23:39.074
in love with her, and that he killed

00:23:39.074 --> 00:23:41.584
her because the spells had worn off.

00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:45.364
Her charges of adultery and incest,

00:23:45.814 --> 00:23:47.674
even though they were completely fake,

00:23:48.064 --> 00:23:50.444
were also taken as proof that she was

00:23:50.444 --> 00:23:53.224
a witch, as witches were believed to be

00:23:53.454 --> 00:23:56.234
overly sexual and have no self-control.

00:23:57.604 --> 00:23:59.604
And one of the reasons that our

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:02.284
knowledge of the real Anne Boleyn is

00:24:02.284 --> 00:24:05.984
so unclear is that after her death her

00:24:06.014 --> 00:24:08.424
critics did as much as they could to

00:24:08.484 --> 00:24:11.194
erase all trace of her very existence.

00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:13.804
Her writing was destroyed,

00:24:13.914 --> 00:24:15.364
as were portraits of her.

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:17.844
Her detractors wanted to make

00:24:17.844 --> 00:24:20.204
her as silent as the crowd at her

00:24:20.204 --> 00:24:22.604
coronation…and they succeeded.

00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:26.194
And as you’ll have seen, the story

00:24:26.234 --> 00:24:28.964
of Anne Boleyn is principally told

00:24:29.204 --> 00:24:31.694
through the people around her, the men

00:24:31.704 --> 00:24:34.084
who tricked and conspired against her.

00:24:35.094 --> 00:24:38.194
Clearly, in this respect there is only one

00:24:38.194 --> 00:24:40.684
person who must bear responsibility for

00:24:40.684 --> 00:24:43.244
the tragically short life of his former

00:24:43.244 --> 00:24:46.334
lover and wife: Henry VIII, the king.

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:50.324
For some commentators, her fate was

00:24:50.334 --> 00:24:52.984
sealed the moment he set eyes on her and

00:24:53.154 --> 00:24:55.784
decided that he must make her his lover.

00:24:56.864 --> 00:24:59.424
Perhaps, you could say, her story would

00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:01.134
have been very different if she had

00:25:01.354 --> 00:25:04.304
flat-out refused him, if she had said no.

00:25:05.314 --> 00:25:07.514
Perhaps it would, but in that case

00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:08.954
she would never have been queen.

00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:11.684
Or if she had given him

00:25:11.864 --> 00:25:13.374
a son, not a daughter.

00:25:14.344 --> 00:25:15.834
Now, to state the obvious,

00:25:16.064 --> 00:25:17.534
clearly she isn't at fault here.

00:25:17.874 --> 00:25:19.794
In fact, if we are to assign fault

00:25:19.804 --> 00:25:20.994
about the gender of the child,

00:25:21.034 --> 00:25:23.494
it's Henry's, as the gender comes

00:25:23.494 --> 00:25:24.794
from the father’s chromosones.

00:25:26.404 --> 00:25:29.204
In any case, if Elizabeth had been a

00:25:29.204 --> 00:25:31.734
boy, the fate of Anne Boleyn, and the

00:25:31.734 --> 00:25:33.564
country, would have been very different.

00:25:34.654 --> 00:25:36.564
Perhaps Anne would have been

00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:38.744
able to write and control her own

00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:40.654
legacy in a way that she wasn't

00:25:40.684 --> 00:25:42.934
able to after her untimely death.

00:25:43.884 --> 00:25:46.294
Given her unpopularity during her

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:48.534
life, the history books after her

00:25:48.534 --> 00:25:50.954
death were not kind to Anne Boleyn.

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:54.544
She is, by many, remembered as an

00:25:54.764 --> 00:25:57.354
ambitious, power-seeking young woman who

00:25:57.354 --> 00:25:59.594
would stop at nothing to become queen,

00:26:00.034 --> 00:26:02.954
seducing her boss’ husband and persuading

00:26:02.954 --> 00:26:04.994
him to break with the Catholic Church.

00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:08.994
If this is your view, perhaps it’s hard

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.444
to have a huge amount of sympathy for

00:26:11.444 --> 00:26:13.624
her when things came crashing down.

00:26:14.804 --> 00:26:18.114
But to others, and especially in more

00:26:18.114 --> 00:26:20.804
recent readings of her story, she is

00:26:20.804 --> 00:26:23.824
an innocent victim of a misogynistic

00:26:23.824 --> 00:26:26.014
world, someone who was in the wrong

00:26:26.014 --> 00:26:28.404
place at the wrong time, someone whose

00:26:28.634 --> 00:26:31.034
only crime was failing to produce a male

00:26:31.034 --> 00:26:34.254
heir, a victim of a cruel male-dominated

00:26:34.254 --> 00:26:37.414
society and an sociopathic male ruler.

00:26:38.744 --> 00:26:40.754
Whatever your opinion of Anne Boleyn,

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.334
perhaps her greatest legacy is in

00:26:44.334 --> 00:26:46.634
its literal sense, the greatest

00:26:46.634 --> 00:26:49.204
thing she left behind, was to be the

00:26:49.434 --> 00:26:51.454
baby girl that Henry didn’t want.

00:26:52.834 --> 00:26:55.294
That baby girl would go on to become

00:26:55.294 --> 00:26:57.894
queen, and not just any queen.

00:26:58.844 --> 00:27:01.224
This would be Elizabeth the First,

00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:03.861
one of the most loved and influential

00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:05.271
monarchs in British history.

00:27:06.101 --> 00:27:08.571
And most importantly, this queen

00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:10.551
would manage to survive and

00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:12.511
thrive in this male-dominated

00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:15.451
world, without a man by her side.

00:27:18.131 --> 00:27:20.121
Ok then, that is it for

00:27:20.121 --> 00:27:22.160
today’s episode on Anne Boleyn.

00:27:22.731 --> 00:27:24.981
As a reminder, this is part one of

00:27:24.981 --> 00:27:27.691
this three-part mini-series on queens.

00:27:28.241 --> 00:27:30.861
Next up will be that baby girl Elizabeth

00:27:30.881 --> 00:27:33.081
the First, the daughter of Anne Boleyn,

00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:35.531
and then in our final part it will

00:27:35.531 --> 00:27:37.451
be Catherine the Great of Russia.

00:27:38.151 --> 00:27:40.011
As always I would love to know what

00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:41.391
you thought about this episode.

00:27:41.741 --> 00:27:43.531
What do you think of Anne Boleyn?

00:27:43.991 --> 00:27:45.851
Ruthless power-seeking maniac

00:27:45.911 --> 00:27:47.441
or innocent young victim?

00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:50.061
How might her life have been different

00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:51.901
had Elizabeth been born a boy?

00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:53.681
Do you think she could have

00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:55.291
refused Henry's advances?

00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:57.811
I would love to know, so let’s

00:27:57.811 --> 00:27:59.201
get this discussion started.

00:27:59.561 --> 00:28:00.591

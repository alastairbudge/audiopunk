Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:16.796
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:21.026
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:27.596
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about San Francisco.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:33.366
It’s one of the most influential cities in the United States, it produced bands

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:39.356
like Jefferson Airplane, actors like Bruce Lee and entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs.

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:44.816
It was traditionally a sanctuary for artists, musicians, poets and

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:50.406
hippies, a city of free love, tolerance, equality and opportunity.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:01:00.136
But San Francisco in 2022 stands accused of being a very different place, a city with house prices

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:06.676
so high that residents can’t live there any more, with a drug problem so severe that people are

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:12.746
dying on the streets every day, and politicians without a coherent plan to do anything about it.

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:18.746
So, in this episode we are going to look at what is happening in San Francisco.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:23.726
We’ll start by looking at a brief history of the city, how technology companies

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:28.876
have changed the fabric of San Francisco society, we’ll look at how its more

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:34.656
liberal city administration has addressed the city’s problems, and ask ourselves

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:39.985
what comes next for the city that was once called the Paris of the West.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.025
OK then, San Francisco.

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:51.065
In April of 2022, if you were to drive around the city of San Francisco and look up, you

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:57.415
might see billboards, large advertising boards, offering all kinds of different services.

00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:04.465
Productivity software, McDonalds, Burger King, the latest show on Netflix.

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:11.205
You might even have seen some adverts with beautiful pictures of some iconic San

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:17.555
Francisco landmarks: the steep hills, Alcatraz Prison, or the famous Golden Gate bridge.

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:22.285
If you looked more closely and read the words on

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:25.765
billboard, the message on it might have surprised you.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:32.845
It read: “Unfortunately, we’re just as famous for our dirt-cheap fentanyl”.

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:37.785
Fentanyl, by the way, is a highly addictive drug, an opiate.

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.975
Our last members-only episode was a deep dive on fentanyl, so if you

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:46.485
are interested in that then I’d definitely recommend checking that out.

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:55.525
This campaign cost $25,000 and was paid for by a mothers support group called Mothers Against

00:02:55.525 --> 00:03:02.135
Drug Deaths, a not-for-profit group run by mothers who have lost children to drug overdoses.

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:08.815
The billboards were in protest at San Francisco’s liberal policies towards drug

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:15.355
use, which have, according to critics, turned entire areas of one of the wealthiest

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:20.645
cities in the country, and even in the world, into an open-air drug market.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:25.445
As there was increasing press coverage of this campaign,

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:30.255
journalists descended on the city to report back what they had seen.

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:31.935
Cable

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:37.295
TV was filled with images of drug dealers and drug addicts lining

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:42.095
the streets, images of tents blocking the pavements, squares, and

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:46.955
public spaces, and a clear message of a city that was out of control.

00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:52.755
There were interviews with local business owners who complained that people didn’t come

00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:57.575
to their shops any more, people who have owned restaurants and cafes in downtown San

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:03.765
Francisco who have been forced to close up and leave, and interviews with paramedics and

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:09.745
medical professionals who recounted how many drug overdoses they deal with on a daily basis.

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:15.635
And of course, there were painful interviews with people suffering from drug

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:20.965
addiction and homelessness themselves, people who had fallen on bad times or made

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:26.215
poor life choices, and were now living on the streets, in many cases struggling with

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:32.245
mental health problems and often resorting to petty crime to feed their addiction.

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:37.735
The question you might be asking yourself is, how did it get to this?

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:44.645
To answer this question, we need to first take a quick look at the history of San Francisco.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:52.245
It was founded in 1776, and the Gold Rush of the mid 19th century brought hundreds of

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:58.155
thousands of people to the city, turning it into the largest city on America’s west coast.

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:02.045
For years it welcomed immigrants from all over the

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:05.325
world, especially from East Asia and Latin America.

00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:11.961
In the post-war period it became a city of freedom and liberal attitudes, a

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.055
hippy paradise, immortalised by the lyrics of the 1962 song by Scott McKenzie,

00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:23.135
“If you're going to San Francisco / Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair“.

00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:30.995
In an increasingly conservative America, San Francisco was a place where freedom and individuality

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:37.525
flourished, homosexuality was tolerated, and there was an increasing counterculture movement.

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:42.655
This counterculture is thought to have helped lay the groundwork

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:47.225
for some of America, and the world’s, most creative companies.

00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:54.805
San Francisco is just 50km north, a short drive north, from Silicon Valley, an

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:59.865
area that would become the global centre for technology and entrepreneurship.

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:06.215
As technology companies started to boom in the early 2010s, an increasing

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:10.115
number of tech companies and their workers were drawn to the city.

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:16.515
Tech salaries have always been higher than average, and as competition

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:21.925
increased for the best and brightest engineers, salaries were pushed up and up.

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:28.325
The San Francisco Bay Area is now home to companies like Google, Apple, and

00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:33.255
Facebook, all companies that are able to pay vast sums of money to attract

00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:38.085
workers, and now pay hundreds of thousands of dollars just for a recent graduate.

00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:46.305
These tech workers tended to prefer living in the city, in San Francisco, rather than in sleepy

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:53.046
Silicon Valley, and the impact of this has been to push up house prices to eye-watering levels.

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:59.646
Indeed, the median family home price in San Francisco in 2021 was

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:07.216
$1.6 million, and the median rent for a family home was around $4,000.

00:07:07.836 --> 00:07:10.146
Just for a roof over your head.

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:16.156
The result of this has been, as you might imagine, that people who are not on a

00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:22.506
tech company salary are often priced out of the market, the rent is just too high.

00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:28.666
The high property prices and rent costs are though to have contributed

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:33.916
pushing people towards homeless, sending the homeless population skyrocketing.

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:40.376
San Francisco now has a homeless population of around 8,000 people, at least

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:45.846
according to the official City Hall numbers, but if you ask public health experts

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:52.056
they’ll say that the number is around 18,000, more than double the official estimate.

00:07:53.776 --> 00:08:02.116
Given that the population of San Francisco is 875,000, that means 1% of the population is homeless,

00:08:02.206 --> 00:08:08.106
if you were to take the lower number, and 2% if you were to take the more credible number.

00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:15.076
Put another way, the rate of homelessness in San Francisco is the same as in Chad,

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:21.756
the war-torn central-African country with a per capita income of $62 per month.

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:28.866
As the city’s homeless population grew, so did the problems that are so often associated

00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:34.186
with homelessness: drug and substance addiction, crimes committed to pay for drugs,

00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:40.636
people living on the pavements in tents, not having adequate toilets, bathrooms and so on.

00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:46.796
At the same time, the city had voted in politicians and city officials with a

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:52.426
more liberal attitude towards the prosecution of petty crime, of low level crime.

00:08:53.676 --> 00:09:00.086
In December of 2019 the city voted to elect a man called Chesa Boudin as the District

00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:05.686
Attorney, the person who is responsible for prosecuting crimes committed in the city.

00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:11.246
Boudin wasn’t from San Francisco, he was from New York, but he

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:15.526
came from a family with a long history of left-wing politics.

00:09:16.136 --> 00:09:20.396
His parents were both members of a left-wing militant organisation called

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:25.796
Weather Underground, his grandfather was a lawyer who represented Fidel Castro,

00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:31.306
and Boudin himself had spent time working in Venezuela under Hugo Chavez.

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:37.956
He had also experienced firsthand the impact that sending people to prison can have

00:09:38.136 --> 00:09:43.826
on their nearest and dearest, on their family: when Boudin was only 14 months old

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:49.116
his parents were sent to prison for murder in an armed robbery that went wrong.

00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:55.136
His mother was sentenced to 20 years in prison and his father 75.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:58.816
Boudin was raised by adoptive parents.

00:10:00.306 --> 00:10:05.536
He ran for office on a platform of creating a more fair and equitable justice

00:10:05.536 --> 00:10:11.016
system, of trying to give people help and assistance rather than send them to prison.

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:18.586
For Boudin, drug addicts were victims of an unjust society, and his oft-repeated

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:23.646
slogan is that he wants to “make it easier to get help than to get high”.

00:10:24.886 --> 00:10:30.528
Even before the election of Boudin at the end of 2019, California, the state San

00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:35.898
Francisco is in, had put into place some quite liberal laws surrounding petty crime.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:41.928
Specifically, something called Proposition 47: The Safe Neighborhoods

00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:47.177
and Schools Act, which, amongst other things, reclassified the theft

00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:51.788
of certain goods from a shop as a misdemeanour, not a federal crime.

00:10:52.578 --> 00:10:57.038
What this meant in practical terms was that you could steal anything up

00:10:57.038 --> 00:11:03.228
to a value of $950 and the police would not be required to intervene.

00:11:04.218 --> 00:11:09.978
What this has led to is scenes that you may have seen on TV or social media, of

00:11:10.118 --> 00:11:15.688
people simply walking into shops and taking goods, knowing full well that they will

00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:20.488
not be arrested for it, and then simply going around the corner and selling them.

00:11:21.628 --> 00:11:27.418
It has got so bad in some areas of the city that some supermarkets and pharmacies

00:11:27.628 --> 00:11:33.268
have had to lock up every single product, so simply to buy a tube of toothpaste

00:11:33.378 --> 00:11:37.868
you have to go and ask a store attendant to unlock the case and give it to you.

00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:43.118
Now, there are very different perspectives on what are the root

00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:47.878
causes of this increase in homelessness and crime, and what the

00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:52.138
solutions are, so let’s just address some of these individually.

00:11:53.348 --> 00:11:57.488
For Boudin and his supporters, it is a social justice issue.

00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:02.508
Rich tech companies and their workers have come into the city and

00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:07.358
pushed residents out, forcing them into homelessness and drug addiction.

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:12.708
They are victims of their situation, and the focus should be on doing

00:12:12.768 --> 00:12:16.588
everything that can be done in helping them get back on their feet.

00:12:17.828 --> 00:12:20.658
For others, it’s predominantly a drug issue.

00:12:21.338 --> 00:12:28.198
Cheap fentanyl, an incredibly powerful opiate, has flooded the streets, destroying already fragile

00:12:28.198 --> 00:12:34.608
lives, forcing people to turn to crime and locking them further into a cycle of destruction.

00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:40.538
Drug dealers know that they can sell their product openly on the streets without

00:12:40.538 --> 00:12:45.808
fear of prosecution, which has led to the city being flooded with cheap drugs.

00:12:46.608 --> 00:12:49.928
This is certainly the perspective of the mothers' action group

00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:52.878
that put up the billboard I mentioned at the start of the episode.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.768
For others, it’s a housing issue.

00:12:56.518 --> 00:13:00.838
San Francisco has very strict laws about the construction of new houses.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:05.258
If more houses could be built, not only would house prices go

00:13:05.258 --> 00:13:09.078
down but the homeless people could be given rooms to live in.

00:13:10.188 --> 00:13:12.528
For others, politicians are to blame.

00:13:12.908 --> 00:13:17.398
The city administration has become so large and bloated, so the

00:13:17.398 --> 00:13:21.898
argument goes, that it is incapable of solving these difficult problems.

00:13:23.098 --> 00:13:27.008
At the moment the city spends over a billion dollars on homeless

00:13:27.008 --> 00:13:32.698
services, which is anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 per homeless person,

00:13:32.858 --> 00:13:36.628
depending on whether you take the official or the unofficial number.

00:13:37.808 --> 00:13:42.798
In any case, it’s a lot, so the argument goes, and the fact that the homeless

00:13:42.818 --> 00:13:47.068
population is growing suggests that the money isn’t doing an effective

00:13:47.068 --> 00:13:51.368
job at helping people get off the streets and get their lives together.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.948
And it isn’t like San Francisco doesn’t have enough money.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:14:01.378
California has some of the highest taxes in the country, and the San Francisco

00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:07.788
budget is $13 billion, more per capita than any other city in the country.

00:14:09.018 --> 00:14:13.068
For better or worse, San Francisco is a place where it is

00:14:13.128 --> 00:14:16.878
easier than most other US cities to live on the streets.

00:14:17.808 --> 00:14:22.598
There are plenty of other people in a similar position, plenty of services to help you,

00:14:22.908 --> 00:14:27.958
and for those people who are in a cycle of addiction, there are widely available drugs.

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:33.368
On the one hand, great, society should give homeless people all the tools

00:14:33.388 --> 00:14:38.428
and services they need to live a dignified life, and every opportunity

00:14:38.428 --> 00:14:42.328
to change their lives if they want to and when they are ready to.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:49.348
On the other hand, no, this is a city that has made it too easy to be homeless and

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:54.968
do drugs, and with everything that is provided in terms of services and easy access

00:14:54.968 --> 00:14:59.388
to drugs, combined with the fact that you are very unlikely to be sent to prison

00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:04.408
even for committing a crime, there is little incentive to get your life together.

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:12.228
Of course, this is a simplistic and binary way of looking at it, but these are the broad arguments.

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:17.308
Now, while it’s very possible to disagree on the best solution to

00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:22.198
homelessness and poverty in San Francisco, it's hard to argue with the facts.

00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:29.148
In 2020 and 2021, so throughout the COVID pandemic, more people died

00:15:29.368 --> 00:15:33.528
of fentanyl overdoses on the streets of San Francisco than of COVID.

00:15:33.918 --> 00:15:36.228
Two people died every single day.

00:15:37.368 --> 00:15:41.218
The death number is decreasing, but this is primarily

00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:45.178
because more of something called Narcan is being distributed.

00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:51.558
Narcan is a medication that can be administered when someone is overdosing on opioids.

00:15:52.478 --> 00:16:00.688
Indeed, although deaths from overdoses went from 700 to 650 from 2020 to 2021, the

00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:08.108
number of overdoses that were reversed using Narcan doubled, it went from 4,000 to 8,200.

00:16:08.888 --> 00:16:12.758
More than double the number of people overdosed, it just so happened

00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.538
that their lives were able to be saved before it was too late.

00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:23.398
So, yes, making sure that drug users have access to this life-saving medication

00:16:23.538 --> 00:16:28.178
does help save lives, but it certainly doesn’t seem like a sustainable

00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:33.818
long-term solution to simply provide drug addicts with this medication and

00:16:33.998 --> 00:16:38.258
hope there is someone around to administer it when they have an overdose.

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:45.928
So then, what does the future hold for this historically liberal city that Americans on the right

00:16:46.108 --> 00:16:51.998
have been presenting as an example of what happens when the “radical left” takes control of a city?

00:16:52.668 --> 00:16:57.688
There is growing dissatisfaction, especially among the tech community, with the

00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:03.628
perceived consequences of the policies of Chesa Boudin, the District Attorney, so

00:17:03.628 --> 00:17:09.248
much so that there is a campaign to recall him, to remove him from his position.

00:17:10.178 --> 00:17:14.841
The vote will take place on June 7th, so we will have to wait to see what happens there.

00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:20.278
To state the obvious, there is no one solution to the problems of San Francisco.

00:17:20.628 --> 00:17:24.668
It's an inequality problem, it's a housing problem, it’s a drug

00:17:24.718 --> 00:17:29.088
problem, it’s a mental health problem, it’s a problem of what happens

00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:32.798
when city budgets swell out of control, it’s a political problem.

00:17:33.401 --> 00:17:35.841
The only question is what to do about it.

00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:41.011
To many San Francisco residents, they still cross their fingers for a return

00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:46.191
to the city they once knew, that it yet again becomes an affordable, liveable,

00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:51.241
liberal city where people can do what they want as long as it doesn’t harm others.

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:55.651
Everyone on all sides of the political spectrum wants this, they

00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.801
want the same thing, for the city to regain its former glory.

00:18:00.431 --> 00:18:05.275
The only problem is that there are vastly different views on how to get there.

00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:11.811
OK then, that is it for today's episode on San Francisco.

00:18:12.071 --> 00:18:14.981
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:21.411
As a quick reminder, this was a companion episode to episode number 263, a

00:18:21.581 --> 00:18:26.521
member-only episode where we did a deep dive into fentanyl, the drug that is

00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:31.261
partly responsible for causing so much death and destruction in San Francisco.

00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:35.151
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:37.361
Have you been to San Francisco recently?

00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:43.181
What was it like, and if you’ve been there several times, how has it changed over the years?

00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:48.441
Are there examples of cities in your country that have followed a similar path?

00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:50.511
What do you think the solution is?

00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:54.171
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:57.521

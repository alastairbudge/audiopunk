Hello hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:15.941
English, the show where you can listen to interesting stories and learn weird

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:21.311
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:29.166
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the British sense of humour.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:37.316
As you probably know, the British sense of humour is a bit, well different.

00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:43.616
Today we are going to discuss what makes it different, the things that make

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:48.896
up British humour, and of course you'll hear a few jokes along the way.

00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:55.631
It's going to be quite a fun one, and dare I say it, it could even be funny too.

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.751
Before we get right into that though, I just want to remind those of you listening

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:07.241
to the podcast on your favourite podcast app that you can get all of the bonus

00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:13.211
member-only episodes plus transcripts, key vocabulary, access to live Q and

00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:18.781
A sessions, and much more over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:25.001
If you are listening to these podcasts with the objective of improving your English,

00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:30.371
then I definitely recommend checking out the website, not just because we have all

00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:35.471
of that great extra content and learning materials on it, but also because there

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:42.041
are all sorts of guides and articles on how to improve your English using podcasts.

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:47.471
So if that sounds like something you'd be interested in and it certainly

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:52.371
sounds good to me, then the link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.421
Okay then, let's get started.

00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:03.751
If you are a new listener and you can't tell from my accent, I'm British.

00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:09.301
I've lived in lots of different countries and have friends from all over the world.

00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:14.051
And this has led me to the conclusion that the British sense of

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:21.521
humour is firstly an acquired taste, but secondly is indeed superior.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.691
Okay, I'm joking, but not really.

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.901
The British sense of humour is peculiar.

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:30.311
It's strange.

00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:36.971
And if you haven't really lived in the UK or you don't have British friends,

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:43.871
then it can be quite difficult to understand, or at least you probably

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:48.911
will just find British people weird if you don't know that they are joking.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.810
So what we will do in today's episode is talk about what makes up British humour.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.850
We'll go over the different types of humour that you might encounter in

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.050
Britain, and afterwards you can decide whether you think it's actually funny.

00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:13.314
To begin with in Britain, we laugh at pretty much everything.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:21.539
There is not really much that is off-limits and even the things that are off-limits, things that

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:29.369
are considered too bad or sensitive to joke about, we joke about the fact that they are off-limits.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:37.769
Laughing about a tragic set of circumstances is a quintessentially British thing to do.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:46.619
And while in some other cultures this would be completely taboo, completely forbidden, as long

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:52.969
as it's clear that it's a joke there are few things that are actually properly off-limits.

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:56.984
I'll talk about some of the different types of humour

00:03:57.284 --> 00:03:59.804
that you'll be likely to encounter in a minute.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:08.169
But let's just first touch on two of the key themes that exist in almost all British humour.

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:10.888
First, sarcasm.

00:04:12.228 --> 00:04:17.478
Now sarcasm, if you don't know what this word means, is defined

00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:23.688
as the use of irony to mock or convey contempt, to make fun.

00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:31.103
It's generally when you say something that is obviously the opposite of what you actually mean.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:36.443
An example you might hear would be someone saying, "no

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:41.243
shit, Sherlock" if someone else said something very obvious.

00:04:42.294 --> 00:04:47.027
The idea here is that they are calling you Sherlock Holmes, a famous

00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:51.287
detective, despite you pointing out something that was very obvious.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.762
So that is sarcasm.

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:58.459
Brits are famously sarcastic and it's sometimes difficult

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.379
for foreigners to understand when we are joking or not.

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:10.939
My wife is Italian, and when we first started dating, she made me a lovely meal.

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.479
I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was some

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.809
delicious Italian dish, some sort of pasta, I think.

00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:24.214
When she brought out, I asked her whether she minded me putting tomato ketchup

00:05:24.244 --> 00:05:30.694
on top, which was sarcasm, of course, because it was very tasty and tomato

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:35.614
ketchup would definitely have ruined it, at least in her opinion putting

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:41.254
something like tomato ketchup on pasta is almost a cardinal sin in Italy.

00:05:42.604 --> 00:05:47.479
Anyway, I thought it was pretty funny, she obviously thought it was funny

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.849
enough to eventually marry me, but it definitely took her awhile to understand.

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.280
So watch out for sarcastic Brits.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.950
If someone says something that seems unbelievable, they may well be joking.

00:06:03.357 --> 00:06:06.927
Secondly, a quality that is very common in British

00:06:06.927 --> 00:06:11.757
humour is self-deprecation, of putting yourself down.

00:06:12.717 --> 00:06:15.987
What I mean by this is making fun of yourself.

00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:20.847
In lots of cultures, this really isn't something that

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:25.137
is often done as it's seen as a sign of weakness.

00:06:26.127 --> 00:06:27.237
Not in Britain.

00:06:27.927 --> 00:06:32.757
There's nothing that we like doing more than making fun of ourselves, and

00:06:32.907 --> 00:06:37.797
it's one of the most common forms of humour that you will find in Britain.

00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:45.287
You might hear a Brit saying, "God, I'm good at this", if they mess something up

00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:51.017
or do badly, or just talking about something embarrassing that they have done.

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:58.923
Again, this might seem strange in lots of cultures, but it is a crucial part of British humour.

00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:06.631
Another important aspect of British humour is the delivery of the joke itself.

00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:14.401
It's important, vital even, to deliver it with a straight face, to not laugh.

00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:21.301
If you laugh when you're delivering a joke, you've failed, or you're American.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.541
It's almost like it's a competition.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:31.771
The person hearing the joke first has to laugh and only then are you allowed to laugh.

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:39.041
Or if you are being very British, nobody laughs, there's just a mutual understanding that

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:45.891
it was a joke, it was funny, but that there's no need to physically express your amusement.

00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:52.541
For people used to American culture, this is a big difference.

00:07:53.791 --> 00:08:00.326
While with lots of American comedy TV shows, for example, there is a laughter track,

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:08.546
there is the noise of people laughing whenever there is a joke, in the UK, it is pretty

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:14.696
rare for TV shows to have a laughter track, especially in the past 20 years or so.

00:08:15.716 --> 00:08:22.556
There's normally no sign, no signal, about what is a joke or not.

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:28.004
This is especially true with some of the most famous comedies

00:08:28.034 --> 00:08:33.014
from recent decades almost nobody laughs on screen ever.

00:08:34.328 --> 00:08:41.594
Another component of the British sense of humour is laughing about the most mundane, normal things.

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:47.391
Laughing about people's day to day lives, poking fun at people's

00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:53.031
day to day lives, about how painfully boring and ordinary they are.

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:58.711
Some great examples of this in recent years are shows

00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.181
like Peep Show, Gavin and Stacey and The Office.

00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:09.351
Now, if I were to describe to you what happens in these shows, you

00:09:09.351 --> 00:09:14.601
would probably think they sound incredibly boring and not funny at all.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:16.491
Let's just try.

00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:23.301
So Peep Show is about two university friends who are both unhappy in different

00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:29.538
ways and spend their days either doing jobs they hate or doing nothing.

00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:38.073
Gavin and Stacey is about the relationships between a series of characters in South Wales and East

00:09:38.073 --> 00:09:44.853
England who just travel back and forth between the two places and don't really do very much at all.

00:09:46.563 --> 00:09:50.433
And The Office is about people who work in a paper

00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:55.143
company, in a town outside London who all hate their jobs.

00:09:56.263 --> 00:10:03.510
I guess that none of these storylines sound particularly exciting, but they are, and not just

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:09.965
in my opinion, some of the funniest and most popular comedy series over the past 20 years.

00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:11.314
Why?

00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:16.954
Well, partly because a huge part of British humour is about

00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:22.654
laughing about the monotony of our lives, and laughing at ourselves.

00:10:23.464 --> 00:10:27.604
You don't need to be telling elaborate jokes or going on huge

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:32.674
adventures to be funny in British humour, you just need to be yourself.

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:38.907
Another big component of British humour, which is not as unique to

00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:43.287
British humour as the previous things I've mentioned, but is something

00:10:43.287 --> 00:10:48.727
we do a lot in Britain, is the use of innuendo and double-entendre.

00:10:50.074 --> 00:10:55.243
Innuendo is when you see something that alludes to or hints

00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:59.383
at something else, often something sexual or unpleasant.

00:11:00.783 --> 00:11:09.238
In fact, there are entire British comedy series that rely completely almost on innuendo, the most

00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:17.008
famous one is probably a series called the Carry On series, which came out in the late 1950s.

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:23.278
So if you want to see some classic British innuendo, most of it sexual,

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:28.138
actually, then I definitely recommend checking out the Carry On series.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:38.323
So we've had sarcasm, self-deprecation, deadpan delivery of jokes, laughing about boring,

00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:45.763
normal life, and innuendo these are some of the classic things that you will find in

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:52.343
almost all British comedy, and you'll see coming out in the British sense of humour.

00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:58.663
One other thing that British people love to joke about is

00:11:58.663 --> 00:12:02.413
stereotypes about people from different parts of Britain.

00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:06.868
Again, this isn't unique to Britain, of course.

00:12:07.108 --> 00:12:12.688
All countries, no matter how small, tend to have different stereotypes

00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:17.038
about people from different areas, but Britain is no exception.

00:12:17.878 --> 00:12:23.668
The difference with Britain, or rather the UK, is that it's formed of

00:12:23.668 --> 00:12:28.468
four different countries, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:33.763
And there are stereotypes about people from all of these areas.

00:12:35.053 --> 00:12:41.473
A classic joke is the format of having one person from three of these countries

00:12:42.013 --> 00:12:47.593
with the obvious stereotypes about characteristics of people from these places.

00:12:48.103 --> 00:12:52.243
So normally there is an Englishman, a Scotsman, and an

00:12:52.243 --> 00:12:55.903
Irishman or any mixture of people from the four countries.

00:12:56.803 --> 00:13:01.993
They usually enter a bar, the first two say something, then the

00:13:01.993 --> 00:13:06.463
third one does something that displays some stereotypical behaviour.

00:13:07.813 --> 00:13:11.533
And obviously these stereotypes depend on where you come from.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:19.873
In England, at least there is the stereotype that Irish people are not particularly clever, and

00:13:19.873 --> 00:13:25.213
in fact, there's exactly the same stereotype with Irish people, that the English are stupid.

00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:30.563
A stereotype of the Scottish is that they are quite tight

00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:34.853
with money and like to make money like to do business.

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:42.083
And there are some quite impolite stereotypes relating to the Welsh and their love for sheep.

00:13:43.793 --> 00:13:48.653
And for all four nations, there is the stereotype that they like to drink,

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:54.868
which for those of you that have spent time in any British city on a Friday

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:59.068
night, you probably think that there is truth behind every stereotype.

00:14:00.408 --> 00:14:03.018
So here's an example of one of these jokes.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:10.380
Two Englishman, two Irishman and two Scotsmen are shipwrecked on a desert island.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:20.590
Within a month, the Irishmen are whiskey, the Scots are selling it at their pub, and the Englishman

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.900
are drinking on opposite sides of the bar because they haven't yet been properly introduced.

00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:27.362
Do you get it?

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.417
Generally a good joke is a joke that you don't have

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:32.907
to explain, but I will just explain this one here.

00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:39.417
Obviously it's playing on the stereotypes that the Irishman like to drink, the Scots are

00:14:39.447 --> 00:14:44.337
entrepreneurial and like making money and that English people are shy and anti-social.

00:14:45.715 --> 00:14:49.813
I should point out, of course, that British humour isn't all the same.

00:14:50.353 --> 00:14:56.683
There are some big regional differences and you won't find exactly the same kind of jokes in

00:14:56.683 --> 00:15:03.823
Glasgow as you would in London or Birmingham as you would in Belfast, but these are some of

00:15:03.823 --> 00:15:10.308
the main traits, the main characteristics, that you will see across a lot of British humour.

00:15:11.548 --> 00:15:15.058
I'm biased here, of course, but I'd definitely say

00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:18.738
it is one of the more sophisticated senses of humour.

00:15:19.808 --> 00:15:25.308
It does take awhile to get used to, and it is very different to the sense of humour

00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:30.718
that exists in lots of other countries, but I would say that it is worth the time.

00:15:31.768 --> 00:15:36.543
Especially if you want to be able to hold a conversation with a British person

00:15:36.813 --> 00:15:42.403
in an informal setting, it's important to know a bit about their sense of humour.

00:15:43.623 --> 00:15:48.003
And if they start joking with you or if they start playing jokes

00:15:48.063 --> 00:15:53.073
on you, well then you know the conversation is going to go well.

00:15:54.723 --> 00:15:59.873
Okay then, that is it for today's episode on the British sense of humour.

00:16:00.513 --> 00:16:04.923
I hope it has been an interesting one and it has helped explain

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:09.433
some of the strange aspects of this weird sense of humour.

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:15.183
I'm going to leave some links in the show notes with some classic examples

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:19.263
of British humour, and I will leave you to enjoy those at your leisure.

00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:25.083
As a word of warning, they do rely on a lot of wordplay and

00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:29.013
innuendo, but there are a lot of pretty great jokes in there.

00:16:30.213 --> 00:16:34.323
As one final reminder, if you aren't looking for all of the bonus

00:16:34.323 --> 00:16:39.363

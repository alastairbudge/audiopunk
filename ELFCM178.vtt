Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:16.338
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.958
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.378 --> 00:00:27.718
I'm Alastair Budge and today is Part 3 of our 3-part series on The Space Race.

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:32.668
In Part One, we talked about how it started, and how the Soviets

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:36.948
scored some early victories, putting the first satellite into space,

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:41.108
the first animal into space, and then the first human into space.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:46.028
In Part Two, which was one of our member-only episodes, we talked about

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:50.298
the second half of The Space Race, the race to put a man on the moon.

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:54.088
And you don’t have to have listened to that episode

00:00:54.248 --> 00:00:57.508
to know that the Americans won that particular battle.

00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.668
And in today’s episode, Part Three, we are going to

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:04.818
talk about what has been called The New Space Race.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:09.818
In this episode we’ll cover what has happened since the end of the first Space

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:16.198
Race, ask ourselves why people have started talking about a “new” Space Race, what

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:21.878
is actually happening, why, and what might the future hold for space exploration.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:27.568
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:32.308
a member of Leonardo English and follow along with the subtitles, the transcript

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:37.028
and its key vocabulary over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:43.158
Membership of Leonardo English gives you access to all of our learning materials, all of our

00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:49.468
bonus episodes, such as Part Two of this mini series, as well as almost another 100 extra ones.

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:53.028
Plus you’ll get access to our awesome private community

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:56.818
where we do live events, challenges, and much, much more.

00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:02.748
Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:07.898
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.548
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:16.418
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:22.648
OK, let’s get started, and talk about The New Space Race.

00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:27.218
Let’s briefly remind ourselves where we left off in Part Two.

00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:35.018
On July 20th, 1969 , the United States of America became the first country to put

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:40.448
a man on the moon, when Neil Armstrong stepped out of the Apollo Lunar Module and

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:47.268
uttered the famous words “this is one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”.

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:54.638
Putting a man on the moon had been the big prize, and the Americans had scooped it, they had won.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:03:02.508
After that, enthusiasm for space exploration in America dwindled, it reduced significantly.

00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:08.538
Part of this was because the US government greatly lowered the budget for

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:13.988
NASA, it reduced the amount of money it set aside for space exploration.

00:03:14.688 --> 00:03:19.768
Part of it was because there wasn’t another attainable big next step.

00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:25.688
Putting a man on Mars was too complicated, and Venus was impossible.

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:31.608
The moon had been the big one, and the Americans had already done it.

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:33.878
It was also incredibly expensive.

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:39.238
The cost of the Apollo programme, which was the initiative to send an American

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:44.818
to the moon, is estimated to be around $200 billion dollars in today’s money.

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:46.618
Space wasn’t cheap.

00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:50.718
And on the other side of the Atlantic, or of the

00:03:50.718 --> 00:03:54.478
Pacific I guess, the USSR was starting to fall apart.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:04:00.738
It had lost the Space Race at the final hurdle, and although it did continue

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:06.078
its space programme, it was vastly reduced compared to the 1950s and 1960s.

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:12.958
The enthusiasm for big, ambitious space missions was not what it was, and

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:18.918
no decade has been as dominated by space exploration as the 1960s was.

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:24.818
Indeed, there are only 12 people who have ever been to the moon, and two

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:29.508
of them, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first two people to do it.

00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:32.698
So, what has changed?

00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:34.108
Has anything changed?

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:36.018
Well, yes.

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:41.958
A quick Google will reveal hundreds of thousands of results for “The New Space Race”,

00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:48.018
with videos and articles proclaiming that we are either in the middle, or about to start,

00:04:48.128 --> 00:04:54.288
a similar Space Race again, but this time with more players, and much higher stakes.

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:59.038
Indeed, it isn’t just sensationalist headlines, here’s

00:04:59.038 --> 00:05:01.808
the former Vice President of the US, Mike Pence.

00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:07.648
And make no mistake about it.

00:05:07.648 --> 00:05:08.418
We are in a space race today.

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:09.268
Just as we were in the 1960s.

00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:10.218
And the stakes are even higher.

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:13.668
So, what is actually happening?

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:19.998
There is certainly much more interest in space exploration than there was 30 years ago, there

00:05:19.998 --> 00:05:25.278
is more investment in space exploration technology, there are more companies working on it,

00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:31.538
and there is more activity in space now than there ever was during the first Space Race.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:37.488
For starters, there are more countries that have taken an interest in space exploration.

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:42.208
The USA and Russia are still two dominant players in

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.608
space exploration, but they have been joined by China.

00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:53.038
To date, up until now, only these three countries are capable of sending people to space.

00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:59.428
But, the number of countries that are able to send rockets into space, and therefore

00:05:59.448 --> 00:06:04.188
send objects such as satellites or probes to other planets, has dramatically

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:10.128
increased, and there are currently 11 - alongside the US, Russia and China,

00:06:10.318 --> 00:06:16.318
we have France, Japan, the UK, India, Israel, Ukraine, Iran and North Korea.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:21.298
What the past 20 years has seen though, which has been a major difference

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:26.488
between the first space race and now, is the emergence of private space

00:06:26.488 --> 00:06:31.208
companies, companies that are building their own space exploration technology.

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:38.648
Why this is important is that it no longer means that a country has to either build its own rocket

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:45.107
technology or pay another country to allow it to take its astronauts, or other spacecraft, to space.

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:50.817
Private companies, which have the objective of making a profit, will be happy to take

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:55.977
these people, satellites, or anything else to space, for the right price, of course.

00:06:56.507 --> 00:07:02.347
You have probably heard of some of these companies, but the dominant three are SpaceX, the

00:07:02.487 --> 00:07:08.367
company founded by Elon Musk, who is also the boss of Tesla and was a founder of Paypal.

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:13.537
Then there is Virgin Galactic, which is backed by Richard Branson,

00:07:13.587 --> 00:07:17.747
another billionaire and the founder of the Virgin group of companies.

00:07:18.097 --> 00:07:22.057
Technically Virgin Galactic is focussing on sending spacecraft

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:25.729
to the edge of space, but it is still a dominant player.

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:31.799
And the final one is Blue Origin, the space exploration company

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:36.179
founded and financed by Jeff Bezos, the man behind Amazon.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:42.928
You can see the theme here - you have to have a lot of money to start a space exploration company...

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:49.226
Although space exploration is still not cheap, the arrival of these private companies has

00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:55.366
increased competition, meaning that the cost of getting to space is lower than ever before.

00:07:56.316 --> 00:08:04.216
Indeed, for the 30 years between 1970 and 2000 the cost per kilo of sending an object

00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:11.665
to space remained pretty constant, at around 18,500 dollars per dollars per kilo . The

00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:18.675
American NASA space shuttles were even more expensive, at 54,500 dollars per kilo.

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:25.625
Now, SpaceX has reduced that cost to under $3,000 per kilogram.

00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:30.545
Still not cheap, but it’s 20 times cheaper than the space shuttle.

00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:35.495
It has done this mainly by developing reusable rocket technology.

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:42.575
You may have seen clips of the Falcon rocket, the SpaceX rocket, returning to Earth, where

00:08:42.665 --> 00:08:48.985
it can be refurbished, and then reused, which of course results in a large cost saving.

00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:52.875
These companies don’t exist for the public good, of course.

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:54.515
They exist to make money.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:59.465
As we’ve heard, Space exploration has historically been very expensive,

00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:04.615
and it was a notoriously difficult industry for companies to make money in.

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:10.845
But, the prize is so large, and investors think there is so much money

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:15.025
to be made, that billions of dollars are flooding into the sector.

00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:22.175
The space industry is worth just under 500 billion dollars at the moment, and is predicted

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:29.175
to triple to 1.4 trillion by the end of the decade, and to continue to rise after that.

00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:30.375
Why?

00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:34.276
Well, partly, given that it has become cheaper and

00:09:34.276 --> 00:09:37.406
cheaper to get to space, more countries are doing it.

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:44.536
Faced also with a finite amount of natural resources on Earth, there are those who believe that the

00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:51.026
solution to this is to take natural resources from outer space, and bring them back down to Earth.

00:09:51.806 --> 00:09:53.836
This is called space mining.

00:09:54.476 --> 00:09:58.686
There is the belief that a single football-pitch size asteroid

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:03.656
is going to contain as much as $50 billion worth of platinum.

00:10:04.126 --> 00:10:08.956
Of course, actually getting the platinum out of the asteroid and back

00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:13.546
to Earth is another question, but there is a growing belief that space

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:17.606
does contain vast amounts of minerals that we need back on Earth.

00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:22.926
The money to be made in space isn’t only going to come from what is found

00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:28.156
in space, though, but rather what putting objects in space enables us to do.

00:10:28.936 --> 00:10:36.256
Specifically, satellites, and what they allow both us as individuals, and nation states, to achieve.

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:42.446
On an individual level, we are all great beneficiaries of a large satellite network.

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:48.756
GPS, the Global Positioning System, which is made possible by only 24

00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:53.676
satellites, means that you or I can turn on our phone and see where we are.

00:10:54.646 --> 00:10:58.196
When it comes to mobile phone reception, unless you have a satellite

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:01.676
phone, you don’t currently get mobile phone signal from space.

00:11:02.126 --> 00:11:06.366
If you live in a relatively urban area, this isn’t a problem.

00:11:06.946 --> 00:11:13.346
But there are more than 2 billion people worldwide who don’t have mobile phone coverage.

00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:19.226
There is evidently a huge amount of money to be made in connecting this unconnected

00:11:19.226 --> 00:11:25.756
population, and doing this from satellites in space is one particular popular option.

00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:29.866
And when it comes to countries, and national security,

00:11:29.996 --> 00:11:33.776
having a satellite network in space comes in pretty handy.

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:39.637
While there are plenty of concerns about the right to privacy, being able to watch

00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:44.587
over your citizens from above is an attractive idea from a security perspective,

00:11:45.007 --> 00:11:50.227
especially for countries that aren’t so concerned about the privacy of their citizens.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:55.557
And the result of this is that there are more satellites than ever before,

00:11:55.837 --> 00:12:02.109
around 6,000 circling the Earth, of which only about 40% actually work.

00:12:02.965 --> 00:12:03.585
The rest?

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:07.615
Well, they are either broken or are no longer in use.

00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:12.995
Bringing them down to Earth is expensive, and so they are just left up there.

00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:19.825
And while space is, to state the obvious, absolutely massive, there is a growing

00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:25.415
concern about the amount of rubbish that is up there, so called “space junk”.

00:12:26.685 --> 00:12:31.665
Because of the high cost and difficulty of bringing things back down to Earth,

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:37.435
whether it is a broken satellite, a misplaced screwdriver, or a fuel tank,

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:42.245
there is a lot of stuff in space that has just been left there by humans.

00:12:43.105 --> 00:12:45.065
NASA currently tracks these.

00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:51.145
According to its website, there are approximately 23,000 pieces of debris

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:57.065
larger than 30cm, half a million pieces larger than 1 centimetre in diameter,

00:12:57.335 --> 00:13:02.765
and approximately 100 million pieces larger than 1 centimetre in diameter.

00:13:03.405 --> 00:13:05.045
That’s a lot of space junk.

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:12.150
And it isn’t just floating around harmlessly, given the gravitational pull of the Earth,

00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:18.753
it is traveling incredibly fast, it’s travelling at around 25,000 kilometres an hour.

00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:26.243
This means that even a very small object could do great damage to a spaceship or satellite.

00:13:26.783 --> 00:13:32.343
These objects are made to be light, so that they are easier to launch into space, they

00:13:32.343 --> 00:13:38.283
aren’t built to withstand collisions with other objects at 25,000 kilometres per hour.

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:44.503
So it is certainly a growing concern, with no easy immediate solution.

00:13:45.743 --> 00:13:48.913
Another element of space exploration that is also in

00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:52.343
need of a solution is the laws that apply to space.

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:58.934
In 1967, 10 years after the first satellite was launched, the Outer Space Treaty

00:13:58.934 --> 00:14:04.524
was signed, which sets out the principles of what you can and cannot do in space.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:10.544
It includes things like there should be no nuclear weapons in space, that the Moon should

00:14:10.554 --> 00:14:16.934
be used for peaceful purposes, and that space should be free for exploration by all states.

00:14:17.954 --> 00:14:23.144
But there are those who argue that it is now out of date, and fails to

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:28.764
reflect the true nature of what mankind’s ambitions for space really are.

00:14:29.814 --> 00:14:32.644
For example, how would space mining work?

00:14:33.044 --> 00:14:36.794
Who would “own” a settlement on the Moon, or Mars?

00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:43.624
There is a treaty relating to what you can and cannot do on the moon, called The Moon Treaty.

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:47.893
It specifies things like natural resources found on the moon

00:14:47.983 --> 00:14:52.393
should be shared by all of humanity, and you cannot own the Moon.

00:14:52.783 --> 00:14:58.003
But importantly it hasn’t been signed by any countries that can actually go to the

00:14:58.003 --> 00:15:04.193
Moon, and most importantly it hasn’t been signed by the three dominant players in space

00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:10.763
exploration - the US, Russia and China - so it’s not really worth the paper it’s written on.

00:15:11.763 --> 00:15:16.953
So, when it comes to the laws of space, there is still a lot to figure out.

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:24.717
But it is a very exciting time, and if this next phase of space exploration is anything like the

00:15:24.727 --> 00:15:30.597
first Space Race, then it will result in huge technological breakthroughs for us, back on Earth.

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:36.257
Indeed, while one might look at space exploration and think “well, that doesn’t

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:41.737
apply to me, as I’m not too keen on living on Mars”, the exciting thing about

00:15:41.737 --> 00:15:45.887
space exploration is how it might make our lives, back on Earth, better.

00:15:46.857 --> 00:15:51.567
Many of the technologies that came from the original Space Race were completely

00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:57.877
unexpected, from baby milk formula to memory foam for beds, and there will no doubt

00:15:57.877 --> 00:16:03.097
be discoveries that vastly improve our quality of life in this new space race.

00:16:04.037 --> 00:16:09.057
And one of the reasons that so many commentators are so much more optimistic

00:16:09.157 --> 00:16:14.157
about this “space race” than the previous one is that it is highly collaborative.

00:16:14.827 --> 00:16:21.177
Yes, there are still some regional rivalries, and it is of course a matter of great pride for

00:16:21.177 --> 00:16:27.947
a country to “own” a space discovery, or to be the first country to do something in space, but

00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:35.327
this new era of space exploration is the polar opposite of The Space Race of the 1950s and 60s.

00:16:36.557 --> 00:16:41.347
While the USSR and the US were fierce enemies, hiding their technological

00:16:41.347 --> 00:16:45.687
developments from one another and operating like space exploration

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:50.947
was a zero sum game, the modern era is dominated by collaboration.

00:16:52.087 --> 00:16:57.157
After the NASA space shuttle programme ended in 2011, American

00:16:57.177 --> 00:17:01.147
astronauts were actually taken to space by Russian spaceships.

00:17:01.727 --> 00:17:06.667
This stopped in 2020, after SpaceX won the contract, but was

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:10.737
a sign of how collaborative these two ex-enemies now were.

00:17:11.807 --> 00:17:17.537
In March of 2021 Russia and China signed a memorandum of understanding

00:17:17.697 --> 00:17:22.407
to set up a Lunar Research Centre, a research centre on the moon, and

00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:26.964
they offered equal access to any nation that wants to participate.

00:17:27.697 --> 00:17:32.897
Now that it is no longer a public competition, and there is the spirit that space

00:17:32.937 --> 00:17:38.157
exploration is a benefit for mankind, and not the citizens of one particular

00:17:38.207 --> 00:17:43.447
country, the modern space era is dominated by collaboration, not competition.

00:17:44.217 --> 00:17:47.247
While one can only hazard a guess about what might come

00:17:47.247 --> 00:17:51.597
next, it is hard to deny that it is very, very exciting.

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:58.977
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The New Space Race,

00:17:59.027 --> 00:18:03.007
and with that comes the end of this mini-series on The Space Race.

00:18:03.407 --> 00:18:06.757
I hope you enjoyed it, that you learned something new, and that it

00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:11.287

What are you most excited about for the future of space exploration?

00:18:20.117 --> 00:18:23.187
Do you even think it’s exciting, or do you think we

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:25.847
should prioritise the planet we are on right now?

00:18:26.227 --> 00:18:27.217
I would love to know.

Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:08.464
English.

00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:09.844
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.571
It's a new year and a new decade, which is exciting news, good news.

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.021
But unfortunately, I have some bad news for you.

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:27.851
It's that no doubt today and this week and this year's newspapers will be filled with all sorts of

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:36.671
bad news, floods, famines, murders, terrible things, just generally stuff going wrong.

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:46.331
Today though, we're going to talk about why that might be, talk about what this constant influx of

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:54.761
negative news is doing to us and imagine a world where the news wasn't always quite so negative.

00:00:55.396 --> 00:01:00.233
I normally start these podcasts with a reminder about how you can get the transcripts and key

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:05.723
vocabulary for the podcast on the website, but I'm not going to do that today, or at least not in

00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:07.643
any more length than I've just done.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.393
What I will say though is that I want your feedback.

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:15.573
I want to know what you like about the podcast, what you don't like, and what we could be doing

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:15.743
better.

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:22.623
And as a little reward for this feedback, I will personally correct every single one that I receive

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:24.693
and send it right back to you.

00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:30.753
So you can think of this as a free bit of English writing practice from a teacher and native

00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:31.143
speaker.

00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:37.593
So what you need to do is email hi hi@leonardoenglish.com with your feedback.

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:39.543
Just put feedback in the subject line.

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:42.113
I'll then correct it and send it straight back to you.

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.410
Okay then today, let's talk about the news.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.640
Not a particular item of news, but the news in general.

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:57.045
Specifically, why is the news always so negative?

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:04.685
Whether you're tuning in to the news on TV, sitting on a bench, reading a newspaper, or reading news

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:10.685
on your phone, or even listening to a podcast, a lot of the news is negative.

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:12.875
In fact, it's almost always negative.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:17.855
So famines, explosions, murders, genocide.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:25.100
If you took the news to be a representation of what goes on in the world today, well, it will be

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.870
quite a bleak picture.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.110
Of course, journalists would argue that the entire point of the news is to be newsworthy, right, to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.260
be worthy of the news, worthy of being talked about.

00:02:40.062 --> 00:02:45.950
And it's for exactly this reason that they'd say that the reason the news is negative is because

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.160
it's not that frequent and that's why it's worth being talked about.

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:55.466
They'd say that actually these terrible acts aren't so commonplace, and that's why they make up the

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:55.916
news.

00:02:56.526 --> 00:03:02.390
While of course there is an element of truth to this, what I want to do is look at some of the other

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.560
reasons why our news might be so negative and take a look at how this affects us as human beings.

00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:17.323
Let's start by asking ourselves, what is the role of journalism and who decides what is news?

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:25.623
Well, when you ask a journalist about why they became a journalist and what role journalism plays in

00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:32.464
the world, many would answer that it is to tell the stories that would otherwise go untold.

00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:42.124
To hold people, organisations, and countries to justice, to tell the world about what goes wrong in

00:03:42.124 --> 00:03:44.914
the hope that people will hold others accountable.

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:52.962
While this is of course true and a noble pursuit, you still have to ask yourself why these stories

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:55.122
are all so bloody and negative.

00:03:55.372 --> 00:04:01.870
Why, when you open a newspaper or turn on the news in the evening, why does it always lead with

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.160
negative stories?

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.111
Well, the reality is that it's not really the journalists who decide what makes the news.

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:17.127
Yes, they do the research and produce the stories, but if the editorial team decides it's not going

00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:23.517
to be a good story, then it won't get shown, or at least won't get the prominence that others do.

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:25.427
Why?

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:29.087
Well, like many things in life, it comes down to money.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:35.111
There's a famous phrase in journalism and that's if it bleeds, it leads.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.317
Leads here means is the first story to be covered, right?

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:44.453
The first story in the newspaper or the first story to come on the news on TV.

00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:52.418
Although we might not like to think it, humans seem to naturally gravitate towards stories of

00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:57.998
mortality, stories of things going wrong, and stories of people dying.

00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:05.786
From the Romans at the Colosseum to public executions, to the fact that cars slow down when there's

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:14.120
a road accident as the drivers try and catch a look, to news stories about murderers, humans seem

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.590
naturally attracted to stories of death and blood and gore.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.520
And there are all sorts of theories about why this is.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.660
Is it because it reminds us that we're alive?

00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:34.745
Is it a sort of gloating about the fact that you, the listener or the reader or the viewer is more

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.955
fortunate than the subject of the news item?

00:05:39.287 --> 00:05:45.954
Or is it because there is some kind of innate human instinct to not look away from others'

00:05:45.974 --> 00:05:46.664
misfortune?

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:53.181
I don't want to go too much into the psychological reasons for this, mainly because I don't know a

00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:54.081
huge amount about it.

00:05:54.696 --> 00:06:05.136
But the reality is it's taken for granted by news editors that stories full of blood and human

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:09.096
misery captivate the viewer or the reader's attention.

00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:13.956
And there have been numerous studies that have shown just this, right?

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:21.726
People love stories about misfortune, and news companies, which let's remember, are first and

00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:28.806
foremost commercial entities, depend on as many people as possible consuming their content for as

00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:34.476
long as possible, especially the ones that are supported by advertising business models.

00:06:35.376 --> 00:06:42.726
Because what happens is the more people are looking at a screen with the stories on or watching TV

00:06:42.726 --> 00:06:49.705
or opening up the pages of a newspaper, the more eyeballs there are and the more value the media

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:53.380
company can get by selling those to commercial advertisers.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.694
And while editorial and commercial teams in newsrooms are theoretically separated, in many cases,

00:07:01.694 --> 00:07:09.631
this Chinese wall is actually quite thin, especially with ad-supported media, it's the advertisers

00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:15.441
who ultimately pay the journalist's salaries, and so they need to make sure that the stories are

00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:19.081
generating enough interest to keep the advertisers happy.

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:20.611
Yeah.

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:26.761
If this is bursting your bubble, I'm sorry, but media companies can really tell exactly how much

00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:33.062
each article has earned them, and thus a journalist is to a commercial department, just another

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:34.802
income and expense item.

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:41.462
So you can see the cost of producing a story and then the amount of revenue it has brought in in

00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:47.732
terms of that, either that advertising revenue or the number of people who have read the story and

00:07:48.232 --> 00:07:54.362
evidently need to stay profitable a media company needs to have stories that bring in more money

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:55.802
than it costs to make them.

00:07:56.582 --> 00:07:58.295
And that's business 101 really.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:07.040
And so if as humans we are naturally gravitating towards stories of blood and misfortune, and the

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.900
news is very skewed towards the negative because that's what sells, how does this actually affect us

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.160
as human beings?

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:22.727
Unfortunately, like the subject of this podcast, it's not very good news.

00:08:23.265 --> 00:08:28.515
There's a lot of evidence to suggest that there are some pretty negative mental health effects

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.785
associated with consuming large amounts of news.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:38.713
If you're just consuming negative content, it's very easy to get into the mindset that the world is

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:43.183
a terrible place full of terrible people doing terrible things.

00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:52.201
Indeed, when you're only exposed to negative stories, it's increasingly hard to imagine positive

00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:52.621
things.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:09:00.124
Studies show that people develop a sense of anxiety and a feeling of helplessness, and if you're

00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:06.484
bombarded with negative stories and you're just one person out of, you know, 7 billion in the world

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:11.314
today, it's completely natural to feel a sense of helplessness.

00:09:12.109 --> 00:09:15.739
I guess perhaps this might be something that you can empathise with.

00:09:16.336 --> 00:09:24.270
So on a personal level, it's disturbing, but on a wider level, the constant bombardment of negative

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:31.500
news can also lead to people having a skewed perception of what truth is.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.770
So when people are asked about the perceived risk of something happening, something that is

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.575
frequently mentioned in the news is almost always considered to be more likely than it is.

00:09:44.474 --> 00:09:52.425
So, for example, despite the fact that crime in the UK had actually been falling since 1995 a recent

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:57.645
survey showed that 60% of people in England and Wales think it's been rising.

00:09:58.935 --> 00:10:00.105
So what's the cause of that?

00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:03.045
Mainly constant news stories about crime.

00:10:03.716 --> 00:10:09.373
Understandably, if you're bombarded with news about a particular thing, you're more likely to think

00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:10.663
that it's happening frequently.

00:10:11.983 --> 00:10:14.623
This, I imagine, is all quite familiar to you.

00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:19.406
And as humans we are really bad at actually understanding risk.

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:26.454
If we hear a story of something happening, we automatically think it might happen to us, even if the

00:10:26.454 --> 00:10:28.614
risks statistically are minuscule.

00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:38.701
But even worse than this, after someone is told the truth, humans are very bad at recalibrating

00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:40.021
their original idea.

00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:48.747
One very interesting thing that is actually quite scary is that even after we are told the truth,

00:10:48.777 --> 00:10:56.917
right, even after we have, statistics that are believable and true shown to us, we are very bad at

00:10:56.917 --> 00:11:03.640
recalibrating ourselves and we're not very good at forgetting that original point of reference.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.050
So if you have a point of reference about something, that is your reference point, and people really

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.560
struggle to move too far away from their original idea.

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:18.002
So this is something called judgemental anchoring.

00:11:19.363 --> 00:11:24.450
A fascinating example of this was something called the Gandhi thought experiment.

00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:33.630
Back in 1997 a group of behavioural psychologists took a group of participants and they split them

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.680
into two groups.

00:11:35.272 --> 00:11:44.131
One group was asked whether Gandhi was older than 140 when he died, and the other group was asked

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.111
whether he was younger than nine.

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:53.149
Right, so two groups One asked whether Gandhi was older than 140, the other asked if he was younger

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:53.629
than nine.

00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:57.636
Of course, both of these options are pretty implausible.

00:11:58.086 --> 00:12:03.936
Even if you don't know much about the life of Gandhi, you probably know his name and you assume that

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:09.246
he must have done enough with his life to have died when he was older than nine.

00:12:09.888 --> 00:12:15.491
And you probably also think, well, nobody lives to 140 so he must've been younger than that.

00:12:15.848 --> 00:12:23.135
But each group only had this one point of reference in their head about the age when Gandhi died.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:28.044
They were then asked to state how old they thought he was when he died.

00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:37.914
The group that had been given that over 140 anchor gave an average of 67 whereas the group that had

00:12:37.914 --> 00:12:43.584
been given the less than nine option gave an average of 50.

00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:52.059
So despite the implausibility of the original question, people are anchored, they're glued to the

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:57.939
first piece of information that they are made aware of, and that just anchors everything in their

00:12:57.939 --> 00:12:58.389
mind.

00:12:59.072 --> 00:13:05.134
So bringing this back to the negativity of the news, if people are constantly bombarded with

00:13:05.134 --> 00:13:08.764
negative pieces of information, then this is their anchor.

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:14.919
And no matter how much positive information they see, even if it's contradictory to the first piece,

00:13:15.249 --> 00:13:22.479
it's difficult to unwed, difficult to move yourself away from the first piece of information that

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:23.109
you received.

00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:24.939
It's mad, right?

00:13:25.498 --> 00:13:30.988
So again, bringing it back to the news, it means that even if we know that all these tragic events

00:13:31.228 --> 00:13:36.163
aren't really likely to happen to us, the fact that we've heard about them means they're still in

00:13:36.163 --> 00:13:37.183
the back of our minds.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:41.773
We're still thinking about them and we can't ignore them as a reference point.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.510
But what if the world wasn't like this?

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.540
What if news wasn't always so negative?

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:55.850
Should it really be that as humans, we only like to hear negative stories of industrial accidents,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:02.870
famines, bushfires, and we just accept that we all feel helpless in the face of the world's

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.500
problems?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:10.520
And we feel that the role of news is just to frighten us and make us overestimate the probability of

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.600
terrible things happening.

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:19.060
Well, I recently finished a book called, You Are What You Read by a lady called Jodie Jackson, and

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.910
she certainly thinks it doesn't need to be like this.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:30.400
She has been arguing for a solutions-based approach to journalism, which means a approach where the

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.920
news doesn't just talk about the terrible things that have happened in the world, but that

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.620
highlights the positive things that have happened.

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:46.314
And no, she is not advocating for a world where the news reports that no planes have crashed, or

00:14:46.704 --> 00:14:49.944
actually you don't have to be worried about being eaten by a shark.

00:14:50.394 --> 00:14:52.914
Of course, this wouldn't really be interesting.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.769
Solutions based journalism highlights stories of things that people have done in the world that

00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:00.729
inspire people.

00:15:01.479 --> 00:15:07.959
They are stories of people, of organisations and countries doing things that are making the world a

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:08.769
better place.

00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:16.329
Instead of highlighting disasters, it would be highlighting how disasters can be avoided.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:23.589
It could be highlighting great things that people have done, inventions, great acts and things that

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:31.044
inspire and uplift as opposed to strike fear into the minds of the viewer, of the reader.

00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:36.657
It's really early days for this kind of journalism, but if you're interested, you should definitely

00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:37.287
check her out.

00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:43.331
You can check out her website at jodiejackson.com I certainly think that there is a lot to be said

00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:49.361
for this kind of optimistic journalism, and certainly on this podcast, we're trying to tell

00:15:49.691 --> 00:15:55.871
inspiring stories about fascinating things, not frighten you with terrible news stories.

00:15:56.921 --> 00:16:03.821
In any case, if you are fed up of the constant negativity of the news cycle, then you shouldn't just

00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:07.241
throw up your hands and say 'pah', nothing we can do about it.

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:12.761
There are things you can do about it, and this doesn't mean that you have to retreat to a cottage in

00:16:12.761 --> 00:16:14.381
the middle of the woods with no electricity.

00:16:15.247 --> 00:16:21.367
Firstly, one thing that you can immediately do is to limit your intake of news.

00:16:22.552 --> 00:16:27.982
Yes, it's good to be informed, but there are many, many more productive uses of the hours in your

00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:35.602
day than being glued to a TV or website waiting to be updated on the latest famine, bushfire or

00:16:35.602 --> 00:16:36.412
plane crash.

00:16:36.802 --> 00:16:38.601
It's just simply not healthy.

00:16:39.718 --> 00:16:47.029
You can search out positive news stories, read longer form articles that inform and educate, not

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:48.649
just fearmonger and scare.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:54.424
And of course, listen to podcasts, not just this one, although of course, I hope that you will

00:16:54.424 --> 00:16:59.974
continue to do so, but there are thousands out there, both in English and I'm sure in your mother

00:16:59.974 --> 00:17:03.984
tongue that will teach and inform, not scare and frighten.

00:17:05.473 --> 00:17:11.760
I guess if you're listening to this podcast, then you are also learning English, and while flicking

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:18.960
through the news or flicking through social media might feel like a immediately good thing to do,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.840
long term it's probably not very good for you and you know that you would be much better spending

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.470
that time doing some kind of English learning activity.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.380
Which brings me on to the final point.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.520
So just read and listen to fiction.

00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:42.022
The human brain is the most amazing tool, and whether you're trying to read in English or in your

00:17:42.022 --> 00:17:46.132
own language fiction really is nutrition for the imagination.

00:17:46.382 --> 00:17:53.202
So picking up a fiction book and reading that for 30 minutes before you go to sleep will definitely

00:17:53.218 --> 00:17:58.678
leave you feeling more energized and less anxious than, you know, scrolling through the latest

00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:03.088
headlines or flicking through whatever your favourite social media app might be.

00:18:03.568 --> 00:18:06.658
So just try it right, try it for a week.

00:18:06.808 --> 00:18:09.148
Stop reading the news, cut yourself off.

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:15.798
I'm sure that your fears of being out of the loop won't really be true and there will certainly be

00:18:15.848 --> 00:18:22.241
outweighed by feelings of freshness and positivity and hopefully also improved English.

00:18:22.661 --> 00:18:24.671
What a fantastic way to start the year.

00:18:26.459 --> 00:18:30.198
Okay then, as always, thank you very much for listening to the show.

00:18:30.648 --> 00:18:34.878
I hope it has not been too negative, and I think there is some good news at the end.

00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:40.638
As I said at the start of the podcast, I would love to know what you think of the show.

00:18:41.028 --> 00:18:46.578

00:18:50.658 --> 00:18:52.088

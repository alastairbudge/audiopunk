Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:16.113
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:21.213
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:26.933
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Rare Earth

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:32.943
Elements, sometimes called Rare Earth Metals, or just ‘Rare Earths’ for short.

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:38.373
These are the 17 chemical elements that are very important for a

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:43.133
lot of the technology that you and I probably use on a daily basis.

00:00:43.703 --> 00:00:48.893
From laptops to mobile phones, electric cars to aeroplanes,

00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:53.283
missiles to magnets, Rare Earths are almost everywhere.

00:00:54.183 --> 00:01:00.193
So today, what we are going to do is to take a closer look at what they actually are,

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:08.003
whether they are actually that rare, where they are found, what the impact of us using them

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:14.813
is, and what the implications might be on how we think about ethically sourced minerals.

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:22.013
It might be a slightly more technical episode than our usual ones, but bear with me, you don’t

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:27.983
need to have any knowledge of chemistry or the periodic table for any of this to make sense.

00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:30.463
So, let’s get started then.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.363
Rare Earths are elements in the periodic table.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:40.763
There are 17 of them, as I said - I’m not going to name them all, partly because it

00:01:40.773 --> 00:01:45.623
doesn’t matter that much, and there’s a good chance you might not have heard of them.

00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:55.023
The first Rare Earth element was discovered by a Swedish soldier, in 1787, and gradually,

00:01:55.373 --> 00:02:01.383
over the course of the next 120 years, the remaining 16 elements were discovered.

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:08.863
But contrary to what the name might suggest, they aren’t actually that rare at all.

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:16.613
There are plenty of elements that are a lot rarer, a lot more rare, than any of the Rare Earths.

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:24.123
Gold, for example, is significantly less plentiful than any of the Rare Earth elements.

00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:34.333
The rarest of the Rare Earths, an element called Thulium, is about 125 times more common than gold.

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:38.793
And the most common of the Rare Earth elements, something

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:43.623
called Cerium, is 15,000 times more common than gold.

00:02:44.153 --> 00:02:46.683
So, they are not very rare at all.

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:55.073
And even if they were rare, in terms of there not being huge deposits of them, they are only really

00:02:55.073 --> 00:03:02.883
needed in very small quantities, which makes the Earth running out of them not such a great risk.

00:03:04.363 --> 00:03:09.743
But it is difficult to actually separate them from other elements, so

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:15.983
isolating a Rare Earth element is complicated, expensive, and nasty work.

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:19.263
We’ll come on to why this is relevant in a minute.

00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:26.543
But first, to examine the name of Rare Earths a little bit more, not only are

00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:31.853
they not rare, but they're also not really ‘Earth’, as you might imagine it.

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:36.373
They were just given the name ‘Earth’ because it’s the name for something

00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:41.733
that can dissolve in acid, not because they actually look like earth.

00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:46.243
So, Rare Earths are neither rare nor earth.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:50.653
It’s at this point I guess you might be wondering why

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:54.213
you’re listening to an episode about them, but bear with me.

00:03:54.283 --> 00:03:56.193
It’s about to get a lot more interesting.

00:03:57.183 --> 00:04:03.073
It turns out that Rare Earth elements have some fantastic properties, they are able

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:09.323
to do amazing things, that make them indispensable in a lot of modern technology.

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:15.083
They can create different types of light in certain conditions, so they are

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:21.383
used in euro banknotes for example, Euro paper money, as an anti-fraud measure.

00:04:22.443 --> 00:04:28.743
When the notes are held under a ultraviolet light, they give off a special kind of light.

00:04:28.753 --> 00:04:36.413
So when you pay for something with a euro banknote, and the shop assistant passes it under a kind of

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:43.533
light to check that it’s real, and it gives off this dazzling light, this is thanks to Rare Earths.

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:50.633
Rare Earth elements can also be used to make super strong magnets, the kind of ones that

00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:57.213
could puncture human skin, or more practically speaking, lift something incredibly heavy.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:04.783
You’re even using a magnet with a Rare Earth in now, probably, even though I guess you

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:11.163
don’t know it - Rare Earths are used in computer hard drives, mobile phones, and speakers.

00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:13.063
And the list could go on.

00:05:13.373 --> 00:05:20.063
Batteries for electric cars, magnets in wind turbines, MRI scanners, computer screens,

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:25.843
radars, aeroplanes, cameras, lasers, nuclear reactors, they are all over the place.

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:34.033
And although these Rare Earths aren’t actually very rare at all, they are difficult to extract,

00:05:34.653 --> 00:05:41.753
and this has meant that the vast majority of the world’s Rare Earths all come from one place.

00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:42.923
China.

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:50.943
China produces anywhere from 80-95% of the world’s Rare Earth elements.

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:57.303
You heard earlier that actually getting these Rare Earth elements is difficult to do.

00:05:57.793 --> 00:06:03.193
It’s difficult in terms of being hard, messy, and dangerous work,

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:08.263
but you don’t need huge, multi-million dollar factories to do it.

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:17.253
In fact, when the Rare Earth industry got started in China, in the 60s, it was a bit of a

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:23.593
cottage industry, it was something that could be done relatively inexpensively by individual

00:06:23.593 --> 00:06:29.763
groups of farmers or villages, often illegally, without proper government permission.

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:35.183
The process of actually getting a finished Rare Earth element

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:39.293
means first digging up the ground where these elements are.

00:06:39.743 --> 00:06:43.423
Then you need to actually separate the elements from each other.

00:06:43.873 --> 00:06:49.723
And this isn’t a case of just rubbing some earth and ta-da, you see a shining Rare

00:06:49.723 --> 00:06:56.163
Earth element there, like you might imagine happens when you mine for diamonds or gold.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.813
This process is pretty dangerous, and the soil that

00:07:00.813 --> 00:07:05.696
contains the Rare Earth elements can often be radioactive.

00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:14.086
Secondly, only a tiny percentage of the earth will contain the Rare Earth elements, and

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:20.506
the process of actually getting the finished elements results in a lot of toxic waste.

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:29.036
Specifically, to get 1 tonne of Rare Earths, around 75 tonnes of toxic waste is produced.

00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:35.886
The process typically involves crushing the elements into a fine

00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:41.716
powder, then adding them to big pools, big tanks, with this highly

00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:47.206
toxic liquid inside, and these tanks are normally just left uncovered.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:53.466
There are some amazingly scary pictures of these Rare Earth mines in

00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:58.397
South China, and of the waste that they have all just left behind.

00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:06.527
If you close your eyes and imagine a beautiful Chinese hillside landscape, then add some

00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:12.877
highly scenic pools on the side of the hill, but the difference here is that these pools

00:08:12.937 --> 00:08:20.747
are full of highly toxic, highly polluting acid, that if the pool burst, or if there were

00:08:21.227 --> 00:08:26.957
a landslide or anything that caused the liquid to escape, it would be hugely damaging

00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:32.877
to the nearby environment, and if it got into rivers, well that would be a big problem.

00:08:34.287 --> 00:08:38.877
And these Rare Earth elements, even though they were used in lots of

00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:44.157
high-tech devices, expensive technologies, they were actually pretty cheap.

00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:49.757
Extracting Rare Earths wasn’t a profitable activity by any means.

00:08:50.787 --> 00:08:55.757
Indeed, there were also Rare Earth mines outside China, including a big

00:08:55.757 --> 00:09:00.887
one in California, but it just wasn’t profitable enough to keep them going.

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:06.317
Not only were Rare Earth elements quite cheap, but it was

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:10.797
expensive to extract them in an environmentally friendly way.

00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:17.827
So the majority of these non-Chinese mines just stopped, they went out of business,

00:09:18.147 --> 00:09:24.527
leaving China to have a virtual monopoly on Rare Earths, not because it was better, or

00:09:24.777 --> 00:09:30.987
because they exist only in China, but because China could produce them at a lower cost.

00:09:32.527 --> 00:09:36.807
There are still thousands of these ponds in the hills of Southern

00:09:36.807 --> 00:09:41.937
China, filled with highly toxic waste from producing these Rare Earths.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.510
When the Rare Earth elements were sold, the price was too low to factor in

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:55.610
the cost of the clean up, and so now these Rare Earth mines are left with

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:02.010
these pools that dot the hills, and no plan about how to get rid of the waste.

00:10:02.944 --> 00:10:05.563
There are two differing points of view on this.

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:12.433
The Chinese side argues that actually the consumers of Rare Earths should

00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:16.873
pay the price for the clean-up - the technology companies that bought the

00:10:16.873 --> 00:10:22.103
Rare Earths at the prices that didn’t reflect the cost of the clean up.

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:27.324
They say that the West has got used to cheap technology, and

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:31.114
hasn’t had to pay for the environmental costs of production.

00:10:32.204 --> 00:10:35.954
Naturally, the technology companies aren’t having any of it.

00:10:36.534 --> 00:10:41.934
They paid for the Rare Earths, it’s not their problem if these Chinese Rare Earth mines

00:10:42.144 --> 00:10:47.014
gave them a price that was so low that it didn’t factor in cleaning it up properly.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.004
It is an interesting question.

00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:57.564
When most of us look at our mobile phone, TV, or camera, we don’t necessarily think of this

00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:04.694
as having the same environmental or societal impact as when we consider, let’s say, buying

00:11:04.694 --> 00:11:10.104
a plastic water bottle, or deciding whether to buy something that is fair trade or not.

00:11:11.434 --> 00:11:16.094
Of course, the considerations and impacts are different, but the principle is

00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:21.944
similar - a lot of the ‘dirty work’ in the production of electronics has been

00:11:22.144 --> 00:11:28.304
outsourced to countries where environmental restrictions are significantly less strict.

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:34.174
There’s an expression in English, which is ‘out of sight, out of mind’.

00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:37.774
If you hadn’t guessed what it means, it means that

00:11:38.094 --> 00:11:40.874
if you can’t see something, you don’t think about it.

00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:46.377
I know that there are similar expressions in other languages, interestingly

00:11:46.377 --> 00:11:50.927
in French and Italian it would be translated as ‘far from your eyes, far

00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:55.207
from your heart’, which is a lot more romantic, but you get the gist.

00:11:56.317 --> 00:12:01.077
Rare Earths are definitely a case of ‘out of sight, out of mind’.

00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:05.277
It’s dirty, difficult work, and there is a significant

00:12:05.317 --> 00:12:08.767
environmental cost that most of us aren’t aware of.

00:12:10.177 --> 00:12:17.937
The Rare Earths that go into a smartphone typically result in around 380g of toxic

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:25.407
waste, for a laptop it’s around 1.22kg of toxic waste, and for the battery that goes

00:12:25.407 --> 00:12:32.517
in an electric car, it’s almost 3kg or toxic waste, just to produce the Rare Earths.

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:40.117
And if you are wondering where this waste actually now goes, the answer might surprise you.

00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:47.237
The semi-amateur Rare Earth mines in South China are no longer

00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:50.757
really in use, although the toxic pools are still there.

00:12:51.907 --> 00:12:58.507
Production has shifted north, it has moved north, and there is a huge Rare Earth

00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:04.107
mine in an area of China called Inner Mongolia, next to the border with Mongolia.

00:13:05.377 --> 00:13:10.647
Unlike the semi-amateur operations down south, in Inner Mongolia

00:13:10.837 --> 00:13:15.707
there are huge mines, the largest of which is called Bayan'obo.

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:20.777
It’s here that 40% of the world’s Rare Earths are

00:13:20.817 --> 00:13:25.237
produced, and the area is dominated by the Rare Earth mine.

00:13:26.477 --> 00:13:31.317
And even though the process may be more industrialised, and more

00:13:31.317 --> 00:13:35.687
professional, it doesn’t really make it any more environmentally friendly.

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:43.307
There was a BBC article about it and the title of the article was ‘The Worst Place on Earth’.

00:13:45.107 --> 00:13:51.557
In the area around the Rare Earth mines of Bayan’obo, instead of there being lots of small

00:13:51.807 --> 00:13:58.401
pools filled with this toxic waste from Rare Earths, there is an 8 kilometre wide lake.

00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:04.711
It was described by the journalist writing the article as ‘Hell on Earth’.

00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:12.711
The pictures really are quite something to behold, and it does look like it's something out of a

00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:20.141
dystopian horror film rather than the world that we actually live in, and a byproduct of many of the

00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:25.871
products that we all use, including the laptop or phone that you are probably listening to this on.

00:14:27.261 --> 00:14:35.411
The end result, the phone, tablet, or Tesla electric car, is incredibly clean, and it is many

00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:43.421
degrees separated from the mines at Bayan’obo, but there is probably a good chance that a very

00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:50.121
small part of the device that you are using, at some point, did pass through this part of China.

00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:56.491
But China doesn’t want to be stuck doing this dirty,

00:14:56.511 --> 00:15:00.271
low-end work of just producing Rare Earth elements.

00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:08.701
It might have been happy to do the world’s dirty work in the 1990s or early 2000s, but as it

00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:15.441
is trying to transition to a more services, technology-led economy, it would rather not be

00:15:15.661 --> 00:15:23.311
messing around with toxic lakes and hazardous liquids, and wants to be making the batteries,

00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:30.601
the phones, the actual components itself, doing the more highly-skilled, more profitable work.

00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:37.681
China has even experimented with banning the exports of pure Rare Earth

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:44.511
elements, and it did so to Japan in 2010, after a diplomatic incident.

00:15:45.557 --> 00:15:50.804
Commentators are split, they are undecided, over what the impact

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:56.444
would be if there was a global export ban on Rare Earth elements.

00:15:57.345 --> 00:16:02.175
There are those who say it could be devastating to the global technology

00:16:02.185 --> 00:16:07.255
supply chain, and would mean that more people ended up buying Chinese

00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:12.259
electronics, because the Rare Earths couldn't be exported to foreign companies.

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:17.859
But there are others who say that actually it wouldn’t be a huge deal.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:25.689
After the ban on exports to Japan, Japanese companies found ways to use fewer Rare Earths,

00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:32.459
plus - as we said before - Rare Earths really aren’t that rare, and other countries would

00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:37.639
end up doing the dirty work that China does, if the demand was high enough of course.

00:16:39.149 --> 00:16:43.569
So what can we take, if anything, from today's story?

00:16:44.412 --> 00:16:51.859
It’s really a tale of the global supply chain, how many high-tech, or even ‘green’ products

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:58.329
that end up bought by consumers all over the world actually start out somewhere very different.

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:04.739
We might already know, and have seen images, of how iPhones or TVs are

00:17:04.739 --> 00:17:09.729
produced in factories, and maybe you have read stories about how little

00:17:09.749 --> 00:17:13.799
these workers might be being paid, and the conditions in which they work.

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:19.139
But what is far less known is the environmental impact of

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:22.729
the raw materials that actually go into these products.

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:29.459
And when it comes to Rare Earth elements, and smartphones, TVs, and even

00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:35.099
electric cars, it’s clear that the environmental impact is not insignificant,

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:41.769
but that the general view on this seems to be ‘out of sight, out of mind’.

00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:48.979
OK, that is it for today's episode on Rare Earth elements.

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:56.499
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show, the email is hi@leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:01.739
Our next episode is actually on electric cars, which as you’ve heard,

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:06.049
need Rare Earths to function, so I hope you’ll enjoy that one too.

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:12.149
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:17.749
I’m Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I’ll catch you in the next episode.

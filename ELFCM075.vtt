Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:16.002
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:20.632
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:27.578
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Camorra, the organised

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:34.188
crime structure that originates in Naples, but has tentacles that stretch all over the world.

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:40.898
We’ll talk about what the Camorra is, where it comes from, how it got to where

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:47.488
it is today, and discuss how inseparable it is in many ways from life in Naples.

00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:53.458
It is an intriguing story, and I’m excited to share it with you today.

00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:56.468
So, let’s get started.

00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:01.858
Naples, if you haven’t ever been there before, is an

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:05.538
absolutely amazing city, like nowhere else in Italy.

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:12.448
There’s a famous phrase, which is ‘see Naples and then die’, meaning that once you have

00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:17.858
seen the city, you can die peacefully, because nothing else in the world can match it.

00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:25.164
We aren’t going to be talking specifically about Naples today, but we are going to be talking

00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:31.554
about an organisation that is inextricably linked to the city and the surrounding region.

00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:38.244
The Camorra, or as it’s known in Naples, “O Sistema”, The System.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:46.574
While it would be easy to just skip forward to the modern day, the origins of the Camorra are

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:54.024
pretty interesting, and really help you understand how it got to be so rooted in its home city.

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:59.814
Although where the Camorra originally comes from is a little debated, historians

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:07.594
tend to agree that it started to emerge around the 17th or 18th century.

00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:17.328
It started as local gangs that would just live off petty criminal activity, but by the mid 19th

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:24.768
century the Camorra had grown and grown, and its members held a lot of power in the city of Naples.

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:32.578
Now, as a reminder, until 1861, Italy was a collection of different

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:37.318
city states; the unified country that we know today didn’t exist.

00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:44.408
In 1848 there were a series of revolutions in Italy where liberals

00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:48.518
sought to overthrow the monarchs that were ruling their states.

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:58.027
In Naples, the liberals paid the Camorra to drum up, to get support for the revolution.

00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:03.497
The Camorra had influence over the city’s poor, and the liberals

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:08.037
knew that they would need their support to overthrow the king.

00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:15.167
Of course, this support came with a price, and not just a financial one.

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:21.777
Members of the Camorra were rewarded by the liberals with positions of power

00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:27.197
within the local government, and they soon found themselves no longer just a

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:33.407
series of street criminals, but with influence in local politics and government.

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:43.947
When the Italian unification was finally achieved, on March 17, 1861, the new government found

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:49.937
that within Naples, the Camorristi, the members of the Camorra, they had managed to infiltrate

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:55.911
the city’s bureaucracy, and so the new government started a campaign to try to get rid of them.

00:03:57.411 --> 00:04:05.221
And although some were removed, over 150 years later, the Camorra still exerts a powerful hold

00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:12.461
over large parts of the city, the surrounding area, other parts of Italy, and even further afield.

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:18.321
There are a few aspects to the Camorra that are worth pointing out in

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:24.161
terms of explaining how they have managed to maintain and grow their power.

00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:30.241
Firstly, from a structural point of view, the Camorra is

00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:35.521
organised very differently to things like the Sicilian mafia.

00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:43.741
With a Sicilian-style mafia, there’s usually one large boss, a godfather-type

00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:50.071
figure, and the organisation extends downwards in a pyramid-type formation.

00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:58.471
With the Camorra, it’s much more horizontal, or at least, there are more smaller pyramids.

00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:06.591
It’s divided into a series of clans, often along family lines, each with its own boss.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.531
The first impact of this is that they are harder to get rid of.

00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:18.401
A new clan is relatively easy to form, and breaking up one, or

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:23.501
capturing one boss doesn’t do much to the overall organisation.

00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:33.281
And secondly, these bosses of the clans have enormous power on a hyperlocal level, and getting

00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:41.961
anything done in a local area often requires the approval, support or help of the local clan leader.

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:48.891
What this means is that some ruthless politicians enlist these leaders

00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:54.071
to get people to vote in local elections, and in return, the bosses

00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.911
are able to exert a large amount of power over their local government.

00:06:00.551 --> 00:06:05.021
So the result of these two structural elements means that the

00:06:05.021 --> 00:06:10.181
Camorra is entwined with a lot of Neapolitan life, its approval and

00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:16.321
help is required to get many things done, much like it was in 1848.

00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:25.361
But the Camorra hasn’t stood still for the past 170 years, and as a criminal organisation,

00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:31.821
its interests and businesses have expanded, and become immensely more profitable.

00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:39.011
It would be hard to tell this story without mentioning one particular individual, Paulo Di Lauro.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:45.491
Now, Di Lauro is probably the man who has had the largest influence on the Camorra.

00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:54.431
Not a huge amount is actually known about a lot of his life, but here is at least what is believed.

00:06:55.931 --> 00:07:00.351
He was born in 1953, and he joined the clan of an

00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:04.061
eccentric local boss, a man called Aniello La Monica.

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:10.834
He was given responsibility over the clan’s accounts, over their finances, in

00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:18.554
around 1975, and it was here that he saw quite how much money the clan was making.

00:07:20.424 --> 00:07:24.084
The clan’s main business activities at the time were things like

00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:29.644
extortion, black-market cigarettes, construction, and that kind of stuff.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.354
They made a lot of money, but Di Lauro had a better idea.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:35.954
Drugs.

00:07:37.174 --> 00:07:41.484
He thought that by starting to deal in things like cocaine,

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:45.814
heroin, and cannabis, the clan could make significantly more money.

00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:50.514
He persuaded his boss, La Monica, to go for it.

00:07:51.624 --> 00:07:55.964
The clan started dealing drugs, and as you might imagine,

00:07:56.354 --> 00:08:00.054
they started making a lot more money almost immediately.

00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:05.654
Then two things happened that really changed the fate

00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:09.054
of Di Lauro, and you could also say, of the Camorra.

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:15.504
Firstly, in 1980 there was a huge earthquake in Naples,

00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:19.404
which destroyed a lot of the housing in the city centre.

00:08:21.074 --> 00:08:25.124
The local government built vast new housing blocks to the

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.754
north of the city, where the city’s poor were moved to.

00:08:30.294 --> 00:08:35.604
These would become ideal places for drug dealing, as we’ll find out shortly.

00:08:37.104 --> 00:08:42.804
Then, in 1982, Di Lauro's boss, La Monica, was murdered.

00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:47.654
The king was dead, and Di Lauro had his chance to take over control.

00:08:48.734 --> 00:08:55.354
Now, it has been alleged that Di Lauro himself ordered for his boss to be murdered,

00:08:55.751 --> 00:09:01.557
and several supergrasses, criminals who give evidence to the police, several

00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:07.327
supergrasses have come forward and implicated Di Lauro directly in the murder.

00:09:08.737 --> 00:09:12.637
La Monica’s death certainly was convenient for Di Lauro,

00:09:12.977 --> 00:09:16.927
and he seized the opportunity to become the new boss.

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:24.257
These new apartment blocks to the north of the city became wholesale drug markets.

00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:29.667
Their design made them almost the perfect place for selling

00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:32.977
drugs without the fear of being caught by the police.

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:40.077
They had vast internal areas, and they could be closed off from the outside.

00:09:41.577 --> 00:09:48.317
They were often in large, open areas, so if there was a police raid, the lookouts,

00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:54.727
the guards, they would warn everyone immediately, and there would be enough time so

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:59.957
that when the police did get in, they wouldn’t find anything illegal going on there.

00:10:01.397 --> 00:10:06.837
This turned the area to the north of Naples, areas called Scampia and

00:10:06.837 --> 00:10:11.427
Secondigliano, into the largest open air drug markets in the world.

00:10:12.807 --> 00:10:17.627
The drugs were cheap, and it was a place that people would come to from

00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:23.227
all over Italy to buy drugs without fear of being caught by the police.

00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:30.557
Di Lauro controlled this area, and he grew fantastically rich off the profits.

00:10:32.047 --> 00:10:35.667
Unlike the sort of gangster that you might be imagining though,

00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:41.277
he kept a very low profile, and was practically anonymous.

00:10:42.044 --> 00:10:47.294
People knew of him, of this mythical figure that controlled

00:10:47.294 --> 00:10:50.994
the area, but they didn’t know who he actually was.

00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:57.694
He didn’t have the flashy cars, he didn’t throw big parties, or carry a weapon.

00:10:58.554 --> 00:10:59.424
And that was the plan.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:04.874
He knew that key to his survival was staying undercover.

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:11.524
He was running a multi-million dollar criminal enterprise, and if the

00:11:11.524 --> 00:11:16.294
police knew his identity, his life would be made an awful lot harder.

00:11:17.784 --> 00:11:22.694
But, as with almost any life of crime, the good times don’t last,

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:27.864
and sometimes bad news comes from the most unexpected of areas.

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:32.969
Di Lauro had a large family, with 11 children in total.

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:38.189
At school one day, one of his children was slapped

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:41.929
by a teacher as a punishment for shouting in class.

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:47.909
Some members of the clan decided that this slap on the child

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:54.029
was an insult on the clan, and they went to beat up the teacher.

00:11:55.509 --> 00:12:02.489
The teacher filed an official complaint, and Di Lauro, as the boy's father, was

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:07.799
called into a police station to respond to questions about the assault on the teacher.

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:13.289
Although Di Lauro said he didn’t know anything about it, the police

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:18.486
took pictures of him, they took mugshots, and they then released him.

00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:26.966
He said that he was just a shopkeeper, and as he wasn’t known to the police, he was just let go.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.862
But, for several years, the police had been tapping the phone lines of the clan,

00:12:33.142 --> 00:12:38.082
they had been conducting surveillance and listening to their conversations.

00:12:39.002 --> 00:12:42.782
They had never heard the name Di Lauro, but there was

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:47.562
frequent talk of someone called Pasquale, or The Rabbit Man.

00:12:48.612 --> 00:12:54.332
When Di Lauro was released, the police overheard people talking about Pasquale being

00:12:54.332 --> 00:13:01.262
released, and it was clear that this Pasquale and Paolo Di Lauro were the same person.

00:13:02.312 --> 00:13:05.722
Di Lauro was obviously pretty scared by this encounter.

00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:13.482
He was now known to the police, and he retreated further and further, moving from safehouse to

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:19.932
safehouse, paranoid that the game was up, and that he was going to be captured by the police.

00:13:21.492 --> 00:13:26.982
However, despite the police knowing who he really was, they had to prove the case.

00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:31.862
Even if they did know where he was, which they didn’t,

00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:35.102
they couldn’t just walk in there and arrest him.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:44.382
For the next 4 years they built up evidence, and finally issued a warrant for his arrest in 2002.

00:13:45.882 --> 00:13:51.082
But it wasn’t to be until 3 years later that he was found, hiding in the

00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:56.902
apartment of an old lady in Secondigliano, bang in the middle of his territory.

00:13:58.592 --> 00:14:02.832
He is now in a maximum security prison, under 24hr

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:07.022
surveillance, and he still claims that he is only a shopkeeper.

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:13.346
Italy has this law called 41-bis, which is a punishment

00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:16.736
reserved for serious organised crime leaders.

00:14:17.476 --> 00:14:23.032
It involves complete isolation, 24 hour surveillance, no contact with

00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:27.906
any other prisoners, no news , and the only allowed visits are those from

00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:34.706
lawyers, and there is one visit from one family for one hour a month.

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:41.596
It’s obviously incredibly testing, and the idea is that you cave, you give

00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:46.266
in, and give the police information on other members of your organisation.

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:56.072
Di Lauro has been under this 41-bis regime since he was put in prison, but he hasn’t said a word.

00:14:56.902 --> 00:15:01.132
He has remained completely silent for the past 15 years.

00:15:02.572 --> 00:15:07.342
And although Di Lauro has gone, there is a new generation of Camorristi.

00:15:07.952 --> 00:15:11.012
This time though, they’re not exactly like the last.

00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:17.032
They’re younger, more social media savvy, and far more ostentatious.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:25.172
Roberto Saviano, the author of the famous book Gomorra that really showed the world how far

00:15:25.172 --> 00:15:32.472
the Camorra’s influence stretches, he published a book in 2018 all about this new generation.

00:15:34.162 --> 00:15:40.912
In Italian it's called La Paranza dei bambini, which means a little fishing boat of kids.

00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:44.532
But in English it was translated as The Piranhas.

00:15:46.142 --> 00:15:54.302
This book tells the story of a group of young boys that are the new generation of the Camorra.

00:15:54.302 --> 00:15:59.632
They are ambitious, fearless, and lack any of the historical

00:15:59.652 --> 00:16:04.802
understanding that their older generations had, so they aren’t afraid

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:10.492
to show the world their ill-gotten gains and their lavish lifestyle.

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:14.829
This does seem to make things easier for the police though.

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:20.309
Unlike Di Lauro hiding in the shadows, with few even knowing what

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:26.089
he looked like, these teenagers rob, steal and drug deal in the city

00:16:26.089 --> 00:16:30.949
centre, and flash everything on social media for everything to see.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:38.159
And the results of posting all this stuff on social media are as you might expect.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:46.689
In 2018 42 members of these Piranha groups were arrested by the police and

00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:53.149
sentenced to a combined 500 years in prison, and there are frequent sad

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:58.089
stories of these young boys killing each other on the streets of Naples.

00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:02.009
There’s lots more about the Camorra that we aren't going to have the chance

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:07.759
to speak about today, from fashion to construction, to rubbish collection,

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:14.119
but I want to finish with one particular personal story in today’s episode.

00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:20.969
Now, I actually lived in Naples for 6 months, back in 2008.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:28.879
Not long, I know, but long enough to have experienced some of this, albeit from a distance.

00:17:29.836 --> 00:17:35.055
I was doing an ERASMUS placement, learning Italian and Mandarin at the university there.

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:41.675
I lived by the train station, which, if you have ever been to Naples, you will know that

00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:47.145
it’s not the nicest area of the city, but it’s certainly not the middle of Camorra territory.

00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:52.605
On one of my last nights living there, we had a small party.

00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:57.705
We weren’t particularly loud at all, but obviously we were loud enough

00:17:57.705 --> 00:18:01.745
to have upset some of the people who lived in the nearby apartments.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:07.335
But if you have a problem like this in Naples, you don’t call the police.

00:18:08.115 --> 00:18:09.865
We found this out the following morning.

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:19.005
At probably 8 o'clock there was a battering on the door, and bleary eyed, I went to the door.

00:18:20.485 --> 00:18:25.655
As I opened it, a group of probably 10 men pushed straight

00:18:25.675 --> 00:18:29.525
into the apartment, and formed a big circle around me.

00:18:30.675 --> 00:18:34.175
This definitely wasn’t how I’d imagined starting my day.

00:18:35.725 --> 00:18:39.365
They said that they had heard some complaints from the neighbours about

00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:44.275
noise, and had come to check that we weren’t planning on doing it ever again.

00:18:45.575 --> 00:18:50.865
I don’t think I’ve ever been more afraid in my life, and I’m sure that these men could see that.

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:55.255
After a few minutes of discussion, where I gave them

00:18:55.255 --> 00:18:58.435
my word that it would never happen again, they left.

00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:03.775
Now, I spoke to a few Neapolitan friends about this

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:07.985
afterwards, and it was pretty interesting what they had to say.

00:19:09.685 --> 00:19:10.995
Were they Camorra?

00:19:11.555 --> 00:19:13.155
Maybe they were, maybe they weren’t.

00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:16.165
Who knows, and does it really matter?

00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:19.795
My friends didn’t really seem to think much of it.

00:19:20.275 --> 00:19:26.945
For them, was it such a bad thing that these men came to check out a complaint of too much noise?

00:19:27.825 --> 00:19:31.435
The police wouldn’t do it, and so these men stepped in.

00:19:32.725 --> 00:19:38.145
Yes, they might be doing all sorts of other things that are hugely detrimental for

00:19:38.145 --> 00:19:44.260
society, but in some cases they are filling the gaps that the state isn't able to fill.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.150
And this is perhaps the most important reason that the Camorra

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.810
has managed to maintain its status as O’ Sistema, The System.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.780
For many, it provides work, it provides security, it

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.410
provides a sense of community, and a sense of belonging.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:09.620
And until the Italian state is able to replicate all of that in an

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.710
effective way, then the Camorra isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.950
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on the Camorra.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.120
There is, of course, a lot more to say about it, and how it operates.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.480
If you are interested in this, I’d definitely recommend a few things.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.490
Firstly, Roberto Saviano’s Gomorrah is an excellent place to start.

00:20:34.389 --> 00:20:39.304
There’s the book, of course, but there's also a film inspired by it, and a TV series.

00:20:39.694 --> 00:20:41.424
All of these are excellent.

00:20:42.154 --> 00:20:46.014
They are in Italian, but perhaps you could watch them in Italian with English

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:49.874
subtitles, that way you’re at least practising your English a little bit.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.967
As always, I would love to know what you think of the show.

00:20:54.537 --> 00:20:57.617
We have quite a few members from Italy, so I would

00:20:57.627 --> 00:21:01.267
especially love to know what you thought of today's episode.

00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:06.437

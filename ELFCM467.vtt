Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.179
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.259
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.669
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Alex Jones.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.219
He is America’s best known conspiracy theorist, and for the best part of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.309
30 years he has been going on air and making what might seem to most people

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.319
like outrageous claims, getting riled up about anything and everything.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.739
Early on in his career he might have seemed like an object of ridicule, but he has become a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.039
household name, listened to and trusted by millions of people all across the United States.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.369
So, let’s get right into it, and talk about America’s best-known conspiracy theorist.

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:09.789
On the morning of September 11th, 2001, the United States woke up to the news

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:15.749
that the World Trade Centre had collapsed, after being hit by two passenger jets.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:23.229
News anchors adopted a solemn tone, trying to process what was not just the deadliest

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:29.549
terror attack on US soil, but the single most lethal terror attack in history.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.989
While the death toll was still mounting, journalists were urging

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.349
caution, as it was still unclear who was behind the attack.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.909
In Austin, Texas, one radio host was not so balanced.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.029
On the same day as the attack, the then 27-year-old Alex Jones told

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:59.509
his listeners that, and I’m quoting directly, there was "a 98 percent

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:04.049
chance that this was a government-orchestrated controlled bombing."

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:10.449
It might sound ludicrous, mad to think that someone would make this claim from

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.799
the other side of the country as bodies were still being pulled out of the

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.309
rubble, but listeners of Alex Jones’ radio show would not have been surprised.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.079
He had been repeating similar claims for years, any time there was any

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.839
kind of major event, especially one that resulted in a major loss of life,

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.709
he would go on air and say that he didn’t believe the official version.

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:43.799
The government was lying, and he was the only one brave enough to speak truth to power.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.859
Now, back then Alex Jones was a mere radio host, still dismissed by most

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.149
as a bit of a nut-job, a crazy guy who nobody should take seriously.

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.029
But fast forward to today, and he has become a household name, he has grown his conspiracy

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:11.969
theory radio show into a mini media empire, interviewed Donald Trump, been subsequently kicked

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:18.659
off most major social media platforms, and made tens of millions of dollars in the process.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.159
His views might be wacky, they might be abhorrent, but they are absorbed

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:30.219
by tens of millions of people every month, so his story is worth telling.

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:38.099
He was born in 1974, and grew fascinated by conspiracy theories as a teenager.

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:45.529
He was particularly influenced by a book called None Dare Call It Conspiracy, which puts forward

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:51.279
the idea that a group of international bankers financed the communist revolution in Russia

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.729
as an experiment, and that now there is a plot to impose a global government and mass social

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:05.669
welfare programmes, so that the average person is dependent on and subservient to the government.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:13.459
Barmy, perhaps, but clearly if you believe it, it would completely change your worldview.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.589
And Alex Jones believed it, he bought it hook line and sinker.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.939
He dropped out of college, and almost immediately started his own call-in radio show,

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:33.049
where anyone, anywhere, could call in to Jones and make some kind of ludicrous claim,

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.109
and Jones would nod along and come up with some more conspiracy theories of his own.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:48.099
The main event that he was obsessed with at this time was the 1993 Waco siege, when a group

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:54.419
belonging to a religious cult called the Branch Davidians refused to allow US government agents

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:02.049
into their compound, and the result was a shootout and a fire that cost the lives of 86 people.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:08.179
Jones held the government responsible for this, saying that it

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:11.969
was an example of US government aggression against its citizens.

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:20.729
Now, you can learn more about this siege in episode number 229, on doomsday cults, but the short

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.319
version is that the cult leader, David Koresh, was a mad and manipulative leader who didn’t let

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.929
his subjects surrender, and who most people believe ultimately bears responsibility for the deaths.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.859
But that wasn’t what Jones thought.

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.929
He continued to claim that Koresh was a peaceful innocent man who had

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:49.209
been murdered by the US government, and he even attempted to raise funds

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.209
to build a church as a memorial to those who had died in the siege.

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:00.969
Ultimately, this, as well as his other controversial positions, got him fired from the radio show.

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:07.339
He would claim it was because he was speaking truth to power, and politicians

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.129
had ordered for him to be silenced, but his bosses would say it was because

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.879
his views were so offensive that no companies wanted to advertise on his show.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.389
Strangely enough, being fired turned out to be the big break that he needed.

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.129
He had been cancelled, before being cancelled was a thing, and this

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.109
lit a fire in his belly, and allowed him to continue to put forward his

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:38.409
point that he was being silenced by the mainstream, by the establishment.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:45.989
Shortly after being fired, in 1999, he launched a website called InfoWars.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.739
It was initially a place for Jones to publish his conspiracy theories,

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.489
as well as for fans to buy copies of documentaries that he had made.

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:58.499
But it continued to grow.

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.715
A year later, he used it as a base for a new call-in radio

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.869
show and he kept on doing the same thing, over and over.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.979
Every new news event became a subject of attack for Jones, a topic he would

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.209
go on air about and say “no, I don’t buy the official government version”..

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:25.409
9/11 was an inside job, Barack Obama’s birth certificate was fake, the Boston Bombing

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:31.809
was staged by the FBI, Hillary Clinton was running a paedophile ring, the 2016

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:37.809
election was fraudulent, obviously COVID-19 was a tool of government suppression.

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:43.449
Anything and everything that the US government was involved in was

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.249
some sort of scam or trick intended to crush the average citizen,

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.189
subvert personal liberty and bring forward the new world order.

00:07:54.692 --> 00:08:00.412
And surprisingly, or perhaps unsurprisingly, a segment of the US population

00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:06.912
lapped it up, they tuned in loyally to Alex Jones, week in, week out.

00:08:08.242 --> 00:08:14.112
His audience continued to grow, and according to one report, his website was

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:18.732
getting more monthly visitors than mainstream websites like The Economist

00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:23.502
and Newsweek, with more than 10 million people visiting it every month.

00:08:24.902 --> 00:08:27.462
He had no problem attracting an audience.

00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:33.262
He was so passionate, he got so worked up while on air, shouting, banging his

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:38.532
fist on the table and getting all hot and sweaty, and at least it seemed like

00:08:38.532 --> 00:08:44.202
he truly believed what he was saying, even if the evidence for his claims was

00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:48.882
flimsy at best, there wasn’t really much evidence for anything he claimed.

00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:55.572
But what he did have a problem with was attracting advertisers,

00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:59.562
companies that would pay for their adverts to play on his show.

00:09:00.802 --> 00:09:05.832
A radio show normally needs advertisers to function, to pay the bills.

00:09:07.092 --> 00:09:12.122
But, just like with his first radio show, he was a hot potato.

00:09:13.092 --> 00:09:16.672
Very few advertisers wanted to be associated with

00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:20.052
Alex Jones, given the nature of what he was saying.

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:28.022
So, he had to get creative, or rather, desperate and criminal, depending on what way you look at it.

00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:37.342
He became his own advertiser, and InfoWars became full of commercials for products that it sold.

00:09:38.602 --> 00:09:42.742
And it wasn’t just t-shirts, mugs and novelty pens.

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:47.592
The wonderful thing about being a conspiracy theorist is that you can

00:09:47.592 --> 00:09:52.072
sell your own solutions to the problems that you talk about in your show.

00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:59.062
During a segment on the show when Alex Jones would rail against how the government was putting

00:09:59.082 --> 00:10:04.532
chlorine in your drinking water, he would pause for a commercial break to tell you about how you

00:10:04.532 --> 00:10:10.562
could buy your own water filter from the InfoWars website, a water filter that had the official

00:10:10.622 --> 00:10:16.762
Alex Jones stamp of approval, and would protect you and your family from government interference.

00:10:17.962 --> 00:10:21.812
In the middle of talking about how the government is turning society weak,

00:10:22.342 --> 00:10:27.442
Alex Jones would talk to you about his testosterone supplements or drops

00:10:27.462 --> 00:10:32.172
that would help your brain function properly and help you think more clearly.

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:39.882
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, he even developed his own supposed cure and preventive

00:10:40.152 --> 00:10:46.032
for the coronavirus, which, naturally, was available for sale on the InfoWars website.

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:52.262
As it is a private company, the amount of money that he was making through this

00:10:52.472 --> 00:10:59.382
is a subject of much debate, but one estimate put it at around $10 million a year.

00:11:00.722 --> 00:11:04.192
He had found an audience that was prepared to listen to him

00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:09.902
religiously, and buy almost anything he sold, no matter its efficacy.

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:15.432
And on the subject of efficacy, of how effective these

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:19.802
treatments were, well that is also a subject of much debate.

00:11:20.982 --> 00:11:25.492
Looking closely at the label, almost everything that he sold, and that

00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:30.392
he still sells, on the InfoWars website, has not been approved by the

00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:35.352
FDA, the federal authority that regulates new medical supplements.

00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:42.042
But the beauty of an audience that trusts you more than the federal government is

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:46.872
that they don’t trust these government approvals anyway, they trust you, so whether

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:52.862
a drug or treatment is FDA-approved is somewhat immaterial, it doesn’t matter.

00:11:54.202 --> 00:11:59.792
Alex Jones clearly made a lot of money peddling everything from health supplements

00:11:59.942 --> 00:12:05.902
to dubious cures, but he would find that his past claims would come back to bite him.

00:12:07.322 --> 00:12:13.095
In terms of the subject of his previous claims, from the 9/11 attacks to Barack

00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:18.252
Obama having a fake birth certificate, you might listen to those and think “well,

00:12:18.252 --> 00:12:23.352
it’s just a crazy guy on the radio, nobody is really getting hurt by these claims”.

00:12:24.602 --> 00:12:28.362
But in one particular case, there were real victims.

00:12:29.652 --> 00:12:35.722
On December the 14th, 2012, a 20-year old man called Adam Lanza shot

00:12:35.862 --> 00:12:39.882
and killed his mother and then drove to the Sandy Hook elementary school

00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:45.152
and killed 26 people, 20 of whom were children, before killing himself.

00:12:46.552 --> 00:12:50.772
To state the obvious, it was an act of pure evil that cost the lives of

00:12:50.802 --> 00:12:55.862
innocent children and inflicted untold heartache and pain on their loved ones.

00:12:57.032 --> 00:13:01.694
But Alex Jones, perhaps unsurprisingly now that you have got to

00:13:01.694 --> 00:13:05.562
know a little bit more about him, didn’t buy the official version.

00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:12.852
He claimed that the entire thing was a hoax, that it simply didn’t happen, and

00:13:13.032 --> 00:13:18.462
it was part of a government conspiracy to enact stricter gun controls in the US.

00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:25.092
So while the families and loved ones of the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre

00:13:25.442 --> 00:13:30.662
were trying to grieve, there was Alex Jones, not just telling his audience of

00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:36.752
millions that the entire thing didn’t happen, but using his captive audience

00:13:36.832 --> 00:13:41.212
to advertise all sorts of bogus supplements and pills at the same time.

00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:47.162
Jones would discover that there were consequences to his actions.

00:13:48.432 --> 00:13:55.512
In 2016, 4 years after the massacre, a group of the victims’ families as well as one FBI

00:13:55.552 --> 00:14:03.062
agent filed a defamation suit against Jones and InfoWars, and more legal cases followed.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.792
He was first ordered to pay $100,00 in compensation,

00:14:09.322 --> 00:14:13.342
but this would pale in comparison with what was to come.

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:21.439
By 2022, spread over a bunch of different cases, he was ordered to pay a total

00:14:21.439 --> 00:14:28.359
$1.5 billion in compensation to the families of the victims of Sandy Hook.

00:14:29.989 --> 00:14:35.899
Now, Jones was rich, but he was not $1.5 billion rich.

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:41.959
He appealed to his audience to help raise money, to fight “the new world order”,

00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:48.099
and pleaded with listeners and viewers to buy his products to “fight the info war”.

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:54.509
It wasn’t enough, and he was forced to declare personal bankruptcy,

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:59.649
to start afresh, but was allowed to retain ownership of his companies.

00:15:01.143 --> 00:15:08.783
Despite this court order, as of last year at least, he had not paid a cent in compensation, and

00:15:08.933 --> 00:15:15.653
was still living the high life, with one report alleging that he was spending $90,000 a month.

00:15:16.943 --> 00:15:22.653
Of course, most of his audience doesn’t care, he doesn’t have to worry about a backlash from them,

00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:29.443
as they listened to and lapped up his Sandy Hook massacre conspiracy theories in the first place.

00:15:30.832 --> 00:15:36.762
But, there were consequences of the Sandy Hook claims in terms of his ability to reach his audience.

00:15:37.884 --> 00:15:44.201
Starting in 2018, he was deplatformed, his social media accounts removed from

00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:49.391
Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and practically every mainstream social media platform.

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:56.261
To listen to Alex Jones today, you either have to go directly to the InfoWars

00:15:56.261 --> 00:16:02.281
website, or to similar supposed “freedom of speech” media platforms like Rumble.

00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:08.481
You have to specifically want to listen to Alex Jones, you probably won’t stumble across him.

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:14.321
Now, listening to all of this, learning about the claims that he has repeatedly

00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:19.391
made and the real harm that this has done to real people, you might think

00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:23.411
“fair enough, he doesn’t deserve to have a presence on those kinds of

00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:27.881
platforms, it's a good thing that dangerous voices like his are marginalised”.

00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:32.561
Or you might think, “well, he might be a nasty piece of work, he might be a

00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:37.071
madman, but you can’t ban someone just because you don’t like what they say.

00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:39.811
That’s against the principle of free speech.”

00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:47.281
The reality is that the complete cancellation of Alex Jones might have reduced his available

00:16:47.281 --> 00:16:51.831
audience, people who might find him in the same way that you might discover someone

00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:57.761
new on YouTube or Instagram, but it has strengthened his relationship with the people

00:16:57.781 --> 00:17:02.801
who were already listening to him, the people who were already his dedicated followers.

00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:08.721
He had been telling them for years that mainstream politicians wanted to silence him,

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:15.301
and there he was, removed from mainstream media platforms, exactly as he had predicted.

00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:22.961
Now that he is cancelled, he is in some ways even more free to say anything he wants.

00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:29.341
In fact, he is uncancellable because he cannot be more cancelled than he already is.

00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:36.061
And what’s more, his claims are validated, because exactly what he said would

00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:40.621
happen, happened; he was removed from the mainstream social media networks.

00:17:41.974 --> 00:17:47.724
If you spend any time watching his more recent stuff, and yes, he is still making shows

00:17:47.774 --> 00:17:54.514
almost every single day, it has got perhaps even more unhinged, even crazier, with one

00:17:54.514 --> 00:18:00.284
of his most recent videos claiming that a new world order is engineering a global famine.

00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:06.134
Anything the government does, he seems to reject as false, and he

00:18:06.134 --> 00:18:10.604
has made it his brand to be worried about anything and everything.

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:17.034
It is certainly not surprising that he has been dubbed The Most Paranoid Man in America.

00:18:19.524 --> 00:18:22.644
OK then, that is it for Alex Jones.

00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:27.264
Perhaps unsurprisingly, I would certainly not recommend spending too much time watching

00:18:27.334 --> 00:18:31.774
anything by Alex Jones, but if you want to get a sense of the sort of things that

00:18:31.774 --> 00:18:36.424
he is talking about, well just Google Alex Jones, and you can decide for yourself.

00:18:37.674 --> 00:18:42.204
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:42.694 --> 00:18:47.904
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

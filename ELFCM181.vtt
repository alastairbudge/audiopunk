Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.762
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:21.046
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:27.166
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Geoffrey Chaucer,

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:32.506
a man who by many people’s standards is the father of English Literature.

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:37.026
He might not be the first person you think about when you think of

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:41.956
an English writer, but he was the most famous person to have first

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:46.206
written in the vernacular, the English spoken by normal English people.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.856
He was also much more than a writer.

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:54.526
He was an astronomer, a diplomat, a member of Parliament, a

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:59.106
courtier, a philosopher, a bureaucrat, a soldier and a poet.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:04.696
So, let’s not waste a minute, and learn about the fantastic

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:08.276
and fascinating life and work of Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.536
As with almost everyone who lived in the Middle Ages, there is a

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:18.626
limited knowledge about his life on a day to day basis, but we do know

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:22.926
more about Chaucer than many other writers who were alive at the time.

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:28.256
We know that he was a prolific traveller in Europe, which was

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.636
obviously a lot harder to do 650 years ago than it is now.

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:35.126
He was also a linguist.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:42.176
He spoke fluent French and seems to have had a good working knowledge of both Italian and Latin.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:49.496
Although his home and work were right at the heart of London, he was very much a European.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:56.656
Since he first put pen to paper, in the year 1357, his brilliant writing has

00:01:56.856 --> 00:02:03.016
amused and intrigued people across the social spectrum – from kings to the most

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:09.046
lowly of peasants; from his own contemporaries to 21st century digital natives.

00:02:09.716 --> 00:02:15.786
Yet this man lived more than 600 years ago and wrote in a style of English which,

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:21.976
although recognisable to scholars, requires some translation or at least getting used

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:28.156
to in order to make it fully understandable to even a native speaker of modern English.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:36.286
If you were to take a copy of Chaucer to the streets of London, New York, or Sydney, I imagine

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:42.266
that most people wouldn’t understand it, and many wouldn’t even recognise it as English.

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:47.966
His life and work have continued to fascinate writers, poets

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:53.346
especially; and since his death in 1400, he has not gone out of fashion.

00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:59.426
This achievement is all the greater when we consider that he was an amateur

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:04.486
writer - in other words, he wrote in his spare time, he wasn’t a professional.

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:10.876
He had a variety of demanding, salaried jobs, mainly working for the government;

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:16.426
in spite of this he managed to produce a large body of literature – almost

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:22.286
all poetry, but across a wide range of literary styles or genres.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:29.086
His collected works, all of the writing that he produced in his life, rival those of the other.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.560
undisputed giant of English Literature, William Shakespeare.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.923
So, Chaucer's status as the “Father of English Literature” is well deserved.

00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:45.573
Aside from literary merit, aside from what an excellent author he was, there are

00:03:45.613 --> 00:03:51.593
two other very good reasons for exploring the life and writing of Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:57.923
The first is that, because he worked for most of his life for the state as a

00:03:57.973 --> 00:04:02.863
diplomat, bureaucrat and member of Parliament, we actually know quite a lot

00:04:02.913 --> 00:04:07.933
about his life, as much was written down and survived in court documents.

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:14.063
This means that he gives us a unique insight into the working life of a

00:04:14.273 --> 00:04:18.993
socially and professionally ambitious Englishman of the late Middle Ages.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:25.833
The other reason for exploring this fascinating man is that he wrote in English.

00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:31.723
Now, you might think, this isn’t much of a reason - he was English, wasn’t he?

00:04:32.183 --> 00:04:36.143
Well, yes, he was English, but most English poets at the

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:39.523
time would have written in French, rather than English.

00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:45.483
We’ll explore this further in a few minutes, but Chaucer’s decision to use English

00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:51.318
rather than French may well have had a significant effect on the development of the

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:56.083
English language, on the development of the language that I am speaking at the moment.

00:04:57.383 --> 00:05:02.173
Let's start then with a brief outline of the man‘s life, before moving

00:05:02.183 --> 00:05:07.463
onto his impact on the language and then finally the works themselves.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:15.133
Born in 1343 into a prosperous middle-class London merchant family, the

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:20.383
young Chaucer’s social status was on the rise from early on in life.

00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:26.853
This was partly because his parents grew richer for a tragic reason - as

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:31.793
a result of many of their relatives dying in the bubonic plague or

00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:36.768
Black Death which swept through all of Europe in the late 1340s.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:43.223
As his relatives died, they left money to Chaucer’s family, who then grew richer.

00:05:44.413 --> 00:05:50.753
However, to get ahead, to be successful, in Medieval England money wasn’t enough.

00:05:51.053 --> 00:05:54.573
You also needed connections to people in high places.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:06:00.023
Luckily enough, his father had them, and was able to place the

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:04.773
young Chaucer as something called a “page” in a royal household.

00:06:05.653 --> 00:06:12.443
A page is essentially a young boy who would be a servant in a noble, an aristocratic, family.

00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:19.483
Chaucer was placed in the household of the wife of one of the King’s sons – in fact

00:06:19.553 --> 00:06:27.293
the second son of King Edward III, the king who was on the throne from 1327 – 1377.

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:34.293
It's not a perfect analogy, but if you imagine that once Prince Charles becomes king, Prince

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:40.813
Harry will be the second son of the King: so, the teenage Chaucer’s position in the court of

00:06:40.823 --> 00:06:47.153
the Elizabeth de Burgh, Countess of Ulster, was a bit like being in the Court of Meghan Markle.

00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:53.143
Of course, without the press, the paparazzi, and scandal, but that’s the idea.

00:06:53.873 --> 00:07:00.403
Anyway we have all sorts of details about young Chaucer‘s life in that royal court, including

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:08.183
the fact that his aristocratic mistress required him to wear ultra-fashionable but provocatively

00:07:08.243 --> 00:07:14.883
tight stockings and short tunics when he was waiting on the family and their noble guests.

00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:18.573
One can only hazard a guess as to why...

00:07:19.453 --> 00:07:22.643
What else do we know about his varied working life?

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:26.583
We know that he went to war – against France, of course,

00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:30.313
as the so-called Hundred Years’ War was in progress.

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:35.463
We know that as an eighteen year old soldier he was captured at the

00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:41.503
siege of Reims in France and that he was ransomed, that he was held as

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:48.263
a hostage for a total of £16, which is equivalent to about £12,000 now.

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:54.363
This meant that he was in effect bought back by King Edward III,

00:07:54.363 --> 00:07:58.506
clearly demonstrating that he was greatly valued in high places.

00:07:59.586 --> 00:08:05.926
The appetite for travel and discovery was clearly a strong element of Chaucer’s character.

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:12.916
His role as a diplomat, possibly even a spy, took him to France and Italy.

00:08:13.766 --> 00:08:19.846
In both countries he seems to have encountered the significant poets of the day, people like

00:08:19.876 --> 00:08:25.926
Petrarch and Boccaccio, as well as powerful aristocrats like the Viscontis, the rulers of Milan.

00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:31.506
As well as being a member of Parliament, he occupied the influential

00:08:31.506 --> 00:08:36.336
role of controller of the King’s customs in London for 12 years.

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:43.076
What this would mean is that he was in control of goods coming in and out of the city of London.

00:08:43.846 --> 00:08:48.706
He would therefore have had a very close up insight into the way in which

00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:53.966
England‘s largest export to continental Europe, sheep‘s wool, paid for much of

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:58.236
the vast cost of the Hundred Years’ War through the taxes raised on the product.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:05.476
Chaucer’s final job was as clerk of the King‘s works, which involved being the main

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:11.136
person in charge of managing and organising the King‘s major building projects.

00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:18.936
Upward mobility, or rising up in society, was also a feature of his personal life: he

00:09:18.936 --> 00:09:25.226
married Philippa de Roet, a lady-in-waiting or aristocratic attendant to the Queen.

00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:32.366
Philippa’s sister became the mistress and then wife of a man called John of Gaunt.

00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:38.016
Now, this explanation might be a little confusing, but John of Gaunt was

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:44.269
King Edward III’s second son, and after the death of Richard II, who was

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:49.686
John of Gaunt’s nephew, John of Gaunt’s eldest son, Henry IV, became king.

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.306
If you’re lost, I don’t blame you.

00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:57.746
The point to remember is that this man, John of Gaunt, had been the uncle of the

00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:03.546
king, and then the father of the new king, so he was incredibly wealthy and powerful.

00:10:04.176 --> 00:10:08.386
And he was a close friend and ally of Chaucer.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:14.766
Chaucer had gone from a relatively modest, one could say middle-class

00:10:14.816 --> 00:10:19.376
upbringing to being the brother in law to the King’s father – a

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:23.026
highly influential position at the centre of the English court.

00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:29.066
If you would like a more yet more memorable way of understanding how much he

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:35.576
was appreciated by his royal masters, here is a bizarre fact for you: King

00:10:35.596 --> 00:10:41.946
Edward III awarded him a gallon of wine every day for the rest of his life.

00:10:42.486 --> 00:10:45.279
A gallon is just under 5 litres.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:50.666
We have no way of knowing for sure, but it is highly likely that this

00:10:50.756 --> 00:10:56.106
liquid appreciation was in recognition of Chaucer‘s talents as a poet.

00:10:57.016 --> 00:11:02.856
Even today, the poet chosen by the monarchy as the official poet is paid

00:11:03.006 --> 00:11:08.226
in liquid form – a barrel of something called sherry, a barrel is about

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:13.836
720 bottles, and they are paid this for the 10 years they do the job.

00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:20.846
Now, let‘s move on to discuss the impact that Chaucer had on the English language.

00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:26.376
As we know, English is now a global language – a lingua franca.

00:11:27.156 --> 00:11:31.486
But if we go back 700 years to the period just before

00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:36.286
Chaucer‘s birth, so that’s the early 1300s, what do we find?

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:41.646
Well, English is a very different beast - a low status,

00:11:41.856 --> 00:11:46.106
vernacular language, meaning native language or dialect.

00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:52.166
It was the poor relation to French which was the language that the most

00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:57.746
aspiring and ambitious poets in Europe would generally use and that

00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:03.416
Chaucer, as a poet at the King’s court, would have been expected to use.

00:12:04.126 --> 00:12:07.686
French was the undisputed language of all things

00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:13.536
sophisticated - fine food, perfume, law and, yes, fine poetry.

00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:20.136
If you wanted to have your writing heard and read by the best educated and

00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:25.116
most sophisticated people, you wrote in the appropriate language - French.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:31.216
After all, French had remained the language of the royal court for many years

00:12:31.406 --> 00:12:37.526
following the so-called Norman Conquest of England by the Norman French in 1066.

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:45.236
It was actually only in the year 1415, 15 years after Chaucer‘s death that for the

00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:51.466
first time English was used to convey a royal message; this was when the news of

00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:55.626
the victory at the Battle of Agincourt was brought back from France to England.

00:12:56.106 --> 00:12:59.576
Previously, all such messages had been in French.

00:13:00.486 --> 00:13:05.166
So, given all of this, Chaucer’s decision to write in English went

00:13:05.186 --> 00:13:10.036
completely against the grain – it was against what would have been expected.

00:13:10.776 --> 00:13:17.606
However, as a result of his brave decision, two particular opportunities opened up for him.

00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:22.936
The first was that, although he was less likely to reach a European

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:27.596
audience, writing in English opened up a large English audience.

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:33.886
After Chaucer‘s death, this became ever more so when, with the operation of the

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:40.176
first printing press for books in English in 1473, Chaucer’s works were much

00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:45.526
printed and started to be read by the increasingly literate English population.

00:13:46.496 --> 00:13:50.876
The second result of his decision was that he was able to to create his

00:13:51.056 --> 00:13:57.226
very own fusion or combination of influences: this meant combining both

00:13:57.276 --> 00:14:02.606
the native or indigenous English influence and the semi-foreign French one.

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:10.816
This became apparent both in the style of his language and also in the literary styles that he used.

00:14:11.646 --> 00:14:16.956
In particular, Chaucer took advantage of the fact that the English of this time

00:14:17.126 --> 00:14:23.266
was being flooded by French words – often these words were providing additional

00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:29.706
synonyms and nuances which complemented the existing, native English words.

00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:35.336
So, for example, words like chivalry, courtesy and perfume,

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:39.776
all imports from French are readily used by Chaucer.

00:14:40.707 --> 00:14:46.017
In terms of the literary styles, a parallel or comparable process

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:50.537
happened under Chaucer – you could say that it was a magical combination.

00:14:51.427 --> 00:14:57.077
In short, the English narrative or storytelling poetic tradition relied

00:14:57.117 --> 00:15:03.867
on action – it featured lots of events - battles, quests, journeys.

00:15:04.567 --> 00:15:09.177
This meant that there was plenty to interest the reader, but the interest

00:15:09.177 --> 00:15:14.457
was mainly based on action: who was going to do what to whom and when?

00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:19.618
The equivalent French literature of the day had at its centre

00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:25.208
emotion – with the emotion of love as the most significant and powerful.

00:15:25.928 --> 00:15:32.849
The genius of Chaucer, many believe, was to use the relatively new, fast-developing

00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:39.569
English language with its new, sophisticated French words and to combine the best

00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:44.569
of both of the English poetic tradition with the best of the French: in other words,

00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:51.319
English tradition for action, combined with the French penchant towards emotion.

00:15:52.349 --> 00:15:57.739
As we draw towards a close, I will do my best to illustrate this by referring

00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:03.429
to Chaucer’s best known works – Troilus and Criseyde and The Canterbury Tales.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.679
Troilus and Criseyde is a beautifully constructed long poem that describes the love of

00:16:09.729 --> 00:16:17.309
Troilus, a Trojan prince in ancient Troy and his love, Criseyde, whose father has deserted

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:22.959
Troy and treacherously gone over to the Greek enemies who are camped outside the city.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:28.169
These two lovers know that their love is forbidden, it is not allowed;

00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:33.349
Criseyde’s position as a vulnerable young woman is especially poignant.

00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:37.049
In Chaucerian English, he writes:

00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:40.579
Right as an aspes leaf she gan to quake,

00:16:40.939 --> 00:16:43.679
What she hym felte hire in his armes folde.

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:50.659
Now, I imagine you might not understand that, and indeed many native speakers wouldn’t either.

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:55.559
He is saying that Criseyde is shaking like the leaf of a

00:16:55.599 --> 00:17:00.259
tree as she feels herself being wrapped in Troilus’ arms.

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:06.949
Although we know from the start of the poem that their love is doomed, that it will never work,

00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:13.269
the psychological reality of a nervous young woman in her lover’s arms that Chaucer creates

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:19.409
is typical of the quality that makes this poem one of the greatest love poems in English.

00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:23.419
Of course, the story isn’t Chaucer’s own.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:29.719
Troilus is a character from Ancient Greek literature, and Chaucer’s story is inspired

00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:35.872
by a work of Boccaccio, which is itself inspired by a 12th century French poet.

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:41.492
But that doesn’t stop it being beautiful and worth reading in its own right.

00:17:42.422 --> 00:17:48.772
Chaucer‘s vision for his more famous work, The Canterbury Tales, was even more ambitious.

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:55.482
The vehicle for this great work was that of a pilgrimage from London to Canterbury,

00:17:55.732 --> 00:18:01.512
the site of the shrine to the most famous, domestic English saint, Thomas A Becket.

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:09.112
Chaucer tells the tale of 30 different pilgrims, each of whom should tell

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:14.882
two stories on the journey out to Canterbury and two stories on the way back.

00:18:15.912 --> 00:18:20.242
Chaucer did not fulfil all of this massive task - he died before

00:18:20.242 --> 00:18:24.612
he could complete it - but he still left us something incredible.

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.959
What is so special about this great work?

00:18:28.489 --> 00:18:31.759
Well, I have time to tell you about three things.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:38.549
Firstly, this work is surprisingly and brilliantly democratic: Chaucer

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:44.489
gives voice to characters right across the full span of society, from the

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:50.189
aristocratic knight to the humble ploughman, the farmer who ploughs the fields.

00:18:50.939 --> 00:18:56.619
And the social status of the pilgrim does not save them from the criticisms of the poet: for

00:18:56.619 --> 00:19:03.579
example, he even raises doubts about the motives of the knight through suggesting that his claimed

00:19:03.599 --> 00:19:10.259
high virtues are not true, given his participation in some dreadful massacres of civilians.

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:17.169
Chaucer dramatises the fights that the pilgrims have; for example the rivalry

00:19:17.169 --> 00:19:23.179
between the miller, a person who works in a mill, and his sworn enemy, the carpenter.

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:28.219
The result is that the miller tells a very rude story which

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:32.579
shows carpenters in a very poor light, it portrays them badly.

00:19:33.369 --> 00:19:38.019
No one escapes satire and laughter, no matter their social status.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:44.619
The second special thing is the way that Chaucer combines the character of the

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:51.119
person telling the story with the tale itself and thereby uses irony skilfully.

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:56.849
A good example of this is with one of the nastiest characters of the

00:19:56.849 --> 00:20:01.759
group - a man called the pardoner, whose job involves cheating poor

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:07.569
people into buying fake pardons and relics to forgive them of their sins.

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:13.909
This being the Middle Ages, England was still a Catholic country, and people would buy

00:20:13.949 --> 00:20:19.269
objects and do certain things which they thought would save them from going to hell.

00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:26.179
The Pardoner’s story to his fellow travellers is the same one that he tells people to trick

00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:32.729
them out of their money, with a moral of The Root of all Evil is the Desire for Money.

00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:39.459
The Pardoner seems to have no shame, he is not embarrassed about the fact that he is a

00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:46.089
cheat and a fraud, and he even asks his fellow pilgrims for money at the end of his story.

00:20:46.729 --> 00:20:51.699
The pardoner thinks he is being very clever by tricking the pilgrims, but the

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:57.629
irony is that the reader can see quite how terrible he is, and how The Pardoner

00:20:57.769 --> 00:21:03.549
himself is a living example of how “The Root of all Evil is the Desire for Money”.

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:09.109
So, this is not only thought-provoking, but it is beautifully ironic.

00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:14.689
The third and final important thing to mention is Chaucer’s portrayal

00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:19.559
of women, in particular his most famous creation, the Wife of Bath.

00:21:20.689 --> 00:21:26.749
This character talks with great colour and openness about her life and in particular

00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:33.259
her treatment of her five husbands, the ways she controls them and her sexual appetite.

00:21:34.399 --> 00:21:39.559
It is really compelling and unusual, given the traditions of medieval poetry.

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:45.869
We have no way of knowing the degree to which the prominence of female characters like the Wife of

00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:52.639
Bath helped increase the reading of Chaucer amongst women, but it would be surprising if it did not.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:57.769
So there you have it - what a poet, what a man, and

00:21:57.779 --> 00:22:00.889
deservedly called The Father of English Literature.

00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:05.589
His work is translated into most languages, and if you are planning

00:22:05.589 --> 00:22:09.449
to read some, I would recommend doing so in the translation.

00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:14.419
As I said earlier, reading it in the original Middle English is hard

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:19.339
enough for a native speaker, and it probably isn’t realistic to try

00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:23.069
to read the works of Chaucer in the original as a non-native speaker.

00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:29.379
But, I would certainly recommend listening to a bit of how we believe it would have sounded.

00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:31.829
Here’s a very quick taster:

00:22:32.216 --> 00:22:32.338
Here bygynneth the Book of the tales of Caunterbury

00:22:32.338 --> 00:22:32.434
Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote,

00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:32.556
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,

00:22:32.556 --> 00:22:32.652
And bathed every veyne in swich licóur

00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:47.586
Of which vertú engendred is the flour;

00:22:48.432 --> 00:22:51.002
Now, don’t worry if you can't understand that.

00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:55.612
It is very different, and there is no reason for you to be able to understand

00:22:55.612 --> 00:22:59.842
it, it certainly wouldn’t help much with modern English conversation.

00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:04.722
But if you haven’t read any Canterbury Tales, I would certainly recommend it.

00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:11.992
It is amazingly timeless, from stories of love affairs to jealousy, gluttony to drunkenness,

00:23:12.302 --> 00:23:18.162
like all great writers there is something truly timeless about the works of Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:23:20.505 --> 00:23:27.812
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Geoffrey Chaucer: the father of English literature.

00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:31.182
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something

00:23:31.182 --> 00:23:35.822
new, and that this might have inspired you to pick up a copy of The

00:23:35.822 --> 00:23:39.962
Canterbury Tales, in translation of course, and enjoy it for yourself.

00:23:40.992 --> 00:23:44.462
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:48.352

00:23:48.772 --> 00:23:51.132
Have you read any of The Canterbury Tales?

00:23:51.502 --> 00:23:53.282
And if so, what did you think?

00:23:53.442 --> 00:23:55.772
Which pilgrim told your favourite story?

00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:57.342

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.901
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.991
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:24.541
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:28.831
mini-series, this time on the subject of crime and punishment..

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:32.309
In part one, this episode, we are going to talk

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.509
about the history of crime and punishment in Britain.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.459
In part two, we are going to zoom in and learn about the most serious

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.679
and final of punishments, capital punishment, the death penalty.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.149
And in part three, the final part, we are going to talk

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.169
about the evolution of and the evolving role of prisons.

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:58.913
OK then, let’s get started, and learn about crime and punishment in Britain.

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:05.743
If you know the story of Victor Hugo’s masterpiece, Les Miserables,

00:01:06.073 --> 00:01:09.943
you will remember the protagonist and hero, Jean Valjean.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:17.993
With seven hungry children at home and no way to feed them, he steals a loaf of bread.

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:22.993
He is caught, and sentenced to five years in prison.

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:28.293
After attempting to escape several times, his sentence is

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:34.933
extended and extended, and he ends up spending 19 years in prison.

00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:40.093
It might sound extreme to us today, a punishment that is

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:44.053
totally disproportionate to the severity of the crime.

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:51.823
But Jean was lucky that the bread he stole came from a French bakery, not a British one.

00:01:52.483 --> 00:01:57.733
And no, that isn’t a comment about the quality of French baguettes compared to British bread.

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:04.903
In 1795, at the time of this fictional theft, a key part of

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:09.233
criminal law in Britain was something called the Bloody Code.

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:16.148
As you might be able to guess from the name, this was a series of laws

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:22.473
which listed over 200 crimes for which a punishment was the death penalty.

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:27.213
Theft was included, if the value of the stolen goods

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:32.083
exceeded one shilling—which is around €10 in today’s money.

00:02:33.073 --> 00:02:38.783
So, Jean Valjean’s nighttime trip to the bakery landed him 19 years in prison

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:45.153
but had the theft occurred in Britain, it could well have cost him his life.

00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:52.938
Fortunately, the British justice system has moved on since then, but for almost all

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:57.898
of British history, criminal activity–or perhaps it would be more accurate just to

00:02:57.898 --> 00:03:05.208
say “undesirable behaviour”–has been dealt with swiftly and harshly, with not a huge

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:10.148
amount of attention paid to whether the guilty person was guilty in the first place.

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:17.528
Now, before we get into the details of British criminal history, it’s worth

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:22.638
spelling out a few wider questions related to crime and punishment, which

00:03:22.638 --> 00:03:26.988
are clearly applicable anywhere in the world, they aren’t unique to Britain.

00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:36.628
For a crime to be committed, that crime needs to be defined; a society needs to create laws

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:42.608
specifying that certain behaviours are allowed, and certain behaviours are not allowed.

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:47.598
Crime is a human construction, and it is fluid.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:53.038
Some things we now consider crimes were not crimes in the past.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:04:00.028
Slavery is probably the most obvious example, but there are many examples of societies

00:04:00.028 --> 00:04:05.028
in which even murder was not considered a crime, in certain situations at least.

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:12.208
And many things used to be crimes in the past, but are not considered crimes any

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:19.302
more: adultery, blasphemy, witchcraft, homosexuality, interracial marriage, these are

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:25.177
all things that range from perhaps socially frowned on but not a crime, in the case

00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:31.007
of things like adultery or blasphemy, through to perfectly acceptable and celebrated

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:35.897
in the case of homosexuality and interracial marriage, in some countries at least.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:42.147
And on that last point, even today, things that are considered

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:46.437
crimes in some countries are not in others, and vice versa.

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:51.817
The fact that crime is not black and white, and that definitions change,

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.637
are themes that will crop up again and again throughout this mini-series.

00:04:57.527 --> 00:05:03.977
Now, with that out of the way, let’s return to crime and punishment specifically in Britain.

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:10.537
Going back to early British history, in the early Medieval era, so before the

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:17.077
arrival of William the Conqueror in 1066, justice was mainly an individual affair.

00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:24.527
If a crime was committed against you, let’s say that someone stole two of your sheep or didn’t

00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:29.439
pay you back the money you'd lent them, it was your responsibility to resolve the issue.

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:36.481
There was no idea of a central justice system, and there wasn’t even really a local one either.

00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:42.231
If a crime was committed, it was the victim’s responsibility to find

00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:47.071
out who committed it, and then come to an agreement with them, which

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:50.991
normally took the form of some kind of payment, in order to resolve it.

00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:59.561
If no resolution could be found, there was an answer for this, but it wasn’t particularly just.

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:09.541
For more serious accusations, there would be a trial by ordeal, so the accused would be subjected

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:16.671
to something pretty awful, like being thrown into a cold pond or having to hold a red-hot iron.

00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:23.801
The idea was that if they were innocent, God would intervene to protect them.

00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:29.161
In the case of being thrown into a cold pond, if the person looked

00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:32.451
like they were about to sink to the bottom and drown, then this was

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:36.461
a sign of their innocence, and they would be pulled up by a rope.

00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:41.521
And if they floated to the top, this was a sign of their guilt, and they

00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:45.761
would typically be executed or subjected to some other terrible punishment.

00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:53.141
And with the red-hot iron, the sign from God was about whether the wound got infected.

00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:58.181
If it did get infected, not only would you have an infected wound but it was

00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:03.351
seen as a sign of your guilt and you would most probably be executed, and if

00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:08.591
it didn’t get infected, well lucky you, that was a sign that you were innocent.

00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:16.851
In other words, in this early era of British crime and punishment the detective work, if we can

00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:23.631
call it that, was passed on to the individual, and “justice” was determined by the will of God.

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:29.619
Clearly, this wasn’t a great system, especially for falsely accused

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.069
people who were good at swimming or had weak immune systems.

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:41.339
When William the Conqueror arrived, in 1066, he sought to update and modernise this system.

00:07:42.403 --> 00:07:46.852
As you may know, one of the key developments the Norman King made was the

00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:52.652
creation of a central system of law and order, with the king at its centre.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.710
Under William the Conqueror, a crime was no longer just an offence against

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.020
an individual or a family; it was an offence against the king himself.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:11.855
This was when we started to see the rise of royal courts and common law, a system where laws

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:18.105
were based on previous rulings and applied consistently across the country, in theory at least.

00:08:19.325 --> 00:08:26.455
This was a big step forward, and it marked a shift from community-based justice to one

00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:32.555
where the state, represented by the king, had a central role in defining and enforcing laws.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:38.545
Another important development during this time was the introduction of trial

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:43.770
by jury, of a collection of people deciding the guilt or innocence of an

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.040
individual, rather than a single magistrate or leaving it up to the will of God.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:55.930
Now, perhaps you live in a country where the judicial system involves juries.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.200
Perhaps you have even been on a jury yourself.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.670
But this early version of a jury wasn’t quite like the one we know today.

00:09:06.248 --> 00:09:11.674
It wasn’t a group of randomly chosen impartial citizens weighing up evidence.

00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:19.194
Instead, it was typically made up of local people who knew the accused person and

00:09:19.354 --> 00:09:25.334
were asked to give their opinion on whether the person was guilty or not, often based

00:09:25.344 --> 00:09:30.234
on their character and what people thought they could have done, rather than coming

00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:34.734
to a conclusion solely based on the evidence of their involvement in the crime.

00:09:35.824 --> 00:09:42.114
And on that note, to state the obvious, proving undeniably that someone committed

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:47.584
a crime was an awful lot harder in the 11th century compared to the 21st century.

00:09:48.334 --> 00:09:52.484
If you think of all of the sort of evidence that is used in a courtroom today,

00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:59.234
from DNA records to telephone records to photos to CCTV footage, even through

00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:03.784
to the fact that most cities have abundant street lighting so it’s easier

00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:08.084
to see what’s going on at night, none of this existed in the medieval era.

00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:12.774
There had to be eye-witnesses to the crime being committed, and

00:10:13.054 --> 00:10:17.414
even that was often a case of one person’s word against another’s.

00:10:18.504 --> 00:10:23.874
So, although it was ripe for bias and would certainly have led to many

00:10:23.904 --> 00:10:26.914
innocent people being found guilty because their neighbours didn’t

00:10:26.914 --> 00:10:31.094
like them or because they were a bit strange, it was a step forward.

00:10:32.484 --> 00:10:36.904
And what happened if someone was deemed to be guilty of a crime, you might ask?

00:10:37.724 --> 00:10:44.414
Well, the punishments became harsher, especially for crimes that challenged royal authority.

00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:51.484
Execution–the death penalty–was used more frequently, and new laws,

00:10:51.534 --> 00:10:55.684
like “forest laws”, were introduced to protect royal hunting grounds.

00:10:56.744 --> 00:11:02.994
Killing a deer from the king’s land could result in brutal punishments—sometimes even death.

00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:08.964
Now, these laws weren’t just about stopping people from stealing deer;

00:11:09.564 --> 00:11:14.144
rather, they were a signal to everyone of the absolute power of the

00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:19.354
monarch, and what fate awaits anyone who decides to challenge that power.

00:11:20.824 --> 00:11:27.864
And this would be ratcheted up a notch as we move into the late medieval and Tudor periods.

00:11:29.024 --> 00:11:33.534
By the 16th century, England was undergoing huge changes.

00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:38.274
The rise of strong monarchs, like Henry VIII, meant that the

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:42.074
state’s control over crime and punishment grew even tighter.

00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:49.604
Henry VIII in particular is known for his use of harsh punishments, especially for crimes like

00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:56.014
treason and heresy—offences that threatened his power or the religious authority of the crown.

00:11:56.984 --> 00:12:01.314
If you opposed the king or refused to accept his religious reforms,

00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:05.424
you could find yourself facing the ultimate punishment: execution.

00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:10.954
Beheading, burning at the stake, and hanging, these all became common

00:12:10.954 --> 00:12:14.484
methods of punishment for those who dared to oppose the monarchy.

00:12:15.774 --> 00:12:19.484
These were also times when public punishments were used not

00:12:19.484 --> 00:12:23.444
just to deal with criminals, but to make examples of them.

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:27.932
Executions were carried out in public squares to send a clear

00:12:27.952 --> 00:12:32.722
message to the population: disobey the king, and this could be you.

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:37.432
But the state didn’t just rely on execution.

00:12:38.262 --> 00:12:42.492
Other forms of physical punishment, such as whipping and branding,

00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:46.412
where the person would be physically marked for life, were also common.

00:12:47.682 --> 00:12:51.542
And it wasn’t just serious crimes that were punished harshly.

00:12:52.262 --> 00:12:58.182
Minor offences, like theft or begging, were also met with brutal consequences.

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:03.122
People could be flogged, have their ears cut off, or be thrown into jail.

00:13:04.682 --> 00:13:08.332
But the most infamous period for punishment was yet to

00:13:08.332 --> 00:13:11.962
come—the Bloody Code, which you heard about at the start.

00:13:13.138 --> 00:13:19.068
By the 18th century, the British justice system had become infamous for its severity,

00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:25.028
and there were more than 200 crimes that were technically punishable by death.

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:32.438
And not just what we would consider today to be serious crimes, like murder or rape.

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:37.358
Under the Bloody Code, you could also be executed for stealing a sheep,

00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:42.998
cutting down a tree, pickpocketing, if the stolen goods were worth more

00:13:42.998 --> 00:13:48.088
than a shilling, and even for being in the company of Gypsies for one month.

00:13:49.518 --> 00:13:50.903
Why, you might be thinking?

00:13:51.803 --> 00:13:57.373
Justice had been harsh in Britain for hundreds of years, but this seemed particularly

00:13:57.383 --> 00:14:03.763
extreme, just putting one foot wrong could cost a previously upstanding citizen their life.

00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:09.603
Well, the idea behind the Bloody Code was that these harsh punishments

00:14:09.843 --> 00:14:14.613
would act as a deterrent, they would stop people from committing crimes.

00:14:15.753 --> 00:14:19.913
Public executions became even more common, and men,

00:14:20.253 --> 00:14:23.693
women and children were encouraged to come and watch.

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:28.083
The criminal would be taken through the crowd to the

00:14:28.093 --> 00:14:32.173
gallows, where their crime would be read out for all to hear.

00:14:33.743 --> 00:14:37.583
And these executions were not intended to be quick

00:14:37.723 --> 00:14:41.453
affairs; they were meant to be gruesome public spectacles.

00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:48.003
The condemned would be hanging there kicking and struggling, the idea being that anyone watching

00:14:48.003 --> 00:14:53.483
would think twice about committing a crime, knowing that this would be the fate that awaited them.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:56.383
So, did it work?

00:14:57.303 --> 00:14:59.783
In short, no, it did not.

00:15:00.353 --> 00:15:04.293
There is no evidence that crime decreased at all, and some

00:15:04.343 --> 00:15:08.583
evidence to suggest that it actually increased in certain areas.

00:15:10.112 --> 00:15:13.442
As to why, well, there are several theories.

00:15:14.532 --> 00:15:21.402
One is that, like Jean Valjean in France, criminal acts were often done out of necessity.

00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:27.582
People stole because they had no other option, such was the level of poverty in much of the country.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:33.852
If you are starving and you have hungry mouths to feed, then you will do whatever is necessary.

00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:41.942
Another theory is that the public nature of the executions often turned executed criminals into

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:48.002
folk heroes, so the threat of meeting the same fate really wasn’t so much of a threat at all.

00:15:49.877 --> 00:15:54.582
And there was also a growing discomfort, not just among the general

00:15:54.582 --> 00:15:59.102
population but also with those in the justice system responsible for

00:15:59.112 --> 00:16:04.112
administering the law, about the severity and cruelty of the punishments.

00:16:05.252 --> 00:16:10.562
Ending someone’s life for petty theft just felt…wrong, and often

00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:14.112
judges would find a way of avoiding the death penalty, whether that

00:16:14.112 --> 00:16:18.502
was by finding them not guilty or giving them a more lenient sentence.

00:16:20.032 --> 00:16:25.732
In some cases, judges would even sentence a criminal to be hanged, they would be taken

00:16:25.782 --> 00:16:31.482
to the gallows and the noose would be placed around their neck, but then there would be

00:16:31.482 --> 00:16:37.642
a last minute reprieve, a pardon, the idea being that this was to signal to the criminal

00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:43.322
quite how close they had come to death, and it would deter them from doing it again.

00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:48.149
And this growing discomfort with the severity of the

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:51.789
Bloody Code wasn’t just happening at an individual level.

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:57.439
The Enlightenment was well underway, and moralists and philosophers

00:16:57.689 --> 00:17:01.699
had started asking questions about the role of the justice system.

00:17:02.969 --> 00:17:06.249
How should a society deal with people who break the law?

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.599
What was the role of the criminal justice system?

00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:13.569
Was it to punish people who had committed a crime, or

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:16.629
was it to stop crime being committed in the future?

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:21.269
If it was to punish people who had committed crimes, then surely

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:24.959
the punishment should be commensurate with the crime committed.

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:31.427
And if it was to stop future crimes being committed, what did this mean in practice?

00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:36.747
Was it about stopping other people from committing crimes in the future, and therefore

00:17:36.917 --> 00:17:41.527
enforcing harsh and more gruesome public punishments, like during the Bloody Code?

00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:47.458
Or was it about ensuring that the convicted criminal wouldn’t commit crimes in the future?

00:17:48.878 --> 00:17:52.358
And if so, did that mean helping them change their

00:17:52.358 --> 00:17:55.118
character so that they wouldn’t commit future crimes?

00:17:55.468 --> 00:17:57.728
Or did that mean executing them?

00:17:58.248 --> 00:18:03.298
Or did it mean sending them so far away that they wouldn’t be able to commit future crimes?

00:18:04.678 --> 00:18:08.668
Enlightenment thinkers started to analyse the problem from every

00:18:08.668 --> 00:18:13.418
angle, not just from the point of view of how best to reduce crime, but

00:18:13.418 --> 00:18:17.428
also what was the morally and ethically correct way to deal with it.

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:20.348
Change was on the horizon.

00:18:20.998 --> 00:18:25.238
And in mainland Europe, substantial progress was being made.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.505
The great Italian Enlightenment philosopher, Cesare Beccaria,

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.750
would publish his seminal work On Crimes and Punishments, in 1764.

00:18:36.988 --> 00:18:41.538
In this, he put forward several controversial arguments, for

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:45.608
example that the punishment should be proportionate to the crime.

00:18:46.348 --> 00:18:49.993
He also suggested that it was not the severity of the punishment,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.798
but the certainty of punishment, that would effectively deter crime.

00:18:56.198 --> 00:19:00.278
This was a radical idea at the time, especially in a system that

00:19:00.278 --> 00:19:04.208
believed public executions would stop criminals in their tracks.

00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:10.514
And this shift in thinking laid some important groundwork for a

00:19:10.514 --> 00:19:14.862
slow but significant transformation  of the British legal system.

00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:20.772
Reformers began to speak out against the death penalty for minor crimes,

00:19:21.022 --> 00:19:25.912
and gradually, the number of capital offences started to decline.

00:19:27.262 --> 00:19:32.091
By the early 19th century, transportation—sending convicts to penal

00:19:32.091 --> 00:19:36.721
colonies—had become a more common and popular alternative to execution.

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:44.691
Now, we actually have an entire episode on Penal Colonies, it’s episode number 108, but to cut a

00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:52.445
long story short, if you committed a crime that once might have led to execution, such as theft or

00:19:52.455 --> 00:19:59.325
forgery, you might now be transported to one of Britain’s distant colonies, typically to Australia.

00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:06.545
Transportation was seen as an effective way to punish the criminal, by sending them to a

00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:11.525
completely new place and meaning that they would never see their friends or family again, and

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:16.985
also a way of ridding Britain of its criminals, because they were on the other side of the world.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.610
But transportation wasn’t a perfect solution.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.950
It was expensive, soon enough word got out that life in Australia wasn’t actually

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.574
all that bad, and getting criminals to Australia and keeping them under control was

00:20:32.574 --> 00:20:37.974
a logistical challenge, and it became a less popular tool in the justice system.

00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:44.424
And at a similar time, so we’re talking the early 19th century here,

00:20:44.924 --> 00:20:49.104
the idea of prison as a form of punishment was gaining traction.

00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:53.094
Now, you might think we have always had prisons,

00:20:53.304 --> 00:20:56.534
but they are actually a relatively recent invention.

00:20:57.901 --> 00:21:01.954
Early prisons in Britain, for example the ones you might see in castles,

00:21:02.434 --> 00:21:06.424
these were often little more than holding cells for people awaiting

00:21:06.424 --> 00:21:10.834
trial or execution, they are more like what we would call “jails” today.

00:21:12.214 --> 00:21:17.074
But with growing discomfort with both the death penalty and transportation,

00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:22.504
there was a shift towards using imprisonment as a punishment in its own right.

00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:27.094
The idea was that this was a place where a criminal could

00:21:27.094 --> 00:21:31.034
reflect on their crimes and become morally reformed.

00:21:32.094 --> 00:21:36.904
And of course, the length they would be required to stay would be proportional to the

00:21:36.914 --> 00:21:42.814
gravity of the crime they had committed, because serious crimes required serious reform.

00:21:44.254 --> 00:21:49.314
Now, we’ll discuss prisons a lot more in part three of this mini-series, but

00:21:49.594 --> 00:21:53.294
the important thing to mention in the context of the history of the British

00:21:53.384 --> 00:21:59.440
justice system is that prison became more about rehabilitation and reintegration

00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:04.584
rather than punishment or removal of undesirable people from society.

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:11.744
The very word for these early prisons–penitentiaries–gives us a clue to their purpose.

00:22:12.714 --> 00:22:17.874
It comes from the idea of penitence—that criminals should reflect

00:22:17.884 --> 00:22:22.104
on their crimes and become morally reformed while incarcerated.

00:22:23.514 --> 00:22:28.394
At the same time, the idea of solitary confinement was introduced, where

00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:32.924
prisoners were kept in isolation so they could reflect on their crimes.

00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:38.444
It was believed that solitude and silence would lead to moral reformation.

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:40.734
So did it?

00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:43.184
Well, again, not really.

00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:47.024
In reality, the conditions in many prisons were still

00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:50.840
horrific, with overcrowding, disease, and maltreatment.

00:22:51.734 --> 00:22:55.844
So, by the mid-19th century, Britain was still grappling with a

00:22:55.844 --> 00:23:00.244
fundamental question: what was the purpose of a criminal sentence?

00:23:01.024 --> 00:23:06.374
Was it to rehabilitate criminals, and turn them into productive members of society?

00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:10.404
Or was it still about punishing those who had broken

00:23:10.414 --> 00:23:14.464
the law, to make an example of them and deter others?

00:23:16.084 --> 00:23:21.554
Moving into the modern day, many of these questions are still being asked, and

00:23:21.784 --> 00:23:26.904
although conditions in British prisons are significantly better than in the Victorian

00:23:26.914 --> 00:23:31.674
era, they are pretty unpleasant places that suffer from severe overcrowding.

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:36.151
The last people to be executed in Britain were Owen

00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:41.241
Evans and Peter Allen, who were hanged in August of 1964.

00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:47.201
Their crime was, I’m sure you’ll agree, more serious than stealing

00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:52.281
a deer or pinching a loaf of bread; they robbed and murdered a man.

00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:57.321
That was more than 60 years ago now, but the role of

00:23:57.361 --> 00:24:00.781
punishment in the justice system is still being discussed.

00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:07.301
After 1,000 years of experimenting with crime and punishment, in Britain, like

00:24:07.331 --> 00:24:12.391
all over the world, we are still a very long way from finding a perfect solution.

00:24:14.501 --> 00:24:19.501
OK then, that is it for today's short history of crime and punishment in Britain.

00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:23.951
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that it has

00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:29.001
got you ruminating a little about the role of the criminal justice system in society.

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:32.791
As a quick reminder, this is part one of a three-part

00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.821
series on the broad theme of crime and punishment.

00:24:36.331 --> 00:24:40.261
Next up, in part two, we are going to be going deep into the history

00:24:40.261 --> 00:24:44.771
of capital punishment, of the death penalty, and in part three we

00:24:44.771 --> 00:24:48.791
are going to take a long, hard look at the evolving role of prisons.

00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:53.821
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:24:54.211 --> 00:24:59.341

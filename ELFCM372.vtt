Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:16.108
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:20.258
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.848 --> 00:00:25.458
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about milk.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:30.074
Now, it might sound like a relatively uncontroversial subject.

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:34.954
After all, every mammal in the world produces milk, you most probably drank

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:38.684
your mother’s milk as a baby, you might put milk in your cereal in the morning.

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:44.554
Perhaps you’re even sipping a cappuccino or a cup of milky tea at this very moment.

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:50.554
But milk has gone from something innocent, something that governments literally

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:55.274
gave children for free and encouraged parents to provide for their children, to

00:00:55.274 --> 00:01:01.604
something of a bogeyman, an outcast, with calls for the sale of milk to be banned.

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:06.874
So that’s what we are going to be exploring in this episode, the war on milk.

00:01:08.407 --> 00:01:14.957
Let me start this episode with a perhaps polarising question:  do you drink milk?

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:21.927
If I had transported myself back in a time machine to perhaps any period of history

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:27.097
and asked someone this question, they would most likely have been slightly confused.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:34.387
Going back as far as 8,000 BC, 10,000 years ago, there is evidence of humans

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:40.747
drinking milk from animals - cows, goats, sheep, reindeer, horses, you name it.

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:46.967
After all, every mammal produces milk, it’s nutritious, it tastes

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:50.707
pretty good, or at least many people think it tastes nice enough,

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:55.247
and it’s easy to collect - all you need is a mammal that produces it.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.667
And a quick biological point here.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:02.677
Cows, goats, sheep, and of course humans, need to

00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:05.947
become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:09.694
You probably knew that already, but it’s important to

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:13.594
clarify early on, as it will become more relevant later.

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:21.314
So, back to early milk drinking, and me asking someone 100, 500, or

00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:26.914
even 5,000 years ago if they drank milk, or consumed dairy products.

00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:31.007
Odds are that they would have said “yes, of course.

00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:35.457
We keep cows or sheep, we milk them, we drink the milk, we

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:38.907
make butter and cheese, of course we do, why wouldn’t we?”

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:44.597
And as for the countries where milk wasn’t consumed, this was generally

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:49.982
for health reasons - around 90% of people of East Asian descent have

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:54.392
lactose intolerance, so consuming dairy products makes them feel ill.

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:59.882
But for anyone who wasn’t lactose intolerant, and who had access to

00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:05.362
cows, sheep and goats, milk and dairy products were somewhat of a staple.

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:11.272
Milk is full of vitamins, and it was almost literally available on tap.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.229
A bit of squeezing of your cow’s udders and ta-da,

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.819
you had a nice cup of nourishing, warm fresh milk.

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.769
And with time, the process of producing milk went from a localised one, where farmers produced

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:32.249
enough milk for their immediate family or their village, to larger dairy farms with lots of

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:37.289
cows whose milk would be transported and sold all over the country, all over the world even.

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:45.039
Fast forward to today, the dairy industry is estimated to be worth anything from 500 to

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:52.569
900 billion dollars, with something in the region of 250 million dairy cows in the world.

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:59.189
And here’s a fun but useless fact that I calculated for you - if you lined up every dairy

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.095
cow in the world nose to tail, that line would stretch around the world    17 times.

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:09.425
The point is, the dairy industry is huge.

00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:14.525
Billions of people drink milk every day, and there is evidence

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:18.267
of people drinking milk for over    10 thousand years now.

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:20.937
So, what’s changed?

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:25.567
Well, let me read you some headlines from the past few years.

00:04:26.597 --> 00:04:29.607
“12 Reasons to Stop Drinking Cow’s Milk”.

00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:34.427
“Hate To Break It To You, But Drinking Milk Is Not Okay”

00:04:35.887 --> 00:04:37.797
“Only Psychopaths Drink Milk”

00:04:39.047 --> 00:04:43.187
OK, that last one was from a film critic’s article on how

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:46.837
only psychopaths drink milk in movies, but you get the point.

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:53.517
There has never been a greater backlash against this drink than in the 21st century.

00:04:55.017 --> 00:05:00.947
If you’re a sworn “no milk” person, you’ll no doubt know all of the reasons for this already.

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:05.967
Even if you chug down litres of milk every day, you will probably be aware of

00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:11.127
some of them, but it’s worth naming them here, so we’re all on the same page.

00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:17.587
The reasons that people have stopped drinking milk can be split broadly into three categories:

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.617
Environmental, ethical, and health.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:25.623
To expand on these briefly, the dairy industry is

00:05:25.623 --> 00:05:30.213
responsible for around 3.6% of global carbon emissions.

00:05:30.783 --> 00:05:36.303
Cows burp and fart, they release methane from their mouths and

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.553
their bottoms, and this isn’t good news for the environment.

00:05:40.787 --> 00:05:44.427
By drinking milk you support the dairy industry, which is

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.717
responsible for going on 4% of global carbon emissions.

00:05:47.907 --> 00:05:51.757
So, if you stop drinking milk and replace it with a plant-based

00:05:51.757 --> 00:05:56.587
alternative, so the argument goes, you will reduce your carbon footprint.

00:05:57.947 --> 00:06:02.087
Secondly, for ethical reasons, reasons around animal cruelty.

00:06:03.077 --> 00:06:08.027
While 500 years ago a cow might have had a relatively happy life

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:12.727
in the countryside, life as a modern dairy cow is not so pleasant.

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:19.037
Cows are artificially inseminated, they are forced to become pregnant against their will.

00:06:19.657 --> 00:06:24.777
They give birth, and immediately their calf is taken away, never

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:29.007
to be seen again, and typically killed for its meat within months.

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:36.207
Gone are the days of roaming grassy pastures for most 21st century dairy cows; their

00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:42.407
days, their lives even, are spent standing next to each other in cramped indoor sheds.

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:45.387
It’s cruel for the mother and for its baby.

00:06:46.557 --> 00:06:47.757
And finally, health.

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:53.907
While the benefits of milk, its high levels of vitamins and so on, while milk

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:58.357
was for years something that governments and parents would promote as a good

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:04.187
thing to drink, some modern studies have concluded that milk can be problematic.

00:07:04.737 --> 00:07:08.607
It has been linked to everything from cancer to skin conditions.

00:07:09.557 --> 00:07:15.917
So, milk, once the symbol of nourishment and goodness, a drink that is mentioned no fewer than

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:23.477
48 times in the Bible, is becoming increasingly unfashionable, especially with younger consumers.

00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:30.006
If one report from 2022 is to be believed half of Gen

00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:34.116
Z is ashamed, too embarrassed, to drink milk in public.

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:40.376
What’s more, the business of producing milk is not a particularly good business.

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:47.156
Dairy farmers are constantly hammered on price by large supermarkets; they simply can’t make much

00:07:47.156 --> 00:07:53.069
money selling milk anymore, because their costs have risen so fast, and they can’t charge any more.

00:07:54.698 --> 00:07:59.716
For milk’s critics, no doubt this is fantastic news, as it’s

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:03.266
yet another reason to consign milk to the history books.

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:06.396
But there is a real human cost.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:12.776
Farmers already have a higher suicide rate than every other type of job, with American

00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:17.556
farmers twice as likely to kill themselves than people in any other profession.

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:22.355
And dairy farmers are particularly susceptible, given

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:25.846
that they have always operated on very low profit margins.

00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:33.086
One dairy cooperative in the United States even went so far as to send its members

00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:39.256
a leaflet with a list of suicide prevention hotlines - that is how bad it has got.

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:44.686
Dairy farmers are literally killing themselves because the future is so bleak.

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:51.636
On the flip side of all of this, however, is a growing group of passionate milk drinkers,

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:57.736
people who are committed to going back to nature and drinking pure, raw cow milk.

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:01.976
Quick side note, the milk that you or I might find in

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:05.216
a supermarket has not come straight from a cow’s udder.

00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:11.656
It has been processed, pasteurised, harmful bacteria removed and the fat levels adjusted.

00:09:13.076 --> 00:09:17.196
Raw milk, on the other hand, is exactly that, it’s

00:09:17.196 --> 00:09:20.696
raw, it hasn’t been processed or changed in any way.

00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:28.116
Most governments, in fact, have restrictions on raw milk, precisely because it can be harmful.

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:33.136
It’s actually illegal, banned, in some states in the United States.

00:09:33.966 --> 00:09:38.386
In the UK, it’s completely illegal in Scotland, but in England,

00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:42.466
Wales and Northern Ireland it’s illegal to sell it in supermarkets

00:09:42.506 --> 00:09:46.736
or highstreet shops, but not illegal to sell directly to a consumer.

00:09:47.616 --> 00:09:52.866
In other words, you can buy it directly from a farmer but you can’t buy it at a supermarket.

00:09:54.176 --> 00:10:02.976
And, like anything that is illegal or semi illegal, this often adds to its attraction, its intrigue.

00:10:03.726 --> 00:10:10.706
The number of people searching online for “raw milk” has tripled since 2004, and more and more

00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:17.576
people are being drawn to this pure, unadulterated, and in some cases illegal, type of milk.

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:19.906
Why, you might ask?

00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:26.586
Well, proponents of raw milk share some of the same health concerns as critics of “normal”

00:10:26.586 --> 00:10:32.216
milk, that it is pumped full of additives and preservatives and not very good for you.

00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:39.326
But while many critics of normal milk suggest drinking plant-based alternatives - oat

00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:44.916
milk, almond milk, soy milk and so on - proponents of raw milk have exactly

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:49.336
the same health issues with these plant-based milks, these “alternative” milks.

00:10:50.686 --> 00:10:57.056
Drinks like oat milk often have very high sugar content and use rapeseed oils, and lack

00:10:57.126 --> 00:11:02.746
many of the nutrients that come with raw milk and, to a lesser extent, processed milk.

00:11:03.866 --> 00:11:10.146
And, according to the author of a book called The Great Plant-Based Con, the environmental arguments

00:11:10.326 --> 00:11:16.316
for switching to plant-based milks over cow-based milk are not as strong as most people think.

00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:23.516
In fact, according to the book’s author, if you measure greenhouse gas emissions based on

00:11:23.526 --> 00:11:31.426
nutrients, not on calories, oat milk is actually three times worse for the planet than cow milk.

00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:39.746
Or to put it another way, on a per calorie basis oat milk is better for the environment.

00:11:40.176 --> 00:11:44.666
But because it has so few nutrients compared to cow milk, on a

00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:49.066
per nutrient basis it is considerably worse for the environment.

00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:56.004
Raw milk, according to its most ardent proponents, its greatest supporters, is

00:11:56.004 --> 00:12:01.302
the answer, and there is a growing corner of the internet where raw milk fans will

00:12:01.302 --> 00:12:07.093
espouse its benefits and tell everyone that they should ditch processed milk and

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:13.431
milk alternatives, instead going to the source, pure, unadulterated cow’s milk.

00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:17.861
You’ll see health and fitness influencers on social media

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.880
talking about how they drink a pint of raw milk every day.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:27.010
Even Liver King, who you might remember from our mini-series a few weeks ago on Great

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:32.640
American Con Artists, you can find videos of him chugging down litres of raw milk,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:38.460
telling people how great it is and how they need to avoid any kind of processed drinks.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:46.550
It’s still a relatively niche, a small, group of people, these raw-milk enthusiasts, and raw milk is

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:53.200
still illegal in much of the world, but its fans and advocates are passionate and growing in number.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.718
So this is the curious state of milk in 2023.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.040
On the one hand there are milk’s biggest critics, people who point

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.950
to the environmental, ethical and health dangers of drinking milk

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.500
and eating dairy, people who are almost literally waging war on milk.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.480
On the other side of the spectrum you have the raw milk proponents, people who will

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:25.000
often travel hundreds of kilometres to buy raw milk directly from a farmer, people

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.570
who are super passionate about raw milk and encourage everyone they meet to try it.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:37.010
And stuck in the middle you have “traditional” milk, or normal processed milk I should say.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.060
It’s under attack from both sides.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.503
You have dairy farmers being squeezed on price by supermarkets, you have younger

00:13:45.503 --> 00:13:51.491
consumers deciding  to not drink cow’s milk, and you have increasing costs of production.

00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:58.131
Given all of this, it’s hardly surprising that the future for dairy farmers is

00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:03.881
somewhat bleak, with some reports going as far as to say that the dairy industry

00:14:03.891 --> 00:14:10.161
in the United States could be obsolete by the year 2030, it could simply not exist.

00:14:11.221 --> 00:14:14.751
But is there light at the end of the tunnel, what

00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:18.141
could come next for the dairy industry and for milk?

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.321
There is extensive work and investment going into reducing the carbon footprint of

00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:30.091
cows, giving them probiotics to stop them emitting so much methane, running the farms

00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:35.621
in a more environmentally friendly way, and doing what can be done to reduce the

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:40.341
carbon footprint of the dairy industry, while still keeping cows front and centre.

00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:47.191
And one potential future has cows being removed from the milk-production altogether

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:52.181
via something called “precision fermentation”, which allows milk to be produced

00:14:52.351 --> 00:14:57.121
without the environmental or ethical problems of producing milk from cows.

00:14:57.941 --> 00:15:03.071
It’s still prohibitively expensive, its too costly to mass produce milk

00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:09.706
in this way, but it’s claimed that by 2035 "precise fermentation" will

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:15.001
be a cheaper way to produce milk, thereby putting cows out of business.

00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:20.981
And there are also plenty of hair-raising headlines about alternative

00:15:20.981 --> 00:15:25.261
types of milk, including one that even claimed that milk could be made

00:15:25.261 --> 00:15:29.281
from cockroaches, which I certainly don’t particularly like the sound of.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:36.551
So, as to the future of milk, while in the short term dairy farmers are

00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:41.411
being squeezed from all sides, with seemingly little support, there are still

00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:46.731
billions of people who drink milk and consume dairy products every single day.

00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:51.581
Whatever your personal views about milk, the fact that

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:55.541
it is so popular is, in some ways, a little strange.

00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:02.781
Firstly, humans are the only species on earth that drinks the milk of another animal.

00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:06.981
Plenty of other animals eat other animals, or other

00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:10.167
plants, but none drink the milk of another animal.

00:16:11.257 --> 00:16:15.017
And secondly, humans are the only mammals that continue to

00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:19.037
drink milk into adulthood - no other adult mammals do it.

00:16:20.132 --> 00:16:23.282
Strange it might be, but it is very popular.

00:16:24.312 --> 00:16:28.632
We humans have been drinking milk for 10,000 years, as

00:16:28.632 --> 00:16:31.532
a species we have developed quite the thirst for it.

00:16:32.512 --> 00:16:40.262
Who knows whether we’ll still be doing it in 10,000, 1,000, 100 or even 10 years from now.

00:16:42.662 --> 00:16:47.342
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the war on milk.

00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:52.967
I hope it's been an interesting one and that whether you are a avowed vegan and anti-milk

00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:58.477
crusader, or if you get through litres of milk every day, well I hope you've learnt something new.

00:16:59.387 --> 00:17:02.667
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:04.047
Do you drink milk?

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:10.617
If so, what milk do you drink, plant based, supermarket processed milk, or raw milk?

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:15.597
Has your consumption of dairy products and of milk changed over time?

00:17:16.137 --> 00:17:19.377
Where do you think the dairy industry will be in 10 years time?

00:17:20.177 --> 00:17:23.637
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:26.737

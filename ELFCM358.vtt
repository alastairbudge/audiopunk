Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.770
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.870
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.990
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.599
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.840
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.950
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.380
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.759
are going to be talking about a

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.739
subject that is close to my heart,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.509
both emotionally and geographically.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.019
And that is the question of how Malta,

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.740
a tiny country in the middle of the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.059
Mediterranean Sea, became a, if not

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.390
the, global centre for online gambling.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.510
It’s a fascinating story that gets you

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.489
thinking about the interconnectedness

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.070
of the global economy, what small

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:54.000
countries do to survive, how wealth

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.040
is created, distributed and shared, or

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.800
not shared, and how this affects the

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.880
societies where this all takes place.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.820
So, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:09.578
OK then, Poker Island, the story of How

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:11.848
Malta Became An Online Gambling Hub.

00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:15.778
It was a quarter past seven

00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:17.028
on a Saturday morning.

00:01:17.768 --> 00:01:20.038
I was queuing to pay in a local

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.808
supermarket, holding my young son’s hand.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.588
We'd gone out to buy butter and milk,

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:29.838
as making pancakes on a Saturday morning

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:33.018
had become somewhat of a ritual for us.

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.238
In front of me in the queue were two

00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:40.428
tall, blond haired men in their mid-20s.

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:43.109
They'd clearly not yet gone to

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.379
sleep, it had been a busy night,

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:47.229
and they were buying cigarettes

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.279
and beers to keep them going.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.749
They were both red in the face, and

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.509
rubbing their noses, telltale signs

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:57.729
that all manner of substances were

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.809
still flowing through their bloodstream.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.249
The cashier scanned the last item,

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.789
and told the first man the price.

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:08.529
“Fourteen Euros twenty seven please”.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.369
“Sure”, he said, in a Scandinavian accent.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.079
He reached into his pocket, bringing out

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.389
a huge wad of 50 euro notes, thousands

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.589
if not tens of thousands of Euros simply

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.549
hanging loose in his trouser pocket.

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.089
He tried to take one out and hand it to

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:33.049
the cashier, but as he did so he fumbled,

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.469
with the rest falling to the floor.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.869
I looked down at the ground, which was

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.239
covered with what must have been thousands

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.799
of Euros falling all around his feet.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.059
The man didn’t seem to notice me, but

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.839
bent down and started picking up the

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.169
dropped fifties, stuffing them into his

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.179
pocket like he was picking up rubbish.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.599
“You’ve missed one”, said the

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.579
cashier kindly, pointing out a

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.509
fifty Euro note under his foot.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.669
“Thanks”, said the man, collecting his

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.339
change, the beer and cigarettes, picking

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.819
up the remaining fifty, and joining

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.779
his friend who was waiting outside.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.509
So, what were these men doing in Malta,

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.229
why did they have so much money that it

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.349
was falling out of their pockets, what

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.009
has this all meant to a tiny island nation

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.539
and what can we learn from all of this?

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.899
Well, I should start with a brief

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.929
introduction to the location, the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.799
place we are talking about today.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.699
It’s called Malta, and it’s

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.329
a tiny island, or technically

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.449
collection of three islands, in the

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.749
Mediterranean, just south of Sicily.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.129
If you picture Sicily, the football at

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.309
the bottom of Italy, then you go almost

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.689
exactly 100km south, you will hit Malta.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.389
But you’ll need to look very

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.629
carefully, because it’s easy to miss.

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:02.299
The island of Malta itself is only 246

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.789
km squared, and the entire country,

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.349
which consists of two other smaller

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.759
islands, is only 316 km squared.

00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:15.469
To put that in perspective, the

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.499
metropolitan area of London is 8,382

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:21.469
kilometres square, so you could

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.928
fit almost 27 Maltas inside London.

00:04:26.288 --> 00:04:29.539
And to go on a very quick, a whistestop,

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:31.939
tour of Maltese history, it has been

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.969
occupied by everyone from the Phoenicians

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.039
to the Knights of Malta, then briefly

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:39.229
the French before being occupied

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:41.889
by the British for over 150 years.

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:46.289
It is, essentially, a tiny rock in

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.679
the middle of the Mediterranean.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.649
It was useful from a strategic point of

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:53.439
view, because it has a deep harbour and

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.609
was a useful place for other powers to

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:58.009
hold, but there really isn't anything

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.769
there, no natural resources, no oil

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.219
or gas, it’s just a rock in the sea.

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.689
And it has gone through periods of

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.359
great wealth and abject poverty,

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:12.649
with the rulers of the day often

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.839
enjoying lavish standards of living

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.649
while the local people, well, didn’t.

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:21.219
It became independent from the UK

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:25.159
technically in 1964, but not fully

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.269
until 1979, when the British navy left.

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.239
And although it is an independent country,

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.039
with a fiercely proud people, it still

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.059
retains many signs of its former occupier:

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.899
English is one of the two official

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:43.599
languages, they drive on the same side of

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.639
the road as in the UK, the electric plugs

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.699
are the same, they even have the same

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.649
distinctive red post boxes as in the UK.

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.389
And after it gained its independence,

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:58.519
the Maltese economy did grow relatively

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.872
healthily, but it started from a

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:05.542
very low bar - in 1980 the GDP per

00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:08.692
capita was around €12,000, less than

00:06:08.692 --> 00:06:11.282
half of its closest neighbour, Italy.

00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:15.302
To put it another way, it was a very

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.482
poor country with not much going

00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:18.992
for it apart from good weather.

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:23.192
Fast forward to the modern day and

00:06:23.192 --> 00:06:25.142
Malta is one of the fastest-growing

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:27.562
economies in Europe, with Ferraris

00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:29.402
cruising down the streets and

00:06:29.412 --> 00:06:32.092
luxury yachts docked in its marinas.

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:34.902
So, what happened?

00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:38.762
Well, two words: online gambling.

00:06:39.852 --> 00:06:43.172
Over the past almost 20 years Malta has

00:06:43.192 --> 00:06:45.902
transformed itself from a cheap package

00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:48.722
holiday destination to the Las Vegas

00:06:48.772 --> 00:06:51.092
of the Mediterranean, or perhaps more

00:06:51.122 --> 00:06:53.822
accurately the Las Vegas of the Internet.

00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:58.912
On the first of May, 2004, when along

00:06:58.912 --> 00:07:00.752
with Cyprus, the Czech Republic,

00:07:01.012 --> 00:07:03.552
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:05.292
Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia,

00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:08.002
Malta joined the European Union.

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:13.052
15 became 25, and the union now

00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:14.602
encompassed the majority of the

00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:16.152
continent’s geographical area.

00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:19.962
Clearly, even if online gambling didn’t

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:22.532
exist, joining the EU would have been a

00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:25.682
huge boom for Malta, as it allowed free

00:07:25.682 --> 00:07:27.752
movement through other member countries,

00:07:27.872 --> 00:07:30.502
and made it much more attractive both as

00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:33.302
a holiday destination and a destination

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:35.352
for people to come and learn English, and

00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:37.642
then travel to other countries in the EU.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.162
But we are talking about gambling,

00:07:41.342 --> 00:07:43.192
so why is this important?

00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:46.982
Well, before the ink was dry on the

00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:48.822
agreement for Malta to join the EU,

00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:51.672
politicians in Malta had a plan.

00:07:53.052 --> 00:07:55.552
The plan was to create a regulatory

00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:57.882
framework to give licences to

00:07:57.922 --> 00:08:00.222
online gambling operators, which

00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:02.242
would allow them to what’s called

00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:04.672
“passport” to other jurisdictions.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.662
To operate an online casino you need a

00:08:08.662 --> 00:08:11.692
licence, and casinos could set up shop,

00:08:11.952 --> 00:08:14.442
they could base themselves in Malta, and

00:08:14.442 --> 00:08:16.392
then allow gamblers from all over the

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:19.002
world to play on their online casinos.

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:23.152
So, Malta created this favourable

00:08:23.192 --> 00:08:25.342
regulatory framework, meaning that it

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:28.292
was relatively easy and affordable to

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:30.352
get a licence to start an online casino,

00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:32.852
and start accepting customers from

00:08:32.892 --> 00:08:35.372
everywhere from Stockholm to Berlin.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.452
Malta also has several other advantages

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:41.422
for these online gambling companies.

00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:44.492
The first was a very low corporate

00:08:44.552 --> 00:08:47.192
tax rate, effectively 5%.

00:08:48.702 --> 00:08:50.222
When compared to the tax rates

00:08:50.222 --> 00:08:52.292
in Scandinavia, which is a

00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:54.122
particularly popular region for

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:56.222
online gambling, clearly there were

00:08:56.232 --> 00:08:57.832
considerable savings to be made.

00:08:59.322 --> 00:09:01.892
Secondly, and again this is related

00:09:01.892 --> 00:09:04.742
to costs, Malta’s low cost of living

00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:07.372
and low salaries, at least 20 years

00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:09.582
ago, meant that online gambling

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.692
companies could pay what would have

00:09:11.692 --> 00:09:14.222
been low wages in Stockholm but

00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:16.072
would have allowed their employees

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.452
to live lavish lifestyles in Malta.

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:21.422
Now it’s a completely different

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:23.992
story, as I’ll come to explain, but

00:09:24.232 --> 00:09:26.832
even 10 years ago it was possible to

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:30.332
earn a salary of, let’s say, €1,500 a

00:09:30.332 --> 00:09:33.362
month in Malta and live like a king.

00:09:34.742 --> 00:09:36.432
And a third factor was

00:09:36.462 --> 00:09:37.802
simply geographical.

00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:40.512
It’s a tiny Mediterranean island with

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:42.402
beaches and sun most of the year.

00:09:43.462 --> 00:09:45.152
Compared to the dark winters of

00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:47.572
Northern Europe, well, you can see

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:49.912
the attraction of 300 days of sun.

00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:53.092
So, what happened?

00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:55.652
Sure enough, the Maltese

00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:57.332
government's plan worked.

00:09:58.462 --> 00:10:01.142
Slowly but surely, companies upped

00:10:01.212 --> 00:10:04.022
sticks, they moved south, attracted

00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:05.912
by favourable legislation, low

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:08.272
taxes, and the possibility of

00:10:08.302 --> 00:10:10.142
paying their staff significantly

00:10:10.172 --> 00:10:11.832
less than they were paid before.

00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:14.552
The first company came, then the

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:16.422
second, the third and the fourth,

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:19.002
and now there are literally hundreds

00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:20.712
of online gambling companies.

00:10:22.242 --> 00:10:25.312
As the Maltese government hoped, employees

00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:27.702
from these first companies left to start

00:10:27.732 --> 00:10:29.472
their own companies, employing more

00:10:29.472 --> 00:10:32.452
people, paying taxes, renting apartments,

00:10:32.452 --> 00:10:34.632
buying food, doing all the sort of

00:10:34.632 --> 00:10:36.802
things that people do, all the sort of

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:39.002
things that bring money into an economy.

00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:42.512
And on the subject of money,

00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:44.952
especially in the early days of online

00:10:44.952 --> 00:10:47.342
gambling in Malta, these companies

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.512
would make eye-watering amounts of

00:10:49.512 --> 00:10:52.002
money, often with very small teams.

00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:55.572
It was a complete gold rush, and

00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.332
18-year-olds working on websites from

00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:00.712
around their kitchen table ended up making

00:11:00.722 --> 00:11:03.152
millions of Euros every single month.

00:11:04.482 --> 00:11:07.312
Now, before we get into the impact

00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:09.202
of this, it’s worth giving you

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:11.872
a brief outline of how online

00:11:11.882 --> 00:11:14.212
gambling works, because after all,

00:11:14.532 --> 00:11:15.752
the money comes from somewhere.

00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:20.952
So, there is you or me, the person who

00:11:20.952 --> 00:11:23.132
decides that they want to gamble online.

00:11:23.652 --> 00:11:25.842
Well, not actually me, perhaps

00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:27.862
not you, but according to some

00:11:27.882 --> 00:11:30.082
statistics, up to 20% of the

00:11:30.082 --> 00:11:32.082
world’s population gambles online.

00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:34.752
So, what happens?

00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:37.072
Well, there is a person,

00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.192
let’s call him Jim.

00:11:39.192 --> 00:11:41.572
Jim probably searches on Google for

00:11:41.572 --> 00:11:44.172
something like “best casino bonuses”,

00:11:44.392 --> 00:11:46.442
he’ll find a website with a load of

00:11:46.442 --> 00:11:48.822
reviews, he’ll click on a link to

00:11:48.822 --> 00:11:50.672
a casino that promises to give him

00:11:50.932 --> 00:11:54.072
€100 if he deposits €100, let’s say.

00:11:55.012 --> 00:11:56.762
He’ll go to that online casino,

00:11:57.082 --> 00:11:59.832
he’ll deposit his €100, the casino

00:11:59.832 --> 00:12:01.962
will give him an extra €100 to play

00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:04.242
with, but statistically speaking,

00:12:04.402 --> 00:12:06.212
he’ll probably end up losing it all.

00:12:06.902 --> 00:12:08.872
Or he might win a little bit, then

00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:10.962
he’ll lose a bit, he might deposit some

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:13.342
more money because he thinks “I almost

00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:15.362
won, let me just have one last try”.

00:12:15.922 --> 00:12:17.422
But he’ll end up losing

00:12:17.472 --> 00:12:18.662
everything he put in.

00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:21.882
And where does this money go?

00:12:22.632 --> 00:12:24.432
If you’re thinking, “well, it just

00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:26.402
goes to the online casino”, well

00:12:26.652 --> 00:12:28.392
let me tell you it’s usually a

00:12:28.392 --> 00:12:29.922
bit more complicated than that.

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:33.082
The first recommendation website,

00:12:33.262 --> 00:12:35.612
called an affiliate, will most likely

00:12:35.612 --> 00:12:37.482
get a percentage of what Jim lost.

00:12:37.752 --> 00:12:40.182
The casino will normally license the

00:12:40.182 --> 00:12:42.312
actual game from a game provider,

00:12:42.732 --> 00:12:44.312
and they might get a percentage of

00:12:44.312 --> 00:12:46.472
what Jim deposited, or what he lost.

00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:48.832
And the company that manages the flow

00:12:48.832 --> 00:12:50.332
of money might also get something.

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:53.092
The rest goes to the casino operator.

00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:55.362
And Jim, of course, well,

00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:56.672
he’s left with nothing.

00:12:57.662 --> 00:13:00.712
If he had deposited enough money, perhaps

00:13:00.722 --> 00:13:03.002
the casino’s internal systems would

00:13:03.002 --> 00:13:05.442
have flagged him as a “high potential”

00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:08.932
player, a “VIP”, and he might get a nice

00:13:08.932 --> 00:13:11.022
message from someone informing him that

00:13:11.022 --> 00:13:13.242
they’ll give him more credit to come back.

00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:15.912
So he deposits more money to get

00:13:15.922 --> 00:13:18.492
the credit, maybe he even wins big.

00:13:18.852 --> 00:13:20.402
Perhaps he might win tens

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:21.732
of thousands of Euros.

00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:26.122
But if he does, in many cases the casino

00:13:26.122 --> 00:13:28.362
will give him the money back in smaller

00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:30.952
tranches, not the entire amount at once.

00:13:31.552 --> 00:13:33.302
Unless, that is, he wants to use

00:13:33.302 --> 00:13:35.822
it as credit in the casino, in

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:37.342
which case he can have it all

00:13:37.342 --> 00:13:39.142
back immediately to play at once.

00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:42.662
So, Jim decides to do this, after

00:13:42.662 --> 00:13:44.232
all, he got lucky last time.

00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:46.652
Then he loses it all again.

00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:50.152
And if Jim was a really big fish,

00:13:50.352 --> 00:13:52.692
someone gambling tens of thousands of

00:13:52.692 --> 00:13:55.182
Euros every day, he would probably have

00:13:55.182 --> 00:13:57.392
someone who would text him at all hours

00:13:57.392 --> 00:13:59.772
of the day, inviting him to concerts,

00:14:00.062 --> 00:14:02.602
on holidays, to sporting events, and

00:14:02.862 --> 00:14:05.422
showering him with gifts, all with the

00:14:05.422 --> 00:14:08.082
intention of getting him to log back in

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.542
to the casino and deposit more money.

00:14:12.162 --> 00:14:13.912
There’s a saying in English, “the

00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:16.172
house always wins”, meaning that

00:14:16.172 --> 00:14:18.052
the casino always comes out on top,

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:19.802
that you can never beat the casino.

00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:21.952
And it’s a saying for a

00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:23.662
very good reason; it’s true.

00:14:24.862 --> 00:14:28.082
And although some casinos do go bust,

00:14:28.092 --> 00:14:30.342
they do lose money, statistically

00:14:30.342 --> 00:14:32.442
speaking they will always come out on top.

00:14:33.702 --> 00:14:36.002
Now, why am I mentioning this,

00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:38.002
why am I going into such detail?

00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:40.012
I’m certainly not advocating

00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:41.802
that you start gambling online.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.502
As you probably know, it can be a

00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:46.682
slippery slope, can be addictive,

00:14:46.882 --> 00:14:48.672
and leads to the destruction of

00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:51.322
marriages, homelessness, and suicide.

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:52.472
So don’t start.

00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:55.632
But I mention it because the important

00:14:55.642 --> 00:14:57.812
thing to underline is that every single

00:14:57.822 --> 00:15:00.282
cent that has come into Malta through

00:15:00.312 --> 00:15:02.642
online gambling has come from someone

00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:05.742
like Jim, often sitting alone on their

00:15:05.742 --> 00:15:07.892
mobile phone in a toilet cubicle at

00:15:07.892 --> 00:15:10.122
their office, typing their bank details

00:15:10.252 --> 00:15:12.612
into yet another online casino to try

00:15:12.632 --> 00:15:15.052
to regain the feeling of that first win.

00:15:16.152 --> 00:15:18.912
The adverts for these online casinos show

00:15:18.912 --> 00:15:21.222
glamorous men and women having fun at

00:15:21.222 --> 00:15:24.282
poker tables, but the reality is that it’s

00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:26.362
much more likely to be someone on their

00:15:26.402 --> 00:15:29.002
own playing a slot machine on their phone.

00:15:30.232 --> 00:15:33.472
And when it comes to quite how much money

00:15:33.642 --> 00:15:36.182
online gambling has brought to Malta, how

00:15:36.182 --> 00:15:39.012
much money has been lost by these players,

00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:42.222
by punters, the sums are enormous.

00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:45.312
Today the online gambling

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:47.392
industry directly contributes

00:15:47.632 --> 00:15:51.392
around 14% of Malta’s GDP, and is

00:15:51.392 --> 00:15:53.872
worth around €2 billion a year.

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:58.432
€2 billion might sound like pocket

00:15:58.432 --> 00:16:01.442
change, a small sum, for a larger

00:16:01.442 --> 00:16:03.812
country, but remember this is one

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.992
of the smallest countries in Europe.

00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:09.582
It’s about €4,000 for every person

00:16:09.612 --> 00:16:11.692
on the island, every single year.

00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:15.562
It has become a key employer, responsible

00:16:15.562 --> 00:16:17.292
for tens of thousands of people,

00:16:17.832 --> 00:16:20.412
and remember this is out of a local

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:22.832
population of under half a million people.

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.982
And some of the biggest online

00:16:25.982 --> 00:16:27.962
gambling companies in the world

00:16:28.192 --> 00:16:29.862
are now based here, or at least

00:16:30.002 --> 00:16:31.662
have some of their operations here.

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:35.672
Indeed, 10% of all online gambling

00:16:35.672 --> 00:16:37.642
companies have a presence in Malta,

00:16:37.982 --> 00:16:39.702
in this small country that would

00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:42.032
be a tiny neighbourhood of London.

00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:45.812
And what has this done to Malta?

00:16:45.842 --> 00:16:47.642
What has it done to the island?

00:16:48.432 --> 00:16:50.507
Well, for lots of people it has meant

00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:52.852
that they have made lots of money, with

00:16:52.852 --> 00:16:55.052
some growing spectacularly wealthy.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.972
For the casino owners, the people and

00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:01.252
companies who own the affiliate websites

00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:03.592
and the game providers, clearly they

00:17:03.592 --> 00:17:05.982
have been direct beneficiaries of this.

00:17:07.082 --> 00:17:09.412
But this isn’t restricted to the people

00:17:09.422 --> 00:17:11.742
directly involved in online gambling.

00:17:12.412 --> 00:17:13.832
There has been a property boom

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.852
in Malta over the past 10 years,

00:17:16.152 --> 00:17:17.972
with property prices rising

00:17:17.972 --> 00:17:20.372
200% in the space of a decade.

00:17:21.722 --> 00:17:24.492
Indeed, if you come to Malta today, there

00:17:24.492 --> 00:17:26.672
is barely a single place on the island

00:17:26.882 --> 00:17:28.842
where you will not be able to hear a

00:17:28.852 --> 00:17:31.022
large pneumatic drill in the background.

00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:34.845
This is good news for property

00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:37.025
developers and the construction industry,

00:17:37.335 --> 00:17:39.955
but for almost everyone else it is

00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:42.325
destructive, in the literal sense.

00:17:42.965 --> 00:17:45.665
You’ll see beautiful old townhouses being

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.595
knocked down by wrecking balls, you’ll

00:17:47.595 --> 00:17:49.985
see the previously unspoilt countryside

00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:52.505
with huge cranes dotting the landscape.

00:17:53.275 --> 00:17:54.665
There’s even a joke that Maltese

00:17:54.665 --> 00:17:57.575
people tell, that the “crane” is

00:17:57.575 --> 00:17:59.101
now the national bird of Malta.

00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:02.427
With this influx of people and money,

00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:04.367
it has meant that the cost of living

00:18:04.607 --> 00:18:07.777
has increased hugely, and young people

00:18:07.897 --> 00:18:09.727
starting out with their first jobs

00:18:09.847 --> 00:18:12.327
have very little chance of ever owning

00:18:12.327 --> 00:18:14.137
their own apartment unless they have

00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:16.347
help from their parents, or if they

00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:17.887
join an online gambling company.

00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:21.287
But the effects of Malta

00:18:21.497 --> 00:18:22.917
becoming an online gambling

00:18:22.917 --> 00:18:24.737
hub are even further reaching.

00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:28.107
Specifically, it has made it an even

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.497
more attractive destination for organised

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:32.667
criminals to launder their profits.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:36.397
Now, real-life physical casinos

00:18:36.597 --> 00:18:38.497
have long been used by criminals

00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:40.527
to launder their money.

00:18:41.157 --> 00:18:43.437
Dirty cash goes in, and it comes

00:18:43.437 --> 00:18:45.537
out at the end clean as a whistle.

00:18:46.927 --> 00:18:49.357
Online casinos on some levels

00:18:49.527 --> 00:18:51.837
make this slightly harder, because

00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:54.627
digital money leaves a trace, but

00:18:54.977 --> 00:18:56.837
on another level it makes it much

00:18:56.877 --> 00:18:58.677
easier, because you don’t have to

00:18:58.677 --> 00:19:00.947
physically take the cash to the casino.

00:19:02.507 --> 00:19:05.387
As a result, organised criminals have

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:08.097
used, and still use, Maltese online

00:19:08.097 --> 00:19:10.777
casinos to launder billions of dollars.

00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:15.417
Indeed, in January of 2023, there was

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:18.447
an EU report that described Malta and

00:19:18.747 --> 00:19:21.697
I’m quoting directly, “a mafia paradise

00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:24.187
where billions of illegally obtained

00:19:24.197 --> 00:19:27.762
euros are laundered”, and an “ATM, a

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.057
cash machine, for the Italian mafia”.

00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:33.387
But, you might be thinking, I thought

00:19:33.407 --> 00:19:34.757
you said there was a regulator for

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.977
this industry, that Malta was one

00:19:36.977 --> 00:19:38.827
of the first countries to create

00:19:38.827 --> 00:19:40.617
a system to regulate all of this?

00:19:41.357 --> 00:19:44.127
Well, yes, but the regulators aren’t

00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:45.947
always very good at regulating.

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:50.037
Indeed, two of the most senior executives

00:19:50.207 --> 00:19:52.317
at the Malta Gaming Authority, the

00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:54.287
government authority that regulates

00:19:54.397 --> 00:19:55.707
the online gambling industry,

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:57.767
have been charged with corruption.

00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:01.177
In the case of the former CEO,

00:20:01.517 --> 00:20:03.577
literally the boss of the regulator,

00:20:04.047 --> 00:20:06.477
he was charged with selling insider

00:20:06.487 --> 00:20:10.057
information to a man named Yorgen Fenech.

00:20:10.537 --> 00:20:11.897
If you recognise that name,

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.947
he is also the man accused of

00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:16.047
masterminding the assassination of

00:20:16.047 --> 00:20:18.147
the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:20:19.497 --> 00:20:21.807
So, although Malta is very keen to

00:20:21.837 --> 00:20:24.967
portray itself as a clean and respectable

00:20:24.967 --> 00:20:26.927
place to do business, when the man

00:20:26.927 --> 00:20:28.857
responsible for regulating an industry

00:20:29.137 --> 00:20:31.327
is accused of doing deals with the

00:20:31.327 --> 00:20:33.577
country’s most famous murder suspect,

00:20:33.757 --> 00:20:36.527
well it doesn’t exactly ooze confidence.

00:20:37.687 --> 00:20:40.347
And indeed, not only because of this,

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:42.757
but because of a wide range of financial

00:20:42.757 --> 00:20:45.307
scandals, Malta was actually placed on

00:20:45.307 --> 00:20:47.907
something called the “grey list” by the

00:20:47.907 --> 00:20:50.727
“FATF”, the Financial Action Task Force.

00:20:51.327 --> 00:20:52.807
We don’t need to go into detail

00:20:52.807 --> 00:20:55.307
of exactly what this is, but it is

00:20:55.307 --> 00:20:57.497
essentially a naughty list of countries

00:20:57.727 --> 00:20:59.477
believed to be involved in money

00:20:59.487 --> 00:21:01.157
laundering and crooked behaviour.

00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:04.577
It's now off this “grey list”, after

00:21:04.827 --> 00:21:06.467
promising to better regulate the

00:21:06.477 --> 00:21:09.677
financial sector, but as that EU report

00:21:09.697 --> 00:21:11.997
is evidence of, there are still plenty

00:21:11.997 --> 00:21:14.357
of people who believe that Maltese online

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:17.417
casinos are a vital part of organised

00:21:17.457 --> 00:21:19.777
criminals’ money laundering operations.

00:21:21.167 --> 00:21:22.737
So, what next?

00:21:23.597 --> 00:21:26.077
The past 15 years or so have been

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.897
characterised by huge economic growth and

00:21:28.897 --> 00:21:31.197
increased levels of prosperity in Malta,

00:21:31.697 --> 00:21:34.657
driven predominantly by its transformation

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.837
into the Las Vegas of the Med.

00:21:37.847 --> 00:21:39.687
But what does the future hold?

00:21:40.397 --> 00:21:42.717
Well, it seems like the good times

00:21:42.747 --> 00:21:44.177
are not going to last forever.

00:21:45.217 --> 00:21:47.597
Many of the reasons that made Malta

00:21:47.767 --> 00:21:50.417
an online casino paradise are no

00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:52.404
longer, or at least they are not

00:21:52.447 --> 00:21:54.267
as attractive as they once were.

00:21:55.577 --> 00:21:58.167
Many Northern European countries don’t

00:21:58.207 --> 00:22:00.427
allow online casinos from Malta to

00:22:00.427 --> 00:22:02.977
operate in their jurisdiction, or if

00:22:02.977 --> 00:22:05.077
they do, they are heavily regulated.

00:22:06.387 --> 00:22:08.197
What’s more, the cost of living

00:22:08.207 --> 00:22:10.023
in Malta has dramatically

00:22:10.023 --> 00:22:12.247
increased since the early 2000s.

00:22:13.137 --> 00:22:15.937
Whereas even 10 years ago a company

00:22:16.107 --> 00:22:18.077
might have been able to pay an employee

00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:21.947
€1,500 a month and that employee would

00:22:21.947 --> 00:22:25.167
have been very happy, this now no longer

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.357
affords them the same standard of living.

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:30.547
Sure, it’s still cheaper than

00:22:30.547 --> 00:22:33.017
Stockholm, but not so much cheaper.

00:22:34.537 --> 00:22:36.707
What’s more, there is the constant

00:22:36.707 --> 00:22:38.627
construction, pollution, and

00:22:38.627 --> 00:22:41.167
traffic, and in many respects the

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:43.077
quality of life is a lot lower.

00:22:44.117 --> 00:22:46.217
So it’s harder to attract people

00:22:46.227 --> 00:22:48.117
to come versus 15 years ago.

00:22:49.497 --> 00:22:51.367
And because there are now so

00:22:51.377 --> 00:22:53.147
many online gambling companies,

00:22:53.527 --> 00:22:56.247
competition is much harder, and the

00:22:56.247 --> 00:22:59.637
heyday is, according to some, over.

00:23:00.707 --> 00:23:02.707
Indeed, several online gambling

00:23:02.707 --> 00:23:04.607
companies have left the island

00:23:04.627 --> 00:23:06.787
altogether, because there simply

00:23:06.827 --> 00:23:08.177
aren’t enough reasons to stay.

00:23:09.787 --> 00:23:13.327
So, if this is a reversing trend, if

00:23:13.507 --> 00:23:16.017
online gambling has peaked in Malta,

00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:18.367
what's next for this little rock?

00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:21.867
Well, Malta has always been

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:23.917
quite creative in its quest to

00:23:23.947 --> 00:23:25.787
attract money to the island.

00:23:26.817 --> 00:23:29.897
First there was online gambling, then

00:23:29.897 --> 00:23:32.497
the country started selling citizenship,

00:23:32.797 --> 00:23:35.197
selling passports, it experimented

00:23:35.197 --> 00:23:38.607
with cryptocurrency in 2017, and

00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:41.407
Maltese politicians have made bold but

00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:44.007
unsubstantiated claims about becoming

00:23:44.017 --> 00:23:46.057
a centre for Artificial Intelligence.

00:23:47.597 --> 00:23:50.627
One thing is for sure, and that is that

00:23:50.627 --> 00:23:53.277
Malta hasn’t yet managed to find another

00:23:53.327 --> 00:23:55.647
“golden goose”, another industry to

00:23:55.647 --> 00:23:57.797
attract that will bring as much money

00:23:57.797 --> 00:23:59.957
into the island as online gambling has.

00:24:01.687 --> 00:24:03.617
For many in Malta, this

00:24:03.637 --> 00:24:05.087
isn’t such a bad thing.

00:24:06.157 --> 00:24:08.247
After all, the arrival of online

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:10.717
casinos fundamentally changed the

00:24:10.727 --> 00:24:13.257
character of the country and kickstarted

00:24:13.567 --> 00:24:15.567
a period of development that turned

00:24:15.577 --> 00:24:17.497
the country into a construction site.

00:24:18.977 --> 00:24:21.887
Sure, it left many people with heavier

00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:24.707
wallets, with more zeros on their bank

00:24:24.707 --> 00:24:27.237
balance, but for anyone who wasn’t

00:24:27.247 --> 00:24:29.607
directly involved, and who didn’t

00:24:29.617 --> 00:24:31.517
reap the benefits, they were left

00:24:31.687 --> 00:24:33.907
scratching their heads and asking

00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:37.257
themselves, “who really won the jackpot?”

00:24:39.787 --> 00:24:42.527
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:24:42.677 --> 00:24:44.987
on the rise of online gambling in Malta.

00:24:45.337 --> 00:24:46.657
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:24:47.067 --> 00:24:48.327
and that you've learnt something new.

00:24:49.167 --> 00:24:51.017
As always, I would love to know

00:24:51.017 --> 00:24:52.537
what you thought of this episode.

00:24:52.977 --> 00:24:54.557
Have you been to Malta before?

00:24:54.977 --> 00:24:56.997
In case you weren’t aware, it’s a big

00:24:56.997 --> 00:24:58.927
destination for people coming to learn

00:24:58.927 --> 00:25:01.587
English, although this is now dwarfed by

00:25:01.587 --> 00:25:03.457
the size of the online gambling industry.

00:25:04.177 --> 00:25:06.217
If you have been, did you know

00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:07.567
that the country was such a

00:25:07.577 --> 00:25:08.957
centre for online gambling?

00:25:09.807 --> 00:25:11.737
I would love to know, so let’s

00:25:11.737 --> 00:25:13.117
get this discussion started.

00:25:13.617 --> 00:25:14.647
You can head right into our

00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:16.277

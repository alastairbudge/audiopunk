Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds

00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:16.874
by Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to weird and wonderful stories and

00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:22.574
learn fascinating things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:29.594
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Turkmenistan.

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:36.794
It is an authoritarian country in central Asia, ruled by an eccentric

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:42.734
president who recently changed the constitution so that he could rule for life.

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:50.684
Human Rights Watch called it "one of the world's most isolated and oppressively governed

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:57.989
countries", and it is just a very weird, weird place as we are going to find out today.

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.799
But before we get right into this episode, this is just my chance to remind those

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.889
of you listening to the podcast on Spotify, iVoox, Apple Podcasts or wherever you

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.989
may be listening to it, that you can get all of the bonus episodes plus transcripts,

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.354
key vocabulary and more over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:22.304 --> 00:01:29.534
From bonus episodes on things like the Royal family and member only Q&A sessions,

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:34.514
the next one is coming up on Wednesday the 27th of May by the way, there has never

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:40.334
been a better time to become a member and join our growing group of curious minds.

00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:44.174
So if you want to find out more about that, and I

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:48.964
certainly hope you do, then the link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:53.922
Okay then, let's talk about Turkmenistan.

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:59.082
I guess you have probably never been to Turkmenistan.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:05.922
Very few tourists have, and a combination of the fact that it is so

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:10.757
hard to get to and the fact that it has this strange or

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:16.577
authoritarian rule has meant that it is pretty unknown to the outside world.

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:22.199
It's a relatively small country with under 6 million people,

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:29.309
but it is only slightly smaller than Spain in terms of size, of landmass.

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:37.421
And if you'd have a hard time figuring out exactly where it was on the map, it's

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:45.686
directly to the north of Iran, and has a border with Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Kazakhstan.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.350
So it's firmly in this central Asian block of countries that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.064
all gained independence from the USSR after the breakup of Alastair Budge:

00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:04.092
the Soviet Union, and Turkmenistan got full independence in 1991.

00:03:05.857 --> 00:03:09.457
Since independence, which is what we'll be mainly talking

00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:16.417
about in today's episode, it has remained a weird, isolated country.

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:20.542
It was initially governed by a man called â€ŽSaparmurat

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:26.084
Niyazov who was a North Korean style leader.

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:33.599
He had a proper cult of personality and complete, supreme control over the country.

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.917
With this control he created some Alastair Budge:

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:43.283
downright bizarre laws for Turkmenistan.

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:49.583
Some of these might sound completely crazy, but it is worth talking about

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:53.063
them in a bit more detail here to give you a bit of an

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:59.273
understanding of quite how strange life in this country was under his rule.

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:05.675
Firstly, Niyazov, the president, was apparently worried about the

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:12.957
development of music in Turkmenistan, so he outlawed, he forbid, Alastair Budge:

00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:18.409
lip synching, which is when someone at a concert or on TV

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:23.119
pretends to speak, and then the real audio track is played in the background.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.429
He was not a fan of lip synching.

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.199
He also banished all dogs from the capital.

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.979
He said that they weren't allowed into the city because,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.659
and I quote directly here, of "their unappealing smell".

00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:44.014
In short, he didn't like the way that dogs smelled, and so

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:47.404
he decided that none should be allowed in the capital city.

00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:52.971
He had to quit smoking because of a heart condition, but

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:59.571
rather than just quit himself, he banned smoking in all public places

00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:04.341
and said that all government employees also had to quit.

00:05:06.032 --> 00:05:11.998
And finally, he was a very good son, a doting son, you could say.

00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:19.688
I say this because it seems clear that he loved his mother very much because

00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:28.118
he got read of the Turkmen word for bread and replaced it with his mother's name, Gurbansoltan.

00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:34.868
And he wasn't just content to have changed the word for bread to his mother's

00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:41.288
name he also changed the word for the month April to his mother's name as well.

00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:47.696
There was even a golden statue of Niyazov that rotated throughout

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:54.866
the day to always face the sun, which allegedly cost $12 million to make.

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:57.176
Quite something, right?

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:05.826
He ruled Turkmenistan with an iron fist until his sudden death in 2006.

00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:10.956
When he died, there was a bit of a scramble for power.

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:17.326
Unlike in North Korea, for example, where it is clearly

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:22.386
a family affair, Niyazov hadn't designated a successor.

00:06:24.144 --> 00:06:28.299
However, shortly after his death, his deputy prime minister,

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:34.268
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow took over power, and if you,

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:41.408
or even if the Turkmen people were expecting a return to normality, then

00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:46.443
unfortunately that was not to arrive with the rule of Berdimuhamedow.

00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:51.355
The era of the new president, Berdimuhamedow, has

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:56.875
proved to be equally strange, albeit in slightly different ways.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:06.355
Firstly, we should mention horses, and in particular a special breed of horse called the Akhal-Teke.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.830
This breed of horse plays a big role in the life of Berdimuhamedow.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.650
He is completely mad about them; he has written and published poetry about them

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:26.500
and apparently he personally has a collection of 600 different Akhal-Tekes,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.850
which is 10% of the world's population, of this particular kind of horse.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.369
He has even given himself the nickname The people's horse breeder".

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:41.049
A horse breeder is someone who raises horses.

00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:47.579
And just in case people didn't know how much he loved horses, he

00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:55.074
,like his predecessor decided to build a huge gold statue of himself on a horse

00:07:55.584 --> 00:08:03.384
that sits on top of a 20 metre high white marble statue in the capital of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat.

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.269
You may have heard his name because he was in the news

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:14.789
last year, in 2019, as they were reports that he had died.

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:23.469
He hadn't been seen for a few weeks, and rumours were circulating that he had suddenly died.

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:32.339
So what did the state TV do to prove to the people that their president had not died?

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:38.349
You might think, well, they probably just did an interview with him or

00:08:38.499 --> 00:08:44.169
something like that to make it clear that he was alive and well, but

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.909
that will be far too normal for Turkmenistan and for Berdimuhamedow.

00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:56.949
Instead, state TV broadcast clips of him doing very strange things,

00:08:57.429 --> 00:09:02.664
including driving a rally car around a burning hole in the ground,

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:08.634
firing a gun while riding a bike, and of course, riding a horse.

00:09:09.744 --> 00:09:10.944
Pretty strange, right?

00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:16.975
Now, it's all well and good to just talk about the slightly ridiculous

00:09:16.975 --> 00:09:23.760
things that the leaders of Turkmenistan have done, and are still doing, but there are

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.530
a few slightly more serious topics that are worth mentioning here.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:36.180
Firstly, it's how Turkmenistan as a country makes money and what

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.565
this means for its people, specifically right now.

00:09:41.335 --> 00:09:47.755
Turkmenistan is home to the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world, and

00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:55.765
it also has a large amount of oil, yet it's still a poor country the average

00:09:55.765 --> 00:10:01.129
salary is around $400 per month, and male life expectancy is

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:04.819
just under 65, female life expectancy is a little bit higher.

00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:09.925
Like many countries with a large amount of natural resources,

00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:14.893
it has struggled to turn this into prosperity for its people.

00:10:15.807 --> 00:10:20.907
And this is, as you may know, pretty common with countries that have large

00:10:20.907 --> 00:10:28.287
amounts of natural resources, and is called 'the resource curse' or 'the paradox of plenty'.

00:10:29.347 --> 00:10:35.197
It's a really interesting idea and something that's definitely deserving of its own episode,

00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:41.837
but the theory goes that for lots of countries, they find that having large amounts of

00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:48.527
natural resources actually ends up hurting them and harming their development in the long run.

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:53.081
And it would seem that Turkmenistan is no exception

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:58.091
it has not managed to turn its wealth of natural resources

00:10:58.451 --> 00:11:03.071
into any significant increase in standard of living for its people.

00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:07.465
And in the past few months, things have got

00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:11.815
even tougher for Turkmenistan and for the Turkmen people.

00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:18.773
When there was the big drop in the oil price in March this year, this

00:11:18.773 --> 00:11:24.863
had a knock-on effect for the price that Turkmenistan could get for its natural gas.

00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:27.523
It reduced significantly.

00:11:28.536 --> 00:11:34.416
Because of this, Turkmenistan suddenly didn't have nearly as much money coming

00:11:34.416 --> 00:11:39.976
into the country, it was running out of foreign currency, of dollars and rubles.

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:48.286
So the government implemented some pretty drastic measures and said that all companies

00:11:48.376 --> 00:11:53.926
had to sell all of their foreign currency to the government at the official rate.

00:11:55.231 --> 00:12:00.295
Now, note the use of the word 'official' here because Turkmenistan,

00:12:00.642 --> 00:12:07.424
like several other central Asian countries has two exchange rates: the official

00:12:07.454 --> 00:12:14.234
exchange rate and the black market rate, and there is often a big difference between the two.

00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:19.763
In Turkmenistan, if you have a dollar and you exchange that

00:12:19.763 --> 00:12:26.408
at the official rate, you will get 3.5 of the local currency, the manat.

00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:33.578
But if you find someone who will exchange manat with you on the black market, you can

00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:40.928
normally get more than 20, so you can get about six times more on the black market.

00:12:41.874 --> 00:12:47.214
The result of this is that these businesses that have to give up their dollars

00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:54.594
to the government do so at the official rates of course, and they get about a sixth of what

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:58.944
they're actually worth, which of course is not popular with the businesses.

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:08.124
And on another topical note, Turkmenistan is one of a handful of countries that

00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:15.654
have not, as of May the 20th, reported any cases of COVID-19, of coronavirus.

00:13:16.704 --> 00:13:23.394
Now, whether that is due to excellent preparation or the fact that it is one of

00:13:23.394 --> 00:13:29.064
the most or authoritarian countries in the world, rated third worst in terms of freedom of the

00:13:29.064 --> 00:13:33.674
press, that is something that I will leave you to make up your own mind about.

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:36.549
But it does seem pretty unlikely.

00:13:38.065 --> 00:13:43.765
One final point about Turkmenistan and its leader that is firstly just an

00:13:43.765 --> 00:13:48.491
interesting story to end on, and secondly, just makes you

00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:55.086
think quite how bizarre the world can sometimes be is related to the Guinness World Records.

00:13:56.166 --> 00:14:01.506
Now, we actually recently did an episode on the Guinness World Records, it was

00:14:01.506 --> 00:14:05.886
Episode 52, so if you're interested, then you can go and listen to that one.

00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:12.246
But how this is related to Turkmenistan is that the Guinness World

00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:17.736
Records makes a lot of money through allowing companies and organisations

00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:22.866
to pay to get records to promote their products or services.

00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:30.816
But they also allow countries to pay large amounts of money to get records, and it turns out

00:14:31.146 --> 00:14:39.846
that the president of Turkmenistan, Berdimuhamedow, is a huge fan of the Guinness World Records.

00:14:40.717 --> 00:14:45.946
The result of this is that Guinness World Records is very happy

00:14:45.946 --> 00:14:54.046
to take the money to promote Turkmenistan breaking all sorts of really, really strange records.

00:14:55.006 --> 00:15:00.286
These records are so weird that you probably couldn't even imagine them

00:15:00.286 --> 00:15:06.256
if you tried, but they include the record for the largest architectural

00:15:06.526 --> 00:15:10.801
image of a star, which is basically just a huge star.

00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:16.491
Then the world's largest statue of a horse head, obviously, because

00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:22.971
the president loves horses, and the weirdest one for me, which I just can't really

00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:29.481
believe deserves to be a record, is for the most people in a cycling awareness lesson.

00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:33.381
So a lesson about how to ride a bike safely.

00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:39.386
And it was 3,246 people in that lesson, if you're asking.

00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:45.316
I did have a look at the Guinness Records website, but unfortunately it doesn't

00:15:45.316 --> 00:15:50.236
say whether they all actually learned anything at this record breaking lesson.

00:15:51.756 --> 00:15:55.426
Of course, that wasn't the point, and I'm sure that Berdimuhamedow

00:15:55.536 --> 00:16:00.186
was just very happy to have another record to add to his collection.

00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:05.176
It also doesn't say how much Guinness World Records got paid

00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:09.436
for promoting it, but no doubt it was pretty significant.

00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:19.616
Okay then that is it for this little look at one of the strangest places in the world.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:25.556
It doesn't really get much attention, mainly because it isn't very threatening,

00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:32.451
it's famously neutral, and so it is just left to be strange and unique on its own.

00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:40.221
But it is quite fascinating to think that there is this entire country, almost the same size as

00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:48.591
Spain, with a not insignificant population that just exists in this weird, unbelievable state.

00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:55.341
So if you have ever been to Turkmenistan, I would love to know what you thought.

00:16:55.971 --> 00:17:00.141
I've actually been to Uzbekistan, next door, which is quite

00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:04.461
strange, but I'm told that Turkmenistan is an awful lot weirder.

00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:10.881
So if you have ever been there or even if you haven't, I would love to hear from you.

00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:15.271

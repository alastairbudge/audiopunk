Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.809
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:21.129
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:28.069
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part one of a three part series on Brexit.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:34.919
It is, to state the obvious, a big, emotional, complicated, confusing, and most

00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:40.999
importantly, ongoing subject, and one that is both fascinating and nauseating.

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.639
So, to take on this mammoth topic we are going to split it into three parts.

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:53.189
In part one, today’s episode, we are going to reflect on Britain’s

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.739
relationship with Europe throughout history, which we will discover is

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:03.349
somewhat peculiar, one of a neighbour, partner, and sometimes friend.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:09.109
This will take us up to just before the decision to hold a Brexit referendum,

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:14.789
a decision that was taken in 2015, with the actual vote happening a year later.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.579
Then, in part two we will look at the Brexit campaign itself, diving deeper into the

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:27.339
reasons that people voted for and against Brexit, how the campaigns were actually

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:33.139
fought, and some of the theories about why the country ultimately voted for Brexit.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:39.769
And then in part three, the final part, we are going to look at what has happened in the

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:45.839
five and a half years since the UK voted to leave, how it compares to the predictions

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.159
of what would happen, and think about what the future might hold for Brexit Britain.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:55.739
We have got a lot to get through, so let’s jump right in.

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:00.089
Before we dive into Britain’s relationship with Europe over

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:04.599
time, let me start with a simple but provocative question.

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.429
Is the UK in Europe?

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.259
I’m not talking about the EU here, I’m talking about the continent “Europe”?

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.089
Well, yes, you’d probably say.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.399
Technically it is.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.949
But if you asked this question on the streets of the UK, you might get a different

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:28.129
answer, or at least people might take some time to think about their answer.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.039
Certainly, you would have fewer people in the UK saying that the UK

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.189
was part of Europe than if you went to France, Italy or Germany and

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.679
asked the inhabitants whether those countries were part of Europe.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.859
The UK has always had this slightly peculiar relationship with Europe where the body of

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:56.259
water that separates the UK from France, which is as little as 31 kilometres wide at its

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:02.649
shortest point, creates a sharp division between the UK and the rest of the continent.

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:09.389
If we go back thousands of years, 8,000 years ago to be precise, Britain was

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.229
actually part of the European continent, joined to France, Belgium and the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.429
Netherlands through an area called Doggerland, which is now part of the North Sea.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:28.179
Then, approximately 8,000 years ago sea levels rose, partly due to a massive tsunami

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.909
and melting glaciers, and Britain was forever cut off from the rest of the continent.

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.869
Being an island has some evident advantages when it comes to self-defense, but these advantages

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:49.244
were no match for the Roman army, the first permanent European arrivals to Britain, in 55BC.

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:55.219
After returning for a full invasion of Britain 100 years later, the Romans

00:03:55.279 --> 00:04:00.309
ruled Britain, with the exception of Scotland, for almost 400 years.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.059
This period was, to all intents and purposes, relatively harmonious.

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:12.429
The Romans brought technological advances such as the flushing toilet, good

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:17.409
food and wine, Christianity and bureaucracy to an island that had lived

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.099
under pagan religions and with a distinct lack of technological development.

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:30.909
Strangely enough, after the Romans left Britain in 400 AD, the local inhabitants simply went

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:37.859
back to living almost as they had been before the Romans arrived, as if the previous 400

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:43.139
years and all of the great technological inventions they had brought had never happened.

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:51.209
Now, fast forward to our next important encounter with Europe, and this is an encounter that

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:57.989
shows the confusing and at times contradictory relationship that Britons have with Europe.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:04.629
In 1066, William the Conqueror, a Norman Duke, from modern-day northern

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.689
France, invaded England and became King, King William I of England.

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.009
While you might think that he is looked down upon as a French invader, someone

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:22.229
who cruelly attacked the country and killed the true English king, he isn’t.

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:23.069
Not at all.

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.719
He is remembered fondly, and the Normans are remembered as having brought with them some great

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:36.069
additions to Britain: additions to the language, to the food, to architecture, to government,

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:43.119
to the legal system and indeed that very French thing of fine manners and fine living.

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:50.139
It’s in many ways ironic that William the Conqueror is remembered as a great British king

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:56.499
and ruler, much more fondly remembered than many British-born kings, but he was, essentially,

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:02.969
a Frenchman and certainly an illegal and, when he first arrived, unwelcome immigrant.

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.689
You’ll see this as a theme throughout the episode, and in the rest of this

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:15.319
mini-series - Brits love to blame Europe, and Europeans for things they don’t like,

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:21.909
but tend to forget about the benefits Europeans have brought, and that one of the most

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:27.219
important monarchs in British history was from Europe, continental Europe that is.

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:35.509
Now, let’s jump ahead a few hundred years to our next big event in UK-European relations,

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.329
and in fact the first time that Britain really broke with Europe: The Reformation.

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:49.129
In 1534, almost 500 years after William the Conqueror had arrived on English shores

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:55.009
and brought Britain closer to Europe, Henry VIII decided to break away from the

00:06:55.019 --> 00:07:01.169
Catholic Church and declared himself to be Head of the Protestant Church of England.

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:07.089
One can even make the comparison between the European Union and the Catholic Church here.

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:13.479
Both powerful institutions that have direct and indirect control over much of

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.749
the European continent, institutions that unite people across the continent.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:24.489
But Henry did not want to live under the rules and regulations of a foreign

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:30.199
authority, especially when that foreign authority wouldn’t let him divorce his wife.

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:37.669
Henry VIII is viewed by many, including the famous historian David Starkey, as being the

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:44.679
first Eurosceptic, the first person to question whether having such a close relationship

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:51.909
with Europe was actually beneficial for Britain, or whether it should try to fend for itself.

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:58.659
Indeed, Starkey writes that “The xenophobic, insular politics Henry VIII

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:04.259
created have helped define English history for the past five centuries.”

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:10.259
As with Brexit, nobody had ever broken from the Catholic Church before.

00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:16.659
And as with Brexit, emotions ran high, it was an emotional subject.

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:24.669
As we’ll discover in episode two, and like a religious belief, especially the vote to leave the

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:32.819
European Union was an emotional one, made about emotions and beliefs rather than anything else.

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:39.629
Now, as we move into semi-modern history, the next element to discuss is the

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:45.389
period of European continental warfare, where the British armed forces fought

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:51.909
with and against various European powers for much of the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:57.459
The most important of these wars, at least when it comes to understanding Britain’s

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:06.383
relationship with Europe in the context of Brexit, were the Napoleonic Wars, from 1803 to 1815.

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:12.349
The British army had proved itself to be a formidable fighting

00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:16.779
force, but it was its navy that was even more powerful.

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:22.849
Of course, if you are an island then having powerful sea forces comes in very useful.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:29.239
But Britain had met its match with the French military genius of Napoleon.

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:36.109
Napoleon’s ambitions were vast, both personally and in terms of his vision for Europe.

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:43.596
Indeed, in 1805 he called for a “ European legal system, a European appeal

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:48.846
court, a common currency, the same weights and measures, the same laws.”

00:09:49.836 --> 00:09:51.656
Does that sound familiar to you?

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:56.096
Napoleon’s desire to rule over Europe was a great

00:09:56.216 --> 00:09:59.956
threat to British commercial and imperial ambitions.

00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:05.156
Great Britain had been growing fabulously wealthy from trade and

00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:10.626
colonialism, and the idea of a united European continent to rival

00:10:10.646 --> 00:10:15.076
British power posed a great problem to Britain’s global ambitions.

00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:21.586
Indeed, the only real reason Britain fought in Europe at all during the

00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:27.476
18th and 19th centuries was because of threats to its global trade network.

00:10:28.386 --> 00:10:35.306
Fortunately for Britain, Napoleon’s ambitions proved to be too great, or perhaps the Russian

00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:42.842
winter proved to be too cold, and he was eventually defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:49.556
The victory here is remembered in Britain as a British victory, of the British

00:10:49.576 --> 00:10:56.176
army against the French, but this is certainly selective memory: it was a European

00:10:56.216 --> 00:11:01.916
alliance, and in fact less than a quarter of the soldiers fighting against Napoleon

00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:07.296
were British, with the rest coming from an alliance of different European countries.

00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:12.646
So, that’s another example of selective memory when it comes to Europe.

00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:18.396
After the Battle of Waterloo, Britain’s focus turned away from Europe

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:22.886
and towards the rest of the world, where it was quickly assembling an

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:28.086
empire that would at its peak cover one quarter of the land on Earth.

00:11:28.936 --> 00:11:32.206
Why limit yourself to Europe, Brits thought, when you

00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:36.356
could claim the riches of India, China, and East Africa?

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:42.526
Again, you might recognise a similar line of argument later on in this mini-series.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:47.486
Another important consideration for Britain was what was happening

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:52.316
across The Atlantic, in the newly formed United States of America.

00:11:53.116 --> 00:11:59.896
In 1890 the US economy overtook Britain’s as the largest in the world, and Britain’s

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:05.866
attention was far more focussed on trade with this important non-European ally.

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:12.076
When war broke out in 1914, everything changed for Britain.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:19.766
The complex system of alliances meant that British forces joined the war effort, after an

00:12:19.786 --> 00:12:26.976
almost 100 year period of what historians have called a “splendid isolation” from Europe.

00:12:28.146 --> 00:12:34.296
And although the First World War ended after four years, this was only really a temporary

00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:41.656
hiatus, with the eventual peace in Europe only coming in 1945 at the end of World War II.

00:12:42.516 --> 00:12:47.186
Let’s reflect quickly on the importance of the world wars for the British

00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:51.806
relationship with Europe, before moving on to what this all means.

00:12:53.056 --> 00:12:57.166
While one can argue whether these wars were actually avoidable,

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:01.846
both in general and for Britain, they happened, Britain joined them,

00:13:02.026 --> 00:13:07.276
and around 1.3 million British people were killed during both wars.

00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:15.616
It was, again to state the obvious, a tragic and horrendous period in history, but Britain suffered

00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:21.706
significantly less than much of continental Europe, especially Russia, Germany, and France.

00:13:22.857 --> 00:13:26.870
The suffering wasn’t just in terms of losing fewer citizens.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:33.910
British towns and the British countryside escaped relatively unscathed, even after World War II.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.370
Brits do love talking about surviving The Blitz, the bombing

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.290
of the UK by the Nazi air force between 1940 and 1941.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:52.830
It did result in the deaths of around 40,000 civilians and the destruction of around 2 million flats

00:13:52.860 --> 00:14:00.020
and houses, but compared to the destruction wrought upon France, Germany or Russia, where much of

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:06.200
the actual fighting of World War II was taking place, Great Britain escaped relatively unscathed.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.690
Although Britain might have suffered less than many European countries in

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.530
World War II, it was now evident that it couldn’t simply ignore Europe.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:25.160
After all, it was only 31 kilometres away, people can literally swim from Britain to

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:31.320
Europe, and problems in Europe proved themselves quickly to be problems also for Britain.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:39.360
In Europe there was a sense that European countries needed to form closer alliances, to form

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:46.500
tighter bonds, to prevent the possibility of this kind of catastrophic war ever happening again.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:53.860
Britain, and especially its wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, shared this sentiment, it

00:14:53.860 --> 00:15:01.190
felt the same way, but did not feel that Britain should play a part in this new European alliance.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:08.380
The fact that Britain had escaped relatively unscathed from the war, and that it had

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:14.540
strong alliances and relationships with non-European powers, in particular the US,

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:20.610
Australia, India and South Africa, was viewed as confirming that Britain’s approach of

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:27.840
“splendid isolation”, of not being too closely involved in European affairs was correct.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.930
Britain had also been fighting, in its mind, not just for Europe,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:38.690
but for the whole world, including its vast collection of colonies.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.330
To quote Winston Churchill, “We are fighting to save the whole world from

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:50.450
the pestilence of Nazi tyranny and in defence of all that is sacred to man.”

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.090
So, again, why tie yourself too closely to Europe, when

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.020
you have much wider, global ambitions and responsibilities?

00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:06.681
Churchill was, however, a strong supporter of The Council of Europe, which was

00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:11.811
arguably the beginning of the European Coal and Steel Community, the post-war

00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:16.791
agreement between France and Germany which formed the basis of what became the

00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:24.415
Common Market or European Economic Community [EEC] in 1957, and later the EU.

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:28.941
Churchill simply thought that Britain didn’t need to be in it.

00:16:30.421 --> 00:16:34.861
It had influence after all through other post-war organisations,

00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:38.481
such as NATO, the World Bank and the United Nations.

00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:42.691
Britain was determined to remain a significant power

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:46.381
through these organisations and its international network.

00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:52.561
Above all, it valued its “special relationship” with the United States of America.

00:16:53.491 --> 00:16:59.598
This expression of UK-US ties, which was coined by Churchill, is still in use

00:16:59.598 --> 00:17:05.068
today, as are Britain’s close links with the USA, although the relationship

00:17:05.368 --> 00:17:10.038
is a lot more special and important to Britain than it is to the US.

00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:16.938
But post-war Britain was not the booming economy that Churchill had hoped it would be.

00:17:17.499 --> 00:17:22.692
Growth was stagnant, and British power and influence was decreasing.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:29.679
It was even abandoned by its most powerful ally, the US, during the Suez Crisis

00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:37.179
of 1957, causing it to rethink how special the special relationship really was.

00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:43.629
Meanwhile, across the Channel in Europe, economies were springing back.

00:17:43.822 --> 00:17:48.142
France, Germany, and even Italy were enjoying faster

00:17:48.152 --> 00:17:51.352
rates of growth, in part aided by The Marshall Plan.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:58.490
What’s more, the EEC, the European Economic Community, or simply the European Community,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:05.780
started to have more global influence and an increasingly powerful voice on the world stage.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.640
Brits thought, well, perhaps we should be part of that after all, and

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.390
twice during the 1960s the UK tried to join the European Community.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.380
Unfortunately the UK’s advances were rejected by the French President

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.730
Charles de Gaulle, who vetoed the UK’s application, partly because he feared

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.763
that it would bring an American influence on the decidedly European EEC.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:44.066
When De Gaulle was replaced by Georges Pompidou, the UK was finally accepted into the EEC in 1973.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:49.930
In the UK this event was not seen as a great cause for

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:55.360
celebration, but was rather accepted, grudgingly, as a necessity.

00:18:56.452 --> 00:19:01.772
There were some familiar concerns about what would happen when the UK joined the

00:19:01.782 --> 00:19:08.066
EEC, which remember is the precursor, the organisation that came before, the EU.

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:14.472
For example, there were stories about housewives worrying that their food prices would

00:19:14.482 --> 00:19:19.882
skyrocket, that there would be large jumps in prices, when the UK joined the EEC.

00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:27.712
It turned out that being part of the EEC wasn’t all that bad, and two years after the

00:19:27.712 --> 00:19:33.542
UK joined, there was a referendum on membership, essentially the first Brexit vote.

00:19:34.292 --> 00:19:37.942
In this vote, people were overwhelmingly happy with

00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:43.022
EEC membership, and 67% of people voted to remain.

00:19:44.012 --> 00:19:53.032
It should of course be noted that the EEC in 1975 was a very different beast to the EU in 2016:

00:19:53.832 --> 00:19:59.542
Before the UK joined the EEC in 1973, there were only six countries:

00:19:59.882 --> 00:20:04.742
France, West Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Italy and Luxembourg.

00:20:05.316 --> 00:20:11.356
The UK, Denmark and Ireland all joined in 1973, making it a group of nine.

00:20:12.286 --> 00:20:18.776
Although there was talk within the EEC of gradually moving towards a political and economic

00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:26.126
union, the group that the UK joined was based on trade and the UK‘s reason for joining was

00:20:26.316 --> 00:20:31.916
to do with the advantages that being able to trade easily with these other countries brought.

00:20:32.686 --> 00:20:36.376
It was simply a marriage of economic convenience - it

00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:40.756
was a community based on trade, not a real “union”.

00:20:41.926 --> 00:20:48.376
The EU that the UK voted to leave in 2016 was, of course, greatly changed.

00:20:48.586 --> 00:20:51.576
There were 28 countries, including the UK.

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:58.616
Membership had been expanded significantly, especially further south and east to countries

00:20:58.726 --> 00:21:05.156
that the UK had historically had less contact with and viewed with a certain scepticism.

00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:10.676
It had moved from a community based on trade to a political and

00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:15.436
partially monetary union, through the Euro, the common currency.

00:21:16.366 --> 00:21:20.306
26 European countries had also signed the Schengen Agreement,

00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:23.566
allowing free movement of people throughout Europe.

00:21:24.466 --> 00:21:29.106
Importantly, the UK didn’t join the Euro and didn’t agree to Schengen.

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:33.016
It had one foot in Europe, and one foot out.

00:21:33.536 --> 00:21:37.706
It was never fully in, but it still wanted influence.

00:21:38.336 --> 00:21:43.986
Now, we’ll talk more about the feelings of British people towards Europe and towards

00:21:43.986 --> 00:21:50.736
the EU in the next episode, but if we have to summarise the relationship that the UK

00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:56.676
as a country has had with Europe over the years, it has been one of semi-detachment.

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.376
Perhaps imagine a village with a group of houses in the centre.

00:22:01.896 --> 00:22:05.086
All of the people who live there leave their doors

00:22:05.136 --> 00:22:08.016
open, because they know and trust their neighbours.

00:22:08.686 --> 00:22:12.326
If anyone runs out of sugar, they know they can just

00:22:12.326 --> 00:22:14.846
go to their neighbour’s house and ask for a cup.

00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:18.416
They all have their differences, but everyone has

00:22:18.426 --> 00:22:22.026
chosen to live here because life is better for everyone.

00:22:23.116 --> 00:22:29.376
On the edge of this village, however, there’s a big house with a large garden and a fence.

00:22:29.926 --> 00:22:35.486
The house is in the village, and the inhabitants of the house now come to village

00:22:35.506 --> 00:22:41.226
meetings, because they want to make sure the village is kept clean and tidy, and they

00:22:41.256 --> 00:22:47.596
also want to be able to borrow sugar if they run out, but they lock their doors, they

00:22:47.596 --> 00:22:53.356
don’t allow other village children to come and play, and there is a certain sense of

00:22:53.596 --> 00:22:59.966
superiority that they feel towards the rest of the village, which is in part due to the

00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:05.276
fact that they have lots of friends in other villages, and some powerful friends too.

00:23:06.006 --> 00:23:11.496
The analogy is, of course, imperfect, but it’s a useful way of understanding

00:23:11.496 --> 00:23:16.286
the complicated relationship between the UK and the rest of Europe.

00:23:17.386 --> 00:23:23.846
So, to sum things up, what are the defining features of Britain’s relationship with Europe?

00:23:24.756 --> 00:23:26.052
Firstly, geography.

00:23:26.362 --> 00:23:31.232
Being an island makes it easier to do things like close your borders, and

00:23:31.372 --> 00:23:36.582
it also cuts you off from the rest of the continent in a very practical way.

00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:42.472
Secondly, and semi-related to the geographical point, Britain sees

00:23:42.482 --> 00:23:46.962
itself as a very different country to most European countries.

00:23:47.312 --> 00:23:52.862
Its colonial past, the fact that it is the home to the world’s dominant language,

00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:58.532
and that it has many close relationships with non-European countries means that

00:23:58.532 --> 00:24:03.542
it certainly is less European than the major continental European countries.

00:24:04.184 --> 00:24:11.244
Thirdly, a sense of reluctance about foreign rule, and a tradition of breaking with Europe.

00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:17.774
Henry VIII did it, Britain fought against Napoleon, a man with pan-European aims,

00:24:17.854 --> 00:24:23.624
and again against Hitler, a man with at least European and probably global aims.

00:24:24.944 --> 00:24:30.584
Fourth, a real lack of introspection, and a memory loss about

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:35.264
how closely tied to Europe, in many ways, the UK actually is.

00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:41.074
From the arrival of William the Conqueror to fighting alongside European countries

00:24:41.084 --> 00:24:46.904
for much of the UK’s history, Brits simply aren’t very good at remembering this.

00:24:47.784 --> 00:24:51.524
And finally, this reluctance of being part of Europe.

00:24:52.064 --> 00:24:56.524
As when the UK joined the EEC in 1973, there was this

00:24:56.544 --> 00:25:00.444
idea that it didn’t want to join it, but it had to.

00:25:01.014 --> 00:25:04.644
It decided that the benefits of membership outweighed

00:25:04.644 --> 00:25:07.634
the disadvantages, and it took the decision to join.

00:25:08.484 --> 00:25:17.364
The result of all of this was that, on June 23rd, of 2016, 52% of votes in the referendum,

00:25:17.634 --> 00:25:27.864
17,410,742 people, decided that the benefits no longer outweighed the disadvantages, and the

00:25:27.894 --> 00:25:35.194
country voted to leave, to follow in the footsteps of Henry VIII, to reclaim its sovereignty,

00:25:35.424 --> 00:25:41.734
and to forge what it hoped would be a brighter future, yet again removed from Europe.

00:25:42.434 --> 00:25:48.914
And that, the actual campaign for Brexit, and the Brexit vote, is what we’ll cover in part

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:50.524
two of the mini-series.

00:25:50.574 --> 00:25:57.584
There’s an excellent quote from a Stanford professor called Ian Morris that sums up how Britain’s

00:25:57.614 --> 00:26:03.914
relationship with Europe has changed over the years, and this is a fitting way to end this episode.

00:26:04.724 --> 00:26:11.724
Morris writes: "From about 6000 BC through AD 1700, Britain’s big

00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:15.964
challenge was always how to resist domination by the continent.

00:26:16.804 --> 00:26:22.974
From 1700 through 1945, it was how to prevent any single power

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:27.164
from dominating the continent while Britain expanded overseas.

00:26:28.124 --> 00:26:32.634
Since the 1940s, it has been how to walk a fine line

00:26:32.774 --> 00:26:36.384
between the giant economies of North America and Europe.

00:26:37.234 --> 00:26:42.854
As the 21st century goes on, Britain will face a still more complicated task

00:26:43.164 --> 00:26:48.764
as new great economies in China and India gain on the old Western powerhouses.

00:26:49.554 --> 00:26:54.644
Pulling up the drawbridge never has been, and never will be, an option."

00:26:56.934 --> 00:27:01.574
OK then, that is it for part one of this three-part mini-series on

00:27:01.764 --> 00:27:06.474
Brexit, where we covered the history of the UK’s relationship with the EU.

00:27:06.954 --> 00:27:12.754
It is a really fascinating topic, and is very helpful for understanding what comes next,

00:27:12.884 --> 00:27:18.914
and for giving you an insight into some of the factors that influenced the Brexit vote.

00:27:19.814 --> 00:27:23.494
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:27.064
In particular, for the Europeans among you, what other

00:27:27.284 --> 00:27:30.794
important elements of the UK-European relationship are there?

00:27:31.514 --> 00:27:37.924
In your relationships with people from the UK, have you seen some of these characteristics come out?

00:27:38.614 --> 00:27:42.434
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

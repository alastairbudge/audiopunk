Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.889
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.939
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:26.259
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something called The Swedish Model.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.739
This isn’t the story about a beautiful person, but rather how a country has

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.089
managed to go from an agrarian, forestry-based economy to a highly industrialised

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:42.819
nation, held up by many as an example of how to unleash the power of capitalism

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:46.929
while looking after those who might in other countries be left behind.

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:50.689
It is a fascinating story, it’s also a personal one,

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.969
for reasons I will reveal at the end of the episode.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:58.869
So, let’s get right into it, and learn about the Swedish model.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.349
In schools in Britain, we are taught a lot about British history, about

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.569
how “Britannia” came to rule the waves, how a small, rainy country

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.349
came to colonise much of the globe and get filthy rich in the process.

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:22.879
It made sense, or at least it was logical: an industrial revolution,

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.019
great productivity increases, a strong navy, easy access to the Atlantic,

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:32.689
and then a smorgasbord of colonies from which value could be extracted.

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:40.519
Sure, this is a great simplification, but it follows a traditional capitalist path: productivity

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:46.859
improvements, deregulation, acquiring assets, then extracting as much value from them as you can.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.529
In British schools, perhaps unsurprisingly, we never learned much about

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:57.859
Scandinavia, apart from the fact that this was where the Vikings came from.

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.929
The only thing most people tended to know about modern Scandinavia

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.329
at least was that everything seemed to be very expensive

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.569
I can remember stories of people who had gone to Oslo or Stockholm and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.509
returned nursing their wallets after having to fork out €10 for a beer.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.139
These countries had economies that seemed to be doing

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.419
extremely well, where the streets seemed to be paved with gold.

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:33.289
In the case of Norway, the answer as to why was obvious: it has

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.559
huge oil reserves, currently sitting at 1.4 trillion dollars.

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.229
When these were discovered and the oil started to flow, it turned

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:47.539
a country dominated by fishing into one where the return on its

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.919
sovereign wealth fund alone makes the country over $200 billion a year.

00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:00.859
In other words, Norway could stop drilling oil tomorrow and the money it had accumulated would

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.439
still mean it produced hundreds of billions of dollars per year in income for its citizens.

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:11.926
Sweden, on the other hand, was more of an enigma.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:16.826
It did not have the Norwegian advantage of huge oil reserves.

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:21.116
It does not have the sun, sea and climate to attract

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:24.216
tourists in their masses, unlike much of southern Europe.

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:30.126
It is one huge mass of forest and lakes, bordering by

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:34.296
land only Norway to the west and Finland to the east.

00:03:35.556 --> 00:03:39.526
And before industrialisation in the 19th century, the

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:43.866
economy was based mainly on agriculture, forestry and mining.

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:50.646
But fast forward to today, it is a highly developed country with a GDP per

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:57.276
capita of over 60,000 dollars, more than double Spain and almost double Italy.

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:01.866
And it has done this in unconventional ways.

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:09.516
Conventional capitalism and market economics preach to slash taxation to unleash the economy.

00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:13.713
Sweden has one of the highest rates of tax  in the world.

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:19.283
Conventional capitalism and market economics look down on trade

00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:23.793
unions as a tool to increase wages and lower labour productivity.

00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:30.023
Sweden has one of the highest participation rates in trade unions in the world.

00:04:31.553 --> 00:04:37.123
Conventional capitalism advocates for limited government intervention, but the Swedish

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:42.853
state, as a percentage of the total economy, is one of the largest in the world.

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:51.751
As a former Swedish Prime Minister, Göran Persson said, the Swedish economy is like a bumblebee.

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:55.543
“With its overly heavy body and little wings,

00:04:55.983 --> 00:05:00.993
supposedly it should not be able to fly – but it does.”

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:08.063
So, how does it work, what can we learn from this, and what are some of

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:12.273
the forces that are threatening the flight of this Swedish bumblebee?

00:05:13.823 --> 00:05:18.263
Let’s start with some brief history, and also a disclaimer that we are

00:05:18.263 --> 00:05:21.953
trying to talk about an entire country’s economic history in almost

00:05:21.963 --> 00:05:26.643
100 years, so clearly this will be somewhat of a superficial overview.

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:32.501
As you may know, Sweden has a long history of neutrality,

00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:36.041
and the country remained neutral during both world wars.

00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:42.841
Whatever your thoughts on the rights and wrongs of that, economically it was a smart move.

00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:49.931
Wars are expensive, and by remaining neutral not only do you not have to pay for

00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:55.811
an expensive war but you can also make money through selling goods to both sides.

00:05:56.781 --> 00:06:04.151
And that’s exactly what Sweden did, selling iron ore to the Nazis and machine parts to the British.

00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:12.151
By the time the war was over, Sweden was in an excellent position, with no debt while most

00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:18.351
of Europe had to embark on a huge spending spree to rebuild its destroyed towns and cities.

00:06:19.651 --> 00:06:22.671
This allowed Sweden to invest heavily in its welfare

00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:26.841
state, schools, hospitals, social care, and so on.

00:06:28.381 --> 00:06:32.918
But as the Swedish economy grew, Sweden faced a problem.

00:06:33.948 --> 00:06:37.138
It was, and still is, a small country.

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:44.978
The population in 1950 was around 7 million, and it’s only just over 10 million today.

00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:53.744
As the economy grew, and with a finite population, there were more jobs and fewer people to do them.

00:06:54.894 --> 00:07:02.654
And as any economist knows, when demand outstrips supply, the price of a product increases.

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:07.723
In this case, the “product” was workers’ salaries.

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:13.423
Swedish economists feared that workers would have more power to

00:07:13.423 --> 00:07:17.383
negotiate their salaries, leading to wage rises and inflation.

00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:24.553
Now, this doesn’t sound like such a bad thing on the face of it, at least workers being able to

00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:30.273
command higher salaries, but it was the secondary effects that the economists were afraid of.

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:36.623
Highly skilled workers in high-demand jobs would be able to command very high

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:42.003
wages and the lesser skilled workers would be forced to accept lower wages.

00:07:42.843 --> 00:07:46.703
Therefore there would be great wage inequality, with those

00:07:46.703 --> 00:07:50.383
at the top earning many multiples of those at the bottom.

00:07:51.983 --> 00:07:56.503
As you will know, this is the current situation in many Western countries,

00:07:56.873 --> 00:08:01.933
the UK for example, where it would not be unusual even in a small company

00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:07.633
for the boss to earn 5 or 10 times what their lowest paid worker would.

00:08:08.483 --> 00:08:13.373
And when we’re talking about larger companies, the multiples are even higher, with

00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:18.803
some CEOs being paid many hundreds of times what their lowest-paid workers are.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:27.983
This is market economics at work, some say, high skills should command high wages, and if a

00:08:28.003 --> 00:08:34.333
company is prepared to pay a worker hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, millions even, it is

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:41.233
because that person, in theory at least, generates more value for the company than they are paid.

00:08:42.703 --> 00:08:48.703
But the Swedes looked at this and thought, “Uh huh, nope, we’re going to do things differently”.

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:55.113
What they did was implement something called the “solidaristic wage policy”.

00:08:56.183 --> 00:09:00.073
Now, I don’t want to get bogged down in economic jargon

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:04.173
here, but the simple way of explaining it is as follows:

00:09:05.323 --> 00:09:09.323
Imagine a system where the gap between the highest and

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:13.413
lowest wages within companies is deliberately kept small.

00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:20.763
Instead of letting the market alone decide salaries, which can lead to huge income disparities,

00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:27.763
Sweden encouraged companies and unions to agree on wages that are fair and balanced.

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:34.343
This policy aimed to ensure that everyone, from the CEO to the factory

00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:38.313
floor worker, receives a wage that reflects the value of their work

00:09:38.603 --> 00:09:43.743
but also maintains a sense of equality and solidarity among employees.

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:47.833
This doesn’t mean that everyone gets paid the same,

00:09:48.293 --> 00:09:51.603
but rather that the differences in pay are reasonable.

00:09:52.943 --> 00:09:56.903
High-skilled workers still earn more than those in less skilled

00:09:56.903 --> 00:10:01.363
positions, but the gap is not as vast as you might see elsewhere.

00:10:02.813 --> 00:10:07.893
Now, you might be listening to this and thinking “brilliant”, or perhaps the

00:10:07.903 --> 00:10:12.993
red-blooded capitalists among you are listening to this and thinking “what madness”.

00:10:14.273 --> 00:10:17.983
For those in the latter category, let me tell you that

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:21.163
there was also some sound economic logic behind it.

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:28.233
The economic theory behind it was that this would mean that companies in the least productive

00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:35.323
sectors, in lower-value industries, would be forced to become more productive or go out of business.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:44.483
And in more productive, higher-value sectors, wages would actually go down, or at least companies

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:49.223
wouldn’t be forced to increase wages, meaning that the companies would be more profitable

00:10:49.713 --> 00:10:55.353
and would reinvest their profits into growth, as well as pay an increasing amount in tax.

00:10:56.963 --> 00:11:03.413
It would also control inflation, because wages would be predetermined by collective bargaining

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:10.393
agreements between trade unions and businesses, and wage increases would be negotiated centrally.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:17.135
In essence, the solidaristic wage policy was Sweden’s way of saying, 'We

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:20.735
believe in capitalism, it can lead to great prosperity for our citizens,

00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:25.265
but it needs to be tempered with a strong sense of social responsibility.'

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:32.085
Now, this came into place in the mid 20th century, so there are some

00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:35.485
valid question marks over whether exactly the same thing could be done

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:41.325
today, in the global age of hypermobility, but back then, it worked.

00:11:42.585 --> 00:11:47.975
Unproductive companies, as they were forced to pay higher wages, had to improve their productivity

00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:53.065
or were forced to switch to higher-value activities, or else they went out of business.

00:11:54.285 --> 00:11:58.305
Now, I appreciate that this might seem theoretical, but

00:11:58.585 --> 00:12:02.125
let me give you one example that should help clear it up.

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:05.885
For example, farming potatoes.

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:12.985
Potatoes are a cheap vegetable, potato farming might be hard, backbreaking work

00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:18.505
for those involved in it, but in economic terms, it is a low-value industry.

00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:25.115
If an owner of a potato farm is allowed to pay workers low wages to pick potatoes,

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:29.855
they don’t have much of an incentive to modernise and automate the process.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:36.135
But if suddenly the wages they need to pay their workers increase by

00:12:36.365 --> 00:12:40.545
two or three times, they need to find ways to become more productive.

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:47.005
This might be by investing in technology to harvest potatoes more efficiently, perhaps it’s

00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:52.295
by investing in a different type of fertiliser that allows a potato to grow bigger or in

00:12:52.295 --> 00:12:58.315
a more efficient way, or investing in their workers so that their productivity increases.

00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:05.775
Some farm workers might remain, as the potato farm needs some human involvement, but

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:12.155
others lose their jobs and are retrained, for free, to work in more productive industries.

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:16.775
Making cars, producing medicines, developing software, and so on.

00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:25.455
Key to all of this was an effective system that helped people transition from one job to another.

00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:30.345
And it’s here that we need to start talking about trade unions.

00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:37.485
Today, 70% of all Swedish employees belong to a trade union; it is the world’s

00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:42.265
second-highest country in terms of union membership, after Iceland, that is.

00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:48.785
This is down from around 85% in the mid-1990s , but it is

00:13:48.785 --> 00:13:52.245
still incredibly high compared to most developed countries.

00:13:53.035 --> 00:14:02.171
In Italy it’s around 32%, in the UK it’s 22%, and in the United States, it is a mere 10%.

00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:09.985
Now, the role of the Swedish trade union is slightly different to in other countries.

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:17.675
While in many countries, for example in the UK, the role of the trade union is to protect the

00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:25.345
job at all costs, to reject any job cuts and push for salary increases, in Sweden the role

00:14:25.345 --> 00:14:31.395
of the union is more to protect the individual doing the job, rather than the job itself.

00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:38.705
The job might change, it might be removed due to a changing business environment or because

00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:45.125
of automation, but as long as the individual worker is protected, it almost doesn’t matter.

00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:51.105
This is one of the reasons that the trade unions generally enjoy

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:55.535
very strong support in Sweden, both from workers and businesses.

00:14:56.865 --> 00:15:03.185
Workers pay a fee to be part of a union, but they are treated very well, and afforded

00:15:03.215 --> 00:15:08.265
all sorts of protections while they have their job, and help if they lose it.

00:15:09.745 --> 00:15:16.285
Now, as well as the unions, Sweden also has a very generous welfare state, with the idea

00:15:16.285 --> 00:15:22.285
that the basic needs of citizens in Sweden should be provided at a high quality by the state.

00:15:23.285 --> 00:15:28.785
From healthcare to childcare, education to pensions, the Swedish state provides

00:15:28.785 --> 00:15:33.955
this either free of charge or at a significantly reduced rate to its citizens.

00:15:35.645 --> 00:15:41.145
Clearly, this is expensive, and to do this, Swedes have paid

00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:44.899
and still pay some of the highest tax rates in the world.

00:15:46.229 --> 00:15:52.579
In the 1980s, the marginal tax rate for the highest earners got to 85%.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:00.200
Now the amount is lower, but when you consider the 31% contribution that an employer makes

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:08.690
to social security, the top rate that a Swede pays is a marginal tax of around 63%, and if

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:15.292
that person is a business owner also charging VAT to Swedish consumers, it can reach 71%.

00:16:16.111 --> 00:16:23.029
It is a lot, and what might be surprising is that even Swedish earners on the lower end of the scale

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:32.019
pay relatively high taxes, with the average person in Sweden paying 42.5% of their income in taxes.

00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:41.239
And studies show that Swedes, obviously with some exceptions, are pretty happy to pay high taxes.

00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:46.419
They receive a lot in return, free childcare, school, university,

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:51.109
healthcare, a good pension, and there are very low levels of corruption.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:58.219
The implicit contract in The Swedish Model is that the state provides for you until you

00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:03.139
are of working age, caring for you at every step of the way, so that you are a highly

00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:08.649
skilled worker and able to find a high-skilled job, you pay a lot of taxes for the

00:17:08.649 --> 00:17:13.819
duration of your working life, and when you retire, the state will also look after you.

00:17:15.389 --> 00:17:20.379
Of course, this in itself is not unique to Sweden, it’s how tax in

00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:25.509
practically every country works, but the level of taxation in Sweden, as

00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:30.499
well as the perceived value that derives from it, makes it somewhat unique.

00:17:32.045 --> 00:17:35.845
And to date, the system seems to have worked.

00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:42.785
But it is a delicate balance, and in the 21st century, the Swedish Model has

00:17:42.785 --> 00:17:48.375
been facing some major challenges coming from both external and internal forces.

00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:56.615
Firstly, as a response to the refugee crisis, Sweden decided to open its doors, and in

00:17:56.615 --> 00:18:04.925
2015 the country welcomed 162,000 migrants, mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:18:06.265 --> 00:18:11.105
Sweden was a rich and developed country, and the government decided

00:18:11.105 --> 00:18:15.665
to pull its weight and accept refugees from war-torn countries.

00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:23.005
It was in many ways a commendable decision, but the small country now had

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:27.665
the challenge not only of how to integrate these refugees into society,

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:32.795
but how to do so in a way that was consistent with the Swedish model.

00:18:34.254 --> 00:18:37.084
Now, we are going to keep the discussion here to the

00:18:37.174 --> 00:18:40.684
economic side of things rather than the social and cultural.

00:18:41.474 --> 00:18:44.674
The two elements are of course closely linked, but

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:48.674
the former is black and white and the latter less so.

00:18:49.884 --> 00:18:54.244
Remember, the Swedish Model, its welfare system and high taxes,

00:18:54.584 --> 00:18:58.884
is based on high-skilled labour, normally two working parents.

00:19:00.444 --> 00:19:05.004
Refugees fleeing from war-torn countries, of course with many exceptions,

00:19:05.514 --> 00:19:09.384
had lower levels of education and skills than the average Swede.

00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:15.994
To be precise, half of the recent refugee intake in Sweden had no

00:19:16.014 --> 00:19:20.734
secondary education, so they simply didn’t have the skills to slot

00:19:20.804 --> 00:19:24.734
nicely into the kind of jobs encouraged by the Swedish model.”.

00:19:25.923 --> 00:19:28.723
What this has meant is that there are very high levels

00:19:28.723 --> 00:19:31.773
of unemployment among the Swedish refugee population.

00:19:33.303 --> 00:19:40.363
For recent migrants, the unemployment rate is 44% for men and 70% for women

00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:48.663
And given that there is no minimum wage, low-skilled workers often find themselves pushed

00:19:48.713 --> 00:19:53.733
towards temporary or unstable employment in companies that are not part of a union,

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:59.073
meaning that they don’t enjoy the same rights and protections as the majority of workers.

00:20:00.903 --> 00:20:06.083
What's more, with recent migrants often concentrated in areas of the cities with other

00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:13.583
migrants, and limited opportunities to speak Swedish and integrate into Swedish society, many

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:21.223
understandably feel ostracised, shut out by regular Swedes, leading to discontent and resentment,

00:20:21.623 --> 00:20:27.163
both from the refugee population towards the indigenous Swedish population, and vice versa.

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:33.623
Now, there are all sorts of programmes to upskill recent immigrants and help them develop

00:20:33.643 --> 00:20:39.263
the capabilities required to get high-skilled, well-paid jobs, as well as to help them learn

00:20:39.263 --> 00:20:45.629
Swedish, but there is a long way to go, and hundreds of thousands of people to upskill.

00:20:47.023 --> 00:20:52.403
As you may know, after it became clear that other EU countries were not prepared to share the

00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:58.753
burden and accept as many refugees as Sweden, the country seriously tightened its immigration laws

00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:05.353
. 
The number of refugee arrivals has plummeted, but there is still the question

00:21:05.523 --> 00:21:11.323
of how to integrate the remaining almost 300,000 refugees into Swedish society,

00:21:11.963 --> 00:21:17.033
and in economic terms, how to make the Swedish model work under the pressure.

00:21:18.563 --> 00:21:24.013
These are people who need access to the same public services and welfare as any normal Swede

00:21:24.413 --> 00:21:29.933
but are not able to find a job that allows them to pay back into the system through taxes.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:37.373
On a political level, this has led to changes in Sweden, with the right-wing anti-immigration

00:21:37.543 --> 00:21:45.623
Swedish Democrats winning 20% of the vote in the 2022 election, up from 5.7% in 2010.

00:21:47.393 --> 00:21:50.943
Now, moving onto some external threats to the Swedish

00:21:50.963 --> 00:21:55.003
model, the first to mention comes from Brussels.

00:21:56.643 --> 00:22:01.863
As you may know, there are plans to create an EU-wide minimum wage.

00:22:02.953 --> 00:22:05.623
Now, why would this be a threat to the Swedish Model?

00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:11.743
Well, because wages are currently set between the trade unions and businesses.

00:22:13.013 --> 00:22:20.293
If these become set on a government level, a major role of the unions would be removed, and it could

00:22:20.293 --> 00:22:25.363
lead to businesses saying, "well, for low-skilled work we are going to pay the government-mandated

00:22:25.363 --> 00:22:31.503
minimum wage, rather than a higher wage that had been fought for tooth and nail by the unions."

00:22:33.013 --> 00:22:36.883
In other words, an EU directive on minimum wage could lead

00:22:36.883 --> 00:22:40.973
to lower-skilled Swedish workers earning less, not more.

00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:48.629
And on the other end of the scale, the increasingly globalised nature of work means that offering

00:22:48.629 --> 00:22:55.529
a relatively low wage for high-skilled work often no longer cuts the mustard, it isn’t good enough.

00:22:56.899 --> 00:23:01.269
To give you an example, a highly-skilled software developer at the top of

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:07.719
their game might earn €100,000 working for a Swedish company, but that person

00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:12.689
could easily double or triple that salary by working for an American company.

00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:20.669
In the 20th century, the model worked fine, but in a globalised world of remote work

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:26.199
and global possibilities, hanging on to the most in demand workers is a challenge.

00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:33.629
What’s more, union membership is high but it is reducing, and many high profile

00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:38.349
companies are either rejecting unions outright or pushing back against them.

00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:44.299
You might have heard about Elon Musk’s battle with the Swedish unions, which as

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:48.659
of the time of recording this episode, has been going on for almost four months.

00:23:50.129 --> 00:23:52.189
And it’s not just Elon Musk and Tesla.

00:23:52.769 --> 00:23:59.199
Both Spotify and the payments giant Klarna have also been in the news because of their battles with

00:23:59.199 --> 00:24:05.539
unions, and their preference to deal directly with their employees rather than via a trade union.

00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:10.379
But perhaps the greatest threat to the Swedish model is

00:24:10.409 --> 00:24:13.949
from within, from Swedish politicians and policymakers.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:19.239
There has been an increasing privatisation of state services, increased union

00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:24.639
fees, a removal of tax credits for union membership, and the implementation

00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:28.839
of measures that removed the conditions under which workers could strike.

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:32.609
So what comes next for the Swedish model?

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:36.809
Will the bumblebee keep on flying, or will it need some

00:24:36.819 --> 00:24:40.579
structural changes to stay in the air in a globalised world?

00:24:41.699 --> 00:24:47.479
Who knows, but one thing is for sure, Sweden has defied gravity for the

00:24:47.479 --> 00:24:52.659
past 50 years, and it would take a brave person to bet against it today.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:57.719
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Swedish Model.

00:24:58.139 --> 00:25:03.119
I know it was quite a long one, but I hope it was interesting, and that you've learnt something new.

00:25:03.849 --> 00:25:06.919
Now, I told you at the start of this episode that there was a

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:10.729
personal element to this story, and I’ll tell you what that is now.

00:25:11.449 --> 00:25:17.149
My wife was offered a job in Sweden, and we are actually moving to Sweden imminently.

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:23.719
This episode is going to be released on March 5th, so in fact we will have got

00:25:23.729 --> 00:25:28.199
to Sweden approximately 45 minutes before this episode is publicly available.

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:31.469
I’ll be sure to keep you updated with my thoughts on

00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:34.459
Sweden and The Swedish Model as we all get settled in.

00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:40.559
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:46.267
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

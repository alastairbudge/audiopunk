Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:16.201
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:20.071
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:25.671
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Dark Ages.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:31.351
It’s a period of history that, according to some, was dark, gloomy, and

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:37.191
characterised by a lack of human progress, a time between the fall of Rome

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.951
and the start of the Renaissance when human progress ground to a halt.

00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:46.966
But, as we’ll see, this is quite far from the truth, and

00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:51.086
calling this period “The Dark Ages” is highly problematic.

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:57.136
So, in this episode, we’ll look at why this period was given this name, by

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:02.736
who, what this tells us, and find out whether it really was “dark” at all.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:08.316
OK then, How Dark Were The Dark Ages?

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:13.826
When you hear the term “Dark Ages”, what do you think about?

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:19.826
In English today it’s often used as a negative term to describe something.

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.916
You can say that something is like going back to the

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:27.296
Dark Ages, meaning that it’s a reversal of progress.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:32.406
Or you can say that someone is living in the “Dark Ages”, meaning that

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:36.846
they are failing to keep up with the times, to accept modern technology.

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:44.886
They are both negative terms, going back to, or living in the “Dark Ages” is hardly a compliment.

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:49.496
So, when it comes to an entire period of history that

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.546
is called “The Dark Ages”, what does this actually mean?

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:57.416
Well, let’s start with a reminder of what period we’re actually

00:01:57.456 --> 00:02:01.316
talking about, who first called it this, and for what reasons.

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:04.076
So, when did it start?

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:11.766
The period called The Dark Ages is believed to have started in the late 5th century, after the fall

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:19.546
of the Roman Empire, and continued for a period of about 900 years, right up to the 14th century.

00:02:20.846 --> 00:02:26.566
The idea of darkness being associated with a period of history first started to come

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:32.386
to prominence with the Italian, Francesco Petrarca, known in English as Petrarch.

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:41.726
In 1343 he wrote, and I’m quoting directly, "for you, if you should long outlive me…there

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:47.506
is perhaps a better age in store; this slumber of forgetfulness will not last for ever.

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:52.236
After the darkness has been dispelled, our grandsons will

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:56.556
be able to walk back into the pure radiance of the past".

00:02:57.946 --> 00:03:01.346
For Petrarch, he was still living in The Dark Ages.

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:07.182
He looked back on the achievements of Classical Rome and Greece, compared

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:12.532
it to the world he lived in, and the world that had existed since then.

00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:19.092
According to Petrarch, the achievements of civilisations that had come after the fall

00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:26.032
of the Roman empire paled in comparison, they were worse, less commendable societies.

00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:30.122
The ancient Greeks and Romans had produced great

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:33.852
philosophers, poets, great empires, wonderful cities.

00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:38.962
They had left behind them great texts documenting their history and culture.

00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:42.518
And what had everyone left since then?

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.632
Not much at all, in Petrarch's opinion at least, it was nothing in comparison.

00:03:50.212 --> 00:03:55.652
Five hundred years later a British Victorian historian, Henry Thomas

00:03:55.652 --> 00:04:00.092
Buckle, would build on this idea, and become the first person to

00:04:00.092 --> 00:04:04.182
use the term “The Dark Ages” to describe this period of history.

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:10.962
In his 1857 book, called History of Civilization in England,

00:04:11.462 --> 00:04:16.802
he wrote “In the Dark Ages, men were credulous and ignorant”.

00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:23.812
Credulous here means believing things without questioning, and it’s in

00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:28.077
particular reference to religious beliefs, of believing something because

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:33.587
you are told it is true, rather than examining it to verify for yourself.

00:04:34.997 --> 00:04:42.057
And this term that he coined, “The Dark Ages”, is one that is still in use today to describe

00:04:42.057 --> 00:04:48.667
this extended period of history, which starts at around the year 500 and goes through

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:56.267
to, by some estimates the year 1400 or even 1500, a thousand years of European history.

00:04:57.487 --> 00:05:02.957
Even Carl Sagan, the famous American astronomer, referred to it as a

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:08.517
“millennium gap … a poignant lost opportunity for the human species”.

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:15.127
An entire thousand years wasted, of human beings merely treading

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:20.287
water, making zero progress, a millennium of standing still.

00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:23.807
These are some bold claims, right?

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:28.027
So, why were these people referring to this period of history

00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:32.699
in such a derogatory way, and is there any truth to it?

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:37.829
To answer these questions, let’s first remind ourselves of

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:40.859
exactly why this period of history was thought to be “dark”.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.539
There are two main reasons, and two related meanings of “dark”.

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:51.969
Firstly, the “dark” refers to the lack of knowledge that

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.649
we have about what actually happened in this period.

00:05:55.579 --> 00:06:01.559
The ages are “dark” because we don’t know what happened, or at least our understanding isn’t as

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:08.239
deep and developed, as it is for earlier periods of history, such as Classical Rome or Greece.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:15.349
The Romans and Greeks left behind great works of poetry, philosophy, and theatre.

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.499
We know quite a lot about life in ancient Rome and Greece

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.899
precisely because of what was written down, what was left behind.

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.469
The Dark Ages, so the argument goes, are dark because we simply

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.819
know less about them as there is less literature left behind.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:42.049
Secondly, the “dark” refers to an intellectual and cultural dark period, a period

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:48.229
where people deferred to religion and superstition for their truth rather than reason.

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.649
It’s this “darkness” that the English Victorian historian

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.839
Buckle referred to when he wrote about men being “ignorant”.

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:03.039
And of course the two are closely linked - a society that places value

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.369
on knowledge, one like that of ancient Rome or Greece, understands

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:11.139
the value of recording and documenting history and literature.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:17.859
On the other hand, a society that doesn’t place a value on knowledge doesn’t record history or

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:23.959
create literature to the same degree, therefore there isn’t so much to “lose” in the first place.

00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:29.875
So, let’s dig a little deeper and see how much truth there actually is to these

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:34.495
claims, whether these thousand years were as dark as they were accused of being.

00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:41.525
As to our first definition of dark, of a lack of information about what happened

00:07:41.535 --> 00:07:45.815
in the period after the fall of the Roman empire, there is certainly some

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:50.405
truth that we know less about this period, at least in most of western Europe,

00:07:50.835 --> 00:07:55.045
than any time since the Romans arrived in Britain, in the 1st Century AD.

00:07:56.255 --> 00:08:02.266
In Britain this is particularly true before the arrival of William the Conqueror, in 1066.

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:07.875
This, incidentally, is when historians such as Buckle would have

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:13.281
defined the Dark Ages as ending, and British “modern” history starting.

00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:21.241
Indeed, the numbering system of Kings of England started in 1066, with William I.

00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:26.731
It’s almost as if British history ignored the presence of any king that came before him.

00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:34.021
For example, the first King Edward, King Edward I of England, was crowned in

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:40.111
1272, but there were three Kings of England called Edward that came before him.

00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:47.011
They just ruled before 1066, in the so-called "Dark Ages”, and therefore don’t count.

00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:52.941
Getting back to our story, or our question, of whether it’s fair to say that we don’t know

00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:58.461
much about what happened during The Dark Ages, there are plenty of 20th and 21st-century

00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:04.511
historians who completely refute this idea, they say it's rubbish, it simply isn’t true.

00:09:05.351 --> 00:09:09.901
Instead, they say, there is a vast amount of information that we have from this

00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:14.771
period, western European societies weren’t just living in some kind of dark

00:09:14.811 --> 00:09:19.941
cloud where nobody wrote anything down or created anything of cultural value, and

00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:24.811
everyone spent their days not doing much more than working the fields and drinking.

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:31.771
Compared to the ancient Romans and Greeks, yes there might have been less written history,

00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:38.461
less poetry, fewer great buildings, and less information left behind for historians to consult.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:44.721
There were, in fact, plenty of sizable literary achievements in this period,

00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:49.704
some of which we’ll discuss shortly, and most modern historians would argue that

00:09:49.704 --> 00:09:55.481
labelling this entire period as “dark” is a great simplification of reality.

00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:01.411
First of all, putting the entire 1,000-year period into the

00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:05.881
same category and saying it was all “dark” isn’t helpful at all.

00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:10.851
The period directly after the fall of the Roman empire was

00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.841
very different from the period in which Petrarch was living.

00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:18.401
When the Roman empire fell, much of the stability and order

00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:22.031
that had existed in Western Europe for centuries disappeared.

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:29.461
The collapse of Rome created a power vacuum, and smaller tribes fought for regional power.

00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:34.171
And of course, when you are fighting for power, and fighting for your

00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:38.891
own survival, this leaves less time and mental bandwidth for cultural

00:10:38.891 --> 00:10:44.321
activities, writing poems, plays, creating art and building great buildings.

00:10:45.221 --> 00:10:52.801
To call this period directly after the fall of the Roman empire “dark” might be semi-justified,

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:57.851
at least from the point of view of there not being as many great additions to cultural history.

00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:03.601
But fast-forward a few hundred years and it is hard to say the

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.971
same thing about the world that Petrarch lived in, for example.

00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:15.371
Petrarch was born in 1304, just four years before Dante started writing his seminal work, The Divine

00:11:15.371 --> 00:11:21.871
Comedy, a poem that is to this very day the most important work of poetry in the Italian language.

00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:27.921
And later on that century, in northern Europe, Geoffrey Chaucer was writing

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:31.891
one of the most important works in English literature, The Canterbury Tales.

00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:35.621
Hardly “dark” from a cultural point of view.

00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:40.061
What’s more, some of the first universities in Europe had

00:11:40.061 --> 00:11:43.051
been founded several centuries before Petrarch’s comments.

00:11:43.991 --> 00:11:49.011
The University of Bologna was founded in 1088, The Sorbonne in Paris

00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:55.301
was founded in 1150, and the University of Oxford was founded in 1167.

00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:58.401
It’s hard to argue that the founders of these

00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:01.781
world-famous universities were living in the “Dark Ages”.

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.921
But by Petrarch’s definition, they were.

00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:09.187
So, what else was happening in “The Dark Ages”?

00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:14.277
Well, it’s a 1,000 or so year period, so we will have to be very selective here.

00:12:15.077 --> 00:12:20.897
Of course, there was plenty of uncivilised activity, fighting, and bloodshed, the sort of

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:27.837
activities that are associated with classical definitions or stereotypes of “The Dark Ages”.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:33.307
The Vikings don’t exactly come top of many lists of the “world’s most cultured

00:12:33.307 --> 00:12:38.967
societies”, and the reality that European literacy rates were typically in the single

00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:43.647
digits meant that people simply weren’t able to write great works of literature.

00:12:44.717 --> 00:12:50.617
But, when you compare this to Petrarch’s example of a civilisation to admire, Ancient

00:12:50.617 --> 00:12:56.597
Rome, there are, of course, plenty of Ancient Roman examples of not-so-civilised behaviour.

00:12:57.787 --> 00:13:02.817
They might have built beautiful buildings that stand to this very day, but if the

00:13:02.817 --> 00:13:08.017
purpose of these buildings was to watch men fight each other to the death or be

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:13.287
torn apart by lions, it wouldn’t meet many modern definitions of high civilisation.

00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:19.887
So, to go back to what actually happened in the so-called “Dark Ages”, there was a

00:13:19.897 --> 00:13:24.577
lot that was far more civilised than the so-called shining lights of Ancient Rome.

00:13:25.477 --> 00:13:30.137
There was the rise of the papacy, of the pope, and the great monastic orders.

00:13:30.937 --> 00:13:34.837
King Charles of the Franks became Charlemagne, the Holy Roman

00:13:34.837 --> 00:13:38.627
Emperor, uniting Western and Eastern Europe under one ruler.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.360
Trade networks continued to develop.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:48.170
Although transportation was long and arduous, there is evidence of European trade that

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.810
goes against the narrative of people simply living in isolated villages, surviving

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:58.130
off subsistence farming and trying to avoid being killed by neighbouring tribes.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.570
From a technological point of view, there were several significant

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.630
agricultural inventions, mainly around improved ploughing.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:14.530
Sure, this might not sound so impressive nowadays, but figuring out how to generate

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.990
food more efficiently is clearly a pretty useful technological development.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.490
It’s clear that there was not “nothing” going on, even in the

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.090
Eurocentric worlds that Petrarch and Buckle were referring to.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.470
And, perhaps most importantly, outside Europe, this

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.160
period was far from dark, it was very bright indeed.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.480
The Middle East experienced a blossoming of scientific, mathematical and economic development.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:51.430
Baghdad was founded in 762, and swiftly became a trade and cultural centre for the Arab world.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.480
Further East, there was no such “Dark” period in China, with some of the most

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:02.330
impressive dynasties overseeing the country during these supposed “Dark Ages”.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.360
Clearly, outside Europe, in many other areas of the world

00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:11.190
civilisation was moving forward at a breakneck speed.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.300
But, as non-Europeans will be all too familiar with,

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.030
Europeans are not always very good at looking outside Europe.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.270
In the time of Petrarch, in the 1300s, perhaps we can forgive them

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.860
slightly, as knowledge of what lay outside Europe was more limited.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:39.750
But fast forward to the Victorian era, to Henry Thomas Buckle in 1857 and his

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.880
coining of the term “The Dark Ages”, and it’s hard to be particularly forgiving.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:51.750
Indeed, most modern historians have pretty much cast the term aside, agreeing

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.830
that describing this period of history, even if we limit it to European history,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:03.620
or even Western European history, describing it as “dark”, uncultured and lacking

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:09.360
in development, simply isn’t true, and probably tells us more about the people

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.350
describing it as “dark” than the people being described as living in The Dark Ages.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:22.020
Labelling a thousand-year period as “dark”, a period where men were credulous and ignorant,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:29.780
where progress stood still, life was harsh and culture non-existent is, in fact, about as

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:35.750
ignorant a comment as someone could make, and reveals the sense of superiority that a man

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:41.367
like Buckle, and perhaps to a lesser extent Petrarch, felt about the worlds they lived in.

00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:48.544
So, to answer the question we posed at the start of the episode, or even the title of this episode,

00:16:49.094 --> 00:16:56.654
“How Dark Were The Dark Ages?”, the much simplified answer is most probably “not very dark at all”.

00:16:58.944 --> 00:17:03.874
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Dark Ages,

00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:07.584
or rather, the Early Middle Ages as we should call them.

00:17:08.124 --> 00:17:11.874
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that if you previously thought that

00:17:11.894 --> 00:17:16.664
this period of history was characterised by a lack of progress, of stagnation

00:17:16.674 --> 00:17:21.374
of civilisation, well, I hope you’ll now know that this was not really the case.

00:17:21.854 --> 00:17:26.334
Perhaps it will even inspire you to find out about some of the marvellous things that

00:17:26.354 --> 00:17:31.264
did go on during this period, things we didn’t have the time to properly get into today.

00:17:32.254 --> 00:17:36.064
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:39.754
How is the history of The Dark Ages taught in your country?

00:17:40.104 --> 00:17:43.074
And is the period still called The Dark Ages?

00:17:43.644 --> 00:17:46.674
What do you think this term tells us more about…the

00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:49.804
people it refers to, or the people who coined it?

00:17:50.464 --> 00:17:53.594
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:17.261
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:21.781
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:28.491
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Giuseppe Garibaldi, the

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:35.061
guerilla fighter and revolutionary hero who played a vital part in the unification of Italy.

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:41.961
We’ll learn about his wild journey, which took him from Nice to South America, Italy,

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:48.921
Austria, Asia, the UK, almost to the United States, and of course, ending in a united Italy.

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:54.281
The tale of Italian independence is long and complex,

00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:58.931
and this is by no means going to be a conclusive account.

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:04.281
But it will give you an overview of the man at the forefront

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.881
of it all, Garibaldi, the romantic, revolutionary hero.

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:14.741
It is quite the story, and today’s episode is a little longer

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.201
than normal, so without further ado, let’s get started.

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:26.531
His name, in Italian, is Giuseppe Garibaldi, but this is a podcast

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:31.031
in English, so I will use the English pronunciation, Garibaldi.

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:35.301
For the Italians listening, I hope you’ll excuse me.

00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:40.081
It’s hard to exaggerate the importance of Garibaldi in Italy.

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:46.661
In almost every Italian town you’ll find roads and squares named after him.

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:48.231
After

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:54.791
Roma, Rome, Garibaldi is the second most popular name for a street or square in Italy.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.051
Every Italian learns about him in school, and there are

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.091
few that consider him to be anything other than a hero.

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:07.231
And it’s not just in Italy.

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:13.281
He was hugely popular in the UK too - we even have a biscuit named after him.

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.161
Don’t worry, we’ll tell that story shortly.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:21.121
Garibaldi was born in 1802 in Nice.

00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:28.174
His parents were Ligurian, from the region just to the east of Nice which is now part of Italy.

00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:34.424
And to remind you, in 1802, when Garibaldi was born, there was no

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:38.694
Italy, and there had never been a unified country called Italy.

00:02:39.484 --> 00:02:44.674
It was a collection of different states, all ruled by different kingdoms,

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:50.114
with parts of modern day Italy being under the control of foreign powers.

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:57.224
The Austrian Empire lurked to the north and east of modern day Italy, and places like

00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:03.474
Lombardy, Venice and Trieste were all part of the Austrian empire, ruled by the Habsburgs.

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:08.534
The north western part of Italy contained the Kingdom of

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:13.004
Sardinia, which will go on to play an important part in our story.

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:20.364
The central part, around Rome, was controlled by the Vatican, it was called the Papal States.

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:25.384
And below that was the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily,

00:03:25.544 --> 00:03:32.644
which officially united in 1815 to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:36.274
We’ve skipped over a few, but these are the ones that will

00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:39.964
play the most important part in the story of Garibaldi.

00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:46.514
The important thing to remember is that these were independent kingdoms, and the

00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:52.664
probability that they would all come together and form one country was very unlikely.

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:59.524
Nice, when Garibaldi was born, was part of the French empire, and of course now,

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:05.274
Nice is part of France, although it's only 40 kilometers from the Italian border.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.019
Garibaldi’s father was a sea captain, and Garibaldi spent many of his early years at sea.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.459
When he was in his late 20s he met another Giuseppe, Giuseppe

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:22.759
Mazzini, who was an early proponent of Italian unification.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:31.299
Garibaldi joined a society called Young Italy, and swore an oath to unify Italy,

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.439
which was to be a goal he would spend the next 30 years of his life pursuing.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.979
It almost came to a sudden end though, as in 1834, a year after joining Young Italy,

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.269
he played a part in an attempted coup in Piedmont against the kingdom’s rulers.

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:58.339
The coup failed, Garibaldi managed to flee over the border to France, but he was

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:04.729
sentenced to death in absentia, meaning if he was captured he would be executed.

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:09.679
After fleeing to France, he then sailed all the way

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:13.649
to South America, where he spent the next 12 years.

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:20.339
He became involved in liberation movements in Brazil and Uruguay, where

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.869
he honed his military skills and developed a reputation not only as a

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:30.989
formidable military commander, but as an expert in guerilla warfare.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:39.539
His reputation led him to command the Uruguayan navy in the war against Argentina in 1842,

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:46.299
and then a year later he was put in charge of a new Italian unit, the Italian Legion.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.859
This legion, nicknamed the Redshirts, because they were always

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.039
dressed in red, comprised of Italians who were living in Uruguay.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:04.159
Red was to be a colour forever associated with Garibaldi - if you see a painting of a man in a red

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:11.519
shirt and a beard, with a sword and an Italian flag, it is almost certainly Giuseppe Garibaldi.

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.099
Although he had a new life in South America, the fate of his homeland

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.269
never left his thoughts, and he was given renewed hope in the unification

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:27.689
of Italy after the election of a new, pro-reform pope, pope Pius IX.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.859
Garibaldi wrote to the pope, offering his services,

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.619
proposing to come back to Italy to help unite the country.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.799
But the pope didn’t take up his offer.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:46.619
Nevertheless, Garibaldi was encouraged by an increasing amount of revolutionary activity around

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:55.389
Italy, and decided to come home, returning with 60 men from his Italian Legion in April 1848.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.839
Garibaldi and his men were skilled soldiers, but more than that they

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:07.139
were adept in guerilla warfare, tactics they had honed in South America.

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:14.099
At the time that Garibaldi returned, the first Italian War of Independence was going on.

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:21.049
This was led by Charles Albert, the King of Sardinia, which was a kingdom of Italy

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:26.709
that ruled Sardinia, of course, but also Piedmont, the region in North West Italy.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:32.869
Garibaldi offered his services also to King Charles, but he was rejected.

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:39.529
He was viewed as an outsider, a guerilla leader who didn’t play by the rules,

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:44.539
and reportedly wasn’t initially liked by the soldiers of the regular army.

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:51.359
They also hadn’t forgotten the fact that he had tried to lead an uprising 5 years before.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.529
Garibaldi wasn’t one to give up though.

00:07:55.159 --> 00:08:00.379
He headed first to Milan, where he offered his help to the government of Milan

00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:05.469
in the fight against the Austrians, and he won a couple of early victories.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.009
But these victories tended to be short-lived.

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:15.309
Not only were the rebel forces split across multiple different groups, but they

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:20.239
were fighting against the powerful forces of the French and the Austrian empire.

00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:25.964
And of course, not everyone wanted a united Italy, and there

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:29.389
were very few people who believed it was actually possible.

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:32.519
This didn’t deter Garibaldi though.

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:38.239
After a loss in Piedmont, he took his troops to Rome, and proposed that

00:08:38.249 --> 00:08:43.709
Rome should become an independent republic, independent of the Papal States.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:51.427
The French didn’t like the idea of an independent republic of Rome, nor did the King of Naples.

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:58.776
Garibaldi found himself defending Rome against the French and the Neapolitans.

00:08:59.336 --> 00:09:06.336
Despite some heroic fighting, his men stood no chance, and he was forced to flee, heading north.

00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:11.796
He was pursued by French, Neapolitan, Austrian and

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:16.076
Spanish troops, who were all anti-Italian unification.

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:22.546
Miraculously he managed to evade capture, and arrived in San

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:26.756
Marino, the mountainous microstate in north-central Italy.

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:34.956
This was in July of 1849, just a year after Garibaldi had returned from South America.

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:40.946
Although the experience of the past year had given him hope of what might

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:46.716
be achieved, actually achieving it seemed to be a near impossible task.

00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:52.956
The revolutionary forces were hugely outnumbered, and there were some very

00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:58.006
powerful, vested interests in keeping the system of individual kingdoms.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:05.316
The rulers of the kingdoms, for one, were not keen on a united, republican Italy.

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.926
This would mean all their power would be gone, so

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:12.186
naturally they would do everything they could to stop it.

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:21.876
Given all of this, he decided to disband his men, to let his army go, and consider his options.

00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:28.176
He couldn’t return to his homeland of Piedmont; he was still wanted there.

00:10:28.906 --> 00:10:36.644
So he went away on his second exile, first to Tangier in Morocco, where he met a rich Italian

00:10:36.644 --> 00:10:44.074
merchant who suggested that Garibaldi command a merchant ship, that Garibaldi become a sailor again.

00:10:45.474 --> 00:10:52.014
With his revolutionary options exhausted, Garibaldi accepted, and first sailed to New

00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:58.654
York, then to Central America, Peru, crossing the Pacific and going to the Philippines

00:10:58.714 --> 00:11:05.104
and then eastern China, then back to South America, stopping off in Chile, passing

00:11:05.104 --> 00:11:10.734
through New York and then returning to Newcastle, on the north east coast of England.

00:11:11.884 --> 00:11:16.794
Garibaldi’s reputation by this time had spread throughout Europe, and

00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:21.764
he was viewed as a visionary, guerilla fighter, and revolutionary hero.

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:28.674
He had displayed exceptional bravery and leadership, and was a symbol of rebellion.

00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:35.784
When he got to Newcastle, much to his surprise, he was given a hero’s welcome.

00:11:37.004 --> 00:11:44.164
There was a campaign to buy him a gift when he arrived, and they raised enough money to not only

00:11:44.174 --> 00:11:51.214
buy him a gold sword, but to have a pile left over that was donated to Italian Independence.

00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:57.874
They raised £30,000 which would be the equivalent of around £2

00:11:57.894 --> 00:12:02.604
million in today’s money, which all went towards Italian unification.

00:12:03.904 --> 00:12:08.854
When he got off his ship he was completely mobbed, and he was given the

00:12:09.074 --> 00:12:14.284
reception of a celebrity for the duration of his 3 week visit in Newcastle.

00:12:15.574 --> 00:12:19.994
He’s still remembered as the most famous Italian to have ever visited

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:24.529
the north east of England, and if you go to Newcastle now there

00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:29.504
there is a plaque, a blue sign commemorating, a place that he stayed.

00:12:31.004 --> 00:12:35.424
He returned to Italy in 1854, and bought part of a

00:12:35.424 --> 00:12:38.814
small island to the north of Sardinia, called Caprera.

00:12:40.334 --> 00:12:45.384
Garibaldi wasn’t a rich man by any means, but he had been given an

00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:49.994
inheritance by his brother, and was able to buy a part of the island.

00:12:51.054 --> 00:12:54.924
He stayed there for 5 years or so, living a simple life,

00:12:55.234 --> 00:12:58.664
no doubt contemplating his next revolutionary moves.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:05.984
In 1854 he was only 46, so he still had a lot of time left for revolution.

00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:13.444
1859 saw the start of the second Italian War of Independence, and this

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:18.724
time Garibaldi was finally called upon by Cavour, the prime minister

00:13:19.074 --> 00:13:23.294
of Piedmont-Sardinia, to prepare for war against the Austrians.

00:13:24.964 --> 00:13:30.334
Garibaldi led the Sardinian forces to victory against the Austrians, but as part of the

00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:37.554
armistice, it was agreed that Garibaldi’s hometown of Nice would be given back to the French.

00:13:38.744 --> 00:13:43.954
The French had been fighting alongside the Piedmont-Sardinian forces, and it

00:13:43.954 --> 00:13:49.064
was agreed that Nice should be given to them as a reward for their assistance.

00:13:50.494 --> 00:13:54.744
This incensed Garibaldi; it made him incredibly angry, and

00:13:54.794 --> 00:13:58.044
he attacked Cavour while he was speaking in parliament.

00:13:59.324 --> 00:14:04.584
But everything Garibaldi had done up to this point, all of the heroic

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:09.154
activity and guerilla fighting, was just a prelude to what was coming next.

00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:16.874
There had been uprisings in Sicily against the Bourbon rulers, and Garibaldi sensed an opportunity.

00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:22.094
He rounded up a thousand soldiers, called ‘I mille’, the

00:14:22.124 --> 00:14:26.904
thousand, and set sail from Genoa, in Northern Italy, to Sicily.

00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:31.514
This time, he was effectively on his own.

00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:37.064
He had no official government support, no wealthy financiers, nobody.

00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:43.004
It was to be a huge gamble, but what he did have was his

00:14:43.004 --> 00:14:47.064
reputation as a fierce fighter and charismatic leader.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:56.644
He arrived in Sicily 5 days later, was given a hero’s welcome from the rebel Sicilian forces, many

00:14:56.644 --> 00:15:03.514
of whom joined his group of soldiers, and he won a series of quick battles against the Bourbon army.

00:15:04.814 --> 00:15:08.054
He declared himself to be the dictator of Sicily, on

00:15:08.054 --> 00:15:11.724
behalf of Vittorio Emanuele, the king of Sardinia.

00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:18.464
Garibaldi wasn’t interested in ruling for himself, and knew that the movement

00:15:18.474 --> 00:15:23.094
had a better chance with a powerful figurehead like Vittorio Emanuele.

00:15:24.374 --> 00:15:28.454
Vittorio Emanuele had been aware of Garibaldi’s plan, but

00:15:28.754 --> 00:15:32.924
hadn’t officially backed it; he hadn’t officially supported it.

00:15:33.254 --> 00:15:40.264
He was ready to support if it worked, but if it didn’t, he would have completely disowned Garibaldi.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.204
So it was a super risky mission.

00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:47.554
Garibaldi attacked Palermo, the capital of Sicily,

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:53.354
and by the 28th of May 1860 he had captured the city.

00:15:54.764 --> 00:15:58.754
He was viewed as a liberator by many of the local Sicilians.

00:15:59.564 --> 00:16:04.984
They had been living under an oppressive, feudal regime, and life was not much fun.

00:16:06.124 --> 00:16:10.304
Garibaldi was someone who was going to bring about change, free

00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:14.044
them from their evil overlords, and give them a better life.

00:16:15.324 --> 00:16:20.214
After a ferocious battle in the east of the island, Sicily

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:23.984
was liberated, and Garibaldi proceeded to sail north.

00:16:25.254 --> 00:16:30.234
At the same time, Vittorio Emanuele, the King of Sardinia, had secured

00:16:30.434 --> 00:16:35.404
most of the north of the country, having liberated it from the Austrians.

00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:42.534
But everything from Rome down to the bottom of Italy was still under ‘enemy

00:16:42.554 --> 00:16:48.474
control’, or rather it wasn’t yet under Garibaldi or Vittorio Emanuele’s control.

00:16:49.754 --> 00:16:55.804
As Garibaldi crossed over from Sicily to mainland Italy, in Calabria, he

00:16:55.954 --> 00:17:00.724
proceeded with lightning speed up the country, defeating the Neapolitian

00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:06.454
king’s forces and again being given a hero’s welcome when he arrived in Naples.

00:17:07.664 --> 00:17:14.134
Garibaldi’s dream was for a united, republican, Italy, but he started to believe that the

00:17:14.144 --> 00:17:21.284
best way of achieving this was by first essentially enlarging the kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont

00:17:21.544 --> 00:17:27.844
so that it encompassed the entire of Italy, and that would become the united Italy.

00:17:29.234 --> 00:17:35.114
So Garibaldi, after capturing the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which is everything from

00:17:35.284 --> 00:17:41.754
Naples down, handed over control of them to the king of Sardinia-Piedmont, Vittorio Emanuele.

00:17:42.954 --> 00:17:49.264
This was pretty controversial - Garibaldi was a revolutionary fighter, a guerilla, a rebel

00:17:49.274 --> 00:17:56.274
fighting for a united, republican Italy, but there he was, handing over control to a northern king.

00:17:57.554 --> 00:18:06.364
And on March 17, 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was declared, with Vittorio Emanuele as its king.

00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:13.634
After this, Garibaldi retreated to his island of Caprera, essentially retiring from

00:18:13.864 --> 00:18:19.494
active military service, and refusing any reward for the work that he had done.

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:28.204
By this time he wasn’t just a national hero; his reputation had spread all over the world.

00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:33.144
He was even offered a position by Abraham Lincoln in the

00:18:33.164 --> 00:18:37.674
American Civil War, as a major general in the union forces.

00:18:38.934 --> 00:18:46.524
He rejected it, because he demanded that he was to be in control of the entire army and that Lincoln

00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:52.724
commit to the abolition of slavery, which were two conditions that Lincoln wasn’t prepared to meet.

00:18:54.034 --> 00:19:00.124
But coming back to Italy, crucially, there were two missing parts from modern Italy.

00:19:00.804 --> 00:19:07.524
Rome; which still belonged to the papal states, and Venice; which was part of the Austrian empire.

00:19:08.684 --> 00:19:13.454
The problem with Rome was that the French had promised the Pope to

00:19:13.814 --> 00:19:18.644
guard Rome’s independence from Italy, and had stationed troops there.

00:19:19.014 --> 00:19:21.184
There were French soldiers in Rome.

00:19:22.614 --> 00:19:27.144
Any attack on these troops would be considered an attack on France.

00:19:28.224 --> 00:19:35.384
Nevertheless, Garibaldi, no doubt itching to be back in action, decided to do something about this.

00:19:36.624 --> 00:19:44.054
In 1862 he sailed to Palermo, in Sicily, and raised a small army to liberate

00:19:44.094 --> 00:19:50.414
Rome, but when he got to Rome he found that the regular Italian army stood

00:19:50.414 --> 00:19:55.584
there, ready to stop them, in order to not damage relations with the French.

00:19:56.754 --> 00:20:00.964
This was a pretty strange situation, and Garibaldi

00:20:00.974 --> 00:20:04.634
instructed his troops not to fire on the Italian army.

00:20:05.794 --> 00:20:12.994
An accidental shot was fired, more shots were fired in retaliation, and several men were killed.

00:20:14.184 --> 00:20:19.494
It was not a battle by any means, but several of the rebel forces were

00:20:19.704 --> 00:20:24.364
taken prisoner, including Garibaldi, who had been shot in the foot.

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:32.004
Garibaldi was fine in the end, but it was an embarrassment for all concerned, and

00:20:32.204 --> 00:20:38.104
far from the glorious expedition he had led just a few years before through Sicily.

00:20:39.084 --> 00:20:47.784
Rome was to remain part of the Papal States until 1871, 9 years later, when the Franco-Prussia war

00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:53.674
meant that the French troops were sent away from Rome, which made capturing it a little easier.

00:20:54.704 --> 00:20:57.274
But Garibaldi had nothing to do with that.

00:20:58.554 --> 00:21:05.924
So, if you are looking for some Italian dates for your diary, 1861 is the unification of Italy,

00:21:06.214 --> 00:21:13.854
1870 is the unification of Italy plus Rome, and when the capital gets moved from Florence to Rome.

00:21:15.014 --> 00:21:19.944
By this time, though, Garibaldi had in effect retired to Caprera.

00:21:20.924 --> 00:21:27.554
He had fallen out with Italy’s new political leaders, describing himself as an orange

00:21:27.664 --> 00:21:33.734
from which his political masters had sucked out the juice and thrown away the peel.

00:21:34.954 --> 00:21:37.334
But he was still immensely popular.

00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:43.064
Tourists traveled to nearby islands to try to catch a glimpse of him.

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:52.514
On one of his rare trips outside Italy in his ‘semi retirement’, he went to England in 1864.

00:21:53.754 --> 00:21:57.914
When he arrived in London the crowds waiting to see him were

00:21:57.914 --> 00:22:02.864
so large that it took him 6 hours to travel 5 kilometres.

00:22:04.064 --> 00:22:09.944
And reportedly servants in the houses that he stayed in would take his

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:16.284
used bathwater, water from baths that he had had, they would put it

00:22:16.384 --> 00:22:22.454
in little bottles and make small fortunes selling it to obsessed fans.

00:22:23.594 --> 00:22:29.034
With Italy united, Garibaldi felt his mission in life was complete.

00:22:29.964 --> 00:22:34.384
Apart from a few trips abroad, he remained in Caprera

00:22:34.444 --> 00:22:39.064
until his death in 1882, at the ripe old age of 75.

00:22:40.854 --> 00:22:47.064
To say that Garibaldi had an eventful and remarkable life would be an understatement.

00:22:47.864 --> 00:22:53.844
We’ve obviously only covered the highlights here, but he was a man who was for many

00:22:53.844 --> 00:23:00.884
the symbol of revolution, a 19th century Che Guevara but one who actually had a huge

00:23:00.894 --> 00:23:07.124
impact, fought for pro-independence movements in multiple different countries, and will

00:23:07.124 --> 00:23:13.244
be forever associated with the unification of an entire country against all the odds.

00:23:14.714 --> 00:23:18.754
He was nicknamed a hero of two worlds, because he

00:23:18.754 --> 00:23:22.194
wasn’t just a hero in Europe, but also in South America.

00:23:23.524 --> 00:23:29.564
There are thousands of statues of Garibaldi all over Italy, military units are named

00:23:29.704 --> 00:23:35.934
after him, an English football team, Nottingham Forest, chose its red colour of shirt

00:23:36.184 --> 00:23:43.184
after Garibaldi, he gave his name to a type of beard, there are a handful of pubs named

00:23:43.224 --> 00:23:50.284
after him in England, and most importantly, there is an English biscuit named after him.

00:23:51.404 --> 00:23:58.204
Now, the biscuit, if you are asking me, isn’t very nice, it’s a sort of flat biscuit with

00:23:58.414 --> 00:24:05.344
raisins in the middle, but it is just another example of the enduring legacy of Garibaldi.

00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:11.794
One of the most amazing things about the legacy of Garibaldi is that it seems

00:24:11.794 --> 00:24:18.184
that he was universally praised, almost nobody had anything bad to say about him.

00:24:19.054 --> 00:24:21.164
The English historian A.

00:24:21.164 --> 00:24:21.364
J.

00:24:21.364 --> 00:24:21.564
P.

00:24:21.564 --> 00:24:28.334
Taylor even said that "Garibaldi is the only wholly admirable figure in modern history."

00:24:29.614 --> 00:24:35.114
The Italian author Francesco De Sanctis said “Garibaldi must win by

00:24:35.114 --> 00:24:41.524
force: he is not a man; it is a symbol, a form; he is the Italian soul.

00:24:42.164 --> 00:24:46.634
Between the beats of his heart, everyone hears the beats of his one”

00:24:47.824 --> 00:24:54.054
Che Guevara later said “The only hero the world has ever needed is called Giuseppe Garibaldi”

00:24:55.244 --> 00:25:02.144
And perhaps my favourite description of Garibaldi comes from an Argentine Admiral, a man called

00:25:02.144 --> 00:25:08.874
William Brown, who called Garibaldi "the most generous of the pirates I have ever encountered".

00:25:11.214 --> 00:25:14.644
OK then, that is it for the fantastic life of Giuseppe

00:25:14.924 --> 00:25:19.104
Garibaldi, statesman, guerilla, and revolutionary hero.

00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:24.304
It was a little longer than usual, but he did have quite a life.

00:25:25.534 --> 00:25:30.654
At least now, if you are in Italy and see a statue of a man with a large

00:25:30.674 --> 00:25:35.344
beard, on a horse, then you’ll know a little bit more about who he was.

00:25:36.424 --> 00:25:39.984
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:40.424 --> 00:25:45.234
For the Italians listening, no doubt there are some great stories about Garibaldi that

00:25:45.504 --> 00:25:49.804
I haven’t included, and I'm sure that other curious minds would love to know about.

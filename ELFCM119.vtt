Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:17.261
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:21.781
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:28.491
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Giuseppe Garibaldi, the

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:35.061
guerilla fighter and revolutionary hero who played a vital part in the unification of Italy.

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:41.961
We’ll learn about his wild journey, which took him from Nice to South America, Italy,

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:48.921
Austria, Asia, the UK, almost to the United States, and of course, ending in a united Italy.

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:54.281
The tale of Italian independence is long and complex,

00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:58.931
and this is by no means going to be a conclusive account.

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:04.281
But it will give you an overview of the man at the forefront

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.881
of it all, Garibaldi, the romantic, revolutionary hero.

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:14.741
It is quite the story, and today’s episode is a little longer

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.201
than normal, so without further ado, let’s get started.

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:26.531
His name, in Italian, is Giuseppe Garibaldi, but this is a podcast

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:31.031
in English, so I will use the English pronunciation, Garibaldi.

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:35.301
For the Italians listening, I hope you’ll excuse me.

00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:40.081
It’s hard to exaggerate the importance of Garibaldi in Italy.

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:46.661
In almost every Italian town you’ll find roads and squares named after him.

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:48.231
After

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:54.791
Roma, Rome, Garibaldi is the second most popular name for a street or square in Italy.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.051
Every Italian learns about him in school, and there are

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.091
few that consider him to be anything other than a hero.

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:07.231
And it’s not just in Italy.

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:13.281
He was hugely popular in the UK too - we even have a biscuit named after him.

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.161
Don’t worry, we’ll tell that story shortly.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:22.691
Garibaldi was born in 1807 in Nice.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:29.794
His parents were Ligurian, from the region just to the east of Nice which is now part of Italy.

00:02:30.177 --> 00:02:35.827
And to remind you in 1807, when Garibaldi was born ,there was no

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:40.097
Italy, and there had never been a unified country called Italy.

00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:46.077
It was a collection of different states, all ruled by different kingdoms,

00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:51.517
with parts of modern day Italy being under the control of foreign powers.

00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:58.628
The Austrian Empire lurked to the north and east of modern day Italy, and places like

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:04.878
Lombardy, Venice and Trieste were all part of the Austrian empire, ruled by the Habsburgs.

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:09.938
The north western part of Italy contained the Kingdom of

00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:14.408
Sardinia, which will go on to play an important part in our story.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:21.768
The central part, around Rome, was controlled by the Vatican, it was called the Papal States.

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:26.788
And below that was the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily,

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:34.048
which officially united in 1815 to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:37.678
We’ve skipped over a few, but these are the ones that will

00:03:37.678 --> 00:03:41.368
play the most important part in the story of Garibaldi.

00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:47.918
The important thing to remember is that these were independent kingdoms, and the

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:54.068
probability that they would all come together and form one country was very unlikely.

00:03:54.918 --> 00:04:00.928
Nice, when Garibaldi was born, was part of the French empire, and of course now,

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:06.678
Nice is part of France, although it's only 40 kilometers from the Italian border.

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:14.423
Garibaldi’s father was a sea captain, and Garibaldi spent many of his early years at sea.

00:04:15.663 --> 00:04:18.863
When he was in his late 20s he met another Giuseppe, Giuseppe

00:04:20.023 --> 00:04:24.163
Mazzini, who was an early proponent of Italian unification.

00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:32.703
Garibaldi joined a society called Young Italy, and swore an oath to unify Italy,

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:37.843
which was to be a goal he would spend the next 30 years of his life pursuing.

00:04:39.103 --> 00:04:46.383
It almost came to a sudden end though, as in 1834, a year after joining Young Italy,

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:52.673
he played a part in an attempted coup in Piedmont against the kingdom’s rulers.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:59.743
The coup failed, Garibaldi managed to flee over the border to France, but he was

00:04:59.743 --> 00:05:06.133
sentenced to death in absentia, meaning if he was captured he would be executed.

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:11.083
After fleeing to France, he then sailed all the way

00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:15.053
to South America, where he spent the next 12 years.

00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:21.743
He became involved in liberation movements in Brazil and Uruguay, where

00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:27.273
he honed his military skills and developed a reputation not only as a

00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:32.393
formidable military commander, but as an expert in guerilla warfare.

00:05:33.563 --> 00:05:40.943
His reputation led him to command the Uruguayan navy in the war against Argentina in 1842,

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:47.703
and then a year later he was put in charge of a new Italian unit, the Italian Legion.

00:05:48.943 --> 00:05:53.263
This legion, nicknamed the Redshirts, because they were always

00:05:53.273 --> 00:05:57.443
dressed in red, comprised of Italians who were living in Uruguay.

00:05:58.433 --> 00:06:05.563
Red was to be a colour forever associated with Garibaldi - if you see a painting of a man in a red

00:06:05.563 --> 00:06:12.923
shirt and a beard, with a sword and an Italian flag, it is almost certainly Giuseppe Garibaldi.

00:06:13.503 --> 00:06:18.503
Although he had a new life in South America, the fate of his homeland

00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:23.673
never left his thoughts, and he was given renewed hope in the unification

00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:29.093
of Italy after the election of a new, pro-reform pope, pope Pius IX.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.263
Garibaldi wrote to the pope, offering his services,

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:37.023
proposing to come back to Italy to help unite the country.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:40.203
But the pope didn’t take up his offer.

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:48.023
Nevertheless, Garibaldi was encouraged by an increasing amount of revolutionary activity around

00:06:48.213 --> 00:06:56.793
Italy, and decided to come home, returning with 60 men from his Italian Legion in April 1848.

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:03.243
Garibaldi and his men were skilled soldiers, but more than that they

00:07:03.243 --> 00:07:08.543
were adept in guerilla warfare, tactics they had honed in South America.

00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:15.503
At the time that Garibaldi returned, the first Italian War of Independence was going on.

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:22.453
This was led by Charles Albert, the King of Sardinia, which was a kingdom of Italy

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:28.113
that ruled Sardinia, of course, but also Piedmont, the region in North West Italy.

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:34.273
Garibaldi offered his services also to King Charles, but he was rejected.

00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:40.933
He was viewed as an outsider, a guerilla leader who didn’t play by the rules,

00:07:41.013 --> 00:07:45.943
and reportedly wasn’t initially liked by the soldiers of the regular army.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:52.763
They also hadn’t forgotten the fact that he had tried to lead an uprising 5 years before.

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:55.933
Garibaldi wasn’t one to give up though.

00:07:56.563 --> 00:08:01.783
He headed first to Milan, where he offered his help to the government of Milan

00:08:02.013 --> 00:08:06.873
in the fight against the Austrians, and he won a couple of early victories.

00:08:07.483 --> 00:08:10.413
But these victories tended to be short-lived.

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:16.713
Not only were the rebel forces split across multiple different groups, but they

00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:21.643
were fighting against the powerful forces of the French and the Austrian empire.

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:27.368
And of course, not everyone wanted a united Italy, and there

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:30.793
were very few people who believed it was actually possible.

00:08:31.973 --> 00:08:33.923
This didn’t deter Garibaldi though.

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:39.643
After a loss in Piedmont, he took his troops to Rome, and proposed that

00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:45.113
Rome should become an independent republic, independent of the Papal States.

00:08:46.203 --> 00:08:52.831
The French didn’t like the idea of an independent republic of Rome, nor did the King of Naples.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.180
Garibaldi found himself defending Rome against the French and the Neapolitans.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:07.740
Despite some heroic fighting, his men stood no chance, and he was forced to flee, heading north.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.200
He was pursued by French, Neapolitan, Austrian and

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.480
Spanish troops, who were all anti-Italian unification.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.950
Miraculously he managed to evade capture, and arrived in San

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.160
Marino, the mountainous microstate in north-central Italy.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:36.360
This was in July of 1849, just a year after Garibaldi had returned from South America.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.350
Although the experience of the past year had given him hope of what might

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:48.120
be achieved, actually achieving it seemed to be a near impossible task.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.360
The revolutionary forces were hugely outnumbered, and there were some very

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.410
powerful, vested interests in keeping the system of individual kingdoms.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.720
The rulers of the kingdoms, for one, were not keen on a united, republican Italy.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.330
This would mean all their power would be gone, so

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.590
naturally they would do everything they could to stop it.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:23.280
Given all of this, he decided to disband his men, to let his army go, and consider his options.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.580
He couldn’t return to his homeland of Piedmont; he was still wanted there.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:38.048
So he went away on his second exile, first to Tangier in Morocco , where he met a rich Italian

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:45.478
merchant who suggested that Garibaldi command a merchant ship, that Garibaldi become a sailor again.

00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:53.418
With his revolutionary options exhausted, Garibaldi accepted, and first sailed to New

00:10:53.428 --> 00:11:00.058
York, then to Central America, Peru, crossing the Pacific and going to the Philippines

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:06.508
and then eastern China, then back to South America, stopping off in Chile, passing

00:11:06.508 --> 00:11:12.138
through New York and then returning to Newcastle, on the north east coast of England.

00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:18.198
Garibaldi’s reputation by this time had spread throughout Europe, and

00:11:18.258 --> 00:11:23.168
he was viewed as a visionary, guerilla fighter, and revolutionary hero.

00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:30.078
He had displayed exceptional bravery and leadership, and was a symbol of rebellion.

00:11:31.418 --> 00:11:37.188
When he got to Newcastle, much to his surprise, he was given a hero’s welcome.

00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:45.568
There was a campaign to buy him a gift when he arrived, and they raised enough money to not only

00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:52.618
buy him a gold sword, but to have a pile left over that was donated to Italian Independence.

00:11:53.598 --> 00:11:59.278
They raised £30,000 which would be the equivalent of around £2

00:11:59.298 --> 00:12:04.008
million in today’s money, which all went towards Italian unification.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:10.258
When he got off his ship he was completely mobbed, and he was given the

00:12:10.478 --> 00:12:15.688
reception of a celebrity for the duration of his 3 week visit in Newcastle.

00:12:16.978 --> 00:12:21.398
He’s still remembered as the most famous Italian to have ever visited

00:12:21.648 --> 00:12:25.933
the north east of England, and if you go to Newcastle now there

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.908
there is a plaque, a blue sign commemorating, a place that he stayed.

00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:36.828
He returned to Italy in 1854, and bought part of a

00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:40.218
small island to the north of Sardinia, called Caprera.

00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:46.788
Garibaldi wasn’t a rich man by any means, but he had been given an

00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:51.398
inheritance by his brother, and was able to buy a part of the island.

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:56.328
He stayed there for 5 years or so, living a simple life,

00:12:56.638 --> 00:13:00.068
no doubt contemplating his next revolutionary moves.

00:13:01.058 --> 00:13:07.388
In 1854 he was only 46, so he still had a lot of time left for revolution.

00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:14.848
1859 saw the start of the second Italian War of Independence, and this

00:13:14.848 --> 00:13:20.128
time Garibaldi was finally called upon by Cavour, the prime minister

00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:24.698
of Piedmont-Sardinia, to prepare for war against the Austrians.

00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:31.738
Garibaldi led the Sardinian forces to victory against the Austrians, but as part of the

00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:38.958
armistice, it was agreed that Garibaldi’s hometown of Nice would be given back to the French.

00:13:40.148 --> 00:13:45.358
The French had been fighting alongside the Piedmont-Sardinian forces, and it

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:50.468
was agreed that Nice should be given to them as a reward for their assistance.

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:56.148
This incensed Garibaldi; it made him incredibly angry, and

00:13:56.198 --> 00:13:59.448
he attacked Cavour while he was speaking in parliament.

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:05.988
But everything Garibaldi had done up to this point, all of the heroic

00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:10.558
activity and guerilla fighting, was just a prelude to what was coming next.

00:14:11.578 --> 00:14:18.278
There had been uprisings in Sicily against the Bourbon rulers, and Garibaldi sensed an opportunity.

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:23.498
He rounded up a thousand soldiers, called ‘I mille’, the

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:28.308
thousand, and set sail from Genoa, in Northern Italy, to Sicily.

00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:32.918
This time, he was effectively on his own.

00:14:33.298 --> 00:14:38.468
He had no official government support, no wealthy financiers, nobody.

00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:44.408
It was to be a huge gamble, but what he did have was his

00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:48.468
reputation as a fierce fighter and charismatic leader.

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:58.048
He arrived in Sicily 5 days later, was given a hero’s welcome from the rebel Sicilian forces, many

00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:04.918
of whom joined his group of soldiers, and he won a series of quick battles against the Bourbon army.

00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:09.458
He declared himself to be the dictator of Sicily, on

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:13.128
behalf of Vittorio Emanuele, the king of Sardinia.

00:15:14.228 --> 00:15:19.868
Garibaldi wasn’t interested in ruling for himself, and knew that the movement

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:24.498
had a better chance with a powerful figurehead like Vittorio Emanuele.

00:15:25.778 --> 00:15:29.858
Vittorio Emanuele had been aware of Garibaldi’s plan, but

00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:34.328
hadn’t officially backed it; he hadn’t officially supported it.

00:15:34.658 --> 00:15:41.668
He was ready to support if it worked, but if it didn’t, he would have completely disowned Garibaldi.

00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:44.608
So it was a super risky mission.

00:15:45.868 --> 00:15:48.958
Garibaldi attacked Palermo, the capital of Sicily,

00:15:49.318 --> 00:15:54.758
and by the 28th of May 1860 he had captured the city.

00:15:56.168 --> 00:16:00.158
He was viewed as a liberator by many of the local Sicilians.

00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:06.388
They had been living under an oppressive, feudal regime, and life was not much fun.

00:16:07.528 --> 00:16:11.708
Garibaldi was someone who was going to bring about change, free

00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:15.448
them from their evil overlords, and give them a better life.

00:16:16.728 --> 00:16:21.618
After a ferocious battle in the east of the island, Sicily

00:16:21.638 --> 00:16:25.388
was liberated, and Garibaldi proceeded to sail north.

00:16:26.658 --> 00:16:31.638
At the same time, Vittorio Emanuele, the King of Sardinia, had secured

00:16:31.838 --> 00:16:36.808
most of the north of the country, having liberated it from the Austrians.

00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:43.938
But everything from Rome down to the bottom of Italy was still under ‘enemy

00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:49.878
control’, or rather it wasn’t yet under Garibaldi or Vittorio Emanuele’s control.

00:16:51.158 --> 00:16:57.208
As Garibaldi crossed over from Sicily to mainland Italy, in Calabria, he

00:16:57.358 --> 00:17:02.128
proceeded with lightning speed up the country, defeating the Neapolitian

00:17:02.128 --> 00:17:07.858
king’s forces and again being given a hero’s welcome when he arrived in Naples.

00:17:09.068 --> 00:17:15.538
Garibaldi’s dream was for a united, republican, Italy, but he started to believe that the

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:22.688
best way of achieving this was by first essentially enlarging the kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont

00:17:22.948 --> 00:17:29.248
so that it encompassed the entire of Italy, and that would become the united Italy.

00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:36.518
So Garibaldi, after capturing the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which is everything from

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:43.158
Naples down, handed over control of them to the king of Sardinia-Piedmont, Vittorio Emanuele.

00:17:44.358 --> 00:17:50.668
This was pretty controversial - Garibaldi was a revolutionary fighter, a guerilla, a rebel

00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:57.678
fighting for a united, republican Italy, but there he was, handing over control to a northern king.

00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:07.768
And on March 17, 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was declared, with Vittorio Emanuele as its king.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:15.038
After this, Garibaldi retreated to his island of Caprera, essentially retiring from

00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:20.898
active military service, and refusing any reward for the work that he had done.

00:18:22.318 --> 00:18:29.608
By this time he wasn’t just a national hero; his reputation had spread all over the world.

00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:34.548
He was even offered a position by Abraham Lincoln in the

00:18:34.568 --> 00:18:39.078
American Civil War, as a major general in the union forces.

00:18:40.338 --> 00:18:47.928
He rejected it, because he demanded that he was to be in control of the entire army and that Lincoln

00:18:47.928 --> 00:18:54.128
commit to the abolition of slavery, which were two conditions that Lincoln wasn’t prepared to meet.

00:18:55.438 --> 00:19:01.528
But coming back to Italy, crucially, there were two missing parts from modern Italy.

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:08.928
Rome; which still belonged to the papal states, and Venice; which was part of the Austrian empire.

00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:14.858
The problem with Rome was that the French had promised the Pope to

00:19:15.218 --> 00:19:20.048
guard Rome’s independence from Italy, and had stationed troops there.

00:19:20.418 --> 00:19:22.588
There were French soldiers in Rome.

00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:28.548
Any attack on these troops would be considered an attack on France.

00:19:29.628 --> 00:19:36.788
Nevertheless, Garibaldi, no doubt itching to be back in action, decided to do something about this.

00:19:38.028 --> 00:19:45.458
In 1862 he sailed to Palermo, in Sicily, and raised a small army to liberate

00:19:45.498 --> 00:19:51.818
Rome, but when he got to Rome he found that the regular Italian army stood

00:19:51.818 --> 00:19:56.988
there, ready to stop them, in order to not damage relations with the French.

00:19:58.158 --> 00:20:02.368
This was a pretty strange situation, and Garibaldi

00:20:02.378 --> 00:20:06.038
instructed his troops not to fire on the Italian army.

00:20:07.198 --> 00:20:14.398
An accidental shot was fired, more shots were fired in retaliation, and several men were killed.

00:20:15.588 --> 00:20:20.898
It was not a battle by any means, but several of the rebel forces were

00:20:21.108 --> 00:20:25.768
taken prisoner, including Garibaldi, who had been shot in the foot.

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:33.408
Garibaldi was fine in the end, but it was an embarrassment for all concerned, and

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:39.508
far from the glorious expedition he had led just a few years before through Sicily.

00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:49.188
Rome was to remain part of the Papal States until 1871, 9 years later, when the Franco-Prussia war

00:20:49.518 --> 00:20:55.078
meant that the French troops were sent away from Rome, which made capturing it a little easier.

00:20:56.108 --> 00:20:58.678
But Garibaldi had nothing to do with that.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:07.328
So, if you are looking for some Italian dates for your diary, 1861 is the unification of Italy,

00:21:07.618 --> 00:21:15.258
1870 is the unification of Italy plus Rome, and when the capital gets moved from Florence to Rome.

00:21:16.418 --> 00:21:21.348
By this time, though, Garibaldi had in effect retired to Caprera.

00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:28.958
He had fallen out with Italy’s new political leaders, describing himself as an orange

00:21:29.068 --> 00:21:35.138
from which his political masters had sucked out the juice and thrown away the peel.

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.738
But he was still immensely popular.

00:21:39.568 --> 00:21:44.468
Tourists traveled to nearby islands to try to catch a glimpse of him.

00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:53.918
On one of his rare trips outside Italy in his ‘semi retirement’, he went to England in 1864.

00:21:55.158 --> 00:21:59.318
When he arrived in London the crowds waiting to see him were

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:04.268
so large that it took him 6 hours to travel 5 kilometres.

00:22:05.468 --> 00:22:11.348
And reportedly servants in the houses that he stayed in would take his

00:22:11.358 --> 00:22:17.688
used bathwater, water from baths that he had had, they would put it

00:22:17.788 --> 00:22:23.858
in little bottles and make small fortunes selling it to obsessed fans.

00:22:24.998 --> 00:22:30.438
With Italy united, Garibaldi felt his mission in life was complete.

00:22:31.368 --> 00:22:35.788
Apart from a few trips abroad, he remained in Caprera

00:22:35.848 --> 00:22:40.468
until his death in 1882, at the ripe old age of 75.

00:22:42.258 --> 00:22:48.468
To say that Garibaldi had an eventful and remarkable life would be an understatement.

00:22:49.268 --> 00:22:55.248
We’ve obviously only covered the highlights here, but he was a man who was for many

00:22:55.248 --> 00:23:02.288
the symbol of revolution, a 19th century Che Guevara but one who actually had a huge

00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:08.528
impact, fought for pro-independence movements in multiple different countries, and will

00:23:08.528 --> 00:23:14.648
be forever associated with the unification of an entire country against all the odds.

00:23:16.118 --> 00:23:20.158
He was nicknamed a hero of two worlds, because he

00:23:20.158 --> 00:23:23.598
wasn’t just a hero in Europe, but also in South America.

00:23:24.928 --> 00:23:30.968
There are thousands of statues of Garibaldi all over Italy, military units are named

00:23:31.108 --> 00:23:37.338
after him, an English football team, Nottingham Forest, chose its red colour of shirt

00:23:37.588 --> 00:23:44.588
after Garibaldi, he gave his name to a type of beard, there are a handful of pubs named

00:23:44.628 --> 00:23:51.688
after him in England, and most importantly, there is an English biscuit named after him.

00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:59.608
Now, the biscuit, if you are asking me, isn’t very nice, it’s a sort of flat biscuit with

00:23:59.818 --> 00:24:06.748
raisins in the middle, but it is just another example of the enduring legacy of Garibaldi.

00:24:07.798 --> 00:24:13.198
One of the most amazing things about the legacy of Garibaldi is that it seems

00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:19.588
that he was universally praised, almost nobody had anything bad to say about him.

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.568
The English historian A.

00:24:22.568 --> 00:24:22.768
J.

00:24:22.768 --> 00:24:22.968
P.

00:24:22.968 --> 00:24:29.738
Taylor even said that "Garibaldi is the only wholly admirable figure in modern history."

00:24:31.018 --> 00:24:36.518
The Italian author Francesco De Sanctis said “Garibaldi must win by

00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:42.928
force: he is not a man; it is a symbol, a form; he is the Italian soul.

00:24:43.568 --> 00:24:48.038
Between the beats of his heart, everyone hears the beats of his one”

00:24:49.228 --> 00:24:55.458
Che Guevara later said “The only hero the world has ever needed is called Giuseppe Garibaldi”

00:24:56.648 --> 00:25:03.548
And perhaps my favourite description of Garibaldi comes from an Argentine Admiral, a man called

00:25:03.548 --> 00:25:10.278
William Brown, who called Garibaldi "the most generous of the pirates I have ever encountered".

00:25:12.618 --> 00:25:16.048
OK then, that is it for the fantastic life of Giuseppe

00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:20.508
Garibaldi, statesman, guerilla, and revolutionary hero.

00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:25.708
It was a little longer than usual, but he did have quite a life.

00:25:26.938 --> 00:25:32.058
At least now, if you are in Italy and see a statue of a man with a large

00:25:32.078 --> 00:25:36.748
beard, on a horse, then you’ll know a little bit more about who he was.

00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:41.388
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:41.828 --> 00:25:46.638
For the Italians listening, no doubt there are some great stories about Garibaldi that

00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:51.208
I haven’t included, and I'm sure that other curious minds would love to know about.

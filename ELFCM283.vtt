Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.641
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:21.031
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:26.811
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Red Bull.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:32.301
It is the most famous energy drink in the world, and its origin is…unlikely.

00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:38.411
In this episode we’ll meet a toothpaste salesman, Thai boxers, bull

00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:43.991
semen, trips to space, Formula 1, American lawsuits, and nightclubs.

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:47.531
It is an amazing story, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:52.231
OK then, The Story of Red Bull.

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:57.561
I should start this episode with just a little disclaimer, and that is

00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:03.171
that this episode is in no way sponsored by or affiliated with Red Bull.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:07.681
In fact, I hate the taste of Red Bull, but I do like the story.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:13.944
And our story, the story of Red Bull, starts in 1987,

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:17.881
with a 43-year-old Austrian toothpaste salesman.

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:25.551
His name was Dietrich Mateschitz, and in 1987 he travelled to Thailand on business.

00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:33.051
He was the marketing director of a German toothpaste brand called Blendax and he was meeting with

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:39.211
a Thai businessman who wanted to make a deal to arrange the import of this German toothpaste.

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:45.751
Mateschitz was experiencing jet lag, he was feeling tired from his flight

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:50.681
and the time difference, so he drank a bottle of a local energy drink.

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:56.311
This super sweet drink was called Krating Daeng, and

00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:00.191
it had a logo of two red bulls facing each other.

00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:01.801
Sound familiar?

00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:09.851
The man felt a boost of energy, his jet lag was cured, but more importantly, he had an idea.

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:15.518
But before he could spend much time thinking about this idea, he had a meeting to get to.

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:21.688
The meeting was with a man called Chaleo Yoovidhya, who just happened to be

00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:26.078
the inventor of that super sweet energy drink Mateschitz had drunk earlier.

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:29.178
Mateschitz was intrigued.

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:33.548
He was suddenly more interested in this drink than selling toothpaste,

00:02:33.568 --> 00:02:36.948
which was the reason he was in Thailand in the first place.

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:40.108
A tad ironic, a bit funny, perhaps?

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:44.488
Going somewhere for toothpaste, but staying for a sugary, sweet drink.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:50.308
Before we proceed with what our Austrian toothpaste salesman, Mateschitz, did

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:55.958
next, we need to know a bit more about the man he was meeting, Chaleo Yoovidhya.

00:02:56.368 --> 00:03:02.728
He was 21 years older than Mateschitz, and had had a very different childhood and upbringing.

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:07.988
He barely had any formal education, he rarely went to school and

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.438
started working when he was a very young man, practically still a boy.

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.748
At first, he worked with his parents.

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:20.918
Very soon, he moved to Bangkok and started selling medicinal

00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:24.348
products, he was an antibiotics salesman to begin with.

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:33.178
After proving his sales ability, he started his own company, TC Pharmaceuticals, in the early 1960s.

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:41.703
The year of his life that is crucial, or most important for our story, however, will be 1976.

00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:47.538
That was when he placed a new drink on the market, after having, what

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:52.598
he himself has said was “a stroke of divine inspiration”, that is,

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:57.628
he suddenly felt inspired, as if some invisible source helped him.

00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:03.978
Yoovidhya created a drink that consisted of water, sugar, taurine,

00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:09.138
caffeine, vitamin B and inositol, which is another type of sugar.

00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:18.118
It was initially sold in pharmacies, and it boasted a picture of two red bulls fighting with horns.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.518
It was called Krating Daeng, which literally means ’’red bull’’, like the image on the logo.

00:04:26.488 --> 00:04:32.838
A little trivia, a little fun fact is that the animal on the logo is not actually a bull,

00:04:33.028 --> 00:04:39.177
it’s something called a gaur, which is a bull-like animal also known as an Indian bison.

00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:44.480
This animal is the symbol for Thailand, it is the fifth largest land animal

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.628
in the world and interestingly enough, it is not famous for fighting.

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:56.128
Gaurs have no natural enemies, because they’re so big, and when it comes to the mating season,

00:04:56.548 --> 00:05:03.268
the biggest male gets the female of his choice - they don’t fight like deer, or other animals.

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:06.738
Anyway, let’s get back to our Thai drink.

00:05:07.648 --> 00:05:12.098
When it first launched, it mainly targeted the working class in Thailand,

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:17.158
factory workers and drivers who were having to work increasingly long hours.

00:05:18.288 --> 00:05:22.398
This new drink, Krating Daeng, was affordable, it was

00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:26.035
cheap, and it would give them a quick energy boost.

00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:32.525
While you might have thought it was an immediate hit, it actually wasn’t.

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:37.665
As will become a theme throughout the history of Red Bull, it

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:42.395
needed some cunning marketing to get people hooked on the drink.

00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:48.898
This hook, this reason to drink Red Bull, came from an unlikely source.

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:51.565
Muay Thai, or Thai Boxing.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:58.425
It was only when Krating Daeng started to sponsor Muay Thai boxing rings, and

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:02.815
to get the fighters to drink it, that the drink’s popularity started to grow.

00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:09.175
As more and more people saw it and tried it for the first time, they became aware of

00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:14.835
its restorative properties, of the fact that it does give you a bit of an energy boost.

00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:19.195
It became popular with truck drivers, who realised

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.585
that it helped them drive longer and with more focus.

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:29.575
Soon after, the popularity of this Thai Red Bull skyrocketed, it became very

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:34.765
famous and successful, and that is when Dietrich Mateschitz enters our story.

00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:42.736
Chaleo Yoovidhya, thanks to his invention, was now a rich man, and his company had started

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:48.646
doing international business, which is why he thought of importing this German toothpaste.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.180
He was a pharmacist by trade, so it does sort of make sense.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.620
When the Austrian toothpaste salesman Mateschitz met Yoovidhya, supposedly to talk about exporting

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.640
toothpaste to Thailand, the conversation quickly turned to bringing another product back to Europe.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.050
Krating Daeng.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.070
But Mateschitz knew that some changes would be necessary to make it appeal to European tastes.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.850
The drink Mateschitz had drunk was like a very sweet cough syrup, cough medicine.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.670
Mateschitz decided to make the drink fizzy–the original Thai version was not–and to make it taste

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.200
more like other Western carbonated drinks, Coca Cola, Sprite, Fanta, and those sorts of things.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.370
The pair formed a partnership, with each investing half a million dollars.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:51.120
Each would get a 49% share in the company, with the remaining 2% going to Yoovidhya’s son.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.470
The name of the European drink would be a direct translation of Krating Daeng.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.280
Its name would be, of course, Red Bull.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.520
The first product was launched on April 1st 1987.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.530
But there was a lot of work to do to make Europeans start guzzling down Red Bull.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.690
Energy drinks were not a thing in Europe back then, they were not a

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.610
popular choice of beverage, and there was no market for the product.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:28.310
But Mateschitz, being an advertising expert, realised that he had to create a market for the

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:34.150
product, he knew that he needed to make people believe that they needed Red Bull in their life.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.070
He teamed up with Rauch, a famous can packaging company, and together

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.160
they created this tall, blue and silver can with distinctive red bulls

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.560
that would become the signature style for Red Bull all over the world.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.760
In Europe, unlike in its home market of Thailand, Red Bull would be a premium

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.840
drink, more expensive than other soft drinks, something for people to aspire to.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.710
But turning Red Bull into an aspirational brand and product

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.870
would require some creativity, some thinking out of the box.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.740
For Red Bull, this came in the form of associating Red Bull with

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.430
intense activity - fast cars, extreme sports, and nightclubs.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.300
The drink might have been positioned in Thailand as a way for truck drivers to

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.660
keep driving or workers to stay awake, but in Europe it was a way for extreme

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:41.620
sports junkies to get a rush or for clubbers to stay awake dancing into the night.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.170
Recently, Red Bull even entered the world of gaming,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.600
targeting video gamers as their new consumer group.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:56.200
And Red Bull has, for many people, become more famous for its marketing stunts

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.260
and tactics than the energy drink, even breaking world records in the process.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.561
You may remember the name Felix Baumgartner.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:14.300
He is an Austrian daredevil, an extreme sports professional, and on October 14th of 2012, as

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:22.700
part of Red Bull’s Stratos project, he jumped out of a balloon from the edge of space, 39km above

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:30.770
the Earth’s surface, and travelled at up to 1,357 km per hour before returning safely to Earth.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:39.020
This stunt, this sending Baumgartner to space, cost Red Bull an estimated $65

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:45.330
million to do, but it created huge exposure for the brand, with some experts

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.962
suggesting that the value gained from it could be worth up to $6 billion.

00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:53.780
So Red Bull obviously thought it was worth it.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.936
And this is the exact strategy of Red Bull, how it has

00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:02.494
turned a simple energy drink into a global phenomenon.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.510
It sponsors all manner of extreme and dangerous sports, from Formula

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.580
One to BMX cycling, cliff jumping, flying, skiing, and skateboarding.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.890
Through the years, Red Bull as a company has expanded into several areas and today it owns six

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:28.740
football teams, two esports teams, two Formula One teams, a NASCAR team and an ice-hockey team.

00:11:29.677 --> 00:11:36.220
It also owns a travel agency, a clothing brand, a career-finding website, a television channel,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.010
a record label, and a sponsorship business which supports a whooping ninety different sports.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.090
Oh, and of course, it also owns the drink, which is

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.420
still the major source of revenue for the company.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.210
But, what does Red Bull actually make?

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.120
The answer is simple: Nothing, really.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:02.470
There are no Red Bull drink-making factories, or clothes-making factories, or music-making studios.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.680
The Red Bull drinks are made by partner factories.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.490
Red Bull the company is essentially a marketing, sponsorship and media

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.890
company with one overriding objective: to strengthen the Red Bull brand.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:25.657
And it is now a very strong brand indeed, with estimates valuing it at around $15 billion.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.060
The slogan of Red Bull is one you may well know.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.840
Unlike some companies, which change their slogans depending on cultural

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:40.010
differences, the Red Bull slogan is the same everywhere: “it gives you wings”.

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:45.426
Figurative wings, of course, it’s not claiming that you’ll get real wings, but

00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:49.896
it might surprise you to find out that this slogan, this claim that it would

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:54.916
“give you wings” did actually get Red Bull in trouble, and it led to a lawsuit.

00:12:56.056 --> 00:13:03.076
An American citizen and Red Bull drinker, a man called Benjamin Careathers, sued the company back

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:09.336
in 2013 for dishonesty, for not being honest with the claim that it would ‘’give you wings’’.

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:15.756
Now, he didn’t sue Red Bull because he didn’t actually grow wings, that would be ridiculous,

00:13:15.786 --> 00:13:22.236
but his claim was that Red Bull drinks didn’t give as much energy as they claimed they did.

00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:28.976
He won the case because his lawyers proved that a can of the drink has less caffeine

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:34.196
than an average cup of coffee, so it was misleading to claim it gives you so much energy.

00:13:35.206 --> 00:13:37.046
What did he get out of it, you might be thinking?

00:13:37.606 --> 00:13:39.526
Millions of dollars in compensation?

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:41.756
A lifetime supply of Red Bull?

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:43.776
A private tour of the Red Bull offices?

00:13:43.976 --> 00:13:47.316
To go on the next skydive with Felix Baumgartner?

00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:50.716
Nope, he got $10 in compensation.

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:57.506
But the interesting fact about this lawsuit is that the judge ruled that every person who

00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:03.556
had bought a can of Red Bull in America in the twelve years prior to, before the case,

00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:09.296
could fill in a form and could also claim the same $10 in compensation from Red Bull.

00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:14.486
There were fears that this would lead to Red Bull having to pay out

00:14:14.516 --> 00:14:18.986
almost thirteen million dollars in compensation payments, but very few

00:14:18.986 --> 00:14:23.526
people actually took up this offer, and the deadline has now expired

00:14:24.236 --> 00:14:26.836
And of course, the slogan hasn’t changed.

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:33.226
But this wouldn’t be the last of Red Bull’s difficulties, and in fact there have been plenty

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:39.446
of claims over the years that Red Bull gives you too much energy, that it is a dangerous drink.

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:46.546
In 2000, a student called Ross Cooney died during a basketball match after

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:51.596
drinking three cans of Red Bull, and this triggered fear and outrage, with

00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:56.626
several countries, including France, banning the sale of the original Red Bull.

00:14:57.686 --> 00:15:02.816
I should say that there have been many experiments and investigations that Red Bull

00:15:02.816 --> 00:15:08.786
is safe to drink in normal amounts, but–like almost anything–if you drink litres of

00:15:08.786 --> 00:15:14.366
it and especially if you combine it with lots of alcohol, well, it can be problematic.

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:20.316
One other interesting and unfortunate difficulty that Red Bull got

00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:25.856
itself into was related to bull semen, the male reproductive fluid.

00:15:26.956 --> 00:15:30.746
One of the ingredients in Red Bull was something called taurine.

00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:36.456
There were claims that this taurine ingredient was taken from bull semen,

00:15:36.766 --> 00:15:41.736
which would obviously be quite disturbing if it were true, but–just in case

00:15:41.786 --> 00:15:46.226
you have heard this claim and weren’t sure whether it was true–it’s not.

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:51.306
Taurine is something that exists in practically every animal, including

00:15:51.506 --> 00:15:56.786
humans, and the taurine used in drinks like Red Bull is synthesised,

00:15:56.786 --> 00:16:01.736
it is made synthetically, with absolutely no bull semen being used.

00:16:03.236 --> 00:16:07.846
For all of its legal difficulties and problems getting people to believe

00:16:07.876 --> 00:16:12.036
it is safe to drink, Red Bull has turned into a multi-billion dollar

00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:17.746
brand, with an estimated 10 billion cans of the stuff sold every year.

00:16:18.746 --> 00:16:24.396
It owns Formula One Teams, sends people to space, has its own planes, runs

00:16:24.396 --> 00:16:30.026
music festivals, holds skydiving championships and even has its own TV channel.

00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:35.599
And lest we forget, it also controls the most successful energy drink in the world.

00:16:36.449 --> 00:16:43.369
And to think, it all came from a tired Austrian toothpaste salesman trying to get over his jet lag.

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:49.719
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Red Bull.

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:54.039
Whether you are an avid Red Bull drinker, or you can’t stand the smell

00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:57.639
of the stuff, well I hope it was a fun one and you learned something new.

00:16:58.459 --> 00:17:02.059

What is Red Bull associated with in your country?

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:10.369
Have you tried Krating Daeng, the original Thai version?

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:14.439

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:16.635
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:21.005
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:24.925
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.785
talking about Richard Nixon and the Watergate Scandal.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:36.905
On August 8th of 1974, in the White House Oval Office, a tired looking President Richard

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:42.545
Nixon stared into the camera and announced his resignation to the American people.

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:50.155
With this, he became the first and only, to date, American president to resign in office.

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:56.925
And the reason for this, the so-called Watergate scandal, would have a lasting impact on

00:00:56.955 --> 00:01:02.775
American politics, trust in institutions, and even leave a mark on the English language.

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:09.715
So, let’s get right into it, and look at the scandal that brought down a president.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:16.385
The man at the centre of the Watergate scandal was Richard Milhous Nixon.

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:23.395
He was born into a modest Quaker family in January of 1913 in California.

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:30.715
After finishing his studies at law school, he served as a Navy lieutenant commander in the Pacific

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:38.565
during World War Two, and was then elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican in 1946.

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:45.165
With the Cold War developing, Nixon became a national figure after working on

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:51.145
the case of Alger Hiss, an American who was accused of having been a soviet spy.

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:58.645
This proved his anti-communist credentials, and helped him make the jump from Congressman

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:05.115
to Senator, which he did in 1950, when he was elected as the Senator for California.

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:11.405
During this rise to national prominence, he got a name for himself as

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:16.165
someone who was prepared to play dirty to get ahead, someone who was

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:20.805
prepared to do whatever it took to advance his personal interests.

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:27.955
In the campaign to become Senator for California, he fiercely attacked his rival, Helen

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:34.045
Gahagan Douglas, portraying her as a communist, producing misleading pamphlets about

00:02:34.095 --> 00:02:39.735
her voting record, and even claiming Douglas was “pink right down to her underwear”.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:45.765
All of these dirty tactics earned him the nickname ‘Tricky Dick’.

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:52.355
I should clarify here that “tricky” means deceitful or dishonest, it doesn’t mean

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:58.585
difficult or hard in this context, and Dick is simply a short version of Richard.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:05.425
Anyway, Tricky Dick was becoming a household name, known as someone who was fiercely

00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:11.515
anti-communist and would be prepared to go to any lengths to further American interests.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:18.475
It was no surprise, then, when he was chosen, at the age of just 39, to be Dwight

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:24.915
Eisenhower’s running mate in the 1952 presidential election, and he would go on to serve

00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:31.375
as his Vice President for eight years, until 1960, during which he completed various

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:38.055
diplomatic trips abroad and earned himself a reputation as a bit of a foreign policy expert.

00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:43.309
We should note here, that on the campaign trail in 1952,

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:47.975
Eisenhower left all of the ‘negative campaigning’ to Tricky Dick.

00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:54.565
By negative campaigning, I mean spreading what we might today call ‘fake news’ about

00:03:54.705 --> 00:04:00.025
political opponents, and sometimes known as ‘mudslinging’ - all the stuff that Nixon

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:04.405
had got a name for already during the campaign to become Senator for California.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.275
Anyway, life as Eisehnhower’s number two must have

00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.915
had an effect on Nixon and given him a taste of power.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:19.385
In 1960 he decided to have a crack at the top job, and ran for President.

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:23.775
But, 1960 would not be it for Nixon.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:27.725
He narrowly lost out to a younger, much more handsome

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:31.845
and more charismatic candidate, the Democrat John F.

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:35.025
Kennedy, who was only 43 when he became president.

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:39.065
The White House would have to wait, and Tricky Dick

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:42.765
needed to take a step back to plot his next move.

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:50.315
That would come in 1962, when he contested the race for Governor of his home state of California.

00:04:51.115 --> 00:04:58.375
But he lost, and many, reportedly including Nixon himself, thought his political career was over.

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:05.115
Immediately afterwards, he did the traditional thing politicians do when they’re trying to figure

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:11.615
out their next moves: take a trip to Europe, spend more time with their family, and then, in Nixon’s

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:17.745
case, return to the United States and become a senior partner at a prestigious New York law firm.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:23.845
But many political ‘pundits’, political commentators, sensed that

00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:28.295
Nixon wanted to be back in the game - presidential politics, that is.

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:34.785
The problem was that back in 1962, when he unsuccessfully ran

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:39.745
for Governor, Nixon had ruled himself out of the 1964 election.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:45.845
He’d even claimed that his concession speech - the speech losing politicians

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:51.315
make to accept defeat - he claimed that it would be “my last press conference.”

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:59.017
So when his former rival President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Nixon kept to

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:04.217
his word and supported the Republican candidate Barry Goldwater from the sidelines.

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:10.587
Nixon could only watch as Kennedy’s Vice President and successor, Lyndon B.

00:06:10.587 --> 00:06:15.087
Johnson, won a landslide victory and wiped out the Republicans.

00:06:16.377 --> 00:06:20.387
But Tricky Dick was, even back then, planning his next

00:06:20.387 --> 00:06:23.307
run at the White House and plotting for the future.

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:30.727
Nixon just couldn’t resist the pull of the Presidency and would, as we will learn in a few moments,

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:38.277
do just about anything - legal, illegal, and indeed, very illegal - to win power and keep it.

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:45.267
With the Democrats divided about war in Vietnam and tension bubbling in the country

00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:51.537
over civil rights, Nixon felt he had a shot - a chance - at winning in 1968.

00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:58.767
This feeling grew when the incumbent, or sitting, President, the Democrat Lyndon

00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:04.267
Johnson, shocked everyone and announced that he would not be seeking reelection.

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:06.887
And the turbulence continued.

00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:12.007
The assassinations of both civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:15.267
and the potential Democratic nominee Robert F.

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:19.247
Kennedy - the younger brother of the already assassinated John F.

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:24.227
Kennedy - sparked violence and rioting across 130 American cities and

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:31.277
resulted in 46 deaths, 20,000 arrests, and more than $100 million of damage.

00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:38.667
America was on the edge, and the country was ready for someone to bring back some normality.

00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:45.887
And after winning the Republican nomination Nixon capitalised on this tension, and

00:07:46.027 --> 00:07:52.037
decided to run for President on a “law and order” ticket, a “law and order” message.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:57.497
This message, combined with criticism of the Democrats' foreign

00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:01.257
policy record, won him the presidency by a narrow margin.

00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:06.997
Tricky Dick was back - and finally, he was in the White House.

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:13.097
Now, before we get into the Watergate scandal itself, the act of

00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:17.017
Nixon’s presidency that he is most famous for, in the interests of

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:21.372
balance it is worth talking briefly about his first term as President.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:26.732
Now, remember that Nixon was a bit of a foreign policy expert?

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:31.932
Or he had that reputation after his trips to Asia during his time as Vice President?

00:08:32.632 --> 00:08:39.122
Well, Nixon’s Presidency is best remembered - besides Watergate, of course - for ‘opening up’

00:08:39.242 --> 00:08:46.321
China, reducing tensions with the USSR and establishing the European Protection Agency in 1970.

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:54.271
He met with the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and negotiated limits on nuclear weapons, and

00:08:54.451 --> 00:09:01.881
then, in January of 1973, he made an agreement with North Vietnam to pull out American troops.

00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.211
So, his presidency was not without its achievements.

00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:14.181
But for all of these positive legacies, he would be forever remembered for the Watergate Scandal.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:20.601
You might be thinking, after such a long and perhaps unlikely political

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:25.281
comeback, after such a long and difficult road to the Oval Office, and

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:31.091
some initial policy successes, why, and how, did Nixon throw it all away?

00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:37.001
As is often the case with politicians, the origins of Watergate can be

00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:42.631
boiled down - or, simplified, we might say - to one word: reelection.

00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:49.891
Paranoid about being reelected in the 1972 election, Nixon was desperate to

00:09:49.961 --> 00:09:55.021
cling onto power and willing to do whatever it took to stay in the White House.

00:09:56.111 --> 00:10:02.741
He was so desperate, in fact, that he even put together a special team of advisers to make

00:10:02.741 --> 00:10:08.171
sure he was reelected, imaginiatively called the ‘Committee to Re-Elect the President’.

00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:14.561
Put very simply, CREEP, as it became known, started the Watergate scandal

00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:19.191
by ordering a break-in at the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters,

00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:24.511
the DNC headquarters, at the Watergate complex in Washington D.C.

00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:31.401
They bugged phone lines, they put recording devices on Democratic phone lines, they

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:36.941
stole important documents to try to ‘dig up dirt’, or find out useful information,

00:10:37.181 --> 00:10:43.241
on Nixon’s Democratic rival, George McGovern, for the upcoming election in 1972.

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:48.521
Obviously this was illegal - there’s nothing wrong with trying to find

00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:52.691
out information about your rival, but there is something very wrong with

00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:56.831
breaking into a hotel and secretly listening to your rival’s phone calls.

00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:03.571
And they might have got away with it, had it not been for a keen-eyed security guard.

00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:11.281
In the early hours of June 17th, of 1972, a security guard named Frank Wills

00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:16.441
noticed that there was something fishy going on, there was suspicious activity in

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:20.221
the Watergate building, where the Democratic National Committee headquarters were.

00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:27.171
There was tape put on the locks of the doors, which allowed them to close but didn’t lock.

00:11:27.951 --> 00:11:32.031
The security guard removed the tape, but when he returned

00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:35.591
he found that someone had put the tape back on to the locks.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.101
He called the police, who went into the DNC offices and found

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:45.371
and arrested five men, the police caught them red handed.

00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:54.411
These five men, it turned out, were high-ranking members of CREEP, Nixon’s committee for reelection.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:12:00.091
Of course, they didn’t admit to this immediately, the connection between the

00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:04.951
burglars and the White House was not immediately obvious, but it was quickly

00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:09.881
made when a copy of the CREEP phone number was found on one of the burglars.

00:12:11.271 --> 00:12:16.711
The White House, of course, distanced itself from what one spokesman called a

00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:22.181
‘third rate burglary’ attempt, and then, in an August speech, Nixon assured the

00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:27.261
American people that he and the White House had nothing to do with the break-in.

00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:35.241
This promise seemed to have done its job, as in November of 1972 Tricky Dick,

00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:40.411
or rather President Richard Nixon, was reelected in a landslide victory.

00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:44.351
But the story didn’t stop there.

00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:50.871
And as it turns out, it would be the very committee that Nixon had put together to ensure his

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:57.781
reelection that would be his downfall and cause him to be booted out, kicked out of office.

00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:03.871
While the White House claimed to know nothing about the break-in, behind closed doors,

00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:09.491
this committee was trying to cover its tracks, stop the investigation into the break-in,

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:15.884
and distance itself from the five burglars who were arrested that night in June 1972.

00:13:17.121 --> 00:13:20.851
They destroyed evidence and burned transcripts taken

00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:24.881
from a previous failed wiretap at the DNC headquarters.

00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:31.571
Yes, CREEP had actually broken into the DNC before, and on the night they

00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:36.514
were caught, they were actually returning to try and fix a faulty wiretap.

00:13:37.681 --> 00:13:44.031
From the very night the police caught the burglars, Nixon and his staff began what we might

00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:50.531
call today a ‘disinformation campaign’, providing fake alibis, distancing themselves from

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:56.601
the burglary, and paying people off with ‘hush money’ - payments to ensure someone’s silence.

00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:05.361
Crucially, on June 23rd of 1972, less than a week after the break-in, Nixon

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:11.321
ordered that the FBI be told, “Don't go any further into this case, period!”

00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:17.471
This order would later be revealed in what became known as the ‘Nixon tapes’.

00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:24.671
Nixon recorded all conversations in the Oval Office, and it would transpire that he had some pretty

00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:30.281
incriminating conversations, some conversations that showed he knew exactly what was going on.

00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:36.941
While Nixon tried to brush the official investigation under the carpet, two young

00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:42.821
reporters at the Washington Post called Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein wouldn’t let it go.

00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:48.891
Their original reporting on the scandal has been described as “maybe the single

00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:54.771
greatest reporting effort of all time” and played a big role in shaping public opinion.

00:14:56.111 --> 00:15:00.731
A lot of their information came from an anonymous source known only as

00:15:00.781 --> 00:15:05.891
‘Deepthroat’ who they met in secret and, it later turned out, had been

00:15:05.891 --> 00:15:10.112
a high ranking FBI agent involved in the investigation from the start.

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:17.501
Deepthroat revealed that Nixon’s coverup was far more serious than the break-in itself.

00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.701
As he became increasingly paranoid that he would be connected to the crime,

00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:29.581
Nixon then asked the CIA to block the FBI investigation, and remember he had

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:33.951
already tried to tell the FBI to stop the investigation in the first place.

00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:40.201
Now, breaking in, stealing documents, and using wiretaps was one

00:15:40.201 --> 00:15:45.431
thing, but obstructing justice was another, much more serious crime.

00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:51.031
Tricky Dick was getting in over his head - that's to say, getting

00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:55.081
himself involved in a situation he couldn’t get himself out of.

00:15:56.261 --> 00:16:00.711
Several of the burglars pleaded guilty - encouraged, or most likely

00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:05.451
threatened to do so by Nixon’s team - in order to avoid a trial, but

00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:10.421
facing growing media scrutiny some began to crack under the pressure.

00:16:11.651 --> 00:16:17.438
In July of 1973, Alexander Butterfield, Nixon’s deputy assistant,

00:16:17.714 --> 00:16:22.001
testified in court that Nixon recorded all of his conversations.

00:16:23.251 --> 00:16:27.981
For people who believed that Nixon was guilty, which of course he certainly

00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:33.541
was, these tapes were the smoking gun, the evidence that unquestionably

00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:37.771
connected him to the crime, the crime of obstruction of justice.

00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:43.721
The only question that remained for these people was how to get their hands on them.

00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:49.051
It wasn’t only the journalists, Woodward and Bernstein, who were trying to track

00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:54.321
down the tapes, but there was also a special investigation set up, the United

00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:59.211
States Senate Watergate Committee, which was tasked with finding out what happened.

00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:06.231
Pressure was building as 1973 went on, and the Nixon team tried to claim that

00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:11.261
the tapes were protected by Presidential privilege, which means the President

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:16.131
can choose to withhold confidential communication under certain circumstances.

00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:22.251
In fact, years later, in a series of interviews with the British journalist

00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:28.451
David Frost in 1977, Nixon put the presidential privilege argument very bluntly,

00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:33.831
claiming: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.”

00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:40.451
But it was illegal, of course - very illegal, in fact - and Nixon knew it.

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:46.111
As the coverup started to unravel, Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald

00:17:46.111 --> 00:17:52.661
Cox, and on October 20th of 1973, officials from the Justice Department began

00:17:52.661 --> 00:17:57.321
resigning in protest in what became known as the ‘Saturday Night Massacre.’

00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:02.591
In response Nixon gave up some of the tapes, but not all.

00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:08.121
By the start of 1974 he had lost control of the scandal and

00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:12.111
his coverup and obstruction of justice were becoming clearer.

00:18:13.161 --> 00:18:20.161
In early March, a grand jury indicted seven of Nixon’s aides, and the jury, nervous

00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:25.981
about how they should refer to the President, called him an “unindicted co-conspirator.”

00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:31.231
With nowhere to go, and his aides indicted, in July

00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:34.871
the Supreme Court forced Nixon to hand over the tapes.

00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:41.981
Still, even then, Nixon tried everything that he could to avoid it - can you blame him?

00:18:41.991 --> 00:18:44.907
He’d literally recorded all of his lawbreaking.

00:18:46.121 --> 00:18:52.071
Then, the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Nixon for abuses of power,

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:57.061
the cover-up, violations of the Constitution, and obstruction of justice.

00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:05.691
For Tricky Dick, the game was up, and he handed over the complete tapes on August 5th of 1974.

00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:12.331
Knowing he was about to be impeached, three days after handing over the tapes he

00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:18.571
became the first, and still, to this day, the only U.S President to resign in office.

00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:25.091
“By taking this action,” he said from the Oval Office, “I hope that I will have

00:19:25.091 --> 00:19:30.501
hastened the start of the process of healing which is so desperately needed in America.”

00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:36.261
He might have been right that America needed healing, but he didn’t

00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:40.761
actually admit to any kind of wrongdoing in his speech, claiming

00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:44.261
that he always thought he was doing what was best for the country.

00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:51.441
The presidency was passed to his Vice President, Gerald Ford, who some historians

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:55.641
believe was offered the job on the condition that he would pardon Nixon.

00:19:56.781 --> 00:20:02.881
Shortly after being sworn in as President, Ford did indeed pardon Nixon of all crimes.

00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:08.811
Ford said that he wanted to put the issue to bed - that is to say, end

00:20:08.811 --> 00:20:14.191
it - and told the American people that “our long national nightmare is over.”

00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:19.941
Nixon’s reputation might have been tarnished, badly marked,

00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:24.011
but he didn’t spend a day behind bars, a day in prison.

00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:27.701
Not all his staff were so lucky.

00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:32.151
Nixon’s Attorney General John Mitchell served 19 months in

00:20:32.151 --> 00:20:36.391
prison, while the mastermind behind the Watergate break-in, G.

00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:41.111
Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent no less, did over four years.

00:20:42.261 --> 00:20:47.781
In terms of the legacy of Watergate, this very public scandal, the Watergate

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:52.691
scandal, it changed American politics, society, and history forever.

00:20:53.671 --> 00:20:59.751
Americans were already increasingly divided and distrustful of authority before Nixon

00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:05.841
even got the White House, so when he was publicly forced to resign in disgrace many

00:21:05.841 --> 00:21:11.401
Americans concluded that politicians and presidents were all liars with something to hide.

00:21:12.411 --> 00:21:18.341
It’s also why, many historians argue, Nixon’s two successors - Ford, and

00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:23.591
then Democrat Jimmy Carter - were such weak and ineffective Presidents.

00:21:24.531 --> 00:21:30.611
After the expansion of Presidential power throughout the 1950’s and 60’s, Nixon,

00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:34.761
especially his claims that he couldn’t be held responsible for his crimes,

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:40.241
this was viewed as the climax of what is known as the ‘Imperial Presidency.”

00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:47.171
Thanks to the excellent reporting of Woodward and Bernstein, the press began concentrating

00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:53.271
much more on what Presidents and politicians were doing behind the scenes, making sure they

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:57.981
were reporting on what was actually happening, not just what the White House was telling them.

00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:03.101
Congress, too, began reasserting itself and trying to

00:22:03.101 --> 00:22:06.591
rebalance the power dynamic between branches of government.

00:22:07.801 --> 00:22:12.471
Ultimately, as far as the American people are concerned, the people

00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:17.511
felt - and heard, literally, on tape - that the President had lied to them.

00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:25.331
Nixon and Watergate’s true legacy, therefore, is that it solidified suspicion of politicians.

00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:32.231
The belief that they lie and deceive, and that they can’t be trusted, was there for all to see and

00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:38.941
hear in Nixon’s nasally, monotone voice as he looked at the camera and lied to the American people.

00:22:40.021 --> 00:22:45.241
And on a linguistic note, the Watergate scandal left a mark on the English language.

00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:51.571
Whenever there is any kind of scandal, journalists like to add the suffix

00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:57.341
of “gate” to the word, so there was Partygate, with Boris Johnson, or even

00:22:57.351 --> 00:23:02.681
Nipplegate, where part of Janet Jackson’s breast was exposed during the Super Bowl.

00:23:03.771 --> 00:23:08.431
But the most lasting legacy is, of course, to do with trust in politicians.

00:23:09.031 --> 00:23:15.471
Undoubtedly, Richard Nixon was not the first or last US president to overstep his power.

00:23:15.921 --> 00:23:21.271
But the Watergate Scandal made Nixon the face - and the voice - of an idea

00:23:21.271 --> 00:23:26.011
that remains to this day: that politicians are dishonest and can’t be trusted.

00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:32.121
As far as Nixon was concerned, perhaps it was not too much of a surprise.

00:23:32.631 --> 00:23:37.371
People had seen how he had behaved throughout his political career, and it

00:23:37.371 --> 00:23:41.801
was clear that he would do whatever he thought was necessary to stay in power.

00:23:42.401 --> 00:23:46.611
And if that wasn’t enough, there was a clue right there in his nickname.

00:23:47.351 --> 00:23:50.241
After all, he wasn't known as Tricky Dick for nothing.

00:23:53.008 --> 00:23:58.128
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on the Watergate Scandal, the story

00:23:58.128 --> 00:24:02.628
of one man’s lust for power and his willingness to do anything to keep it.

00:24:03.228 --> 00:24:08.998
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Watergate before, or this is

00:24:09.018 --> 00:24:14.318
the first time you’d actually dug into the story of it, well I hope you learned something new.

00:24:15.218 --> 00:24:18.608
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:23.398
If you were alive at the time of the Watergate scandal, how do you remember it?

00:24:23.818 --> 00:24:27.528
How do you think Nixon ranks on the list of US presidents?

00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:32.288
How do you think his legacy would have been different if it hadn’t been for Watergate?

00:24:32.738 --> 00:24:36.118
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

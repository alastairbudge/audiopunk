Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:13.995
I'm your host, Alastair, Budge, and today we are going to be talking about some of the places in the

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.665
world where aeroplanes aren't allowed to fly.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.261
Some of them you may be able to imagine, but some of them, well, they may just surprise you.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:29.321
Before we get right into it though, I just want to remind those of you listening on Apple Podcasts,

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:34.801
Spotify or wherever you may get your podcasts, that you can get the transcript and keep vocabulary

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:38.501
for this podcast on the website, so that's leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:44.592
There's also a whole load of information on how to use podcasts to learn English over on the blog.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.172
So that's well worth a look as well, if you haven't already.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.120
Okay.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.585
Back to the matter at hand, the places in the world where planes can't fly, So there are a few

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:59.065
categories of places where planes can't fly.

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:06.387
Firstly airspace where countries don't allow other countries' aeroplanes to fly for political

00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:06.977
reasons.

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:15.259
Countries own the sky that's above them and they can choose to allow planes from other countries to

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.359
use it, or they can choose to not allow them to use it.

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:24.685
A country might choose to not allow planes from another country to use its airspace if that country

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:25.575
isn't an ally.

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:32.565
So, for example, Taiwanese aeroplanes can't fly over China, Israeli aeroplanes can't fly over

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:35.305
several Arab states, and vice versa of course.

00:01:35.978 --> 00:01:41.141
Nowadays, there aren't actually that many countries which ban the use of their airspace to other

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:41.721
countries.

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:48.924
Also not allowing planes to go into your airspace means losing out on revenue because every time a

00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:54.279
aeroplane goes into the airspace of another country, that country charges a fee for it.

00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:58.736
But even 30 years ago, things were very different.

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:05.136
Russia and China didn't allow Western aeroplanes to use their airspace, meaning that planes from

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:11.471
Europe wanting to go east, for example, would need to make a big detour to avoid airspace belonging

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.632
to the vast Soviet Union and China.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.796
For example, a flight from London to Tokyo and remember that the Japanese economy was booming in the

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:27.585
eighties so this was a very desirable route so a flight from London to Tokyo would have to go from

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:31.935
London to Greenland, then over Alaska, and then come down to Tokyo.

00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:36.861
If you could imagine a world map or a globe, that's really not a direct route.

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.207
Now, of course, they just fly over Russia and China.

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.879
So that's one reason.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.449
Secondly, there is the category of places that are considered dangerous for commercial planes to fly

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.429
over for geographical reasons.

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:57.458
One you might be familiar with, or at least could imagine is Tibet.

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:04.689
So, Tibet is located on the lofty Tibetan plateau on the northern side of the Himalayas and is joint

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.169
home to Mount Everest, along with Nepal.

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.015
Now, why can't planes fly over Tibet?

00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:12.203
Well, there are several reasons.

00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:17.598
Firstly, Tibet is very high, with an average elevation of almost 5,000 metres.

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:25.738
And if you think Mount Everest is 8,800 metres, then that really gives you an idea of quite how high

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:26.438
Tibet is.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:32.797
Given that planes fly anywhere from nine and a half to eleven and a half kilometres high, that's

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:35.637
actually pretty close to the ground in Tibet.

00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:41.443
There isn't just the risk that you're close to the top of the mountains, but also the risk that if

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:45.453
anything goes wrong, well, you'd be in trouble for a few reasons.

00:03:46.103 --> 00:03:47.653
Firstly, oxygen.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.289
Aeroplanes do of course have oxygen masks, but these only have enough oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes.

00:03:55.382 --> 00:04:01.902
There is a regulation that requires airline operators to be able to descend to around 3000 metres to

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:07.542
ensure that passengers have enough oxygen, and given that the average height of the ground in Tibet

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:12.707
is 5,000 metres, well, going down to 3000 metrers is a bit of a problem.

00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:19.961
Secondly, if anything goes wrong and a plane is required to make an emergency landing, well that's

00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.621
not very easy in the Himalayas.

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:25.101
So that's why no planes allowed to fly over Tibet.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.874
There are a few other reasons.

00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:33.444
So installing and maintaining a radar network in Tibet would be incredibly expensive.

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:36.277
And so China just doesn't do it in Himalayas.

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:42.761
If there's no radar network, then there's no way of guiding and supporting pilots and so they just

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.051
don't do it in the first place.

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:49.495
I should point out that there are flights to Lhasa, which is the capital of Tibet.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:56.105
These will all fly from within China, and as Lhasa is on the Eastern side of Tibet, these flights

00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:58.445
avoid most of the very mountainous region.

00:04:59.073 --> 00:05:04.993
In any case, you can't fly to Tibet from the West for many reasons that we could group together and

00:05:04.993 --> 00:05:10.443
say, "you might crash into the mountains and not be able to breathe", which seems after all pretty

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:10.953
sensible.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.030
It's for similar reasons that you might think that commercial flights don't fly over Antarctica.

00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:22.437
However, there's another more practical reason and it's actually an economic reason.

00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:27.968
It's that there just really isn't the demand for flights to go over Antarctica.

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:34.898
If you take out a globe, you'll see that the only real practical flight would be from somewhere like

00:05:34.898 --> 00:05:39.685
the bottom of South America to Australia, but there just isn't enough demand to warrant the

00:05:39.685 --> 00:05:43.265
investment in radar stations and equipment to support these routes.

00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:46.421
So that's our second category.

00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:52.182
Places where it's just not safe enough to fly over for natural geographical reasons, reasons that

00:05:52.182 --> 00:05:55.441
are very sensible, such as you may crash into a mountain.

00:05:56.344 --> 00:06:02.344
Thirdly, there are those places where commercial airlines can't fly because the countries that own

00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:08.388
the airspace and own the ground underneath it aren't considered safe enough for passengers.

00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:16.635
What's called 'no fly zones' are implemented and then removed on a regular basis and subject to

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:17.625
political events.

00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:24.911
Libya, for example, was subject to a no fly zone in 2011 and then again in 2018 and 2019.

00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:32.986
Other areas that have been subject to no fly zones include Iran, Mali, Yemen, North Korea, the list

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:33.366
goes on.

00:06:34.781 --> 00:06:40.941
The reason that from time to time, of course flying is prohibited over these areas is pretty simple.

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:47.301
The possibility that the plane might be shot down or that if it has to make an emergency landing,

00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:52.551
the passengers will not be given the warmest of welcomes when they land in that country.

00:06:53.754 --> 00:06:57.440
Finally, our fourth category may just surprise you.

00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:03.882
Now, if you're wondering what Disneyworld, Disneyland and Buckingham Palace have in common, nope,

00:07:03.942 --> 00:07:06.682
I'm not going to make any jokes here about the inhabitants.

00:07:06.712 --> 00:07:08.512
I'll leave that to your own imagination.

00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:15.319
Disneyworld, Disneyland and Buckingham Palace all have no fly zones above them, meaning that no

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.579
planes are allowed to travel at whatever height.

00:07:18.953 --> 00:07:24.093
In the case of Disneyland and Disneyworld, it's ostensibly from a security perspective.

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:28.433
As this came into place after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

00:07:28.883 --> 00:07:35.512
However, other theme parks were a bit annoyed when this happened as they used to fly adverts for

00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:38.172
their parks above Disneyland and Disney world.

00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:40.217
Now, of course they can't.

00:07:42.015 --> 00:07:47.190
These aren't the only tourist sites with no fly zones, though - Machu Picchu in Peru has one, as

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.790
does the Taj Mahal in India and the Parthenon in Greece.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.400
In fact, the entire city of Paris has one.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.530
So if you'd been in Paris, looked up at the sky while you were enjoying your vin rouge and camembert

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:06.383
or coffee and croissant and wondered where all the planes were, well, now you've got your answer.

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:12.671
I think we'd all agree that being able to enjoy these attractions without aeroplanes flying overhead

00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:13.561
is, is a good thing.

00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:19.986
And if it reduces the possibility of any kind of terrorist attack, well that's a positive thing as

00:08:19.986 --> 00:08:20.256
well.

00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:21.681
Okay.

00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.631
I hope this has been interesting.

00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:29.471
We've taken a good look at the places in the world where planes can't fly, and now you know what

00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:32.481
Disneyland, Disneyworld and Buckingham Palace all have in common.

00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:38.411
Stay tuned as we've got another podcast in the pipeline about who owns the sky.

00:08:38.964 --> 00:08:41.634
I don't know about you, but I find this stuff pretty fascinating.

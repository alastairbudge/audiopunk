Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.763
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:21.103
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:25.733
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.743 --> 00:00:30.303
Winston Churchill, the iconic British wartime Prime Minister.

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:35.873
This is actually going to be the first of two episodes about Churchill.

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:40.743
Today, we will talk about his varied life, from escaping from as a

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:45.463
prisoner of war camp in South Africa to his unorthodox daily routine,

00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:49.753
and of course his huge influence on the world we all live in today.

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:56.563
Then in the next episode we will talk about his language, and how he used the

00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:02.623
English language to galvanise a nation, and look at what you, as a learner

00:01:02.673 --> 00:01:07.233
of English, can learn from Churchill about how to use language effectively.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:14.493
OK then, he survived two world wars, was almost killed numerous times,

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:19.593
served as the British Prime Minister twice, and lived to the age of 90.

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:23.683
There is a lot to get through, so let’s get started.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:31.303
In 2002 the BBC conducted a poll, a survey, a public vote.

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:36.493
They asked the British public to vote on who was the greatest Briton ever.

00:01:37.543 --> 00:01:43.243
This became a lively national debate – on television, radio and in newspapers.

00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:48.323
Now, without sounding too much like I’m working for the UK

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:51.773
tourist board, there are a lot of people to choose from.

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:55.183
Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all time?

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:59.323
Isaac Newton, perhaps, the man who discovered gravity?

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:03.983
John Lennon, the peace activist and member of The Beatles?

00:02:04.243 --> 00:02:10.083
Or even Queen Victoria, who was the longest-reigning British monarch at the time of the survey?

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:15.603
Nope, it was Winston Churchill, the man who is believed by many

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:19.243
to have saved Britain from Nazi invasion in the Second World War.

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:25.233
Indeed, many would argue that his leadership during the period when Britain stood

00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:30.463
alone against the Nazi forces gives him a worldwide significance and status,

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:35.493
and that without him, the world would be a very different place right now.

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:40.542
Perhaps when you hear his name you can imagine what he looks like:

00:02:40.902 --> 00:02:46.172
quite a large man, dressed formally in the clothes we might associate

00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:51.042
with the 19th century - black jacket, bow tie and bowler hat.

00:02:51.982 --> 00:02:57.362
He sometimes has two fingers raised in the “V for Victory” sign;

00:02:57.832 --> 00:03:02.962
very often he is holding a fat cigar in his mouth or in his hand.

00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:08.952
Recently, Churchill‘s status as a wartime leader and hero has come

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:13.642
under attack, especially with the accusation of being a racist.

00:03:14.572 --> 00:03:18.692
After the Black Lives Matter protests, his statue in Parliament

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:23.552
Square in London had “was a racist” written in red after his name.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:27.662
As a result, his statue was covered in protective

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:31.072
material so that it did not suffer any further damage.

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:37.972
This caused huge controversy in the UK, with some powerful right-wing newspapers

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:42.952
arguing that it was a disgrace that a national hero was being attacked,

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:49.102
while protestors on the other side argued that he was far from a hero.

00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:55.962
In this episode, the first of two about Churchill, we are going to do three things:

00:03:56.992 --> 00:04:03.322
Firstly, to outline his remarkable career and his profound influence on the Second World War;

00:04:04.012 --> 00:04:09.292
Secondly, to assess his influence on the so-called post-World War II order;

00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:15.472
and finally, whilst considering the influence he continues to have on British culture

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:20.662
and the way in which the British view themselves and their history, we will consider

00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:26.452
whether the accusations made against him are justified, and to what extent they matter.

00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:34.712
And as a little bonus, we will end with a brief list of surprising facts about this remarkable man.

00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:41.742
So, firstly, to the extraordinary life of Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill.

00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:48.082
Let us start with an amazing thought to do with the length of his working life:

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:55.072
he became an officer in the British army in the reign of Queen Victoria and, five

00:04:55.122 --> 00:05:01.612
monarchs later, the current Queen Elizabeth II was on the throne when he died in 1965.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.220
To give you an example of quite how much change he lived through, as a young soldier he took part

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.480
in some of the last cavalry charges ever - battles between men on horses armed with large swords;

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:24.225
yet when he was Prime Minister for the second time in 1952, he heard the news of the successful

00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:30.925
development of the first hydrogen bomb, the yet more powerful successor to the atomic bomb.

00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:35.955
There is so much that is colourful and extraordinary about

00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:39.575
this man’s life so we will need to be ultra-selective.

00:05:40.885 --> 00:05:45.355
He was remarkable in the range of careers that he followed: soldier,

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:50.855
journalist, historian, lecturer, politician, not to mention the hobbies

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:55.915
that he threw himself into – painting, primarily, but also brick laying.

00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:03.905
Born in 1874 into a highly privileged aristocratic and wealthy family, he not only

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:10.145
had a famous politician as a father, but also one of the most admired and celebrated

00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:15.225
British war heroes, John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough, as an ancestor.

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:22.125
As a thank you and a tribute to John Churchill for his victories over the French in

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:27.445
the War of the Spanish Succession, the country built him one of its grandest palaces

00:06:27.565 --> 00:06:33.055
in beautiful, landscaped grounds just north of Oxford, it was called Blenheim Palace.

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:37.875
Blenheim Palace was not only where Winston Churchill was born in

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:43.565
1894 but also where he proposed marriage to the American, Clementine

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:47.745
Hozier, and where he and she spent the start of their honeymoon.

00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:52.275
Blenheim Palace is actually open to the public, it’s possible

00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:55.705
to visit it today, and I would definitely recommend a trip.

00:06:56.705 --> 00:07:02.585
The reason I mention it now is because it is an important setting to bear in mind when

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:08.535
you consider Churchill‘s career: his heritage or tradition of political and military

00:07:08.535 --> 00:07:15.045
success makes his ambition, drive and sense of historical destiny much more understandable.

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:21.779
Young Winston was acutely aware of his own talents and seems, from

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.259
an early age, to have had an unusual sense of his own destiny.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:31.989
In a letter to Violet Bonham-Carter, a lifelong friend, he wrote in

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:37.989
1906: “We are all worms, but I do believe that I am a glow-worm”.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.539
Glow-worms are the worms that give off light in the darkness.

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:48.619
Self-belief, courage, resourcefulness and the connections he had in

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:52.799
the ruling establishment – so that's the people at the top of British

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:57.709
society – this all meant that he became famous very early on in his life.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.999
His first taste of celebrity came during the Boer War in South Africa.

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:10.619
He had travelled to South Africa as a journalist in 1899, taking with him a

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:16.559
collection of servants and a vast liquor cabinet containing 18 bottles of whisky.

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:21.379
He was on an armoured train when it was attacked by the Boers.

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:26.519
Despite being only a journalist, he jumped into action and

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.449
bravely defended the train, taking command of the British troops.

00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:38.269
He was captured and kept as a prisoner of war, deep in enemy territory, but he managed to escape.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.559
There was a huge manhunt to try to find him, but he managed to

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:48.429
evade capture, which turned him into a national celebrity overnight.

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.909
He had a great talent for writing, and wrote a

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:56.189
best-selling book about his adventures during the Boer War.

00:08:56.969 --> 00:09:01.079
Even more profitable than selling books was a lecture tour of the

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:05.519
United States, where he cultivated his talent for public speaking.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:09.749
But he didn’t have his heart set on becoming a writer.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:14.719
He wanted to make as much money as possible from writing so that he would have

00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:19.589
complete financial independence in order to pursue his career as a politician.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:26.119
He became an MP, a member of parliament, in 1900, and served from

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:32.599
1900 to 1964, apart from a two-year break between 1922 and 1924.

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:37.919
This still makes him the longest serving MP in British history.

00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:43.939
And although he belonged to two different political parties during the course of

00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:48.489
his life – the Liberals and the Conservatives – his own distinctive approach to

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:53.819
political life often did not naturally fall within the boundaries of political

00:09:53.819 --> 00:09:59.569
parties, and he was not afraid to propose controversial, unorthodox ideas.

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:07.409
During the 1st World War, as Minister of War, he proposed a bold military move in order to

00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:14.199
unlock the stalemate, the deadlock, that was causing so many deaths on the Western Front.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:19.629
The idea was to open up a new front through the invasion

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:23.119
of Gallipoli on the Dardanelles Peninsula in Turkey.

00:10:23.849 --> 00:10:30.149
This complicated naval and military plan failed spectacularly, resulting in the

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:35.369
deaths of a quarter of a million allied soldiers; Churchill‘s reputation was

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:41.239
severely damaged as a result, and throughout his political career he was taunted,

00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:46.649
he was made fun of, by his opponents with the phrase “Remember the Dardanelles”.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.949
It took him quite some time to recover, and it was during

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:55.819
the 1930s when Churchill again came to political prominence.

00:10:56.769 --> 00:11:02.229
The background to this was that, as a response to the popularity of pacifism,

00:11:02.259 --> 00:11:08.127
or the idea of “No more war”, and the tragic loss of young life in World War I,

00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:13.429
the Western democracies were trying to cut down the size of their armed forces.

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:16.699
The word for this in English is disarmament.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:23.109
Britain and France felt that they should do this, partly in order that Germany did not

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:28.979
have the justification to build up its army; however, Churchill, who called out the

00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:35.229
nasty actions of the fascists from early on, felt that disarmament was leading to a

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:41.459
disastrous situation whereby the fascist powers would have superior military strength.

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:47.819
In retrospect, he had the vision to see what was happening: that the two prominent

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:53.839
European dictators who had come to power in the 1920s, so, Adolf Hitler in Germany and

00:11:53.869 --> 00:11:59.579
Benito Mussolini in Italy, they were building up their armies, navies and air forces.

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:05.599
Churchill, who had learnt to fly in the early years of aviation, was a

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:09.899
particularly strong campaigner for Britain to build up its air force.

00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:15.149
Alas, or unfortunately, the government did not act on his proposals.

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:19.999
Along with the policy of disarmament, the British Prime Minister,

00:12:20.099 --> 00:12:24.159
Neville Chamberlain, led a policy of appeasement towards Hitler; this

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:28.689
meant trying to keep Hitler happy through conceding or giving in to him.

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:36.599
Churchill opposed this policy energetically; for example, when in September 1938, Chamberlain

00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:42.429
came back from Germany with the so-called Munich Agreement, waving the treaty in the air and

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:49.849
saying it represented “Peace in our time”, Churchill called it “a total and unmitigated defeat.”

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:55.389
When finally, Czechoslovakia having already been sacrificed to the Nazis,

00:12:55.709 --> 00:13:01.439
Poland was invaded in September 1939, it became clear to everyone that

00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:06.459
these policies of disarmament and appeasement had failed disastrously.

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:12.159
Chamberlain fell out of favour, and was replaced by Churchill, who became Prime Minister

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:18.339
and led a coalition government which was in power for the wartime years of 1940 to 1945.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:26.669
With the defeat of France in June 1940 and the chaotic evacuation of British and French

00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:33.769
troops from Dunkirk in France, Britain‘s situation was terrible: Russia was in its temporary

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:40.159
alliance with Germany; the USA remained neutral; and Hitler‘s main focus was therefore on

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:46.539
continuing his march westwards, with the invasion of the British Isles a strong possibility.

00:13:47.289 --> 00:13:52.159
At this time there were plenty of British politicians who, under a different

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:57.469
person’s leadership, would have wanted to seek peace with Hitler through some form of

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:03.489
concession – thereby giving in and falling under German control in one way or another.

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:09.989
Churchill‘s repeated, powerful statements against the horrors of the Nazi regime

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:14.879
meant that there was no possibility of seeking to find agreement with the Nazis.

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:19.619
We will go into this in detail in the next episode, but here

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:24.279
is just a little taste of his oratory, of how he used language.

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:29.699
In Parliament he warned against German aggression and refers

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:34.569
to how “the concentration camps pockmarked the German soil”.

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:39.669
Pockmarked means covered by the scars that are left after spots on your skin.

00:14:40.569 --> 00:14:45.799
His sense of destiny and history were evident when, with Britain in a

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:51.309
dangerous situation and morale low, he referred to the “high honour” of

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:56.039
the British being the “sole champions now in arms” against Nazi tyranny.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:02.329
During the darkest of times, with the retreat from Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain,

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:07.269
which was when the air forces of the two countries fought in the skies above Southern

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:12.689
England, and the Blitz, which was the German bombing of English cities, Churchill

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:18.359
rallied the British public, he encouraged the public, through his famous speeches.

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:24.969
His words had a powerful effect on national morale through speeches such as “We will

00:15:24.969 --> 00:15:29.439
fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds…we shall never surrender.”

00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:34.399
And, as we know, Britain did not surrender, the US joined

00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:37.459
the war effort, and Hitler and the Nazis were defeated.

00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:43.429
Although for many people the reputation of Churchill is mainly based in the

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:48.339
period between the fall of France and the arrival of the USA as an ally in

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:53.629
the war in December 1941, he had a significant impact in creating the shape of

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:59.339
alliances and the institutions which have influenced all our lives since 1945.

00:15:59.969 --> 00:16:03.659
Let me try to describe to you how Churchill did this.

00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:09.319
He had a good knowledge of the USA, partly based on his mother‘s American

00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:14.629
heritage, but also on visits there, such as his lecture tour in his 20s.

00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:21.669
He had cultivated the American President, Franklin Roosevelt, or FDR, from the early days

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:28.019
of the war, persuading him to lend Britain military equipment in order to resist the Nazis.

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:34.099
As soon as the USA joined the war in December 1941, Churchill went

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:39.529
straightaway to visit Roosevelt in order to plan the next stage of the war.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:45.059
They also started to talk about how the post-war order should be arranged.

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:48.029
Central to this was the United Nations.

00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:54.109
Other significant institutions were founded to prevent the recurrences of future

00:16:54.149 --> 00:16:59.629
economic depressions that had helped the growth of fascism; so institutions

00:16:59.829 --> 00:17:04.089
such as the World Bank and the Bretton Woods agreement were also established.

00:17:05.159 --> 00:17:09.619
As for Europe, Churchill had a clear vision for some form of

00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:13.659
United States of Europe, with France and Germany at its core.

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:20.049
Although he had tried to reach agreements with Stalin, the leader of the USSR, Stalin‘s

00:17:20.049 --> 00:17:26.079
determination to control Eastern Europe and the fact that his armies had advanced so far meant

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:32.109
that all the promises given by Stalin to Churchill about democratic elections meant nothing.

00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:37.065
In the end, Soviet military might and Communist authoritarian

00:17:37.065 --> 00:17:40.765
rule were to dominate Eastern Europe for almost 45 years.

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:45.075
Churchill saw what was happening: he had an instinct, you

00:17:45.075 --> 00:17:49.065
could say a knack or skill, of seeing the shape of the future.

00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:56.995
Speaking in Fulton, Missouri in the USA in 1946 he first used the words which came

00:17:56.995 --> 00:18:02.155
to describe the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, saying: “From Stettin in the

00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:08.005
Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.”

00:18:09.115 --> 00:18:14.315
Churchill wasn’t the first person to use that phrase, but he was the most famous.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:18.565
And it stuck, it has remained the most common way of describing

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:22.845
the division between East and Western Europe during that era.

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:29.985
Now, to the complex question of Churchill‘s iconic status and the accusations of racism.

00:18:31.065 --> 00:18:36.865
The debate over Britain‘s role within Europe and the resulting withdrawal from the European Union

00:18:37.175 --> 00:18:44.285
revived the image of Churchill; for Brexit supporters, the idea of the revival of British greatness

00:18:44.385 --> 00:18:50.235
is linked closely with the image of Churchill and a time when Britain was a global superpower.

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:55.585
But opponents of Brexit see such ideas as dangerous dreams of

00:18:55.745 --> 00:19:00.105
a time or era which has gone for ever, it no longer exists.

00:19:00.795 --> 00:19:07.355
There is no doubt that Churchill‘s own writings and the memory of him in popular folklore has had

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:13.315
a strong influence on how British and colonial history was taught in schools until quite recently.

00:19:13.955 --> 00:19:18.755
In other words, as the vote in 2002 showed, Churchill and what he

00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:22.725
stands for is still a powerful force in the British imagination.

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:24.785
But, was he a racist?

00:19:25.315 --> 00:19:31.625
By today‘s standards, undoubtedly yes; but a high proportion of his contemporaries, people

00:19:31.765 --> 00:19:36.455
living at the same time as him, would also be viewed as racists by today’s standards.

00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:41.205
This isn’t by any means to excuse his views, but to try

00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:44.195
to understand them in the context of the time he lived in.

00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:48.405
He certainly viewed white people as superior to other

00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:51.965
races - in some kind of a social Darwinian hierarchy.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:58.325
Although he held these views that we would now find completely unacceptable, this didn’t mean

00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:05.515
that he felt it was right to treat non-white people in an inhumane way and, even from his early

00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:11.105
days in British Imperial India, he objected strongly when he saw this behaviour taking place.

00:20:11.655 --> 00:20:15.585
However, there is one especially serious accusation against

00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:18.535
Churchill of inhumane treatment of people of colour.

00:20:19.065 --> 00:20:25.765
This was in 1943 when he failed to take action in order to help limit deaths through famine in

00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:31.155
Bengal, a region in North East India, which was still part of The British Empire at the time.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:37.565
He insisted that India continued to export rice in order to support the European

00:20:37.565 --> 00:20:42.565
war effort - in other words to feed Europeans who might not have enough to eat.

00:20:43.195 --> 00:20:46.965
The problem was, exporting the rice abroad would mean

00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:50.085
that the people in Bengal would suffer food shortages.

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:57.195
It is thought that Churchill’s decision made the situation much worse; a cyclone and flooding

00:20:57.205 --> 00:21:04.385
were also factors but Churchill’s policy was a major cause of the deaths of three million people.

00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:08.945
There are plenty of other racist accusations that can be made against

00:21:08.945 --> 00:21:13.625
Churchill – anti-Semitism in particular; but again, there are contradictions.

00:21:14.725 --> 00:21:21.075
Yes, he was certainly guilty of the casual anti-Semitism which was an element of so many of the

00:21:21.245 --> 00:21:27.275
British ruling class of the time, but he was also an ardent supporter of the foundation of Israel.

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:34.725
In July 1944 he also acted swiftly to stop, or at least limit the amount

00:21:34.745 --> 00:21:39.365
of, Hungarian Jews who were being sent to concentration camps by the Nazis.

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:46.065
And closer to home, although he was accused of using violent methods to stop Welsh

00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:51.155
workers who were on strike or refusing to work, he was a strong supporter of the

00:21:51.305 --> 00:21:56.815
reform of working conditions and an early architect of the modern welfare state.

00:21:57.905 --> 00:22:03.855
In conclusion, the length of his political career - remember, the longest political career in

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:10.145
British history - and the extreme demands of what he faced in World War II meant he faced thousands

00:22:10.165 --> 00:22:17.185
of critical decisions; for sure, he had his faults and his failings, but the positive effect he had

00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:24.795
on the world in keeping the torch of liberal democracy burning between 1940-45 means that there are

00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:31.375
certainly some strong arguments that his virtues and his positive impact far outweigh his failings.

00:22:32.445 --> 00:22:39.215
I will leave the last words on this to Queen Elizabeth II and also to Churchill‘s political opponent

00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:45.805
and successor as Prime Minister, Clement Atlee; they were made after Churchill’s death in 1965.

00:22:46.714 --> 00:22:49.454
The Queen described him as “a national hero”.

00:22:50.134 --> 00:22:54.464
And Clement Atlee remarked on how Churchill combined to a remarkable

00:22:54.464 --> 00:22:59.204
extent “energy and poetry“, saying that he was “the greatest Englishman

00:22:59.264 --> 00:23:03.474
of our time – I think the greatest citizen of the world of our time.“

00:23:04.651 --> 00:23:09.650
OK, so that is a brief summary of the life of Winston Churchill, and we will

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.860
learn more about the rhetoric and the language of the man in the next episode.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:20.110
But, as promised, let’s end with a few weird and wonderful facts about this amazing man.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.930
Firstly, near death experiences: there were many.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.870
For a man who believed he was destined for greatness, he was

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.880
certainly careless about his personal safety and he loved danger.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.640
When he was 18 years old, playing with his 12-year-old brother and 14-year-old

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:45.440
cousin, he jumped off a bridge and fell almost 9 metres, landing on the hard ground.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.980
He was almost killed, and spent 3 months in bed recovering.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:56.170
He had several plane crashes, he nearly drowned in a lake, he consistently fell from

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:01.460
running horses, and was knocked down and almost killed by a car whilst visiting New York.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.270
What’s more, he actively chose to become a soldier

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.210
in World War One, and served on the Western Front.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.400
It’s remarkable that he lived as long as he did.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:18.020
His working regime often involved him working until three or four o' clock in the morning.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.800
He would sleep for a short period, four or five hours, then eat

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.740
a very large cooked breakfast and continue to work from his bed.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.860
As well as loving those big fat cigars, he did not hold back with

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:36.600
alcoholic drinks, loving fine wine, champagne and brandy especially.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:42.800
He began with “a daily whisky mouthwash” he called it, and it is estimated

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:48.130
that he drank 42,000 bottles of Pol Roger champagne during his lifetime.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:55.110
Again, with a lifestyle and diet like that, it is even more amazing that he lived to 90 years old.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.790
And back to his political life, after victory in Europe there was a general election.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.260
Although Churchill was widely credited with leading the country very

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.390
well through the war, Britons chose a Labour government with a radical

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.390
programme of social reform, and a new prime minister was chosen.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.270
But Churchill’s relationship with politics didn’t end there.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:23.430
He was to remain an MP, albeit in the opposition, until the ripe old age of 89.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:30.240
So, while there is certainly plenty of value in debating some of the views that Churchill held,

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:37.320
and the policies that he presided over, it is undeniable that he lived a fascinating life, shaped

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:43.130
the world that we all live in today, and was one of the most important figures of the 20th century

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:51.700
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Winston Churchill, A British Icon.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.940
As a reminder, in the next episode we will talk about his language, and how he used English

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.860
to galvanise and excite the British population, and the entire English-speaking world.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.110
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.230
What do people think of Churchill in your country?

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.040
How is he remembered, if at all?

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:15.906
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:19.766
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:25.216
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are talking about Henry Kissinger.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:30.296
To some, he was a legendary diplomat, responsible for saving the

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:34.506
world from nuclear war and bringing peace when there was conflict.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:40.946
To others, he was the world’s greatest threat to democracy, a war criminal and a

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:45.806
heartless megalomaniac responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people.

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:51.326
He was nothing if not controversial, so let’s not waste a minute

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:55.456
and learn about the extraordinary life of Henry Kissinger.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:01:00.736
If you look down the list of people who have won The Nobel

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:04.156
Peace Prize, you’ll probably see some familiar names.

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:08.976
Mother Teresa, a Catholic nun who was awarded the prize in

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:13.506
1979 for "her work for bringing help to suffering humanity."

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:19.796
Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights activist who earned the prize in 1964

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:24.836
for “his non-violent struggle for civil rights for the Afro-American population."

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:33.646
And even going further back, in 1944 an organisation, the International Committee of the Red Cross,

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:39.146
was awarded the prize "for the great work it performed during the war on behalf of humanity."

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.966
All relatively uncontroversial so far.

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:50.166
But go to 1973, and you’ll see that the prize was shared by two

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:56.676
men: A Vietnamese man, Lê Đức Thọ, and an American, Henry Kissinger.

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:04.236
They were awarded the prize for “jointly having negotiated a ceasefire in Vietnam."

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:10.526
In his acceptance speech, Kissinger spoke passionately about the importance

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:16.179
of peace in an increasingly complex world, saying, and I quote directly:

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:22.316
“America’s goal is the building of a structure of peace, a peace in which all

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:27.596
nations have a stake and therefore to which all nations have a commitment.

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:35.736
We are seeking a stable world, not as an end in itself but as a bridge to

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:41.946
the realisation of man’s noble aspirations of tranquillity and community.”

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:43.226
END QUOTE.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:51.846
Impressive words, “a stable world…tranquillity and community”, it all sounds very enticing.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:59.256
But not everyone was buying it, and there were many who thought that Kissinger was one of the

00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:06.566
world’s greatest threats to world stability, that he was an enemy of tranquillity and community.

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:13.776
In fact, he would go from winning this globally recognised prize to being the subject of

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:20.646
a famous book called “The Trial of Henry Kissinger”, in which the author puts Kissinger on

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:28.046
trial for war crimes in Vietnam, Bangladesh, East Timor, Chile, and even the United States.

00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:33.276
To better understand how it got to this, and who Henry

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:37.026
Kissinger really was, we need to go right back to the start.

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:43.636
He was German by birth, born Heinz Alfred Kissinger in 1923.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:50.786
He was also Jewish, and when it became clear that Nazi Germany was not going to be a safe

00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:57.566
place for Jewish people, his family fled Germany, seeking a new life in the United States.

00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:07.046
This was in 1938, and the 15-year-old Kissinger arrived in America not speaking a word of English.

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:13.906
He learned quickly, but it wasn’t long before he found himself back in Europe,

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:19.476
this time as an American soldier fighting his own countrymen, the Germans.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:26.886
He was initially destined for the front, as a regular soldier, but he was noticed by

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:31.896
another German immigrant, Fritz Kraemer, who recognised both the fact that the young

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:38.226
Kissinger could speak fluent German and that he was clearly gifted, he was very intelligent.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:42.836
As a result he was transferred to the military intelligence

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:46.086
service, where his skills could be put to better use.

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:52.476
Kissinger distinguished himself during the war, and would later say that it was

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:57.716
during this time that he started to think of himself as an American, not a German.

00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:04.166
And it would be Fritz Kramer, the same German immigrant that first spotted

00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:09.776
Kissinger’s talents, who advised the young man to raise his post-war ambitions.

00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:15.806
At this point he had thought of perhaps going to university and getting a job

00:05:15.806 --> 00:05:21.166
as an accountant, or some kind of respectable but not world-changing career.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.146
Kraemer saw Kissinger’s potential, and encouraged him to aim higher.

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:32.026
When he got back from the war, Kissinger sent off

00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:35.706
applications to the top universities in the United States.

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:41.646
He got rejection letter after rejection letter, until finally one said

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:46.956
yes: Harvard University, the most prestigious university in the country.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.106
He excelled at Harvard, majoring in political science.

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:56.496
He stayed on afterwards as an academic, and developed

00:05:56.696 --> 00:06:00.106
his own unique sense of politics and diplomacy.

00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:03.886
This was in the mid 1950s.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:10.166
The Cold War was in full swing, and new alliances were being sought between nations.

00:06:11.256 --> 00:06:18.276
Underpinning all of this was the threat not just of nuclear war, but of nuclear destruction.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:24.186
The US had a growing stockpile of nuclear weapons, as did the USSR.

00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:32.226
From the American side, if the Soviets fired a weapon it seemed like there were only two choices,

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:38.776
retaliate in full, raining down nuclear weapons on the Soviet Union, which would most likely end

00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:44.696
in a serious counterattack, with the destruction of much of both the US and the Soviet Union.

00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:51.846
This was clearly in nobody’s interests, it would result in mutually assured destruction.

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:58.456
And the second choice, the alternative, was to simply give in,

00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:03.256
not retaliate at all in order to avoid this nuclear holocaust.

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:10.356
Of course, neither of these two choices were good outcomes for either side, or for the world.

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:16.386
And from a US foreign policy perspective, this position didn’t

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:19.966
give the US much negotiating power with the Soviet Union.

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:27.846
Kissinger’s first somewhat revolutionary political idea was to find some kind of middle ground.

00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:35.006
He favoured fighting the Soviets with localised, small-scale force, and backing

00:07:35.006 --> 00:07:39.806
this up with the threat of using nuclear weapons on a small-scale level.

00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:45.656
He outlined this theory in a hugely influential work called

00:07:45.886 --> 00:07:50.593
Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy, which he published in 1957.

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:58.996
This theory might sound relatively sensible and obvious to us now, but it wasn’t at the time.

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:03.656
And it was this idea that started to get this

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:07.696
thirtysomething political scientist noticed in Washington DC.

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:15.306
He served as an advisor and consultant, both to the US government and on the failed

00:08:15.346 --> 00:08:20.886
Presidential campaign of a man called Nelson Rockefeller, of the famous Rockefeller dynasty.

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:28.756
He might not have got “his man” into the White House, but his talents had caught the attention of

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:36.216
Richard Nixon, who appointed Kissinger as his National Security Advisor when he took office in 1969.

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:42.826
Now, let me give you a quick reminder of what was going on in the world, especially

00:08:42.826 --> 00:08:47.726
related to US foreign policy, when Kissinger took his first political role.

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:53.436
The Vietnam War had entered its 14th year, with no end in sight.

00:08:54.546 --> 00:08:57.776
The Cultural Revolution in China was in full flow.

00:08:58.966 --> 00:09:04.686
In the Middle East, during the Six-Day War, Israel gained control over a huge amount of

00:09:04.686 --> 00:09:10.556
territory, including The West Bank, The Gaza Strip, The Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula.

00:09:11.576 --> 00:09:16.666
And in Latin America, there was the rise of Marxist movements combined with

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:21.256
the overthrow of democratically elected governments by fascist regimes.

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:27.536
The political situation all over the world was tense, and, as

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:32.186
National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger got to work right away.

00:09:33.523 --> 00:09:40.413
His main focus was the Vietnam War, which was by this time incredibly unpopular domestically.

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:47.603
It had been dragging on, it was costing the US taxpayer some $30 billion a

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:53.973
year, and hundreds of young Americans were flying home every week in body bags.

00:09:55.403 --> 00:09:59.993
As you heard at the start of the episode, Kissinger would jointly win a Nobel

00:10:00.003 --> 00:10:07.203
Peace Prize for ending the war, but what did he actually do, and did he deserve it?

00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:13.223
Well, there is little debate that the end of the Vietnam War was a

00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:18.163
positive outcome, no war is an improvement from a never ending war.

00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:25.843
But where it starts to get more debatable is what Henry Kissinger’s role was in the war,

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:32.173
what he was prepared to do to end the war, and whether he really deserved any of the credit.

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:39.353
Firstly, he would be accused of delaying the peace negotiations for political gain.

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:46.493
There was going to be a US election in 1972, and he would be accused of delaying

00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:50.403
the peace process because he wanted it to be announced in the lead up to

00:10:50.403 --> 00:10:56.113
the election, so that Richard Nixon, his boss, stood to benefit politically.

00:10:57.633 --> 00:11:02.943
Secondly, he conducted negotiations outside the normal government channels,

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:08.403
he bypassed his colleagues and negotiated directly with the North Vietnamese.

00:11:09.653 --> 00:11:15.213
To his critics, this was an example of the fact that he considered himself superior,

00:11:15.783 --> 00:11:22.413
and that the normal rules didn’t apply to him, but this was only the tip of the iceberg.

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:27.913
Much more importantly, it would emerge that the steps he was willing

00:11:27.913 --> 00:11:33.103
to take went much further than simply ignoring diplomatic protocols.

00:11:34.463 --> 00:11:39.123
It transpired that, without approval from Congress, he had personally

00:11:39.123 --> 00:11:44.443
authorised bombing raids on Cambodia, which was not an active participant

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:48.483
in the war, but was allowing North Vietnamese troops to pass through.

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:54.333
And this wasn’t a one-off, a case of Kissinger trying to get something

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:58.973
done quickly and, as an exception, ignoring the normal channels.

00:12:00.283 --> 00:12:05.093
According to one Pentagon report, so an official source, “Henry A.

00:12:05.133 --> 00:12:13.255
Kissinger approved each of the 3,875  Cambodia bombing raids in 1969 and

00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:18.555
1970” as well as “the methods for keeping them out of the newspaper.”

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:25.345
And in terms of what the impact of these bombing raids was, it’s estimated that

00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:31.945
these were responsible for the deaths of anywhere from 150 to 500,000 people.

00:12:33.475 --> 00:12:37.685
His role in the Vietnam war would be far from his only controversy.

00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:44.045
If you are from Latin America, and certainly if you are from Chile, you may be

00:12:44.045 --> 00:12:48.365
aware of Kissinger’s role in the coup that toppled the democratically elected

00:12:48.365 --> 00:12:53.985
leader, Salvador Allende, replacing him with General Augusto Pinochet, and

00:12:54.115 --> 00:12:59.445
resulting in a military junta which ruled the country for almost two decades.

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:05.975
Now, why was Kissinger getting involved with the domestic politics of Chile, you might be asking?

00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:14.145
Well, Kissinger was a disciple of realpolitik, a system of politics or principles based on

00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:21.195
practical rather than moral or ideological considerations, and he was more than willing to interfere

00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:26.745
with the democracy of other sovereign states, if it served the interests of the United States.

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:32.935
And as you may know, this went on all across Latin America in

00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:37.485
the 1970s and 80s, in something that was called Operation Condor.

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:42.915
Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, the list goes on.

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:49.805
The playbook was simple but effective: if a country looked like it was about to elect a

00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:55.325
leader that was not in the interests of the United States, typically because that leader had

00:13:55.375 --> 00:14:02.405
socialist sympathies, Kissinger and the CIA would do their utmost to stop that person from

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:08.245
gaining power, or if they were already in power, there would be a US-backed military coup.

00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:16.085
And as you will know, these coups were typically brutal, murderous and repressive.

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:23.735
Political adversaries were locked up and tortured, with many disappearing forever without a trace.

00:14:25.105 --> 00:14:31.705
Due to its clandestine nature, estimates vary as to how many people were killed as part of Operation

00:14:31.735 --> 00:14:37.945
Condor, but the numbers are typically thought to be somewhere between 60 and 80,000 people.

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:44.145
And this was all supported and partially enabled by Henry Kissinger.

00:14:45.575 --> 00:14:51.655
Understandably, in many of the countries where this took place, they are calls for justice,

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:57.295
and for Henry Kissinger in particular to be held to account, to be held responsible.

00:14:58.705 --> 00:15:04.815
In 2001, when he was staying at the Ritz in Paris, a French judge attempted to serve

00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:10.515
Kissinger with a court summons, asking him to testify about his role in Operation Condor.

00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:16.865
There are calls in the Argentine and Chilean legal systems to officially summon

00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:21.915
Kissinger to answer questions about particular murders or disappearances of

00:15:21.915 --> 00:15:28.815
civilians, and the Supreme Court of Uruguay has sent an official extradition request.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:38.185
And although he hasn’t held any official US government role since 1977, and he was acting in an

00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:44.925
official not personal capacity, he has had to be very careful about where he travelled, for fear of

00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:51.475
being whisked away and forced to answer for his actions, or for his crimes, as many would put it.

00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:55.925
But, as they say, it wasn’t all bad.

00:15:56.745 --> 00:16:01.875
In the interests of balance, we must take a look at some of the less controversial acts of

00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:08.332
Henry Kissinger, the most famous of which is the rapprochement with China, the normalisation

00:16:08.445 --> 00:16:12.985
of relations between the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China.

00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:19.165
As a brief reminder of what was going on here and why it was important, Mao

00:16:19.165 --> 00:16:24.895
Zedong had come to power in 1949, founding the People’s Republic of China.

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:29.825
The United States had supported his opponents, the

00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:33.205
Nationalist government, which was led by Chiang Kai-Shek.

00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:39.235
The Nationalists were driven out by the Communists, and forced to retreat to Taiwan.

00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:47.175
This is obviously a very brief and simplistic overview, but the point to underline is that

00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:52.485
the United States simply didn’t recognise the new Chinese Communist government, it did

00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:59.495
not accept it as a legitimate nation state, and the two countries had no formal relations.

00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:05.085
Kissinger recognised that this wasn’t a situation that could go on

00:17:05.085 --> 00:17:10.245
forever, and he made it one of his missions to re-engage with China.

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:16.795
He went on a series of secret, undercover trips to Beijing, negotiating with the Chinese

00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:22.725
Premier, Zhou Enlai, which resulted in US President Richard Nixon’s famous trip to China

00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:29.292
in February of 1972, and the resumption of diplomatic relations at the start of 1979.

00:17:30.358 --> 00:17:35.903
Nowadays, a visit by a US President to China might seem like a run-of-the-mill

00:17:36.133 --> 00:17:42.803
diplomatic trip, but it’s hard to overstate just how important and unusual this was.

00:17:43.503 --> 00:17:49.953
The two countries had no official relations, they were ideological enemies, Mao’s Cultural

00:17:49.953 --> 00:17:56.103
Revolution was in full-swing, and there was a sitting US President, from the Republican

00:17:56.103 --> 00:18:02.143
party no less, shaking hands with the leader of the largest Communist country in the world.

00:18:03.263 --> 00:18:08.673
It took some serious diplomacy and statesmanship, for which Kissinger took the credit.

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:14.863
He did a similar thing in the Middle East after the Yom Kippur War in 1973,

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:19.593
going from country to country trying to broker some kind of peace agreement.

00:18:20.912 --> 00:18:26.302
This constant shuttling around, to and from Middle Eastern states, even

00:18:26.302 --> 00:18:30.732
brought a new expression into the English language: “shuttle diplomacy”.

00:18:32.262 --> 00:18:36.312
And it worked, or at least Kissinger was one of several

00:18:36.312 --> 00:18:39.662
people who played an important role in the peace process.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.521
Now, Henry Kissinger was born in 1923.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:51.050
I’m recording this in 2023, a few months after he celebrated his hundredth birthday,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.150
and to this very day he has been commenting on world politics: the Iranian nuclear

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.710
programme, the COVID Pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine, he is very happy to voice his

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.330
opinion on the latest goings on in the world, particularly to do with foreign policy.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.870
And one subject that he has shown a particular interest in, an interest that you

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:20.040
might think is unusual for a man in his hundredth year, is Artificial Intelligence.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:28.260
Yes, “artificial intelligence” might be the expression of the moment, but Kissinger has been talking

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:34.060
about the risks and opportunities posed by artificial intelligence for longer than most people.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:41.630
Back in June of 2018 he wrote an article for The Atlantic magazine with the title

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.580
“How the Enlightenment Ends”, and the subtitle, “Philosophically, intellectually—in

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.170
every way—human society is unprepared for the rise of artificial intelligence.”

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.300
It is, perhaps, unusual.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:01.260
If I ask you to close your eyes and picture an expert on Artificial

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.430
Intelligence, that person probably wasn’t born in the 1920s.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:13.360
Still, the more you learn about Henry Kissinger, the more you realise that, yes, Artificial

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.830
Intelligence is probably exactly the sort of thing that someone like him would be thinking about.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:26.570
He spent his career thinking about the motivations of nation states, how to negotiate, what deals

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:32.710
to do, how to act in the best interests of his adopted country, the United States of America.

00:20:34.186 --> 00:20:39.776
These were hard problems, but they were human problems, problems

00:20:39.776 --> 00:20:44.996
of ego, problems of miscommunication, problems of misunderstanding.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:50.376
He realised that lots of these problems could be solved through diplomacy.

00:20:51.616 --> 00:20:57.006
Sure, you can certainly point out that a “problem” for Henry Kissinger might simply be called

00:20:57.196 --> 00:21:03.146
“democracy” by someone else, but the point is that Kissinger’s career was spent working with,

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:10.596
negotiating with, manipulating you might even say, “people”, confronting human problems.

00:21:12.156 --> 00:21:16.616
What does a world look like with these human problems removed?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.640
He realised relatively early on that Artificial Intelligence changes

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.490
the playing field when it comes to foreign and domestic policy.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.140
An AI can ingest far more information than a human being ever can, and

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.910
it can be programmed to make decisions based on all of this information,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.420
rationally, without letting emotion or prejudice cloud its judgement.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.010
Much like he no doubt looked at his own abilities and thought that he played an important

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:55.770
part in US foreign policy successes because of his superior decision-making abilities,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:01.480
he started to believe that there would be an Artificial Intelligence arms race, with the

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.110
countries with the most sophisticated AIs able to outsmart and outnegotiate the others.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:14.270
Time will only tell if he is right as far as this is concerned, but given the fact

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.960
that he has been studying foreign policy for longer than most people are alive, he

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.770
was working 15 hours a day even as he celebrated his 100th birthday, and he can look

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:30.460
back on his life and see a long list of the impacts he had on countries spanning from

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.200
Chile to Israel, China to Vietnam, it seems foolish to bet against Henry Kissinger.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.330
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Henry Kissinger,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.440
the controversial but undeniably influential US diplomat.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.480
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.310
Was he a War Criminal, Diplomat Extraordinaire, or somewhere in between?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.330
Are you from a country where Henry Kissinger is loved or hated?

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.900
And why was that?

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.560
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

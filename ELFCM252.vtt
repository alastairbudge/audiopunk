Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:17.373
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:21.583
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.563
I'm Alastair Budge and I hope you’re not listening with an

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:29.923
empty stomach because today, we are going to talk about food.

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:36.513
And specifically, we are going to talk about the unusual stories of 5 different,

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.613
everyday foods, foods that you have probably eaten, or at least heard of,

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:48.003
but perhaps you don’t know where they were invented, how, when and by who.

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:53.623
On this culinary journey we’ll talk about the sandwich, tomato

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:59.813
ketchup, fish & chips, chicken tikka masala, and the humble tea bag.

00:01:00.313 --> 00:01:05.703
It is going to be quite the food extravaganza, and I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.740
Now, let’s roll up our sleeves, sit down at the table

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.350
and tuck in to our first unusual food origin story.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.450
And it’s one of a food we all know and probably love.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.810
The sandwich.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.620
Now, before you cry out that “nobody invented the sandwich”, it’s just

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.450
bread and something in the middle, let me add a little disclaimer here.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.350
Yes, people have eaten bread with meat or vegetables on

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.910
top, or between two pieces of bread for thousands of years.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.660
One of the earliest known sandwich lovers was a Babylonian Rabbi named Hillel

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.900
the Elder who was a prominent figure in Jerusalem in the first century BC.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.820
His love of lamb and herbs spread between matzah bread, an unleavened flatbread,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.520
is recorded in The Haggadah, a Jewish text typically read during Passover.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.990
According to the text, the fillings in this sandwich were meant to represent

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.290
the Jews’ suffering, especially the crushed nuts which symbolised the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.180
mortar that Jews used when they were forced to build Egyptian buildings.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:29.796
And this idea of bread with fillings was enjoyed

00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:33.416
throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East for centuries.

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:40.776
But history, or at least English-language history, has a particular date for the invention

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:47.146
of the modern sandwich, and a particular person who is credited with the invention of

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:54.796
this dish that is enjoyed by a whopping 56% of the British population every single day.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:03:04.806
And that date was 1762, and the man, a man named Sir John Montague, the Earl of Sandwich.

00:03:05.597 --> 00:03:09.935
If you are a particularly dedicated listener to this show you will

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.228
remember that one of the first episodes we ever made, episode number

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:20.078
19 in fact, was on this story, but here is a reminder of how it went.

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:26.038
This man, the Earl of Sandwich, was a voracious gambler.

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:32.305
He loved playing cards, and would sit for hours at a time at the card table.

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:38.008
But he was also a human being, and like any of us, he got hungry.

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:47.868
So, one day, so the legend goes, he signalled to a nearby servant to bring him some meat between

00:03:47.868 --> 00:03:54.828
two slices of bread, a meal he could hold in one hand while he kept his cards in the other.

00:03:55.698 --> 00:04:01.218
No knife and fork were needed, and he could continue to take bites out of this

00:04:01.218 --> 00:04:07.078
little parcel of food while he presumably lost more and more money at the card table.

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:13.608
Before long people in fashionable clubs of London started saying “I’ll

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:19.208
have what Sandwich is having”, and this was shortened just to “sandwich”.

00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:23.588
It turns out that sandwiches are quite nice even if you

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:26.968
aren’t sitting at a card table, but the name remained.

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:33.658
So, there you go, the British might not have invented the concept of the sandwich,

00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:40.118
but a British man is now forever associated with its name and popularisation.

00:04:41.768 --> 00:04:45.508
While we’re on the subject of sandwiches, this leads us

00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:50.068
nicely on to talk about a sauce that you might find in one.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:57.838
If you open any fridge in the UK, you’ll likely see a bottle of this lurking on the shelf.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:06.285
Some might say it’s the superhero of condiments: tomato ketchup, or simply “ketchup”.

00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:14.975
This famous red sauce is both savoury and sweet, but it actually didn’t start out that way.

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:21.135
The name ‘ketchup’ actually comes from the Hokkien Chinese word ‘kê-tsiap’,

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:26.775
a type of fermented fish which the Vietnamese used to make the sauce.

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:32.715
It was later brought to China by traders who popularised it in the region.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:37.785
It’s believed that the British first encountered the mysterious

00:05:37.785 --> 00:05:42.085
sauce in the late 17th century on a trip to southeast Asia.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:47.505
After falling in love with it, they tried to recreate

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:52.272
it using anchovies, mushrooms, oysters and walnuts.

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:57.952
It doesn’t sound that nice to me, but it was certainly loved by some people.

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:04.472
It’s said to have been a favourite of Jane Austen, the author of novels

00:06:04.472 --> 00:06:09.472
such as Pride and Prejudice, who often added it to her meat and fish.

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:14.439
But it was still missing a vital ingredient: the tomato.

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:23.782
In 1812 an American horticulturist named James Mease took some tomatoes, and mixed

00:06:23.852 --> 00:06:30.822
their pulp with brandy and spices to create the first published tomato ketchup recipe.

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:39.102
Although this bore very little resemblance to the original Asian ‘ke-tsiap’, it was delicious.

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:44.832
This tomato ketchup was also significantly easier to store

00:06:45.302 --> 00:06:49.372
than its mushroom ancestor but it was by no means perfect.

00:06:50.482 --> 00:06:52.782
The tomato season was short.

00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:57.582
Storing tomato pulp proved difficult, and some producers

00:06:57.742 --> 00:07:02.612
stored it so poorly that it grew bacteria, yeast or mould.

00:07:03.352 --> 00:07:06.612
Of course, there were plenty of attempts to preserve

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:10.552
the sauce, including using the preservative benzoate.

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:17.760
And by 1837, it had started to be put into bottles and sold across America.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.110
Finally, tomato sauce seemed to keep for a long time, meaning

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.670
it could be bought and kept in the cupboard without going bad.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.810
Remember, we’re still 100 years before mass adoption of fridges here.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.550
So, it was quite the triumph when it seemed that ketchup could finally be kept for a long time.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:46.140
Indeed, Heinz, a company that would later become famous for its tomato ketchup, ran an advertising

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:52.260
campaign with the slogan: "Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!"

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.980
The relief was because ketchup no longer needed to be made from scratch whenever

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.680
someone wanted to eat it - it could be pre-bought and it would keep for a long time.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:09.300
But, these preservatives were dangerous, they were unsafe, and when benzoate was

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.320
finally banned in 1906 the ketchup producers needed to find another solution.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.350
Luckily, the solution was right in front of them.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:25.960
All that was required was ripe, red tomatoes, which have a higher level of

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.180
natural preservatives and were lower in a particular acid called pectin.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.178
And the rest of the history of ketchup is, as they say, history.

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:42.218
Now, our next food is one that can be enjoyed with ketchup, but if

00:08:42.218 --> 00:08:47.468
you are a real purist you will have it only with salt and vinegar.

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:49.668
Fish and chips.

00:08:50.468 --> 00:08:54.808
Again, we did one very early episode on this, it’s Episode

00:08:54.808 --> 00:08:59.618
number 17, but here is the abridged, the concise, version.

00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:04.838
A bit like the sandwich, the origin of fish and chips

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.368
is shared between the Jewish community and Britain.

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:15.708
It all started in the 15th century after Spain expelled its Jewish population,

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:20.888
sending thousands of Jews fleeing to neighbouring countries like Portugal.

00:09:22.008 --> 00:09:27.998
In Jewish culture, it is forbidden to cook on the Jewish Sabbath or Shabat.

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:36.078
That means that from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, the kitchen was off limits.

00:09:37.328 --> 00:09:43.888
To follow this religious requirement, Jewish people needed to prepare food before the

00:09:43.888 --> 00:09:50.093
sun went down on Friday, and this food needed to be good to eat for twenty four hours.

00:09:51.643 --> 00:09:57.863
One of those foods was a white fish like cod or haddock, fried in flour.

00:09:58.913 --> 00:10:02.133
The flour preserved the fish so that it could be eaten

00:10:02.193 --> 00:10:06.007
cold the following day and still have some flavour.

00:10:07.113 --> 00:10:12.953
When Portugal fell under Spanish rule, the Sephardic Jews fled to England,

00:10:13.253 --> 00:10:17.783
bringing their culture and recipes with them, including the fried fish.

00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:24.243
In order to fit in and behave more like the local, Christian, population,

00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:28.603
which was not meant to eat meat on a Friday, and so tended to eat

00:10:28.603 --> 00:10:33.773
fish, the new Jewish immigrants cooked this fried fish on a Friday.

00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:40.633
As it was a dish that fitted both the Jewish and Christian requirements – and was

00:10:40.653 --> 00:10:46.033
evidently pretty tasty – the Jewish immigrants would sell it to the local population.

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:50.503
Initially, it was sold on its own, without chips.

00:10:51.163 --> 00:10:54.573
And the identity of the person who first had the

00:10:54.603 --> 00:10:59.293
genius idea to serve it with chips is somewhat debated.

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:04.183
It’s thought to have been a young, Jewish immigrant named Joseph

00:11:04.183 --> 00:11:09.593
Malin, who opened up the first fish and chip shop in London in 1863.

00:11:10.263 --> 00:11:15.443
However there is evidence of another fish and chip shop being opened at almost

00:11:15.443 --> 00:11:20.373
exactly the same time by another man in Oldham, in the north of the country.

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:27.343
In any case, it was an instant hit, a surefire success, and fish

00:11:27.343 --> 00:11:31.723
and chips became an unofficial national dish for Great Britain.

00:11:32.673 --> 00:11:38.593
By 1910 there were over 20,000 fish and chip shops around the UK and

00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:44.253
during WW1 the Prime Minister tried to boost morale by keeping shops open.

00:11:45.273 --> 00:11:50.353
Fish and chips became such a part of British culture that when the British

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:55.603
soldiers stormed beaches in Normandy in World War II they reportedly called

00:11:55.603 --> 00:12:01.883
out to each other by shouting “fish” and the other would respond with “chips”.

00:12:02.683 --> 00:12:06.423
This helped them find each other in the chaos of battle.

00:12:06.983 --> 00:12:13.703
And even today, when the country has been assaulted by American fast food outlets, the

00:12:13.703 --> 00:12:20.603
fish and chip shop reigns supreme, with over 8 fish and chip shops for every one McDonald’s

00:12:21.433 --> 00:12:28.323
Now, in case you didn’t realise it before, Britain is a big of a magpie when it comes to food.

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:35.943
A magpie is the black and white bird that steals shiny things to bring back and put in its nest.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:41.473
And if you didn’t believe it before, the next item on the menu is going

00:12:41.473 --> 00:12:46.513
to be yet another example, albeit this time of a food that many British

00:12:46.513 --> 00:12:52.693
people believe to be Indian, but is actually, so the story goes, Scottish.

00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:58.543
And it too is a rival for the UK’s national dish.

00:12:59.063 --> 00:13:05.843
You might not have heard of it unless you have been to the UK, but it’s called chicken tikka masala.

00:13:07.013 --> 00:13:12.163
In case you don’t know what I’m talking about, chicken tikka masala consists of a

00:13:12.163 --> 00:13:19.423
boneless chicken cooked over a charcoal fire, and served with a tomato-cream sauce.

00:13:20.453 --> 00:13:25.313
And the legend of where it comes from goes something like this.

00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:34.273
In 1971, on a dark night in Glasgow, in Scotland, a bus driver, tired from his long

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:41.263
shift, came into an Indian restaurant with a Pakistani cook, and ordered a chicken curry.

00:13:42.793 --> 00:13:49.513
After taking one bite, he sent it back to the kitchen complaining that the curry was too dry.

00:13:50.643 --> 00:13:55.183
We Brits don’t tend to eat much dry meat, our meat

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:59.411
normally comes smothered, covered, in gravy and sauce.

00:14:00.478 --> 00:14:06.773
According to the cook’s son, his father was suffering from an ulcer and had

00:14:06.773 --> 00:14:11.753
a pan of tomato soup on the stove cooking that he was planning to eat later.

00:14:13.413 --> 00:14:19.263
To try and please the customer, he improvised and put his tomato soup,

00:14:19.623 --> 00:14:25.113
some yoghurt and some spices, on top of the supposedly “dry” curry.

00:14:26.263 --> 00:14:31.463
When the dish returned to the table, the bus driver’s eyes lit up.

00:14:31.953 --> 00:14:38.033
He took his fork, lifted it up to his mouth, and instantly fell in love with the dish.

00:14:38.823 --> 00:14:42.063
He kept coming back to the restaurant with friends to order

00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:46.133
it again and eventually, the restaurant put it on the menu.

00:14:47.123 --> 00:14:50.973
It has now become a favourite dish for many Brits, and

00:14:51.183 --> 00:14:55.113
is something of a staple in Indian restaurants in the UK.

00:14:56.143 --> 00:15:01.713
In 2001, it even achieved the high praise of the then British Foreign

00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:06.583
Secretary, Robin Cook, who called it a symbol of multicultural Britain.

00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:12.403
I should add that there are plenty of people who say that this story is

00:15:12.593 --> 00:15:17.643
folklore, that there is nothing really British about chicken tikka masala.

00:15:18.223 --> 00:15:24.993
Indeed, the “tikka” part suggests that its origins are significantly older, and that the

00:15:25.003 --> 00:15:31.273
story goes back 5,000 years to a Mughal emperor who was tired of choking on chicken bones.

00:15:31.783 --> 00:15:38.573
But while we will never know the true origin of this dish, it is a British favourite and has

00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:45.673
this peculiar status of being a supposedly “Indian” dish that you are unlikely to find in any

00:15:45.693 --> 00:15:52.833
Indian restaurants in India, and indeed was perhaps created by a Pakistani cook in Scotland.

00:15:53.863 --> 00:15:58.973
Now, our final unusual food origin is related to tea.

00:15:59.693 --> 00:16:05.563
We aren’t talking about tea itself – and again if you are a dedicated listener you

00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:12.233
will remember that we covered that in episode 238 – but today we are talking about

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:18.793
the tea bag, the small bag with tea leaves that you dip into hot water to make tea.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:25.043
Like chicken tikka masala, the tea bag was invented completely by accident.

00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:30.913
But even more so, its inventor wasn’t even trying to invent it.

00:16:32.483 --> 00:16:37.233
Before the invention of the tea bag, tea drinkers had to make a whole

00:16:37.293 --> 00:16:42.263
pot of tea, pouring boiling water over the tea leaves in a strainer.

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:47.903
If you make your tea like this, you will know that it can get a bit messy,

00:16:48.123 --> 00:16:53.669
and having a tea bag is, well, it’s a lot easier and more convenient.

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:57.909
So, it won’t surprise you to find out that this was a

00:16:57.929 --> 00:17:01.239
problem tea drinkers were thinking about from early on.

00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:08.529
In 1903, there was a patent filed by two women from Milwaukee, in the United States,

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:14.809
for something called a “tea leaf holder”, which was a small bag to hold tea leaves.

00:17:15.499 --> 00:17:20.009
But it wasn’t until four years later that the tea bag as we

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:24.969
know it really started to be used, and it was all by accident.

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:30.389
A New York tea merchant named Thomas Sullivan sent some tea

00:17:30.399 --> 00:17:35.089
samples to customers which were packaged in small silk bags.

00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:42.349
He thought that the customers would open the silk bags and put the tea leaves into a pot.

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:50.509
But when the customers started complaining about the fine texture of the bags, Sullivan

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:57.719
realised what had happened; the customers had placed the entire bag directly into the hot water.

00:17:58.649 --> 00:18:02.149
It was then that Sullivan intentionally made tea bags from

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:07.939
gauze to make it easier for the tea to infuse, for it to brew.

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:15.449
Tea bags allowed customers to brew a single cup of tea without brewing a whole pot.

00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:23.489
Because the tea bags were so easy to use, they became a huge hit, and much of the tea-drinking

00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:30.659
world, with the exception of much of Asia, switched to using pre-packaged tea in tea bags.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:36.849
So there you have it, five unusual origin stories of foods.

00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:43.679
So next time you munch on a sandwich, reach for the ketchup bottle, make a cup of tea in the

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:49.549
morning, or even visit the UK and have some fish and chips or chicken tikka masala, well,

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:55.129
you’ll know a little bit more about the history of where all these wonderful foods came from.

00:18:57.849 --> 00:19:01.199
OK then, that’s it for today’s episode.

00:19:01.389 --> 00:19:04.859
I hope it was an interesting one, and that you learned something new.

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:09.439
As always, I’d love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:14.039
We have of course only just scratched the surface of interesting origin

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:18.359
stories about food, and there are so many more we could have talked about.

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:20.809
So, my questions for you are:

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:24.029
What other fun stories are there that you know about?

00:19:24.569 --> 00:19:27.959
How do we even think about who “invented” something which

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:31.159
has been enjoyed in different formats all over the world?

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:35.709
And have you ever claimed to have invented your own dish?

00:19:36.139 --> 00:19:37.579
I would love to know.

00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:40.769

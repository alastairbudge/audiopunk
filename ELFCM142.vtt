Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:16.497
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:20.987
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:27.717
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Scotland, one of the

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:32.527
4 countries that make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.247
The other three being, of course, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:42.527
In this episode you’ll learn about the history of Scotland, and how it

00:00:42.527 --> 00:00:47.137
came to join forces with its arch-rival, England, to form a country.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.727
We’ll talk about some of the great inventions that come out of

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:55.297
Scotland, and we’ll consider what the future of Scotland might be.

00:00:56.177 --> 00:00:59.867
It’s a super interesting story, and it’s also a personal one.

00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:05.257
Although I might not sound like it, I’m a quarter Scottish; my father’s

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:09.287
side of the family is from the north of Scotland, I spent a large chunk of

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:13.877
my childhood growing up in Scotland, and I can actually play the bagpipes.

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:19.377
I should also start by saying thanks to my dad, not just for being

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:23.787
Scottish, but also for helping me with this episode - so, thank you dad.

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:30.227
My final point before we get into the meat of the episode is to quickly remind you that you

00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:35.827
can get all of the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:41.987
for this episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:47.707
This is where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English, and join

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:53.087
a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups, exchanging

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:57.157
ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:57.927 --> 00:02:01.047
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:04.897
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:08.877
OK then, Scotland.

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:15.857
When most people think of Scotland, they think of the highlands, of bagpipes,

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:20.647
of men wearing kilts, the things that look a little bit like skirts, of

00:02:21.047 --> 00:02:26.287
Scottish whisky, and perhaps even of haggis, the famous Scottish dish.

00:02:27.217 --> 00:02:33.467
You can find all of these things in Scotland, but beneath the surface is a fantastic history

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:40.077
of rivalry with its neighbour, of entrepreneurship, of inventiveness, and of struggle.

00:02:41.337 --> 00:02:45.017
Let’s start with a few statistics, to give you an idea of

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:48.687
how Scotland fits into the story of the United Kingdom.

00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:53.897
Scotland, in case you can’t picture it on a map, is found

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:58.687
in the northern part of the UK, it’s directly above England.

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:05.507
Although the land area of Scotland forms a third of the total area of the

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:12.477
UK, it has only 7.5% of the total population, just 5.5 million people.

00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:22.397
So, it is far less densely populated, with only 70 people per square kilometre, vs 430 in England.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:28.644
And even within Scotland, the vast majority of the population is found in

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:33.944
a relatively small area, mainly the part between Edinburgh and Glasgow.

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:38.904
There are huge swathes of it with very few people living there.

00:03:40.134 --> 00:03:46.374
So, it is a small country, between Slovakia and Finland in population size,

00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:52.354
but it packs a sizable punch, it has had a large impact on world history.

00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:57.614
Scottish men and women are responsible for some fantastic inventions,

00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:01.854
some amazing creations, and for things that we use every day.

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.064
John Logie Baird invented the television.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.018
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:11.688
Adam Smith is the father of modern economics.

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:17.328
JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.188
For the sports fans, Sir Alex Ferguson, the long-standing

00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:25.688
manager of Manchester United is a proud Scotsman.

00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:30.983
When it comes to politics, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are from Scotland.

00:04:31.873 --> 00:04:36.853
And there are probably hundreds of Scottish people you have never heard of that have had

00:04:36.903 --> 00:04:42.863
an outsized impact on the world we live in, and you probably use things that they invented.

00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:50.977
A man called William Cullen is responsible for the technology behind refrigerators, behind fridges.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:58.203
A man called Ron Hamilton developed the disposable contact lens, if you enjoy toast, you

00:04:58.203 --> 00:05:04.553
have a man called Alan MacMasters to thank, and if you have ever taken money out from an ATM,

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:10.953
from a bancomat, then you also have another scotsman to thank, a man named James Goodfellow.

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:17.013
Indeed, Winston Churchill, the most definitely English wartime Prime

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:22.823
Minister, once said “Of all the small nations of this earth, perhaps only

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:27.703
the ancient Greeks surpass the Scots in their contribution to mankind.”

00:05:28.823 --> 00:05:33.713
Scottish people are very proud of the impact Scots have had on the world,

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:38.273
and rightly so, the world has a lot to be thankful to Scotland for.

00:05:39.353 --> 00:05:45.513
You might be thinking, if Scotland is such a fantastic, proud country with so many great

00:05:45.673 --> 00:05:51.963
inventors and thinkers, why did it lose its independence and form another country with England?

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:56.503
And didn’t it recently vote to not be independent?

00:05:57.633 --> 00:05:59.713
These are both excellent questions.

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:05.103
We’ll get to the second one shortly, but to the first question of why did

00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:09.773
Scotland first unite with England we need to go back in time a little bit.

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:15.673
Starting as far back as the 13th century, Scotland has

00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:19.493
been a fierce rival of its closest neighbour, England.

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:25.443
If you remember the film Braveheart–which you should certainly not rely on

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:30.363
for historical accuracy by the way–you’ll remember a character called William

00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:35.213
Wallace, who led a movement against the English forces who had occupied Scotland.

00:06:36.493 --> 00:06:42.963
One thing that the film doesn’t get wrong though is that it doesn’t end well for William Wallace.

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:50.303
He is hung, drawn and quartered - he is killed in a horrible way, his body cut up into

00:06:50.303 --> 00:06:56.253
four pieces and sent to four corners of the land as a warning to obey the English king.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:07:01.533
For several hundred years after the death of William Wallace, in

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:06.013
1305, there was a period of tension between England and Scotland.

00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:12.913
Scotland ended up forming an alliance with France, out of a shared hatred of England, and

00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:17.643
there were intermittent periods of fighting between the Scots and their southern neighbour.

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:24.773
It was only in 1707, relatively recently, all things considered, that Scotland finally

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:30.413
completely joined forces with its arch-enemy, England, to form the United Kingdom.

00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:34.903
This wasn’t an immediate, overnight change.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:40.923
Indeed, Scotland and England had been living in a slightly strange situation

00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:46.233
for just over a 100 years, where Scotland and England shared a king,

00:07:46.373 --> 00:07:50.783
they shared a monarch, despite technically being different countries.

00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:58.813
This happened because in 1603, as Elizabeth The First had no children, she made

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:04.333
her closest living relative, James the Sixth of Scotland, also King of England.

00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:10.133
James’ heirs, his children and their children, became the Kings of

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:15.383
both England and Scotland, and so there was a sort of unofficial union.

00:08:16.213 --> 00:08:23.963
And it wasn’t until 1707 that there was the full, political and legal union of the two countries.

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:30.033
The reality is that the unification of Scotland and England wasn’t

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:34.183
something that Scotland wanted to do, they did it out of necessity.

00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:38.293
The reasons were twofold, there were two of them.

00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:45.653
Firstly, Scotland had experienced a period of severe famine in the late 1600s.

00:08:46.643 --> 00:08:51.703
Its population reduced dramatically, and it was struggling economically.

00:08:52.923 --> 00:08:57.104
The second reason involves a country that you might not expect

00:08:57.294 --> 00:09:01.044
to have had an impact in the unification of the United Kingdom.

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:06.404
Panama, yes, Panama, the small country in central America.

00:09:07.344 --> 00:09:13.324
This was the height of colonialism, and there was a plan formed for Scotland to

00:09:13.354 --> 00:09:19.434
colonise Panama, and to control the route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

00:09:20.574 --> 00:09:26.334
It sounded too good to be true, and almost every Scottish landowner invested in the plan.

00:09:27.364 --> 00:09:35.214
Indeed, anywhere from 15-40% of all of the money in Scotland went into this idea to colonise Panama.

00:09:36.324 --> 00:09:40.674
Unfortunately, it did not go to plan, the investors lost all of

00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:44.944
their money, and this had a huge impact on the Scottish economy.

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:52.314
It was as if everyone in Scotland had lost between 15 and 40% of their money, almost overnight.

00:09:53.584 --> 00:09:57.554
There were few options left for Scotland other than to accept

00:09:57.744 --> 00:10:01.714
a unification with its hated next-door neighbour, England.

00:10:02.854 --> 00:10:07.993
This was in 1707, and the union has remained in place ever since,

00:10:08.003 --> 00:10:12.293
Scotland has been united with England in the United Kingdom, ever since.

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:18.023
How happy the Scots have been to remain in the union is another question.

00:10:19.043 --> 00:10:22.703
In order to keep the union intact, there have been recent

00:10:22.713 --> 00:10:27.193
concessions to allow Scotland more powers of self-governance.

00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:34.293
Although Scotland got its own parliament in 1999, with limited powers around

00:10:34.323 --> 00:10:40.593
education, health and some parts of its tax system, it is still part of the United

00:10:40.593 --> 00:10:46.063
Kingdom, with major decisions being taken in Westminster, in London, in England.

00:10:47.123 --> 00:10:50.593
But, for how long that remains is another question.

00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:57.743
As you may remember, there was a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014.

00:10:58.653 --> 00:11:07.223
55% of the Scottish population voted to remain in the UK, while 45% voted to leave.

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:13.683
After the results came out the Scottish National Party, the SNP, which was the

00:11:13.683 --> 00:11:18.583
party that had been pushing for independence, said that the matter had been

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:24.123
settled for a generation, that there wouldn’t be another referendum for 30 years.

00:11:25.303 --> 00:11:30.213
So, if that is the case, why might you have heard about a

00:11:30.213 --> 00:11:34.067
growing movement for another referendum on Scottish independence?

00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:37.067
In a word, Brexit.

00:11:38.107 --> 00:11:43.300
Unless you have been living under a rock for the past 5 years, you will remember that

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:50.167
in 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, which it has now done.

00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:59.067
The margin was close, overall it was 52% voting to leave, and 48% voting to stay.

00:12:00.147 --> 00:12:03.007
But in Scotland, it wasn’t close at all.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:12.587
In Scotland, only 38% of the population voted to leave, 62% voted to remain in the EU.

00:12:13.687 --> 00:12:19.907
And one of the important reasons that people had voted for Scotland to remain part of the UK back

00:12:19.927 --> 00:12:27.988
in 2014 was that, if Scotland had broken away from the UK, it might have had to reapply for EU

00:12:27.988 --> 00:12:34.958
membership, there was no guarantee that Scotland could have left the UK but stayed in the EU.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:41.108
So, after the Brexit vote, there was a growing feeling in Scotland of

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:47.468
“hang on, we voted for something back in 2014, but the rules have changed.

00:12:47.588 --> 00:12:52.248
If we had known that the UK would have voted to leave the EU in

00:12:52.248 --> 00:12:57.488
2016, we might not have wanted to remain part of it back in 2014.”

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:04.368
And as far as the opinion polls are concerned, it does suggest that if a

00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:09.128
referendum on Scottish independence were held today then Scotland would

00:13:09.128 --> 00:13:13.288
vote to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country.

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:18.098
If this did happen there would be all sorts of consequences

00:13:18.438 --> 00:13:21.528
that would be felt far outside the British Isles.

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:26.428
Would Scotland be allowed to easily join the European Union?

00:13:27.698 --> 00:13:33.698
Presumably any attempt would be made difficult by Spain, as if this were easy,

00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:38.328
it would be a strong sign to Catalonia that it could try a similar thing.

00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:42.918
Scotland would need to find its own currency, its own

00:13:42.918 --> 00:13:46.958
money, as it wouldn’t be able to immediately join the Euro.

00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:54.159
And in terms of social spending, Scotland spends more per citizen than

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:59.219
the rest of the UK, and contributes less per head to the UK taxpayer.

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:06.179
So, long story short, Scotland would either need to find additional ways to make money,

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:12.079
or would need to cut costs in order to maintain the same level of spending on its people.

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:15.779
And then there’s the question of a border.

00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:21.839
As anyone who has been following the Brexit negotiations and the question of

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:26.559
the border with Northern Ireland, you will know that there are no easy answers.

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:34.099
As far as I’m concerned, as someone who is Scottish, English and Welsh, if Scotland were

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:40.029
to leave the United Kingdom it would be a great loss both for Scotland and for the UK.

00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:46.459
Although there is still huge rivalry between the two countries, they have been through

00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:51.549
a lot together, and there is a lot of shared cultural heritage between the two.

00:14:52.699 --> 00:14:58.729
From fighting side by side in two world wars through to the fact that the two countries are

00:14:58.729 --> 00:15:04.179
literally part of the same country, there is more that unites the two than divides them.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:12.429
But, as with any alliance, any union, it needs to be based on equality and on mutual respect.

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:17.349
Each party should feel like they are stronger united than apart.

00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:22.139
And certainly Scotland, and the people of Scotland, should have the

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:27.179
right to decide for itself whether it still feels that it is the case.

00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:33.869
Voltaire once said “We look to Scotland for all of our ideas of civilisation.”

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:41.589
Speaking as an Englishman and also a partial Scotsman, it would be a great shame for those ideas of

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:49.519
civilisation to break from an imperfect union, but still one that is preferable to no union at all.

00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:56.879
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Scotland.

00:15:57.159 --> 00:16:02.039
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and if you do go

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:07.249
to Scotland, well then you’ll now know a little bit more about this fantastic country.

00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:12.359
If you are interested in learning more about the differences between Scotland,

00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:16.799
England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and you have always

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:21.479
wondered what the difference between the UK and Great Britain is, then I’d recommend

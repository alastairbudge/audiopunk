Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:16.363
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:20.293
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:25.463
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about sanctions,

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:30.443
and asking the perhaps controversial question: do they even work?

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.840
OK then, Do Sanctions Work?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.350
A few weeks ago I had a fascinating conversation with a gentleman called Siavash.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.610
He told me a moving story about his wife, who had been accepted

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.130
onto a PhD programme at a prestigious university in Australia.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.560
The couple were getting excited about the move, and Siavash’s wife was

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.527
particularly hopeful about possible doors that this degree would open for her,

00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:07.437
opportunities that would not be available if she stayed in her home country.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:14.937
But shortly before she was to be admitted, she received an email from the university.

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:16.917
It read:

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:19.677
Dear Mrs X,

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:23.727
I refer to your application for Higher Degree by

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:27.667
Research candidature and scholarship at University Y.

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:35.424
The University has taken an assessment of your application and determined that acceptance of the

00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:41.710
application may breach international sanctions and controls imposed by the Australian Government.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.410
It is therefore necessary for the University to reject your application,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.320
to ensure the University remains in conformity with Australian Law.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.620
Understandably, Siavash and his wife were devastated.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.000
They were good, upstanding citizens, and his wife had all

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.864
of the qualifications necessary to start this PhD programme.

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:10.254
The problem was…she was from Iran.

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:19.610
And Iran, as you may know, has been under some form of sanctions on and off since November 1979

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:25.707
after the hostage crisis, when a bunch of Americans were held hostage by Iranian militants.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.830
The most recent batch of sanctions are intended to stop Iran from developing its

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.693
nuclear weapons capability, and have essentially cut Iran off from the global economy.

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.283
And in the case of Siavash and his wife, they have literally stopped the

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:47.783
couple from being able to leave and complete a PhD programme in Australia.

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:54.623
Now, the Australian sanctions against Iran appear to be only against services or

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:59.903
products that are related to technology that could be used in ballistic or nuclear

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:04.614
weapons, an area which Siavash told me his wife was not going to be involved

00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:10.564
in, and indeed Siavash’s wife responded to the university pointing out as much.

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:17.794
But it was to no avail; the Australian university, perhaps understandably,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:22.454
did not even want to run the risk that it could be seen as breaking sanctions.

00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:27.594
And the PhD offer was rescinded, it was taken back.

00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:33.944
Now, you might hear this story and think “poor Siavash and his wife, it’s so

00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:39.254
unfair that honest citizens get caught up in these political disputes”, or you

00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:44.064
might hear it and think “good, that's exactly the way that sanctions should work”.

00:03:45.504 --> 00:03:49.844
Instead of trying to take a side, we are instead going to explore

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:53.900
how effective sanctions are at achieving their stated aim.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.630
After all, every sanction has a goal, it has something it is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.350
aiming at, so we’ll explore how effective they are at doing this.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.080
It might surprise you that there is less agreement on the subject than you might think.

00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:18.720
But first, let’s start with a reminder of what sanctions actually are, and how they work.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.980
A sanction is a sort of catch-all term that refers to a wide variety of economic

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.910
measures used by one country or a multilateral organisation to force another

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.000
country to do something, from stopping it getting access to technology or military

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.050
equipment to damaging its economy to trying to bring about a political change.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.240
They can be embargoes, where all trade with a country is banned,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.760
throttling economic growth and the prosperity of that country’s

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.880
citizens, and stirring up discontent for the country’s political leaders.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.800
There can be export or import controls, where certain products cannot be exported or imported.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.340
These are typically used to stop important strategic products entering or

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.610
leaving a country, typically related to technology or military objectives.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.690
There can be financial controls, where all dealings with banks from a country are banned.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.280
Like the first type of sanction, a trade embargo, the objective is to weaken a country’s economy.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.600
There can be asset freezes, where all of the assets

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.590
belonging to or linked to a particular person are frozen.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.460
These are typically used to target powerful people close to the country’s political elite.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.710
And there can be travel restrictions, where individuals and their family

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.660
members are banned from travelling to a particular country or region.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.930
Again, the objective of this is similar to asset freezes; to inconvenience those who wield

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.180
the power in a particular country, disrupting their international mobility and influence.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.890
Sanctions can be very limited in scope, with only certain individuals

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.220
within a country targeted, or an entire country can essentially be cut

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.240
off from trading with another, as is the case with Iran and the US.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.640
Now, as to the history of sanctions, it is a lot longer than you might think.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.330
The first record of economic sanctions goes all the way back to

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.330
Ancient Greece in the year 432 BC, just before the Peloponnesian War.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.950
This was something called the Megarian Decree, and was a form of

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.086
economic blockade by the Athenian Empire against the city of Megara.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.192
The idea was to cut off the city of Megara from trading with its neighbours.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.490
It worked, at least from an economic point of view; the city of Megara was devastated.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:15.350
But Magara appealed to its neighbour and ally, Sparta, and this is believed by some to be a key

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:22.130
factor in starting the Peloponnesian War, in which Athens, the sanctioning power, was defeated.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.970
So, as you can see, right from the very first sanction, they can have unintended

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:35.190
consequences, and the extent to which they achieve their goal is…debated.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.900
Skipping forward a few thousand years, Napoleon Bonaparte

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.030
was one of the first “modern” leaders to implement sanctions.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:53.990
In 1806 he implemented a trade embargo against the UK, in effect creating a blockade, forbidding

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.810
the import of British goods into European countries allied with or dependent upon France.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.140
In Napoleon’s case, it did not achieve its goal.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.430
British goods continued to be smuggled into Europe, the fact that they were harder

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.710
to come by hurt France’s European allies, many of whom had come to be dependent on

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:20.720
British goods, and it caused a strain on France’s relations with its European allies.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.450
In short, it didn’t work, and was a not insignificant factor in Napoleon’s downfall.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:36.180
But ever since this so-called “Continental Blockade”, sanctions have been increasingly used

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:43.210
as a political tool to weaken a country's economy and bring about a regime or policy change.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:51.490
The Allies sanctioned Germany in 1914, North Korea has been under UN sanctions since

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:58.600
2006, Russia has been sanctioned in a myriad of different ways since 2014, and then

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:04.950
more seriously since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and perhaps most famously,

00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:11.033
Cuba has been under severe economic sanctions by the United States since 1962.

00:09:12.043 --> 00:09:18.173
If you go on holiday to Cuba and you fly back to Miami with a Cuban cigar or a

00:09:18.173 --> 00:09:23.583
bottle of Cuban rum in your pocket, or even a packet of chewing gum bought in Cuba,

00:09:23.853 --> 00:09:29.333
you are breaking American sanctions and you could theoretically end up in jail.

00:09:30.763 --> 00:09:39.193
So, given that they are increasingly used as a political and diplomatic tool, have sanctions become

00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:45.313
more effective, or are they still just as ineffective, but they are chosen for other reasons?

00:09:46.743 --> 00:09:53.343
According to the French author, Agathe Demarais, sanctions have not got any more effective.

00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:58.283
Demarais is the author of a book on the efficacy of

00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:02.303
economic sanctions, and in it she looks at all U.S.

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:06.563
sanctions since 1970 and shows that the countries targeted

00:10:06.563 --> 00:10:11.083
by sanctions only changed their behaviour 13% of the time.

00:10:12.483 --> 00:10:18.473
Put another way, 87% of the time sanctions did not have their intended effect.

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:24.763
Sanctions are chosen by politicians, according to Demarais, because they are a

00:10:24.763 --> 00:10:31.003
relatively easy, cheap and painless way to take action against a rogue state.

00:10:32.253 --> 00:10:34.233
Firstly, they are easy.

00:10:34.963 --> 00:10:39.513
A government can draft a piece of legislation and announce it the next morning.

00:10:40.243 --> 00:10:45.453
A government doesn’t need to actually do much to administer the sanctions; the private

00:10:45.453 --> 00:10:50.733
sector does this for it by simply cutting off trade or financial links with a country.

00:10:52.273 --> 00:10:54.753
Secondly, sanctions are cheap.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:11:01.673
Sure, they might have unintended economic costs down the road, but their immediate

00:11:01.673 --> 00:11:06.303
cost is typically only the lost revenue of not doing business with that country,

00:11:06.893 --> 00:11:11.953
and that is significantly cheaper than any kind of military intervention.

00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:20.613
Thirdly, and on a related note, sanctions are seen as a sensible halfway house,

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:25.703
a midway between doing nothing and a full-scale military invasion of a country.

00:11:27.113 --> 00:11:31.603
If one country, country A, is seen to be taking an action that

00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:34.673
is not in the best interests of another country, country B.

00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:40.933
Let’s say that country A is developing nuclear weapons, violating human rights laws or invading

00:11:40.943 --> 00:11:47.393
a sovereign nation, what options does country B have to try to force it to change its behaviour?

00:11:48.763 --> 00:11:55.793
Doing nothing shows weakness, both domestically and internationally, and military action is

00:11:55.803 --> 00:12:02.843
politically dangerous, expensive, and will necessarily result in a direct loss of countless lives.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:08.543
Sanctions are a quick and easy way of showing that you are doing something.

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:14.723
Country B can quickly and easily say “we are imposing sanctions on Country A” and

00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:21.563
it shows that an effort is being made, even if the impact of that effort is unknown.

00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:25.653
Sometimes they work exactly as expected.

00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:33.683
But according to Agathe Demarais, “sometimes” means 13% of the time, although I should add that

00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:41.363
other scholars have suggested that the success rate is as high as 34% and others as low as 4%.

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:47.033
We’ll get into why there is so much disagreement on the topic in a minute, but

00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:53.523
first let’s take a look at a few examples, to see how this bears out in real life.

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:58.413
With the example of US sanctions against Cuba, it's hard

00:12:58.423 --> 00:13:01.153
to make the argument that sanctions have been a success.

00:13:02.043 --> 00:13:09.023
The original objective was for regime change, which didn’t happen, and then in 1992 the objective

00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:15.143
was updated to “force Cuba towards democratisation and greater respect for human rights."

00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:20.623
Now, some form of sanctions have been in place for over 60 years.

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:25.173
There has been no great political change, the sanctions have brought

00:13:25.173 --> 00:13:30.043
Cuba closer to countries like the USSR and Venezuela, and they have

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:34.293
made the US a scapegoat for the poor economic outlook for Cuba.

00:13:35.563 --> 00:13:40.423
Now, in the interest of balance, there are several prominent cases where

00:13:40.423 --> 00:13:45.183
economic sanctions have had their stated effect, or at least sanctions have

00:13:45.183 --> 00:13:49.303
been put in place, and the objective of the sanctions has been reached.

00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:52.713
One clear case is South Africa.

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:59.373
South Africans had lived under an apartheid regime since 1948, a system

00:13:59.383 --> 00:14:04.113
of institutionalised racism in which the minority white population was

00:14:04.123 --> 00:14:08.153
given more rights and privileges than the majority black population.

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:16.363
Ever since the 1960s, various countries, from Brazil to Britain, imposed some specific

00:14:16.383 --> 00:14:22.873
trade sanctions on South Africa, and this intensified moving into the 1970s, ending with

00:14:22.873 --> 00:14:29.643
a full United Nations embargo on weapons sales to South Africa in 1977, an oil embargo

00:14:29.643 --> 00:14:35.443
10 years later, and then multiple countries proposing full divestment from the country

00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:41.753
in the 1980s, essentially withdrawing all investments and money from the racist regime.

00:14:42.803 --> 00:14:48.113
The idea was to cripple the South African economy, and bring about regime change.

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:54.883
But even as this was happening, not all voices outside South Africa agreed with the approach.

00:14:55.853 --> 00:15:01.653
Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, famously described sanctions as "the way

00:15:01.653 --> 00:15:06.433
of poverty, starvation and destroying the hopes of the very people you wish to help."

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:11.563
And John Major, who would go on to be Prime Minister but was Thatcher’s

00:15:11.573 --> 00:15:16.213
Foreign Secretary at the time, criticised sanctions saying that they would

00:15:16.653 --> 00:15:21.503
"feed white consciences outside South Africa, not black bellies within it".

00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:28.063
In other words, sanctions might make people outside South Africa feel like they were doing

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:34.023
a good thing by refusing to trade with a racist regime, but the people who were really being

00:15:34.053 --> 00:15:39.853
punished were black South Africans, who were suffering in poverty under a weak economy.

00:15:41.283 --> 00:15:47.623
In any case, sanctions worked, or at least in 1994, 5 years after the

00:15:47.623 --> 00:15:52.803
UN oil embargo, the South African apartheid regime finally ended, and

00:15:52.963 --> 00:15:57.193
Nelson Mandela was elected in the country’s first multi-racial election.

00:15:58.483 --> 00:16:02.893
Mandela certainly thought that sanctions helped end apartheid, replying

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:06.603
“Oh, there is no doubt” when he was asked about their efficacy.

00:16:07.922 --> 00:16:13.903
But here we move into some interesting discussion about how effective they actually are.

00:16:14.793 --> 00:16:19.963
Yes, apartheid ended, but would it have ended without economic sanctions?

00:16:21.093 --> 00:16:24.753
Black South Africans had to live through the serious economic

00:16:24.763 --> 00:16:28.113
hardship and suffering caused by the sanctions for decades.

00:16:28.773 --> 00:16:33.293
Was it worth it, as in, was this suffering a necessary step to

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:37.743
force regime change and end apartheid, or was it all for nothing?

00:16:39.013 --> 00:16:43.383
And bringing us closer to the present day, Russia has

00:16:43.393 --> 00:16:47.073
overtaken Iran as the most sanctioned country in the world.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.953
If you are in Russia, as you will know, you cannot use

00:16:51.953 --> 00:16:55.183
your Russian bank card to buy many international products.

00:16:55.693 --> 00:17:01.228
VISA and Mastercard have blocked Russian banks, Russia is cut off from the SWIFT

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:06.938
network, and household names from McDonald’s to Starbucks have exited the country.

00:17:08.448 --> 00:17:13.248
Multiple oligarchs have had personal sanctions placed against them, their yachts

00:17:13.258 --> 00:17:18.708
impounded and mansions from London to New York seized, or at least frozen.

00:17:20.158 --> 00:17:26.328
This all started in late February and March of 2022, so…has it worked?

00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:33.098
Now, there are as many articles saying “Russian sanctions are working” as there

00:17:33.108 --> 00:17:38.460
are “Russian sanctions aren’t working”, so commentators are divided on the issue.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.890
And the major problem with assessing the efficacy of the sanctions against

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:49.160
Russia is that there was no clear and easily measurable goal to them, they had

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.880
no clear objective, other than “show Russia that its invasion was not acceptable

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.790
to the international community and disrupt its ability to continue to wage war”.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:06.460
Certainly, those who predicted that Russia would fall into an immediate financial collapse

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.960
and there would be domestic pressure for regime change have been proved incorrect.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:19.860
This was almost two years ago, the war is ongoing, and as of the time of recording

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.960
at least, Putin is still in charge with no sign of that changing in the near future.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.580
Western goods are still getting into Russia, typically being

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.110
“imported” to neighbouring countries and then taken across the border.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:39.100
What’s more, sanctions against Russia are not global by any means;

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.040
Russia might be sanctioned by much of the West, including the EU and

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.770
the US, but this has strengthened its relationship with China and India.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:54.530
And sanctions have given Putin yet another opportunity to blame the

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:59.730
West, telling Russian citizens that Europe and the US wants to cripple

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.210
Russia, and he is the only person capable of leading his country.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:09.459
But there are signs that the Russian economy is creaking.

00:19:10.369 --> 00:19:14.689
Russian GDP decreased by 2.1% in 2022.

00:19:15.117 --> 00:19:21.697
The production of motor vehicles was down almost 50% year on year, the Russian rouble continues

00:19:21.697 --> 00:19:27.417
to lose value against the dollar, and proponents of sanctions say that it is a waiting game.

00:19:28.447 --> 00:19:35.477
Sanctions are strangling Russia, so they say, and much like it took decades to dismantle

00:19:35.477 --> 00:19:41.867
the apartheid regime in South Africa, sanctions are a chokehold on the Russian economy, and

00:19:42.117 --> 00:19:47.437
it is simply a question of waiting for the hold to grow so tight that there is a reaction.

00:19:49.097 --> 00:19:53.472
The problem is, as the history of economic sanctions tells us, that there

00:19:53.472 --> 00:19:58.122
is often no way to know what their impact, what this reaction, will be.

00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:04.362
In some cases, the political objective might be reached swiftly and relatively

00:20:04.392 --> 00:20:08.982
painlessly, with sanctions playing an important role or a minor one.

00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:16.251
In others, it will be a multi-decade process, where innocent citizens of a country are forced

00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:21.551
to suffer because of policy decisions that might have been taken even before they were born.

00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:28.711
And to bring it back to Siavash and his wife, the PhD candidate from Iran I told you

00:20:28.721 --> 00:20:33.451
about at the start of the episode, what can we take away from this personal story?

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:40.131
It seems to epitomise the paradox of sanctions: they are a tool designed

00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:45.281
to exert pressure on a regime, but in practice they are a collection

00:20:45.281 --> 00:20:49.961
of punishments on individuals, promising people like Siavash’s wife.

00:20:51.271 --> 00:20:55.651
Sanctions are easy to implement, and they are a useful tool

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:58.431
for politicians who don’t want to get their hands dirty.

00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:03.521
To quote the British Labour Party politician William Arnold-Forster,

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:08.261
“Pens seem so much cleaner instruments than bayonets”.

00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:15.591
But sanctions are difficult to measure, and their impact is almost impossible to predict.

00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:22.781
What Siavash’s wife’s story is an important reminder of, is that in this grand chess

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:30.361
game of international relations, the pawns often have faces, stories, hopes and dreams.

00:21:32.871 --> 00:21:37.171
OK then, that is it for today's episode on economic sanctions.

00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:40.441
I know it probably sounded like a bit of a dry topic, but

00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:43.351
I hope that we’ve managed to bring some humanity to it.

00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:47.241

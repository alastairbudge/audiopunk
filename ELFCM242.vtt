Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:17.096
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:21.236
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:25.846
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:29.966
about the Evacuation of British Cities during World War II.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:36.976
Starting in 1939, millions of children were sent away from British cities,

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:42.136
in anticipation that the country would be bombed by Hitler’s Nazi forces.

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:47.776
Lives were thrown into chaos and confusion by this massive wartime

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:52.386
mission to safeguard the future of the country - a mission that would have

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:57.826
unintended knock-on effects, that is consequences, long after the war ended.

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:04.076
So, today we are going to tell that story, starting with the background to the

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:10.406
evacuation through to how it actually worked, why so many children returned to the

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:16.206
cities only to have to run back to the countryside as the bombs started to fall, and

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:21.466
how the impact of this huge-scale operation affected the country, and its children.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:29.724
OK then, Operation Pied Piper, the Evacuation of British Cities in World War Two.

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:36.714
Imagine being a five-year-old child about to board a steam train together with hundreds

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:43.904
of other young children — scared, excited, and overwhelmed with feelings of uncertainty.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:49.784
The atmosphere of urgency fills the smoky platform as your hand is

00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:54.784
grabbed by a volunteer marshal and you are ushered onboard the train.

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:59.964
In your other hand, you tightly clutch your gas mask.

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:06.604
It’s shaped into Mickey Mouse to make you feel less frightened, but you still feel afraid.

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:11.014
You have a name card with your name and surname written on it.

00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:17.574
It’s pinned across your chest, so that you can be identified when you get to your final destination.

00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:22.644
With tears in your eyes, you had hugged your mother earlier

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:26.514
that morning and bid her farewell with a reluctant kiss.

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:33.884
It's your first time being separated from your mother, and you are uncertain when you will return.

00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:42.034
A whistle sounds and your train leaves Paddington Station, rattling off into the countryside, taking

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:48.514
you a world away from the city where you have grown up, the only place you have ever called home.

00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:53.054
You remember the panic and fear in your mother’s eyes.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.564
The talk of the Luftwaffe dropping bombs.

00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:58.394
Fear has spread all across the city.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:02.234
Little do you know it now, but you are making history.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:05.094
You are part of Operation Pied Piper.

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:09.604
The evacuation of children, that is the removal of children,

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:13.884
from London and from British cities during World War 2.

00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:18.744
Operation Pied Piper began on a gloomy Friday.

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:25.904
It was September 1st, 1939 — two days before Britain declared war on Germany.

00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:29.924
That very day, Hitler had invaded Poland.

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:33.804
He’d broken the promises of peace he had made to the British

00:03:33.824 --> 00:03:37.004
Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, but one year before.

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:44.534
Despite having done its very best to avoid it, Britain knew another global conflict was coming.

00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:49.814
The public consciousness was still scarred from the so-called ‘Great

00:03:49.814 --> 00:03:54.944
War’ - the war to end all wars, the war we now call the First World War.

00:03:55.854 --> 00:04:02.434
Now, Britain and France had little choice but to enter a new war they’d call the Second World War.

00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:09.744
Britain knew that as soon as it declared war, its civilians would be in grave danger of

00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:16.404
aerial bombings, particularly in strategic targets like London, Birmingham, and Glasgow.

00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:21.514
This was because Britain's home defences, the things put

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:25.454
in place to safeguard civilians, were relatively weak.

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:30.184
This was one of the reasons why Neville Chamberlain, the then Prime

00:04:30.184 --> 00:04:35.214
Minister of the UK, had been so reluctant to declare war on Germany.

00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:42.174
London, obviously, was a prime target for bombings because it was the iconic,

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:47.784
capital city, the seat of government and the part-time home for the royal family.

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:52.454
It also happened to be the closest major British city to mainland Europe

00:04:53.914 --> 00:05:00.514
Badly hurting London and its landmarks would hurt the psyche of the entire British people.

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:06.244
London thus had tremendous propaganda as well as strategic value.

00:05:07.394 --> 00:05:11.664
Birmingham was also important as there was a heavy manufacturing

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:15.284
industry there that would become essential for the war effort.

00:05:16.304 --> 00:05:22.744
Belfast, in Northern Ireland, and Glasgow in Scotland, both had important shipyards.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:30.054
These key areas would become a battleground for aerial bombing later on during the war.

00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:35.334
British politicians were also well aware that Hitler would

00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:38.954
have no hesitation in bombing civilians into submission.

00:05:39.884 --> 00:05:41.024
And they were right.

00:05:41.544 --> 00:05:46.564
This later proved to be the case during what would become known as The Blitz.

00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:52.724
As soon as war broke out, the government knew that there would be no time

00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:58.604
to waste and it made rapid plans to evacuate the most at-risk cities.

00:05:59.954 --> 00:06:04.357
It classified the whole country into three zones, with

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.757
each zone containing roughly a third of the country:

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:12.767
Firstly, what's called, Evacuation Zones, these were the

00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:16.437
most dangerous places from where people would be evacuated.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:21.187
This included the major cities like London and Belfast.

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:27.367
Secondly, Reception Zones, the places thought safe that would receive

00:06:27.397 --> 00:06:32.087
the evacuees [that is the people being evacuated] - these were

00:06:32.407 --> 00:06:38.347
usually remote, rural, places like rural Wales, Kent, and East Anglia.

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:40.577
The countryside, essentially.

00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:48.397
And thirdly, Neutral Zones which would neither send nor receive evacuees - such

00:06:48.397 --> 00:06:54.037
as Kingswood and Mangotsfield in South Gloucestershire, to the west of England.

00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:58.857
Operation Pied Piper was born, and it was one of the

00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:02.537
most extensive mass migrations in British history.

00:07:03.727 --> 00:07:09.537
If you remember your fairy tales tales you might remember the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:15.497
This creepy character is a piper who is hired by the people of

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:21.137
Hamelin to lure the rats away from the town using his magical pipe.

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:28.257
However, the townspeople refuse to pay him even though he has done a good job.

00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:34.247
This angers the piper so he lures all the town's children away from

00:07:34.247 --> 00:07:39.527
Hamelin as retaliation, as revenge, the same way he did with the rats.

00:07:40.197 --> 00:07:44.647
The children follow him in a long line as he plays his magic pipe.

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:50.137
It is somewhat ironic that the British government used the name of a

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:55.217
character from a German fairytale to name the military-style operation

00:07:55.247 --> 00:08:00.027
of removing children from its own cities, but the significance is clear.

00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:07.017
Nowadays, when we see old photographs from World War 2, or movies recreating

00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:13.807
those tear-jerking scenes, we see swathes, that's lots, of children going off on

00:08:13.817 --> 00:08:19.747
trains or being billeted [so being put up] in their new homes in the countryside.

00:08:20.337 --> 00:08:22.527
And this is exactly what happened.

00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:29.077
However, what many do not know is that it was not just children who were evacuated.

00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:34.197
In total, one and a half million people were evacuated over

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:38.617
the course of 3 days at the start of September of 1939.

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:42.237
These numbers are incredible even by today’s standards.

00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:51.727
Of that 1.5 million, 827,000 were school-age children, and 524,000 were

00:08:52.037 --> 00:08:56.797
children under the age of 5, many of whom did actually go with their mothers.

00:08:57.437 --> 00:09:01.217
In addition, 13,000 pregnant women were evacuated.

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:07.487
Now if you have been doing your sums, you will realise that this isn't one and a half

00:09:07.507 --> 00:09:08.175
million.

00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:12.187
This doesn't include the 70,000 disabled

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:19.457
adults and over 103,000 teachers and other helpers that also left the cities with the children.

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:26.497
Books rarely talk about these people, but there were plenty of adults who were also sent away

00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:32.867
in order to make the children’s lives as uninterrupted as possible, given the circumstances.

00:09:33.537 --> 00:09:36.517
And it was not just people that were removed.

00:09:37.257 --> 00:09:40.477
Objects and businesses were evacuated too.

00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:45.237
The National Gallery sent its art collection to Wales.

00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:50.897
The Bank of England moved to a small town in Hampshire [and sent

00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:56.677
its gold to Canada], and the BBC moved to Bristol and Bedford.

00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:02.677
Speaking of Canada, the British government tried to send children there as well.

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:11.487
However, the passenger ships carrying them were torpedoed by German U-boats, the German submarines.

00:10:12.497 --> 00:10:19.847
77 children and over 200 adults tragically drowned during one such crossing, and as

00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:25.027
a result the British government immediately stopped the overseas evacuation scheme,

00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:31.737
focussing all its efforts on finding safe places for children within Britain’s borders.

00:10:33.127 --> 00:10:39.117
The children arrived at village railways stations both scared and excited at the same time.

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:44.047
They were taken to draughty village halls, where the host

00:10:44.057 --> 00:10:47.887
families would pick which child they wanted to take in.

00:10:48.817 --> 00:10:52.857
Host families bargained over the "presentable" children

00:10:53.157 --> 00:10:57.707
while the grubbier, dirtier ones were typically chosen last.

00:10:58.387 --> 00:11:02.567
This must have been a horrible feeling for the last one standing.

00:11:03.387 --> 00:11:09.327
Imagine being picked last for a football team, but instead of a football

00:11:09.357 --> 00:11:13.777
team you’re being picked to go and live with a family for several years.

00:11:15.317 --> 00:11:19.927
Siblings, so that is brothers and sisters, were sometimes separated

00:11:20.197 --> 00:11:23.537
which would have made the whole ordeal much more traumatic.

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:26.847
Of course, it wasn’t all bad.

00:11:27.527 --> 00:11:33.377
For many inner-city kids, the evacuation meant seeing the countryside for the first time.

00:11:34.017 --> 00:11:39.237
The thought of playing in the fresh air, seeing farm animals, and three

00:11:39.247 --> 00:11:43.857
square meals a day excited many who just thought it would be a short holiday.

00:11:45.217 --> 00:11:50.177
Since the evacuation wasn't compulsory, it was only advised,

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:54.907
understandably many parents decided not to send their children away.

00:11:55.647 --> 00:12:03.097
On September 1st of 1939, when the operation started, Britain wasn’t even at war.

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:09.397
There was considerable government propaganda, advising that war was imminent

00:12:09.627 --> 00:12:14.862
and children needed to be sent away from the dangerous cities, but it’s not hard

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:20.427
to understand why some parents were reluctant to be separated from their kids.

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:26.687
Indeed, only about 47% of children were evacuated in

00:12:26.687 --> 00:12:31.517
the initial wave, that is the wave of Autumn 1939.

00:12:32.937 --> 00:12:38.207
Unlike the evacuation, which was voluntary, hosting evacuees

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:42.587
was compulsory, the people in the countryside couldn’t say no.

00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:47.507
The government ordered all host families in evacuation

00:12:47.507 --> 00:12:51.467
towns and villages to host at least one evacuee.

00:12:52.577 --> 00:13:00.047
There was little to no screening as to the host’s character or suitability - in short, no

00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:06.387
interviews or application procedure making sure that the host was able to look after a child.

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:14.647
The host families were paid 10 shillings and sixpence per week for the first unaccompanied child.

00:13:15.097 --> 00:13:18.337
That is around 35 Euros in today's money.

00:13:19.277 --> 00:13:23.795
If a host family took in subsequent children, if they took in more

00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:28.297
children, they would be paid 8 shillings and sixpence for each child,

00:13:28.347 --> 00:13:33.257
so just under 30 Euros per week for every extra child they took.

00:13:34.637 --> 00:13:40.037
In September 1939, these children went to live with complete strangers,

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:45.137
and their mothers allowed themselves to be separated from them in the

00:13:45.347 --> 00:13:49.457
misguided belief that it would only be for a short period of time.

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:54.607
As more time went on without Hitler’s anticipated

00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:58.597
bombings happening, the cities seemed safe that autumn.

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:04.867
No bombs fell, and it seemed like all of this operation had been for nothing.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:11.467
Many parents wanted to get their kids back home, labelling the war as a "phoney war."

00:14:12.217 --> 00:14:14.037
It was a false alarm, they said.

00:14:14.177 --> 00:14:15.657
We want our kids back.

00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:21.127
The government propaganda now went into overdrive, saying that

00:14:21.307 --> 00:14:24.727
parents should keep their children in the care of host families.

00:14:25.787 --> 00:14:31.077
Posters went up all over the cities saying things like "Don't Do It, Mother.

00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:33.027
Leave the Children Where They Are".

00:14:34.267 --> 00:14:38.937
Unfortunately, this wasn't effective enough to change most parents' minds.

00:14:39.377 --> 00:14:47.127
By January of 1940, almost 60% of the children who had been evacuated had returned home.

00:14:48.231 --> 00:14:53.457
But they returned to the cities just as the German bombs started to fall.

00:14:54.077 --> 00:14:58.187
1940 would become known as the year of the Blitz.

00:14:58.707 --> 00:15:05.887
Starting in September, wave upon wave of German bombers dropped bomb after bomb on British cities.

00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:11.009
Coventry [a city that helped produce arms for the war effort]

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:16.067
burned for days, and huge parts of London’s East End were flattened.

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:20.877
It was clear now that the government had been right, Hitler meant

00:15:20.907 --> 00:15:26.117
business, and that these cities were the most dangerous places in Britain.

00:15:27.237 --> 00:15:32.567
The entire process started again, with many children being sent back to the

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:37.667
countryside after having been brought back to the cities when they seemed safe.

00:15:39.067 --> 00:15:43.537
Over the course of the war, there would be three main waves of evacuations.

00:15:44.057 --> 00:15:52.047
The first in September 1939, the second during the Blitz in 1940, and the third and final

00:15:52.047 --> 00:16:00.867
evacuation being in June 1944 when Germany fired V1 followed by V2 rockets at British cities.

00:16:02.187 --> 00:16:09.317
In total over 3.5 million children were evacuated from British cities during World War Two.

00:16:09.657 --> 00:16:13.107
That’s almost 10% of the entire population.

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:19.737
The end of the war in Europe brought an end to the mass evacuation scheme,

00:16:20.007 --> 00:16:25.237
and children started to return home, some of them now almost adults.

00:16:26.237 --> 00:16:30.597
In March of 1946, almost a year after the war in

00:16:30.707 --> 00:16:34.687
Europe had ended, the evacuation was officially over.

00:16:35.647 --> 00:16:40.577
This evacuation, to remind you, was optional, but going back after

00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:45.567
the war had ended was mandatory, this meant people had no choice.

00:16:46.477 --> 00:16:50.397
As you can imagine, returning to your mother and father

00:16:50.557 --> 00:16:55.017
after years apart must have been for many a joyous occasion.

00:16:55.217 --> 00:16:58.997
The war was over, you were finally reunited with your

00:16:58.997 --> 00:17:03.627
parents, and the fear and uncertainty of war was finally over.

00:17:04.597 --> 00:17:07.617
But it certainly wasn’t joyous for everyone.

00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:16.147
For many children they returned to find that they had no father, no mother, or no father and mother.

00:17:17.097 --> 00:17:20.597
For some, especially the younger ones, it must have

00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:23.807
meant going back to a family they did not remember.

00:17:24.667 --> 00:17:29.357
For others, both they and their parents were now different people,

00:17:29.597 --> 00:17:33.967
and some children went back to a family who no longer wanted them.

00:17:34.837 --> 00:17:39.997
Some parents were so used to not having kids around that it was an added

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:45.297
responsibility and financial burden when their evacuated children returned home.

00:17:46.157 --> 00:17:50.227
Not to mention that the children were now almost strangers to them.

00:17:50.727 --> 00:17:54.357
Their children had been gone for four or five years.

00:17:54.697 --> 00:18:02.007
The changes in appearances, outlook, and ideas were often difficult to overlook.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:08.737
Many children had already picked up a rural accent or countryside ways.

00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:11.817
They were now very different people to their parents.

00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:18.337
One former evacuee recounts how his own mother could not deal with the

00:18:18.537 --> 00:18:23.640
newfound love of books and learning his foster parents had given him.

00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:27.227
Some children were shocked to discover that their

00:18:27.227 --> 00:18:31.487
parents’ lifestyles clashed with the ways they now knew.

00:18:32.607 --> 00:18:40.207
One boy, returning from Canada, was horrified that his mother wore makeup, smoked and drank.

00:18:41.097 --> 00:18:46.077
There are even stories of kind host families who adopted the children they

00:18:46.077 --> 00:18:50.337
had looked after, whose parents had died or could not take care of them.

00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:55.317
One evacuee who was fostered by a childless couple

00:18:55.317 --> 00:18:58.637
in Cornwall, had a blissful evacuation experience.

00:18:59.387 --> 00:19:06.477
When he returned “home”, he felt like a fish out of water, that is out of place and not fitting in.

00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:14.117
His own mother, realising how unhappy he was, wrote to his foster parents asking

00:19:14.117 --> 00:19:20.077
them if they wished to adopt him and they did so, welcoming him back with open arms.

00:19:20.967 --> 00:19:25.017
For other foster families who had built a deep bond with the

00:19:25.117 --> 00:19:29.302
evacuees, it was understandably heartrending to let them go.

00:19:30.352 --> 00:19:36.712
The evacuations made an immense impact on the psyche, that is the mind, of the nation,

00:19:37.072 --> 00:19:43.302
and there is an entire genre of literature and film based on this shared experience.

00:19:44.247 --> 00:19:47.992
Evacuees' individual experiences ran the whole gamut,

00:19:48.192 --> 00:19:52.042
that is the whole range, from excellent to terrible.

00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:57.502
For kids whose host families made them work from dawn to dusk in

00:19:57.502 --> 00:20:01.892
the fields, the experience was understandably, slightly unpleasant.

00:20:02.692 --> 00:20:08.662
However, many recalled their evacuation days as moments of pure joy and happiness.

00:20:09.022 --> 00:20:15.882
They remembered the fun and fear of hopping from one host family to another, the shock of

00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:21.932
discovering that there was no inside toilet or bathroom, the awe of seeing the first cow,

00:20:22.272 --> 00:20:28.522
or discovering where milk comes from, and the humbling experience of working on the farm.

00:20:29.452 --> 00:20:34.962
Now, it is hard, nigh impossible, for there to be such a huge operation

00:20:35.212 --> 00:20:40.732
without it impacting the lives of the individuals for years to come, and this

00:20:40.752 --> 00:20:46.602
experience, Operation Pied Piper, reshaped an entire generation of youth.

00:20:47.842 --> 00:20:53.592
There was a recent study by Birkbeck College, which is part of the University of London,

00:20:53.932 --> 00:20:59.172
called "Long-term effects of the British evacuation of children during World War 2

00:20:59.262 --> 00:21:05.702
on their adult mental health", and this shed some light on the devastating effects on

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:11.192
adult mental health due to temporary childhood separation caused by the evacuation.

00:21:12.782 --> 00:21:18.092
The study revealed that children evacuated when they were between 4 and 6 years

00:21:18.092 --> 00:21:23.832
old and those who received poor foster care were at greater risk of depression

00:21:24.072 --> 00:21:29.512
and clinical anxiety and that they would have high levels of self-criticism.

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:34.402
Older evacuated children who had received relatively good

00:21:34.442 --> 00:21:39.082
care were found to be less prone to such mental disorders.

00:21:40.412 --> 00:21:46.842
All these findings only reinforced the findings of Anna Freud, the daughter of Sigmund

00:21:46.852 --> 00:21:53.822
Freud, who, in 1941, conducted a study on the psychological impact of evacuation.

00:21:54.702 --> 00:22:01.352
She concluded that, "separation from their parents is a worse shock for children than a bombing."

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.900
The effects of Operation Pied Piper weren’t only on

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.730
the individuals, but on British society as a whole.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:15.350
It heavily disrupted the schooling and education of many young children.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:21.090
It also shone a light on the level of urban poverty that Britain had been

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:27.010
suffering, and the extent of economic and social deprivation within British cities.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.790
During the evacuation, whether you were rich or poor didn’t matter.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:38.760
Working-class children mixed with kids from rich families, and for many

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:43.070
it was the first time that they had seen how “the other side” lived.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:50.790
The class structure in Britain was dealt a huge blow, paving way for the massive changes

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:57.750
the swinging 60s and 70s would bring, moulded by the now grown-up evacuee generation.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:04.990
And this was a generation with this huge, shared experience, this shared memory.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:10.620
Almost everyone had been touched in some way, whether that was the children being

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:15.980
evacuated, or the children in the countryside whose families had welcomed evacuees.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:23.180
We can perhaps point to some shared experiences in recent memory that have a similar

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:30.130
power, a similar strength, but it’s hard to think of anything that lasted for so long

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.260
and impacted such a large proportion of the population at such an impressionable age.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:44.820
It brought together urban and rural, rich and poor, and people from all over the UK in a bonding

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:51.590
experience of the scale that the country had never experienced before and has not experienced since.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.150
It certainly wasn't perfect, and undoubtedly for many it caused a great deal of

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:03.927
hurt and agony that would last a lifetime, but it was an operation that saved

00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:09.715
probably thousands of children’s lives, and on that basis alone, it has gone

00:24:09.725 --> 00:24:15.015
down as one of the most important operations in British 20th century history.

00:24:17.715 --> 00:24:22.085
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Operation Pied

00:24:22.135 --> 00:24:26.635
Piper, The Evacuation of British Cities in World War II.

00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:29.735
Of course, there is a huge amount more to talk about on

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:33.275
this subject, and we only just scratched the surface.

00:24:33.955 --> 00:24:38.615
From evacuations of children in mainland Europe through to modern

00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:43.215
evacuations of warzones, I’m sorry we didn’t have time to discuss it all.

00:24:44.035 --> 00:24:47.435
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:24:47.795 --> 00:24:50.755
Did you know much about the evacuation of British cities?

00:24:51.315 --> 00:24:58.005
Were cities in your country evacuated during World War Two, and how was that different to Britain?

00:24:58.515 --> 00:25:03.965
Perhaps, if you are one of our older listeners, you might even have been evacuated yourself,

00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:09.895
or perhaps you remember stories your parents or grandparents told you about this period.

00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:15.505
I would love to know, so please feel free to share your thoughts and memories.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:17.016
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.336
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:27.066
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Art

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:32.386
of War, probably the most famous book about military strategy in the

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:37.736
world, and one that was written almost two and a half thousand years ago.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:43.276
We’ll talk about who actually wrote the book, because that’s not a simple answer.

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:47.306
We’ll also talk about what’s in the book, what you can learn from

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:52.696
it, and at the end we’ll try to figure out what you, as a learner of

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:57.556
English, can take from this book and apply to your own English learning.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:03.786
This is actually the second episode about ‘war’ - there was a member-only

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:09.676
one that came out a couple of days ago, episode 127, which was on the ethics,

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:14.756
and morality of war, of when a war can be considered ‘just’ and right.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:19.926
So, you can listen to the two episodes independently, but they do go quite nicely together.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:25.436
That one is available exclusively on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:32.136
Before we get right into The Art of War, I want to quickly remind you that you can get all of the

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:39.146
bonus episodes, like the one on Just War, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:45.036
for this episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:52.106
Until the end of January, which is less than 48 hours after this episode will be released, we’re

00:01:52.116 --> 00:01:57.576
also doing a special offer on Leonardo English membership, where you can join for the year and

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:02.876
get a private, one hour English Strategy Lesson with an amazing English teacher called Amy.

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:07.816
This episode is scheduled to come out on the 29th of January, so there

00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:12.076
will only be 2 days left to grab this offer, and when it’s gone, it’s gone.

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:17.126
The place to go for that is, of course, leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:21.986
OK then, The Art of War.

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:29.406
You have probably heard about this book, you will probably have seen quotes from it on social media.

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:34.256
But unless you have read it, you might not know what’s actually

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:38.516
in it, and the story of how it became quite so popular.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:43.796
There are very few other books that have been around for quite

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:48.231
so long that have remained so popular that are non-religious.

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:54.266
And it’s quite an achievement that a book that was written almost two and a

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:59.236
half thousand years ago, when the world was completely different, is still

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:03.916
used today by millions of people to help them think about how to live their

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:09.606
lives, how to act in the workplace, and how to compete in the modern world.

00:03:10.896 --> 00:03:17.726
Indeed, one of the most interesting things about The Art of War is that, although it

00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:23.996
is about ‘war’, the lessons in it can be applied to so many different aspects of life.

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:33.836
So on one level The Art of War is more about The Art of Life than war, and the lessons in it

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:40.536
are universal, no matter whether you were living in the second century BC in China or you’re

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:45.531
doing what you’re doing now, listening to a podcast episode and improving your English.

00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:50.626
To kick things off, I should start by saying that there is probably

00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:55.136
as much about The Art of War that we don’t know as we do know.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:04:00.486
The author is thought to be a Chinese general and military

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:05.396
strategist called Sun Tzu, who lived around the 5th century BC.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:14.736
On a practical note, Sun Tzu isn’t actually his real name, that just means ‘Master Sun’.

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:20.816
His birth name was Sun Wu, so if you hear someone referring

00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:26.456
to Sun Tzu, Sun zi, or Sun Wu, it’s all the same person.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:30.266
We’ll stick with Sun Tzu for the purposes of this episode.

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:39.506
When Sun Tzu was alive China was in a period called the Warring States, ‘warring’ means ‘at war’.

00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:45.226
Sun was from the Wu state of China, which is in modern day

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:49.396
Zhejiang province, to the east of the country, near to Shanghai.

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:58.166
In modern China, this part of the country is one of the wealthiest, a heart of industry and power.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:03.746
But during the Warring States era it was far from it.

00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:11.346
It was very much a peripheral state, with the most important states to the north, closer to Beijing.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:15.776
You’ll note that I haven’t given specific dates for

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:19.346
really anything here, because we simply don’t know.

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:25.826
Historians believe that Sun Tzu existed around this time, and

00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:29.466
that he started writing down his thoughts on military strategy.

00:05:30.656 --> 00:05:36.206
Since the 5th century BC the text has been changed, edited by

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:40.676
numerous different actors who added and removed parts of it.

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:46.576
So even if it were Sun that first wrote it, the text that you would

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:51.356
read today is almost certainly not the original written by Sun.

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:57.486
But that doesn’t make it any less interesting, or any less worthwhile reading.

00:05:57.986 --> 00:06:00.086
Perhaps it makes it even more so.

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:04.806
Indeed, when one thinks of some of the most widely read books in the

00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:09.996
world, especially the religious texts, the majority of those were

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:13.536
written by multiple different people over extended periods of time.

00:06:14.406 --> 00:06:21.246
The book remained a popular military strategy manual in China, but it wasn’t until the 18th

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:28.096
century, almost two thousand years after it was first written, that it reached the West, after

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:34.266
having been translated by a French Jesuit missionary, a man called Jean Joseph Marie Amiot.

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:41.386
There are rumours that The Art of War was prized by Napoleon, that he thought

00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:46.696
very highly of it, and that he used it as a guide for his military campaigns.

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:54.246
But his decision to invade Russia in the winter suggests that he might not have read the

00:06:54.256 --> 00:06:59.296
chapter on understanding the weather conditions on the battlefield before you set off.

00:07:00.526 --> 00:07:06.046
It wasn’t until the start of the 20th century that the book was translated

00:07:06.046 --> 00:07:12.086
into English, first with the title of The Book of War, with the translation

00:07:12.086 --> 00:07:16.886
of the title only later being commonly accepted as The Art of War.

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:23.466
In fact, the literal translation from the Chinese would be "Master Sun's

00:07:23.586 --> 00:07:29.406
Military Methods", so you could say that The Art of War is a lot more catchy.

00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:36.316
Since then it has been translated into dozens of different languages, and has been

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:41.766
credited by all sorts of military and non-military leaders for their successes.

00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:50.376
So, enough of the backstory, what is actually in The Art of War, and what can you learn from it?

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:55.176
I should say that it’s actually a very short book, and

00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:58.636
you can probably read the entire thing in under an hour.

00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:03.326
If you read it, you might be surprised to find that it

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:07.896
seems a little bit disorganised, a little bit disorderly.

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:13.686
The book is divided into 13 different chapters, each of

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:17.856
which discusses a different element of military strategy.

00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:25.755
But, as you might have guessed, it doesn’t really go into specific detail of how to fight a battle,

00:08:26.015 --> 00:08:31.835
how many soldiers are needed or what formations should be used against different types of enemies.

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:38.575
The lessons in The Art of War are all related to strategy, and how to think.

00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:44.665
This is why it has remained so popular, and why sports coaches,

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:49.455
politicians, and business leaders often swear by the lessons in it.

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:55.765
There are several themes in the book that are worth mentioning, and of course, if

00:08:55.765 --> 00:09:00.335
these are of interest I would certainly recommend actually reading the book yourself.

00:09:01.565 --> 00:09:06.455
The first lesson is that, although the book is about war, war

00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:11.025
and conflict should be avoided with diplomacy if at all possible.

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:17.105
Sun Tzu writes that fighting should be a last resort, and if there are

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:22.375
diplomatic ways to avoid a battle, then these should be preferable.

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:28.255
A quote you may have heard from this is “To win 100 battles is

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:32.415
not the height of skill, to subdue the enemy without fighting is."

00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:37.705
So Sun is saying here that the best way to beat your

00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:41.015
enemy is by avoiding the battlefield altogether.

00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:48.055
I guess that might not be what you’d expect to find in a book called The Art of War, right?

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:54.755
The second theme that I want to mention is the importance of preparation.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:59.235
Now, this is by no means revolutionary, Sun didn’t

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.435
invent the idea that it was important to be prepared.

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:08.655
But a recurrent theme in the book is that the person who is best prepared,

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:14.315
who knows the territory, who understands the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses,

00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:20.235
and perhaps most importantly, who has a well-trained army, will be victorious.

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:26.655
There’s a quote that you may have heard here, and that’s “it is said that if you know

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:32.515
your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you

00:10:32.825 --> 00:10:38.845
do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you

00:10:38.845 --> 00:10:43.885
do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle."

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:50.125
Our third, and final ‘general’ lesson here from The Art of War that is

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:55.585
worth pointing out is the importance of being adaptable, of analysing

00:10:55.595 --> 00:10:59.705
the situation at every possible moment and changing as required.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:05.105
Sun writes that a good leader should be constantly ready and

00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:10.255
adaptable to change, and that change actually presents opportunities.

00:11:11.115 --> 00:11:16.615
Indeed, Sun writes that a strong leader should try to hide their plans,

00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:21.475
hide their strategy so that it is hard for the enemy to make a plan.

00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:28.045
And similarly, a good leader should be ready to adapt at all times to fit the situation.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:34.925
There is evidently a lot more great advice in The Art of War, but these are three

00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:39.765
of the most important themes that I want to point out to give you a taste for it.

00:11:40.965 --> 00:11:45.535
Now, here’s the part where we try and see if there’s anything we can take

00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:49.765
from The Art of War about learning English, and about language learning.

00:11:50.895 --> 00:11:55.875
As far as I can see, nobody has ever done this before, perhaps because it is a

00:11:55.885 --> 00:12:01.915
little tenuous, the connections are a little unusual, but I think there are a few

00:12:01.915 --> 00:12:07.595
things that we can learn from The Art of War and apply to our approach to learning

00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:12.915
languages, and that you can apply to your own attitude towards learning English.

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:15.485
So, let’s give this a go.

00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:20.305
Firstly, here’s a direct quote from The Art of War:

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:25.875
“Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let

00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:30.435
your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.”

00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:36.455
When it comes to fighting a battle, the point here might be obvious - you

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:40.905
shouldn’t just do the same thing over and over, because the enemy will realise

00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:45.305
what you are doing, and you should be prepared to adapt to different situations.

00:12:46.415 --> 00:12:50.625
Now, can we take anything from this and apply it to learning English?

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:52.875
I think perhaps we can...

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:58.425
When many people learn a language, they just do one or two things,

00:12:58.465 --> 00:13:02.735
and assume that because they have got to a certain level with these

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.895
one or two things, they will continue to improve at the same level.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.180
But that is rarely true.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:15.820
What might have worked to get you to a certain point, developing a certain skill, probably won’t

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:23.030
get you to the next level, it probably won't help you get to where you want to get to next.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.620
And having a variety of different tools you can use, or tactics,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.370
as Sun Tzu would say, will mean that you are much better prepared.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:39.190
So instead of just being a master of Duolingo or bingeing TV shows on Netflix,

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:44.660
make sure you write in English, you listen to English podcasts like this one, that

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:50.090
you do things like Shadowing, and expose yourself to different styles of English.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:51.720
Make sense?

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.830
I think it does.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.390
Our second English learning lesson from The Art of War is, and again this is

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.630
a direct quote, “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.940
Tactics without strategy are the noise before defeat.”

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.000
The military lesson here is that if you have a plan, but no

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.530
tactics to execute it, you might win but it’ll take a long time.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.960
If you just have some tactics but no plan, then you will lose.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:30.070
Instead, you need both - a plan of action and tactics about how to achieve it.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.680
If we think about how this might apply to learning anything, including learning

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:42.240
English, it’s that you’ll have the best results with tactics, so we can interpret

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.610
tactics here are as different tools to improve your English, but you will also

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.550
benefit from an overall plan, a strategy of how to approach your learning.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:59.860
You might think that you can just sit down with Netflix, Duolingo, or podcasts and improvements

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:06.900
will magically come, but they will come faster and more easily with a detailed plan of

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.970
how all of the different tools and approaches you are planning to use will fit together.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.570
And our final lesson from Sun Tzu’s The Art of War that we can apply to learning English

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:24.550
is, and again, here’s a direct quote: “Opportunities multiply as they are seized."

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:31.590
When we think about this referring to warfare it means: when you see an opportunity,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.900
take it if it is sensible as it will probably lead to more opportunities.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.480
Now, how is he going to claim this relates to learning English, you might be asking yourself?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.168
Well, I think we can interpret it in exactly the same way, that if you see

00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:54.788
opportunities to engage in English, to chat to others in English, to join English

00:15:54.818 --> 00:16:01.288
communities, when you find an opportunity to use English, take it because it will

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:07.088
likely lead to more opportunities, which will themselves lead to more opportunities.

00:16:08.338 --> 00:16:12.928
But there’s one huge difference between learning English and The Art of War,

00:16:13.408 --> 00:16:17.508
and that is that learning a language shouldn’t be thought of as a battle.

00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:22.068
There is no enemy, despite how you might feel about phrasal verbs.

00:16:22.638 --> 00:16:27.788
You aren’t fighting against anyone, and indeed the magical thing about

00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:32.538
learning a language is that it isn’t a competition, so you might be

00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:35.648
thinking that you should ignore all of the advice you’ve just heard.

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:43.068
But perhaps, just perhaps, there is something that you can take from this 2,500 year

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:48.828
old book, and if it does help you with your English learning, then you won’t be the

00:16:49.068 --> 00:16:54.068
first, and certainly won’t be the last, to be guided by the works of Master Sun.

00:16:56.658 --> 00:16:59.938
Ok then, that is it for The Art of War.

00:17:00.148 --> 00:17:03.748
I hope you found it an interesting one, and that you learned something new.

00:17:04.928 --> 00:17:09.388
As I said at the start, this is part 2 of a mini, mini series on

00:17:09.398 --> 00:17:14.428
war, the previous episode was on the idea of Just War, so if you

00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:18.028
haven’t listened to that yet it’s on the website, leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:18.818 --> 00:17:23.358
It is one of our member-only ones, so if you are a member, you’ll find it on the website.

00:17:23.818 --> 00:17:28.618
And if you’re not yet a member of Leonardo English, then now is the time to change that.

00:17:29.328 --> 00:17:35.278
Membership of Leonardo English gives you access to all of our episodes, so that’s more than twice

00:17:35.308 --> 00:17:40.808
what you get on the podcast apps, plus subtitles, transcripts, key vocabulary, and much more.

00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:48.088
And as a final reminder, if you join as an annual Learner member before January 31st

00:17:48.398 --> 00:17:54.398
you’ll get a 60 minute private English Strategy Lesson with our amazing teacher, Amy, so

00:17:54.668 --> 00:17:59.628
she can set you up for language learning success, in a way that Sun Tzu would be proud of.

00:18:00.258 --> 00:18:05.188
So if that's of interest, the place to go is leonardoenglish.com.

00:18:06.258 --> 00:18:11.278
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:11.738 --> 00:18:16.718

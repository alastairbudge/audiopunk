Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:17.016
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.336
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:27.066
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Art

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:32.386
of War, probably the most famous book about military strategy in the

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:37.736
world, and one that was written almost two and a half thousand years ago.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:43.276
We’ll talk about who actually wrote the book, because that’s not a simple answer.

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:47.306
We’ll also talk about what’s in the book, what you can learn from

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:52.696
it, and at the end we’ll try to figure out what you, as a learner of

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:57.556
English, can take from this book and apply to your own English learning.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:03.786
This is actually the second episode about ‘war’ - there was a member-only

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:09.676
one that came out a couple of days ago, episode 127, which was on the ethics,

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:14.756
and morality of war, of when a war can be considered ‘just’ and right.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:19.926
So, you can listen to the two episodes independently, but they do go quite nicely together.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:25.436
That one is available exclusively on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:32.136
Before we get right into The Art of War, I want to quickly remind you that you can get all of the

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:39.146
bonus episodes, like the one on Just War, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:45.036
for this episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:49.966
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:54.946
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:59.986
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:04.726
So if that is of interest, and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:09.076
wouldn't be, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:13.102
OK then, The Art of War.

00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:20.522
You have probably heard about this book, you will probably have seen quotes from it on social media.

00:02:21.022 --> 00:02:25.372
But unless you have read it, you might not know what’s actually

00:02:25.392 --> 00:02:29.632
in it, and the story of how it became quite so popular.

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:34.912
There are very few other books that have been around for quite

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:39.347
so long that have remained so popular that are non-religious.

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:45.382
And it’s quite an achievement that a book that was written almost two and a

00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:50.352
half thousand years ago, when the world was completely different, is still

00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:55.032
used today by millions of people to help them think about how to live their

00:02:55.032 --> 00:03:00.722
lives, how to act in the workplace, and how to compete in the modern world.

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:08.842
Indeed, one of the most interesting things about The Art of War is that, although it

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:15.112
is about ‘war’, the lessons in it can be applied to so many different aspects of life.

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:24.952
So on one level The Art of War is more about The Art of Life than war, and the lessons in it

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:31.652
are universal, no matter whether you were living in the second century BC in China or you’re

00:03:31.652 --> 00:03:36.647
doing what you’re doing now, listening to a podcast episode and improving your English.

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:41.742
To kick things off, I should start by saying that there is probably

00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:46.252
as much about The Art of War that we don’t know as we do know.

00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:51.602
The author is thought to be a Chinese general and military

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:56.512
strategist called Sun Tzu, who lived around the 5th century BC.

00:03:58.462 --> 00:04:05.852
On a practical note, Sun Tzu isn’t actually his real name, that just means ‘Master Sun’.

00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:11.932
His birth name was Sun Wu, so if you hear someone referring

00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:17.572
to Sun Tzu, Sun zi, or Sun Wu, it’s all the same person.

00:04:18.282 --> 00:04:21.382
We’ll stick with Sun Tzu for the purposes of this episode.

00:04:22.552 --> 00:04:30.622
When Sun Tzu was alive China was in a period called the Warring States, ‘warring’ means ‘at war’.

00:04:31.742 --> 00:04:36.342
Sun was from the Wu state of China, which is in modern day

00:04:36.372 --> 00:04:40.512
Zhejiang province, to the east of the country, near to Shanghai.

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:49.282
In modern China, this part of the country is one of the wealthiest, a heart of industry and power.

00:04:50.482 --> 00:04:54.862
But during the Warring States era it was far from it.

00:04:55.262 --> 00:05:02.462
It was very much a peripheral state, with the most important states to the north, closer to Beijing.

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:06.892
You’ll note that I haven’t given specific dates for

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:10.462
really anything here, because we simply don’t know.

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:16.942
Historians believe that Sun Tzu existed around this time, and

00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:20.582
that he started writing down his thoughts on military strategy.

00:05:21.772 --> 00:05:27.322
Since the 5th century BC the text has been changed, edited by

00:05:27.492 --> 00:05:31.792
numerous different actors who added and removed parts of it.

00:05:32.622 --> 00:05:37.692
So even if it were Sun that first wrote it, the text that you would

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:42.472
read today is almost certainly not the original written by Sun.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:48.602
But that doesn’t make it any less interesting, or any less worthwhile reading.

00:05:49.102 --> 00:05:51.202
Perhaps it makes it even more so.

00:05:51.912 --> 00:05:55.922
Indeed, when one thinks of some of the most widely read books in the

00:05:56.122 --> 00:06:01.112
world, especially the religious texts, the majority of those were

00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:04.652
written by multiple different people over extended periods of time.

00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:12.362
The book remained a popular military strategy manual in China, but it wasn’t until the 18th

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:19.212
century, almost two thousand years after it was first written, that it reached the West, after

00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:25.382
having been translated by a French Jesuit missionary, a man called Jean Joseph Marie Amiot.

00:06:26.682 --> 00:06:32.502
There are rumours that The Art of War was prized by Napoleon, that he thought

00:06:32.502 --> 00:06:37.812
very highly of it, and that he used it as a guide for his military campaigns.

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:45.362
But his decision to invade Russia in the winter suggests that he might not have read the

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:50.412
chapter on understanding the weather conditions on the battlefield before he set off.

00:06:51.642 --> 00:06:57.162
It wasn’t until the start of the 20th century that the book was translated

00:06:57.162 --> 00:07:03.202
into English, first with the title of The Book of War, with the translation

00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:08.002
of the title only later being commonly accepted as The Art of War.

00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:14.582
In fact, the literal translation from the Chinese would be "Master Sun's

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:20.522
Military Methods", so you could say that The Art of War is a lot more catchy.

00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:27.432
Since then it has been translated into dozens of different languages, and has been

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:32.882
credited by all sorts of military and non-military leaders for their successes.

00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:41.492
So, enough of the backstory, what is actually in The Art of War, and what can you learn from it?

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.292
I should say that it’s actually a very short book, and

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.752
you can probably read the entire thing in under an hour.

00:07:50.852 --> 00:07:54.442
If you read it, you might be surprised to find that it

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:59.012
seems a little bit disorganised, a little bit disorderly.

00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:04.802
The book is divided into 13 different chapters, each of

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:08.972
which discusses a different element of military strategy.

00:08:09.762 --> 00:08:16.872
But, as you might have guessed, it doesn’t really go into specific detail of how to fight a battle,

00:08:17.132 --> 00:08:22.952
how many soldiers are needed or what formations should be used against different types of enemies.

00:08:23.612 --> 00:08:29.692
The lessons in The Art of War are all related to strategy, and how to think.

00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:35.782
This is why it has remained so popular, and why sports coaches,

00:08:35.822 --> 00:08:40.572
politicians, and business leaders often swear by the lessons in it.

00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:46.882
There are several themes in the book that are worth mentioning, and of course, if

00:08:46.882 --> 00:08:51.452
these are of interest I would certainly recommend actually reading the book yourself.

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:57.572
The first lesson is that, although the book is about war, war

00:08:57.602 --> 00:09:02.142
and conflict should be avoided with diplomacy if at all possible.

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:08.222
Sun Tzu writes that fighting should be a last resort, and if there are

00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:13.492
diplomatic ways to avoid a battle, then these should be preferable.

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:19.372
A quote you may have heard from this is “To win 100 battles is

00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:23.532
not the height of skill, to subdue the enemy without fighting is."

00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:28.822
So Sun is saying here that the best way to beat your

00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:32.132
enemy is by avoiding the battlefield altogether.

00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:39.172
I guess that might not be what you’d expect to find in a book called The Art of War, right?

00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:45.872
The second theme that I want to mention is the importance of preparation.

00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:50.352
Now, this is by no means revolutionary, Sun didn’t

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:53.552
invent the idea that it was important to be prepared.

00:09:54.472 --> 00:09:59.772
But a recurrent theme in the book is that the person who is best prepared,

00:10:00.242 --> 00:10:05.432
who knows the territory, who understands the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses,

00:10:05.722 --> 00:10:11.352
and perhaps most importantly, who has a well-trained army, will be victorious.

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:17.772
There’s a quote that you may have heard here, and that’s “it is said that if you know

00:10:17.772 --> 00:10:23.632
your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you

00:10:23.942 --> 00:10:29.962
do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:35.002
do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle."

00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:41.242
Our third, and final ‘general’ lesson here from The Art of War that is

00:10:41.242 --> 00:10:46.702
worth pointing out is the importance of being adaptable, of analysing

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:50.822
the situation at every possible moment and changing as required.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:56.222
Sun writes that a good leader should be constantly ready and

00:10:56.232 --> 00:11:01.372
adaptable to change, and that change actually presents opportunities.

00:11:02.232 --> 00:11:07.732
Indeed, Sun writes that a strong leader should try to hide their plans,

00:11:07.912 --> 00:11:12.592
hide their strategy so that it is hard for the enemy to make a plan.

00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:19.162
And similarly, a good leader should be ready to adapt at all times to fit the situation.

00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:26.042
There is evidently a lot more great advice in The Art of War, but these are three

00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:30.882
of the most important themes that I want to point out to give you a taste for it.

00:11:32.082 --> 00:11:36.652
Now, here’s the part where we try and see if there’s anything we can take

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:40.882
from The Art of War about learning English, and about language learning.

00:11:42.012 --> 00:11:46.992
As far as I can see, nobody has ever done this before, perhaps because it is a

00:11:47.002 --> 00:11:53.032
little tenuous, the connections are a little unusual, but I think there are a few

00:11:53.032 --> 00:11:58.712
things that we can learn from The Art of War and apply to our approach to learning

00:11:58.712 --> 00:12:04.032
languages, and that you can apply to your own attitude towards learning English.

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.602
So, let’s give this a go.

00:12:07.932 --> 00:12:11.422
Firstly, here’s a direct quote from The Art of War:

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:16.992
“Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:21.552
your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.”

00:12:23.022 --> 00:12:27.572
When it comes to fighting a battle, the point here might be obvious - you

00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:32.022
shouldn’t just do the same thing over and over, because the enemy will realise

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:36.422
what you are doing, and you should be prepared to adapt to different situations.

00:12:37.532 --> 00:12:41.742
Now, can we take anything from this and apply it to learning English?

00:12:42.422 --> 00:12:43.992
I think perhaps we can...

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:49.542
When many people learn a language, they just do one or two things,

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:53.852
and assume that because they have got to a certain level with these

00:12:53.992 --> 00:12:58.012
one or two things, they will continue to improve at the same level.

00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:00.297
But that is rarely true.

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:06.937
What might have worked to get you to a certain point, developing a certain skill, probably won’t

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:14.146
get you to the next level, it probably won't help you get to where you want to get to next.

00:13:14.146 --> 00:13:18.737
And having a variety of different tools you can use, or tactics,

00:13:18.787 --> 00:13:22.487
as Sun Tzu would say, will mean that you are much better prepared.

00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:30.307
So instead of just being a master of Duolingo or bingeing TV shows on Netflix,

00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:35.777
make sure you write in English, you listen to English podcasts like this one, that

00:13:35.777 --> 00:13:41.207
you do things like Shadowing, and expose yourself to different styles of English.

00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:42.837
Make sense?

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:43.947
I think it does.

00:13:45.217 --> 00:13:50.507
Our second English learning lesson from The Art of War is, and again this is

00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:55.747
a direct quote, “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory.

00:13:56.427 --> 00:14:00.057
Tactics without strategy are the noise before defeat.”

00:14:01.137 --> 00:14:05.117
The military lesson here is that if you have a plan, but no

00:14:05.187 --> 00:14:09.647
tactics to execute it, you might win but it’ll take a long time.

00:14:10.437 --> 00:14:15.077
If you just have some tactics but no plan, then you will lose.

00:14:15.907 --> 00:14:21.187
Instead, you need both - a plan of action and tactics about how to achieve it.

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:27.797
If we think about how this might apply to learning anything, including learning

00:14:27.807 --> 00:14:33.357
English, it’s that you’ll have the best results with tactics, so we can interpret

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:38.727
tactics here are as different tools to improve your English, but you will also

00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:43.667
benefit from an overall plan, a strategy of how to approach your learning.

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:50.977
You might think that you can just sit down with Netflix, Duolingo, or podcasts and improvements

00:14:51.277 --> 00:14:58.017
will magically come, but they will come faster and more easily with a detailed plan of

00:14:58.207 --> 00:15:03.087
how all of the different tools and approaches you are planning to use will fit together.

00:15:04.287 --> 00:15:09.687
And our final lesson from Sun Tzu’s The Art of War that we can apply to learning English

00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:15.667
is, and again, here’s a direct quote: “Opportunities multiply as they are seized."

00:15:16.907 --> 00:15:22.707
When we think about this referring to warfare it means: when you see an opportunity,

00:15:23.137 --> 00:15:28.017
take it if it is sensible as it will probably lead to more opportunities.

00:15:29.257 --> 00:15:34.597
Now, how is he going to claim this relates to learning English, you might be asking yourself?

00:15:35.077 --> 00:15:40.284
Well, I think we can interpret it in exactly the same way, that if you see

00:15:40.304 --> 00:15:45.904
opportunities to engage in English, to chat to others in English, to join English

00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:52.404
communities, when you find an opportunity to use English, take it because it will

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:58.204
likely lead to more opportunities, which will themselves lead to more opportunities.

00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:04.044
But there’s one huge difference between learning English and The Art of War,

00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:08.624
and that is that learning a language shouldn’t be thought of as a battle.

00:16:08.984 --> 00:16:13.184
There is no enemy, despite how you might feel about phrasal verbs.

00:16:13.754 --> 00:16:18.904
You aren’t fighting against anyone, and indeed the magical thing about

00:16:18.904 --> 00:16:23.654
learning a language is that it isn’t a competition, so you might be

00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:26.764
thinking that you should ignore all of the advice you’ve just heard.

00:16:28.034 --> 00:16:34.184
But perhaps, just perhaps, there is something that you can take from this 2,500 year

00:16:34.184 --> 00:16:39.944
old book, and if it does help you with your English learning, then you won’t be the

00:16:40.184 --> 00:16:45.184
first, and certainly won’t be the last, to be guided by the works of Master Sun.

00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:51.054
Ok then, that is it for The Art of War.

00:16:51.264 --> 00:16:54.864
I hope you found it an interesting one, and that you learned something new.

00:16:56.044 --> 00:17:00.504
As I said at the start, this is part 2 of a mini, mini series on

00:17:00.514 --> 00:17:05.544
war, the previous episode was on the idea of Just War, so if you

00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:09.144
haven’t listened to that yet it’s on the website, leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:09.934 --> 00:17:14.474
It is one of our member-only ones, so if you are a member, you’ll find it on the website.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:19.734
And if you’re not yet a member of Leonardo English, then now is the time to change that.

00:17:20.444 --> 00:17:26.394
Membership of Leonardo English gives you access to all of our episodes, so that’s more than twice

00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:31.924
what you get on the podcast apps, plus subtitles, transcripts, key vocabulary, and much more.

00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:37.754
So if that's of interest, the place to go is leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:43.844
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:44.304 --> 00:17:49.284

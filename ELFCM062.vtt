Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:15.279
Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.529
interesting things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:28.086
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something strange that tends to

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:36.666
happen to countries when they find oil, gold, diamonds, or any other sort of natural resource.

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:43.911
You might think that finding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of natural

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:50.451
resources in your country might be a blessing, a great thing for your nation.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:01:00.501
But actually in many cases, this discovery proves to be exactly the opposite; a curse that

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:07.311
brings conflict, slows down economic development, and is deeply damaging to a country.

00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:13.281
So in today's episode, we are going to find out why that is.

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:20.121
Before we get started though, let me just quickly remind those of you listening to this

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:26.781
episode on your favourite podcast app, that you can find all of the episodes, plus transcripts,

00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:33.491
key vocabulary, subtitles, and more over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:38.331
We've also made it much easier to find exactly what you want to listen

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:44.211
to, so you can now filter episodes by subject, and there are nice little

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:48.831
tags on every episode so it's easy to find what you want to listen to.

00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.111
So go and check that out.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:53.441
It is at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.902
Okay, then the resource curse.

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:03.217
There's an expression in English and that is to 'strike gold'.

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:08.437
It means to suddenly become rich or successful after

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:12.037
having found something, normally something unexpected.

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:18.467
Of course it comes from the idea that if you are digging and

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:23.842
your shovel hits gold, well, then you are going to end up rich.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.677
In theory, it makes sense.

00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:29.887
You find gold, you sell gold, you get rich.

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:35.167
However, history shows us that for countries, at

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:39.807
least what often happens is completely the opposite.

00:02:41.337 --> 00:02:48.477
When a country strikes gold, and that gold can either be literal gold or any

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:55.557
other kind of profitable resource oil, gas, diamonds, or other minerals it can

00:02:55.557 --> 00:03:01.437
actually be worse for the people of that country than if they had never found it.

00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:06.587
It is a pretty interesting idea, and today we are going

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:10.217
to talk about some of the reasons why this happens.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.870
Let's just start with some numbers.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.970
For countries in Africa, the economist from Oxford university, Paul Collier showed that the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:30.865
probability of there being a civil war in any five year period is less than 1% for countries without

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:39.865
large amounts of natural resources, but it is around 25% for countries with natural resources.

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:47.935
And since 1990, oil-producing countries have been twice as likely

00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:53.965
to have had a civil war compared with non oil-producing countries.

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:59.235
But it's not just about wars and conflict.

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:04.665
While wars and conflict don't help, of course, there are a plethora

00:04:04.665 --> 00:04:10.155
of reasons that countries with a lot of natural resources tend to grow

00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:16.122
slower than countries without a large amount of natural resources.

00:04:17.772 --> 00:04:24.192
This theory first started to gain traction, to become popular, in the mid

00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:31.242
1990s when two famous Harvard economists published a paper that suggested that

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:38.472
countries that exported more resources, so agricultural products, minerals, and

00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:44.664
fuel, that these countries saw slower economic growth than those that didn't.

00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:53.604
It was, and still is, an interesting idea because it goes against what you might think.

00:04:54.564 --> 00:05:00.234
At first glance, you might think it must be a fantastic thing for a country to just

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:07.914
find billions or trillions of dollars worth of natural resources under the ground.

00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:15.221
All that the country needs to do is find a way of getting them out, and then it can build

00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:22.541
schools, hospitals, universities, and everything it needs for its citizens to prosper.

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:31.931
But interestingly, these Harvard economists suggested that exactly the opposite often happens.

00:05:33.446 --> 00:05:40.466
There are exceptions, of course, but they showed broadly that the more gold a

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:47.096
country found, the poorer that country got, or at least the slower it developed.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.191
And there are a few reasons for this.

00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:54.751
Firstly, when you are selling something like oil or

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:59.491
gold or any kind of mineral, you sell it in dollars.

00:06:00.451 --> 00:06:03.961
When you sell your resources, you receive the money in

00:06:03.961 --> 00:06:08.701
dollars, which you then need to convert into your own currency.

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:15.598
Because there are so many dollars coming into your country this often causes

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:22.138
inflation; prices go up and your money is worth less within the country.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:29.013
But the other thing that often happens within countries that rely on exporting

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:35.853
resources is that their own currency strengthens against the dollar, so it

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:42.273
becomes more expensive for foreigners to buy products from that country.

00:06:43.883 --> 00:06:49.343
What this does is it makes exporting things less competitive,

00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:55.558
thereby hurting people who produce goods and sell them abroad.

00:06:57.358 --> 00:07:04.978
To give you an example of this, if I used to make something and export it for $10,

00:07:05.368 --> 00:07:12.418
but now, because the currency in my country has increased in value, I need to sell the

00:07:12.418 --> 00:07:19.873
same thing for $20, well, there are going to be fewer people that will want to buy it.

00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:28.603
Because the export industry becomes less competitive, it doesn't grow, and so the country

00:07:28.603 --> 00:07:35.713
becomes completely reliant on the money it gets from exporting its natural resources.

00:07:37.153 --> 00:07:40.093
You might say, well, that's no bad thing.

00:07:40.423 --> 00:07:43.723
If a country is making enough money through selling

00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:48.593
oil, gas, or gold or whatever it is, is that a problem?

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:53.573
Look at Saudi Arabia, that doesn't seem to be doing too badly.

00:07:54.833 --> 00:08:01.133
Of course there are exceptions to every rule, but in many cases, having large amounts of

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:08.603
natural resources means that the entire country becomes completely dependent on this money.

00:08:09.962 --> 00:08:16.827
In most countries, the government collects money through taxes from its people, it therefore

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:23.307
needs to be accountable to its people because it's the people who pay their salaries.

00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:31.647
But if suddenly the government gets a huge new source of income from selling

00:08:31.647 --> 00:08:38.370
natural resources, then the income it gets from taxes becomes less important.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.830
And because it becomes less important, governments often become

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.570
less accountable to the people they are supposed to govern.

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:56.336
And this somewhat inevitably leads to countries with large amounts of natural resources

00:08:56.666 --> 00:09:04.136
being more likely to have authoritarian leaders and to have increased levels of corruption.

00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:12.506
As I'm sure we know the behaviour of lots of oil and mining companies over

00:09:12.506 --> 00:09:19.286
the last few decades has been, well, not very admirable, and there are dozens

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:26.066
of cases of large companies offering bribes to local politicians and leaders.

00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:32.832
The president of Equatorial Guinea, for example, has an estimated net

00:09:32.832 --> 00:09:41.802
worth of $600 million, and it was found that he had accepted $300 million

00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:47.172
from the large US oil companies, Exxon mobil and Hess corporation.

00:09:48.902 --> 00:09:56.732
Equatorial Guinea is, on a GDP per capita basis at least, one of the richest countries in Africa.

00:09:57.152 --> 00:10:04.712
Yet it's 141st out of 189 on the UN's human development index.

00:10:05.252 --> 00:10:10.202
So clearly that oil money is not trickling down to the people.

00:10:12.172 --> 00:10:17.482
Other than the increased likelihood of war, the fact that it causes inflation and harms

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:24.807
exports, and that it leads to more authoritarian leaders who are often more corrupt, there are

00:10:24.897 --> 00:10:30.957
a few other problems with suddenly finding that you have a large amount of natural resources.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:37.818
Natural resources, or commodities, have very volatile prices;

00:10:38.298 --> 00:10:42.388
the price can go up a lot, but it can also go down a lot.

00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:47.823
For countries that are reliant on natural resources to

00:10:47.823 --> 00:10:53.133
generate money, this makes planning for anything pretty hard.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:59.583
Life is great when the price goes up, but when it comes down, the

00:10:59.583 --> 00:11:04.293
state suddenly gets significantly less money than it had planned for.

00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:09.092
One of the reasons that Venezuela is having such trouble

00:11:09.092 --> 00:11:14.202
now is that the price for oil has dropped significantly.

00:11:15.372 --> 00:11:26.243
In 2008 the price of a barrel of oil was $144; in April of 2020 it was under $20.

00:11:27.533 --> 00:11:32.633
Obviously, if your country is dependent on money from something like oil,

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:38.423
then it's very hard to predict how much money you'll get in the future.

00:11:39.518 --> 00:11:44.918
Maybe it'll be more than you get now, but maybe it'll be a lot less.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:53.240
So what often happens is countries tend to borrow a lot of money if they need it

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.450
quickly, when prices are low, but they are then saddled with, they are weighed

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:06.200
down by these huge debts that they have to continue to pay for years ahead.

00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:12.331
This idea of the resource curse isn't just a modern thing though,

00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:18.011
and it doesn't only apply if you find resources in your own country.

00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:24.011
There is quite a persuasive theory that the resource curse is

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:28.571
one of the reasons that caused the fall of the Spanish empire.

00:12:29.613 --> 00:12:35.433
After colonising large parts of Latin America, Spain was able to bring back

00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:42.363
huge amounts of precious minerals to Europe: silver, gold, and other minerals.

00:12:43.323 --> 00:12:48.333
Of course, there was a great human cost, but from a currency point of

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:54.543
view, the Spanish got these riches almost for free they simply took them.

00:12:55.495 --> 00:13:01.765
Bringing these goods back to Spain and then selling them for lots of money meant there was a

00:13:01.765 --> 00:13:09.625
lot of money that came into Spain and reduced the incentives for development of other industries

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:16.975
within Spain, so there wasn't as much attention paid to things like investment in education.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.740
The result of this was that the Spanish empire was rich and strong for a while.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:32.050
However, as this influx of cash from the sale of minerals found in Latin, America had made

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:38.620
it lazy, it wasn't building any strong foundations that would help preserve its strength.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.060
That's one theory in any case.

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:48.465
There are however, a handful of countries that disprove everything

00:13:48.855 --> 00:13:54.645
I've said, countries that have large amounts of natural resources that

00:13:54.652 --> 00:14:00.047
they've managed to use sensibly, and for the benefit of their citizens.

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:07.577
The classic example is Norway, a small fishing country in the North Sea that now enjoys

00:14:07.607 --> 00:14:13.157
one of the highest per capita incomes and highest quality of living in the world.

00:14:14.467 --> 00:14:20.017
Botswana, which is the world's largest producer of diamonds has remained

00:14:20.047 --> 00:14:25.267
free from civil war and is one of the wealthiest countries in Africa.

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:30.049
And one that most people wouldn't think of is Canada.

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:35.319
It's actually thought to have the second largest oil reserves in the

00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:41.463
world after Saudi Arabia, yet it hasn't fallen prey to the resource curse.

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:50.343
So having a large amount of natural resources and striking gold, doesn't always have

00:14:50.343 --> 00:14:57.243
to be a curse, but it certainly is something that a country needs to be careful about.

00:14:58.923 --> 00:15:06.273
Back in 1976, the Venezuelan oil minister, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso said that

00:15:06.633 --> 00:15:13.143
"10 years from now, 20 years from now....you will see, oil will bring us ruin.

00:15:13.773 --> 00:15:16.143
It is the devil's excrement."

00:15:17.303 --> 00:15:17.393
Okay.

00:15:17.669 --> 00:15:23.189
Well, it happened a little after 20 years later, but he was proved to be right.

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:29.069
For Venezuela, it most certainly was the devil's excrement.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.719
Okay then, that is it for today's episode.

00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:38.559
I hope that it has been an interesting one and that you now

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:43.554
know that striking gold doesn't always mean, well striking gold.

00:15:44.482 --> 00:15:49.882

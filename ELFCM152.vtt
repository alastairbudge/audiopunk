Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:16.468
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:21.148
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:27.618
I'm Alastair Budge and today, as part three of this three part mini-series on

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:32.648
the Age of Revolution, we are going to be talking about The French Revolution.

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:38.868
As far as revolutions go, it’s up there with the American Revolution as the

00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:43.738
political event that has had the most lasting impact on the world we live in.

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:51.238
Over a period of 10 years, Europe’s most populous country went from a monarchy to

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:57.108
a republic, and ended up becoming what most people today would call a dictatorship.

00:00:58.328 --> 00:01:02.078
We will tell this story with the same format as the episodes

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:04.678
on the Industrial Revolution and American Revolution.

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:09.528
First, we’ll discuss the causes of the revolution, then the course,

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:13.658
what actually happened, and finish by discussing the consequences.

00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:18.458
So, causes, course, and consequences - I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:23.928
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:30.058
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcripts, and the key vocabulary for this

00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:35.548
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:41.478
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English, and join a community

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:46.718
of curious minds from all over the world, I think it's just over 50 countries now, doing

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:52.618
meetups, exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:56.668
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:56.668 --> 00:02:00.468
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:04.658
OK then, The French Revolution.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.098
Our story starts, of course, in France.

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:12.068
France in the 18th century was one of the most

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.418
powerful countries in Europe, and therefore, the world.

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:22.508
It was home to some of the most influential thinkers, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Denis Diderot.

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:29.058
It was seen as a great defender of freedom, having supported the United States in its

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:34.258
battle for independence against Great Britain, as we heard about in the last episode.

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:40.048
Its population had grown from 18 to 26 million during the

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:44.178
18th century, and it was the most populous country in Europe.

00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:52.858
If this was all you knew about France in 1789, you could be forgiven for scratching your head

00:02:52.908 --> 00:03:00.128
and wondering why the country was thrown into revolution, its entire society turned on its head.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:04.708
Beneath the surface though, beneath these superficial

00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:09.478
soundbites, not everything was rosy, it wasn't all OK.

00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:13.268
France was a deeply unequal society.

00:03:13.518 --> 00:03:21.488
It was in effect a feudal society with corruption at every level in this unequal pyramid.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:27.088
Peasants worked the land for very little pay, while the aristocrats,

00:03:27.088 --> 00:03:31.898
the richest in society enjoyed a luxurious standard of living.

00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:37.998
The financial and military support that France had provided to the United

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:43.458
States of America had cost the country dearly, and the nation was very poor.

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:50.348
It was also impoverished, it had lost a lot of money, through lengthy wars

00:03:50.368 --> 00:03:54.958
against the British, including the so-called Seven Years’ War, which went

00:03:54.968 --> 00:04:02.588
on from 1756 to 1763, which resulted in an expensive defeat for France.

00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:10.408
The large increase in population, combined with several years of bad weather and bad harvests,

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:16.428
had meant that there were food shortages throughout the country, and huge price increases.

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:20.088
On the throne was King Louis XVI.

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:27.198
Beside him was his queen, Marie Antoinette, a deeply unpopular woman due to her

00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:32.858
complete lack of sympathy towards normal French people, a love of spending large

00:04:32.858 --> 00:04:38.568
amounts of money and some unfortunate prejudice against her because she was Austrian.

00:04:39.428 --> 00:04:44.208
So, the French state owed large amounts of money, it had big debts,

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:49.388
but France wasn’t collecting enough money in taxes to pay its bills.

00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:56.718
Taxes in France in the mid 18th century were paid mainly by the poor, by the peasants.

00:04:57.428 --> 00:05:01.488
The richest people in French society paid very few taxes,

00:05:01.648 --> 00:05:06.298
and their lifestyles were financed by poor people’s taxes.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:14.158
What’s more, the system of collecting taxes was not only inefficient but it also

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:20.878
resulted in the tax collectors [so called tax farmers] themselves becoming rich.

00:05:22.128 --> 00:05:27.888
If you have listened to the episode from a couple of weeks ago about Tax, and remember

00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:33.288
our example of Arlette in Paris, it’s clear that things have changed dramatically.

00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:39.958
King Louis XVI needed to find a way of generating extra money, and the

00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.538
simplest way to do that, or so he thought, would be to raise taxes.

00:05:45.808 --> 00:05:49.348
But although he was the king of France, he didn’t have the

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:53.838
power to just snap his fingers and put through a tax raise.

00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:58.618
To do that, he would need to call something called the States-General.

00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:03.728
This was a body, a national assembly, that represented the

00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:07.888
three classes of French society, as it had been divided.

00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:13.658
The first state, or class, was the Clergy, the members of the church.

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:21.608
The second class was the nobility, the richest and most powerful non-religious members of society.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:27.058
These two classes owned the vast majority of all of the land,

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:30.758
and with it, they controlled the money, and the country.

00:06:31.648 --> 00:06:35.108
And the third class was everyone else, the commoners.

00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:42.058
This third class, this everyone else class, represented 99% of French society.

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:43.988
It was almost everyone.

00:06:45.098 --> 00:06:54.088
But the problem was that the voting system in this States-General was one vote for one class,

00:06:54.188 --> 00:07:00.828
it didn’t matter that the third class represented 99% of the population, it only got one vote.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:07.448
And given that the first and second classes had very similar aims and

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:12.898
motivations, remember that was the Clergy and the Nobility, they could veto,

00:07:13.168 --> 00:07:18.625
they could vote down anything proposed by the third class, by everyone else.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.910
This States-General was called by Louis XVI in 1789, the first time

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.400
it had been called since 1614, the first time in almost 200 years.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.219
But to state the obvious Europe was a very different place, and France

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:43.619
was a very different country in 1789 compared to what it had been in 1614.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:49.209
Enlightenment ideas, which you might remember from the Enlightenment episode

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:53.549
(which you can find on the website), had been flourishing, there had been certain

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:59.139
freedoms of the press and freedoms of speech that meant people could question the

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:05.529
old ideas, they could ask themselves why things needed to continue in that way.

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:12.349
Why was it right that the first two classes should be able to have effective control

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:18.456
over the legislation, when they represented a tiny minority of the population.

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:24.844
The States-General couldn’t come to an agreement, and to cut a long story short,

00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:31.644
the third class broke away and declared themselves to be a new National Assembly,

00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:37.274
and that they wouldn’t stop until a new constitution of France was created.

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:44.164
King Louis relented, he gave up, there were limited reforms, and there was a feeling

00:08:44.174 --> 00:08:50.254
that change was afoot in France, there was change in the air, that finally the people

00:08:50.304 --> 00:08:55.924
were being given some of the power and representation that had been denied to them.

00:08:56.554 --> 00:09:01.394
According to an eyewitness account, a historian of the revolution called

00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:06.984
François Mignet, people were, and I'm quoting here, "intoxicated with

00:09:06.984 --> 00:09:11.954
liberty and enthusiasm" they were drunk with liberty and enthusiasm.

00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:18.844
But there were rumours of an aristocratic conspiracy, that the King was about to

00:09:18.844 --> 00:09:24.954
send in the Swiss Guards, his own soldiers, to crack down on the common people.

00:09:25.814 --> 00:09:30.374
On July 14th, a large group of Parisians, people from Paris,

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:35.654
congregated outside the Bastille, a large fortress in central Paris.

00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:42.524
The Bastille was a symbol of royal power - it had been used as a prison, and it also

00:09:42.524 --> 00:09:47.654
contained large amounts of weapons that these protestors wanted to get their hands on.

00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:53.514
The protestors stormed the Bastille, they broke into it, they killed the

00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:58.694
man who was in charge of it, and cut off his head and put it on a pole.

00:09:59.334 --> 00:10:04.164
And this day was for many the start of the French Revolution.

00:10:05.194 --> 00:10:08.894
Indeed, it’s celebrated as a public holiday in France,

00:10:09.064 --> 00:10:11.726
in English it's called Bastille Day, July 14th.

00:10:12.974 --> 00:10:18.934
At the time, although the protestors inside the Bastille probably knew something exciting

00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:24.174
and important was happening, they weren’t to know quite how important it was to be.

00:10:25.064 --> 00:10:29.484
Louis XVI was still king of the country, but it was clear

00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:33.524
that the balance of power had shifted away from him.

00:10:34.394 --> 00:10:41.464
By the end of August there were wide-sweeping reforms, requiring aristocrats to pay taxes, and

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:47.974
reducing the tax burden on the poorest, reducing the amount of tax that the poorest had to pay.

00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:53.944
The Catholic Church, which had previously held an iron grip over

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:58.524
the lives of ordinary French people, and required them to pay large

00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:03.146
amounts in taxes directly to the church, was also losing control.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:07.976
France was moving away from being a country controlled

00:11:08.196 --> 00:11:12.366
by king and church, to one controlled by its citizens.

00:11:13.246 --> 00:11:19.176
This might seem like a trivial thing to us now, it might seem unremarkable and obvious,

00:11:19.376 --> 00:11:25.756
but it was a huge shift for French people at the time, who had previously been required

00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:32.436
to pay large taxes to landowners, the church and aristocrats, suffering without enough

00:11:32.436 --> 00:11:38.746
food to put on their table while the richest in society enjoyed lavish lives of leisure.

00:11:39.876 --> 00:11:44.976
Also in August of 1789 the Declaration of The Rights of Man and The

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:49.416
Citizen was published, which was a monumentally important document.

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:54.776
It was inspired by the Enlightenment thinkers, from Rousseau to Montesquieu,

00:11:55.106 --> 00:12:01.196
and by the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, 13 years before;

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:06.526
it quickly enshrined in law the rights that applied to men in France.

00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:13.116
Unfortunately it was normally men, not women, and it didn’t actually say anything

00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:19.396
against slavery, but it was a big step forward compared to the previous situation.

00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:26.226
The period from late 1789 through to early 1791 was actually

00:12:26.276 --> 00:12:30.166
relatively peaceful, especially considering what was to come.

00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:36.046
It was peaceful in terms of bloodshed, there weren’t that many people being killed,

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:42.096
but there was intense debate about what sort of society France should become.

00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:47.166
What place did a monarchy have in the future of the country?

00:12:47.374 --> 00:12:49.344
What should be done with the king?

00:12:50.344 --> 00:12:55.774
The more radical side was led by a man called Robespierre, who believed that the

00:12:55.784 --> 00:13:01.234
future of revolutionary France wasn’t compatible with the king: the king had to go.

00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:07.334
In any case, Louis XVI was losing power, and losing power fast.

00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:14.304
In 1791 he and his family tried to flee the country, apparently

00:13:14.414 --> 00:13:18.864
in order to meet pro-Royalist soldiers who would join him in a

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:24.234
counter-revolution, but he was recognised and brought back to Paris.

00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:30.434
Louis XVI was now effectively trapped in France, a prisoner in his own

00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:36.044
country, and with a fraction of the power he had held a few years beforehand.

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:43.624
Although large parts of the country were swept up in a revolutionary mood, not everyone was.

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:49.864
Many aristocrats had fled France to reunite with relations in places

00:13:49.864 --> 00:13:53.834
like Austria, with the view that they would be safer there, and

00:13:53.994 --> 00:13:58.214
they could mount an attack back on France and retake their country.

00:13:59.264 --> 00:14:04.344
And although the revolutionaries and the king didn’t see eye to eye, they both

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:10.493
supported the idea of going to war with Austria, which France did in 1792.

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:17.524
For the revolutionaries, they wanted to spread the idea of revolution throughout Europe.

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.984
And King Louis XVI, why did he support the war?

00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:29.454
Well, he was a bit stuck, and thought that if France went to war and lost, then

00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:34.474
his relations in Austria would be happy to put him back on the French throne.

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:39.644
The war didn’t go particularly well for France to start off with.

00:14:39.744 --> 00:14:46.014
The Prussians had joined forces with the Austrians, and the French suffered numerous defeats.

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:51.504
The Austro-Prussian army issued a document called the Brunswick

00:14:51.534 --> 00:14:56.734
Manifesto that said that if the French royal family was harmed, Paris

00:14:56.764 --> 00:15:00.814
would be burned to the ground, and no protester’s life would be spared.

00:15:01.837 --> 00:15:07.664
The document was intended to intimidate the French, but it had the opposite effect.

00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:16.344
They imprisoned the French royal family and on August 10th 1792 they abolished the French monarchy.

00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:25.315
Five months later, on January 21st, 1793,  Louis XVI was executed, after having

00:15:25.315 --> 00:15:30.865
been found guilty of the crime of high treason, of betraying his country.

00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:36.665
As his head was sliced off his body using a new device called the guillotine,

00:15:36.955 --> 00:15:42.485
this ended the near thousand year rule of absolute monarchy in France.

00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:49.335
Nine months later, his wife, the incredibly unpopular Marie-Antoinette, met the same fate.

00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:53.935
Now, it’s worth spending a minute just talking about Marie-Antoinette.

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:58.485
Firstly, probably the most famous quote of the French Revolution

00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:03.635
is attributed to Marie-Antoinette, and that’s “let them eat cake”.

00:16:04.085 --> 00:16:09.495
That’s how it’s normally translated in English, which is actually a bit of a mistranslation.

00:16:09.945 --> 00:16:16.825
She said “let them eat brioche”, which was very much a luxury bread at the time, so it doesn’t

00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:23.055
mean she was any less out of touch, but she wasn’t literally saying cake like a birthday cake.

00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:28.105
And the second thing about this quote is that she probably never said it.

00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:29.105
Sorry.

00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:36.115
The quote actually appeared in the writings of Rousseau when Marie-Antoinette was only 9 years old,

00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:43.095
so even though it might be the most famous quote from the French Revolution, it’s not actually true.

00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:48.775
What does seem to be undeniable though is that Marie-Antoinette was

00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:53.385
hideously out of touch with the fate of the common French person.

00:16:54.295 --> 00:17:00.675
At Versailles, the royal palace, she had her own farm built for her, so she could pretend

00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:07.055
to be a common farmer, but she was presumably sitting down on a nice chair, stroking a lamb

00:17:07.255 --> 00:17:12.875
and eating some brioche rather than getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning to milk the cows.

00:17:14.035 --> 00:17:19.055
In any case, by October 1793 she was being taken to

00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:22.755
the guillotine in a cart, to be publicly executed.

00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:28.575
It certainly wasn’t how she thought she would be received when she, daughter of the

00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:33.905
Emperor and Empress of Austria, one of the richest and most powerful noble families

00:17:34.115 --> 00:17:39.615
in Europe, moved from Austria to marry Prince Louis, at the age of just 14 years old.

00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:45.685
At the same time as this was all taking place, the more moderate revolutionaries

00:17:45.895 --> 00:17:51.475
had lost the ideological battle about the path that the revolution should take, and

00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:57.215
the political climate was ruled by the more radical faction, led by Robespierre.

00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:03.835
France was thrown into a period now referred to as The Reign of Terror,

00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:09.075
where 40,000 people were killed for counter-revolutionary behaviour.

00:18:09.975 --> 00:18:16.425
But soon things got to Robespierre’s head, he became drunk on his own power, and

00:18:16.435 --> 00:18:23.435
he ended up tasting the cold steel of the guillotine himself in July of 1794.

00:18:24.465 --> 00:18:28.875
So, we have whizzed through this, we’ve gone very fast through

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:33.345
this period, so let’s just pause for a minute to take stock.

00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:41.125
Over the period of 5 years, the entire French tax system was turned on its head, France got a

00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:47.485
new constitution, the country declared the universal rights of man, the monarchy was abolished,

00:18:47.535 --> 00:18:53.075
France declared war on Austria, the king and then queen were both executed, the revolutionaries

00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:57.975
have been fighting among themselves, and tens of thousands of people have been killed.

00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:00.985
Quite a busy period in French history, right?

00:19:01.935 --> 00:19:07.445
During all this, a young army officer was distinguishing himself through

00:19:07.445 --> 00:19:12.505
military campaigns, and rising through the ranks of the French army.

00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:15.515
His name was Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:19:16.565 --> 00:19:22.695
He had crushed a royalist uprising, a movement in support of the monarchy, in 1795.

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:31.525
He then won decisive victories in what is now northern Italy in 1796, and after invading Malta

00:19:31.525 --> 00:19:38.775
and Egypt in 1798, he returned to France, overthrew the government that was in place, and declared

00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:44.815
himself to be the First Consul of France, essentially the most powerful person in the country.

00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:52.105
This was in 1799, and with it he declared that the French Revolution was over.

00:19:53.065 --> 00:19:57.185
Now, we have evidently skipped over quite a bit here, but this

00:19:57.245 --> 00:20:01.215
is a not-so-brief summary of the course of the French revolution.

00:20:01.995 --> 00:20:06.255
Let’s move on to the consequences, because the consequences are

00:20:06.255 --> 00:20:11.794
far-reaching and long lasting, both in France and further afield.

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.114
Let’s start with France.

00:20:14.804 --> 00:20:18.814
Of course, you will now know that there is now no monarchy in France.

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:26.474
But Louis XVI wasn’t the last king of France, and the First French Republic only lasted from

00:20:26.474 --> 00:20:35.204
1792 to 1804, when Napoleon got power hungry and declared himself to be the Emperor of France.

00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:41.954
And France had Emperors, or kings in various different forms until 1870,

00:20:42.234 --> 00:20:48.124
almost 100 years after the French had first decided they didn’t want a monarch.

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:54.894
Since 1870 France has been a full republic, without a monarch - although the French

00:20:54.894 --> 00:21:00.784
newspapers do enjoy suggesting that various Prime Ministers have king-like ambitions.

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:08.364
So, from a governmental and constitutional point of view, the French revolution set France

00:21:08.524 --> 00:21:14.494
on the course of moving away from a monarchy and towards what it is now, a republic.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:20.304
In terms of more European consequences, the decision of the continent’s

00:21:20.344 --> 00:21:25.584
most populous country to overthrow its monarchy, decapitate the

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:30.058
king and queen, and proclaim a republic had a profound impact.

00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:37.258
For the royal families of other European countries, many of whom were of course closely

00:21:37.258 --> 00:21:43.608
related to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the French Revolution was pretty scary.

00:21:44.348 --> 00:21:49.398
If the French people had risen up and got rid of the monarchy, what was

00:21:49.398 --> 00:21:53.988
to stop people in their own countries from doing exactly the same thing?

00:21:54.988 --> 00:22:01.918
It was clear now that monarchs weren’t untouchable, that they existed because the people

00:22:02.018 --> 00:22:07.328
of the country allowed them to exist, rather than because of some god-given right.

00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:15.528
Indeed, this idea of a king or queen being a representative of the people, rather than the people

00:22:15.638 --> 00:22:21.138
being his or her subjects, is one of the most important consequences of The French Revolution.

00:22:21.868 --> 00:22:28.768
The very idea of the nation state, of a country formed of its people, existed before The French

00:22:28.768 --> 00:22:37.508
Revolution, but the events of 1789 to 1799 really underlined the fact that a country is composed

00:22:37.668 --> 00:22:43.968
of its citizens, and it’s the citizens that have the power to decide the fate of the country.

00:22:44.928 --> 00:22:49.678
This is even more the case for the French Revolution than the American Revolution,

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:56.058
as the American revolutionaries were rising up against their colonial masters, while

00:22:56.058 --> 00:23:00.975
the French were rising up against the entire political system of their own country.

00:23:02.095 --> 00:23:07.055
In terms of French nationalism, the events of the French Revolution brought the

00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:12.285
country together, and there was a new found sense of unity between French people,

00:23:12.485 --> 00:23:18.505
with everyone united around the Liberté, égalité, fraternité - the freedom,

00:23:18.675 --> 00:23:23.235
equality, and brotherhood that are at the centre of the French Constitution.

00:23:24.085 --> 00:23:29.215
This phrase was first used by Robespierre in 1790, and has

00:23:29.225 --> 00:23:33.015
continued to be the national motto of France to this day.

00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:38.525
And it has had a profound impact on the global concept of the

00:23:38.525 --> 00:23:43.255
rights of the individual, and what we now refer to as Human Rights.

00:23:43.745 --> 00:23:48.445
To stress, before the Declaration of The Rights of Man and of The

00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:53.205
Citizen, this really wasn’t an obvious concept, at least in Europe.

00:23:53.695 --> 00:23:57.845
Society was deeply divided between rich and poor, the

00:23:58.005 --> 00:24:01.475
aristocracy, nobles and the church and everyone else.

00:24:02.155 --> 00:24:07.205
The French Revolution proposed that there were universal rights, universal

00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:12.355
privileges that should be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of who they were.

00:24:13.575 --> 00:24:17.647
And while the majority of French people today are very proud of

00:24:17.895 --> 00:24:22.025
the events and consequences of the French Revolution, not all are.

00:24:23.285 --> 00:24:27.325
I remember this being clear to me when I was about 14 years old.

00:24:27.455 --> 00:24:30.735
My brother and I were doing French exchanges.

00:24:31.225 --> 00:24:35.135
I had been sent to stay for a week with a boy called

00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:39.365
Sylvain, who had relatively left-wing, liberal parents.

00:24:39.935 --> 00:24:44.975
My brother had been sent to stay with a boy called Charles, whose family had a

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:50.305
large house in the countryside with old paintings of aristocratic family members.

00:24:51.415 --> 00:24:57.905
The week we stayed with them was over the 14th July, and we experienced two differing

00:24:57.905 --> 00:25:03.155
ways to celebrate Bastille Day, the anniversary of the start of the revolution.

00:25:04.215 --> 00:25:08.245
With the family I was staying with there were great festivities,

00:25:08.255 --> 00:25:12.125
fireworks, we went out and it was a time of great joy.

00:25:12.735 --> 00:25:17.875
But when we went to find my brother, he had had a different experience.

00:25:18.935 --> 00:25:25.595
While most of France was celebrating, the old aristocratic family he had been with had basically

00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:31.515
closed their doors and not even acknowledged the fact that it was a day of any importance.

00:25:32.355 --> 00:25:36.065
Presumably this family had ancestors who had lost their

00:25:36.075 --> 00:25:40.015
heads in the revolution, so it was no time for celebration.

00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:44.645
And even outside France, politicians and leaders are

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:48.095
often cautious when asked about The French Revolution.

00:25:49.085 --> 00:25:54.245
Margaret Thatcher, the ex Prime Minister of Britain, said “It resulted in

00:25:54.245 --> 00:25:59.345
a lot of headless corpses, (headless bodies), and a tyrant (a dictator)”.

00:25:59.997 --> 00:26:01.947
She is of course talking about Napoleon.

00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:07.617
In the interests of balance and fairness, perhaps we should end with

00:26:07.617 --> 00:26:12.237
a quote from the Charles Dickens’ novel A Tale of Two Cities, which

00:26:12.277 --> 00:26:17.047
centres on Paris and London during the period of the French Revolution.

00:26:17.997 --> 00:26:22.987
Dickens wrote, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

00:26:23.527 --> 00:26:29.507
It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:36.077
belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the

00:26:36.077 --> 00:26:42.317
season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

00:26:44.617 --> 00:26:50.567
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The French Revolution, and

00:26:50.697 --> 00:26:55.037
with that comes the end of this mini-series on The Age of Revolution.

00:26:55.687 --> 00:27:00.137
The historians among you will note that The French Revolution definitely wasn’t the

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:05.997
end of the Age of Revolution, as it and the American Revolution actually inspired

00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:11.547
revolutions throughout Europe and further afield during the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:27:11.927 --> 00:27:15.067
But we have to end somewhere, and what better place

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:17.977
to end with the most famous revolution in Europe.

00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:22.387

think the lasting impact of The French Revolution has been?

00:27:29.757 --> 00:27:32.577
How would France have been different without it?

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.160
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:29.048
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part four of our four-part series on criminals and gangsters.

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:34.318
As a reminder, in part one we talked about The Real Peaky Blinders and

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:39.118
the criminals of late 19th century and early 20th century Birmingham.

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:44.168
Then in part two we moved over to the United States and heard

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:49.171
about the most famous mob boss in American history,  Al Capone.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:55.861
In part three we went on the run with John Dillinger, the Depression-era bank robber.

00:00:56.261 --> 00:01:01.371
And in today’s episode, part four, we are going to be talking about the

00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:07.521
Kray twins, the twin brothers who terrorised London’s East End in the 1960s.

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.011
It’s a story that involves The Tower of London,

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.869
boxing, celebrities, politicians, scandal and murder.

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:22.019
This has been one of my favourite episodes of this mini-series to make, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.379
OK then, let’s get started with the amazing story of The Kray Twins.

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:38.046
Reginald, or Reggie, Kray was born on 24th October, of 1933,  10

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:42.486
minutes before his identical twin brother, Ronald, or Ronnie.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:49.376
They were born in an area of London called Haggerston, in the East End of the city.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:54.446
If you go to Haggerston now, you’ll find a trendy

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:58.516
area of London popular with bankers and media types.

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:04.746
You’ll find hipster bars, fancy restaurants, and high-rise newly built apartment blocks.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:10.196
But Haggerston, and the entire East End of London was a very

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.836
different place when Reggie and Ronnie Kray were growing up.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:19.066
The East End of the city had traditionally been the industrial part,

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:24.596
full of factories, meat processing plants, tanneries - so those

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:28.483
are places where leather is made - it was where the docks were.

00:02:29.063 --> 00:02:35.073
And it was very poor, and crime was rife, there was a lot of criminal activity.

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:41.573
It was there that Jack The Ripper had gone on a killing spree less than fifty years

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:46.353
before the Krays were born, it was the location of Charles Dickens' novel, Oliver

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:52.727
Twist, and when the Krays were young boys, it was the area of London that would be hit

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:58.727
hardest by the German bombs during the Blitz, the bombing of London during World War II.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:05.487
The Krays were evacuated from London during the war, they were sent away to the countryside

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:12.017
for their safety, and when they returned they found a city trying to get back on its feet.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:17.584
They were encouraged to take up boxing by their grandfather, and

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:21.414
they both showed early promise, they were pretty good boxers.

00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:26.624
The identical twins were becoming big, muscly men.

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:29.584
Not the kind of people you would want to mess with.

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:38.492
In 1952 the twins were called up to take part in National Service, the requirement to

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:45.522
serve in the armed forces for 18 months, but their military career wasn’t to last for long.

00:03:46.832 --> 00:03:53.092
They turned up to the Tower of London, where they were meant to report to join the National Service.

00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:58.982
They told the officer in charge that they weren’t going to take part, and after

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:04.092
he tried to stop them Ronnie Kray punched him in the face and walked back home.

00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:09.202
Now, The Tower of London wasn’t far from where the Krays

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:12.842
lived, so they simply walked back to their mother’s house.

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:21.232
Unfortunately National Service wasn’t something you could just say no to, especially by punching a

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:27.142
soldier in the face, and the following morning they were arrested and forced to return to the Tower.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:33.862
The Krays weren’t so keen on pretending to be soldiers, and later on that year they

00:04:33.882 --> 00:04:39.482
again ran away, then when they were confronted by a police officer they attacked him.

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:45.566
So, after they were caught again they were thrown into military prison, where

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:51.026
they caused all sorts of problems for their guards - beating up fellow prisoners,

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:56.206
pouring dirty toilet water over the guards, and generally causing mischief.

00:04:57.166 --> 00:05:03.026
After being released from prison in 1954, aged 21, let’s

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:07.596
just say that their mischief turned to full-on crime.

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:13.965
They returned to the area they had grown up in, they proceeded to engage in all

00:05:13.965 --> 00:05:19.325
sorts of criminal activities, mainly extorting local businesses for protection.

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:24.905
They formed a gang and ran what’s called a protection racket,

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:29.105
forcing local businesses to pay them for “protection”.

00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:34.741
If a business didn’t pay the Krays, well it might find its owner

00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.521
beaten up, or worse, it might find itself burned to the ground.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:45.167
Soon enough, the Kray twins had earned a deserved

00:05:45.187 --> 00:05:50.257
reputation for extreme violence, especially Ronnie Kray.

00:05:51.637 --> 00:05:56.117
Reggie was considered to be the more calm and composed brother,

00:05:56.307 --> 00:06:00.137
the one who was able to think on a more long-term basis.

00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:07.247
Ronnie, on the other hand, became known for being incredibly violent and unpredictable.

00:06:07.657 --> 00:06:12.467
It would later emerge that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, but

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:16.637
the result of this would be that people never knew what he was going to do.

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:22.847
Ronnie would go back to prison in the late 1950s after attacking

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:28.197
someone with a bayonet, the knife that is attached to a rifle, a gun,

00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:33.227
and he was actually labelled clinically insane by the prison doctors.

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:38.687
Reggie, on the other hand, was busy in the East End cultivating

00:06:38.687 --> 00:06:43.277
the brothers’ reputation and expanding their business interests.

00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:49.123
They were hard nosed criminals, yes, but Reggie had ambitions

00:06:49.123 --> 00:06:53.493
to expand their small empire into legitimate businesses.

00:06:54.695 --> 00:07:02.115
In the early 1960s, after Ronnie had been released from prison, the Krays started to use the money

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:09.225
they had made from their protection rackets to buy up clubs in the fashionable West End of the city.

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:15.955
Let’s remember also that London of the 1960s was one of the places to be.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:21.463
The city was being transformed from a grim, dark and

00:07:21.493 --> 00:07:26.003
undesirable city to a stylish, fashionable world capital.

00:07:26.962 --> 00:07:30.572
The Beatles were there, The Rolling Stones were there, The Who,

00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:35.242
Frank Sinatra, Dusty Springfield, anyone who was anyone was there.

00:07:35.432 --> 00:07:37.762
London was the place to be.

00:07:38.232 --> 00:07:40.932
And The Krays wanted a piece of it.

00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:49.435
Reggie, who was the more calculating and business-savvy of the twins, recognised that owning

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:57.005
a club in a fashionable area of the city would be a way to legitimise the twins, and it would

00:07:57.045 --> 00:08:03.685
also be a good way of investing and then laundering the money they made from protection rackets.

00:08:04.645 --> 00:08:11.045
One of the Krays’ first clubs was a place called Esmeralda's Barn, which was located

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:17.002
just south of Hyde Park,  behind Buckingham Palace, the residence of the royal family.

00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:23.732
It’s now been demolished and replaced with a $1,000 a night five star hotel called

00:08:23.732 --> 00:08:30.162
The Berkeley, but I mention this to underline quite how fancy an area it was in.

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:35.136
Let’s just say that there are question marks over how exactly the

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:39.716
Kray Twins managed to get their hands on the club, and it has been

00:08:39.716 --> 00:08:44.196
suggested that the pair forced the original owner to sell it to them.

00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:49.723
In any case, Reggie and Ronnie Kray became the owners of this

00:08:49.743 --> 00:08:54.273
exclusive club in one of the city’s most desirable locations.

00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:59.561
And the stars flocked to it, it was filled with celebrities.

00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:05.378
Film stars, musicians, politicians, authors, playwrights, fashion designers.

00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:09.898
Anyone who was anyone would want to be seen at Esmeralda's Barn.

00:09:11.203 --> 00:09:13.583
For a while, the going was good.

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:18.563
The clubs were full, the Krays were mingling with the stars, everyone was happy.

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:24.611
To quote Ronnie Kray directly, “ They were the best years of our lives.

00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:26.811
They called them the swinging sixties.

00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:29.931
The Beatles and the Rolling Stones were rulers of

00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:33.041
pop music, Carnaby Street ruled the fashion world...

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.731
and me and my brother ruled London.

00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:37.711
We were fucking untouchable…”

00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:45.121
The Krays were now, at least to much of the outside world, respectable businessmen.

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:49.891
They were nightclub owners, and they soon opened up several other

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:56.185
nightclubs, again in Soho and the West End of the city,  crucially far

00:09:56.235 --> 00:10:01.355
away from the East End, which was the centre of their criminal enterprise.

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:09.031
Meanwhile, back in the East End, the Krays’ power and influence continued to grow.

00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:15.272
By this time they had formed a sizable gang, which was called The Firm.

00:10:16.352 --> 00:10:22.012
Members of the gang did most of the dirty work, collecting money and threatening

00:10:22.012 --> 00:10:26.522
business owners who either didn’t want to pay or were late on their payments.

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:32.909
Everyone knew that it was Ronnie and Reggie who were really in control, and they

00:10:32.929 --> 00:10:37.989
were treated with a mixture of respect and fear by the people of East London.

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:42.456
The Krays weren’t the only criminal gang in the city, of course.

00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:44.309
There were plenty of others.

00:10:44.659 --> 00:10:49.279
But businesses were happy to be associated with The Krays because

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:53.029
they believed this would mean protection from the other gangs.

00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:59.912
Pubs would give the Kray twins free drinks, because they wanted to be known as places

00:10:59.922 --> 00:11:04.982
that the Krays would go, and would therefore not be touched by other criminals.

00:11:06.092 --> 00:11:11.652
Although many of the patrons of the Krays’ fancy establishments in the West End of the city

00:11:11.862 --> 00:11:18.222
weren’t aware of the true nature of the brothers' criminal activities, the police certainly were.

00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:23.512
They knew exactly who the Krays were and what they were doing, they just

00:11:23.522 --> 00:11:28.132
had no way of proving it, because nobody would testify against them.

00:11:28.982 --> 00:11:35.602
The Krays were so feared, everyone was so afraid of them, that nobody would talk to the police.

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:41.740
Whoever the police talked to, they came up against a wall of silence.

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:47.335
Alongside the police, a newspaper called The Daily Mirror had been

00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:52.295
looking into the life of the Krays, but for a very different reason.

00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:55.625
Ronnie Kray was openly gay.

00:11:56.195 --> 00:12:02.805
It’s thought that Reggie Kray was either also gay or bisexual, but he was a lot more private.

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:09.125
At this time in the United Kingdom, homosexuality was a crime; it was only

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:16.053
decriminalised in 1967, and even then only for men over the age of 21.

00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:24.765
An investigative reporter called Norman Lucas had managed to work his way into the Krays’ inner

00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:30.975
circle, he had managed to become friends with the brothers, and was planning a story on them.

00:12:32.108 --> 00:12:37.438
During the course of his research he discovered that Ronnie Kray had been in a

00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:44.038
sexual relationship with an elderly male Conservative politician called Lord Boothy.

00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:54.568
A story revealing all was published in July of 1964 with the headline “Peer And A Gangster”.

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:58.538
A peer is a member of the aristocracy in Britain.

00:12:59.669 --> 00:13:05.499
The story didn’t name Lord Boothy directly, but it was pretty clear that it was him.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:10.739
So clear, in fact, that Lord Boothy wrote into the paper saying

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:16.145
“everyone thinks it’s me, and I’m going to sue you for libel”,  libel

00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:20.805
being the crime of writing something that harms someone’s reputation.

00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:25.655
Boothy actually won the case, winning today’s equivalent

00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:29.385
of almost a million pounds, so over a million Euros.

00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:36.235
But as soon as Boothy got the money, the Kray twins turned up and asked Boothy politely

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:41.370
to hand over the money, otherwise they would say the rumours were actually true.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.570
A year later, Reggie got married to his childhood sweetheart,

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.230
Frances Shea, but the marriage was not a happy one.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:57.550
It was so unhappy, in fact, that his new wife killed herself with a drug overdose just two years

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:04.050
into it, throwing Reggie into a deep depression and causing him to turn to drugs and alcohol.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.600
Ronnie, on the other hand, was suffering from increasing schizophrenia.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.170
He had been outed, he had been publicly named, as gay,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.660
and he felt that people were making fun of him for it.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:24.630
One such person was George Cornell, a member of a rival South London gang.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.550
He had called Ronnie Kray a “fat poof” - a poof is a

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.960
derogatory term, a nasty expression, for a gay person.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.370
Now, if there is one person you don’t want to insult, it is a paranoid

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.505
schizophrenic with a history of unpredictable behaviour and extreme violence.

00:14:46.535 --> 00:14:52.355
Sure enough, on March 9, 1966, when Ronnie found out that George

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:58.444
Cornell was drinking at a pub called The Blind Beggar–a pub that

00:14:58.444 --> 00:15:04.239
you can still go to today, by the way–he went straight over there.

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:04.765
It was ten past eight in the evening, and there were

00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:08.725
32 other people, members of the public, in the pub.

00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:13.595
Ronnie Kray went straight up to George Cornell, pulled

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:17.455
out a gun and shot him in the head, killing him instantly.

00:15:18.775 --> 00:15:23.445
When the police turned up, nobody, not one of the 32 people

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:26.555
who were there at the time, said they had seen anything.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:30.585
Such was the fear that people had for the Krays.

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:35.585
Ronnie and his brother owned that area of London.

00:15:35.895 --> 00:15:41.062
He could do whatever he wanted, and nobody would dare go to the police and say a word.

00:15:41.787 --> 00:15:43.245
Or so he thought.

00:15:44.385 --> 00:15:48.735
The following year it was to be the other Kray twin, Reggie,

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:52.225
who would put the loyalty of his gang members to the test.

00:15:53.585 --> 00:16:00.785
In October of 1967, just a few months after his wife’s suicide, Reggie had paid another

00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:06.885
member of his gang, a man called Jack “The Hat” McVitie, to kill his financial advisor.

00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:12.625
Reggie had paid him £500 up front, and was going to

00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:16.785
pay him another £500 once the killing had taken place.

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:19.965
But McVitie didn’t do it.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:28.025
In the grand scheme of things, it wasn’t a huge mistake, McVitie had just backed out of a killing

00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:34.135
that he had been paid to do, it wasn’t the worst possible thing a gang member could have done.

00:16:35.315 --> 00:16:43.585
But Reggie Kray, who was no doubt still shaken by his wife’s suicide, and by now heavily

00:16:43.605 --> 00:16:49.985
addicted to drink and drugs, took exception to McVitie’s behaviour, he was not happy at all.

00:16:51.165 --> 00:16:54.525
He invited McVitie to a party at a house.

00:16:55.135 --> 00:16:58.695
When McVitie arrived, he found Ronnie and Reggie

00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:02.065
there, as well as several other members of the gang.

00:17:03.395 --> 00:17:08.995
Reggie then proceeded to very publicly and brutally kill McVitie with a knife.

00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:12.855
This was a step too far.

00:17:13.135 --> 00:17:16.695
McVitie was a member of their gang, he was one of them,

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:21.565
and all he had done was not fulfil a contract properly.

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:28.775
When word got out to other members of the Krays’ gang, opinion started to turn against them.

00:17:29.525 --> 00:17:34.665
The Krays were ruthless, and if they had killed McVitie - a member of

00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:39.635
their own gang and theoretically their ally - then nobody was safe.

00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:44.705
What’s more, for the previous three or four years, the

00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:48.095
police had been busy gathering evidence against the Krays.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:53.035
Nobody would say anything, but after the police sensed that some of the

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:57.905
gangsters were turning against the twins, they sensed their opportunity.

00:17:58.838 --> 00:18:04.235
On May the 8th of 1968, 8 months after the murder of Jack "the Hat"

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:09.375
McVitie, the police arrested the Kray twins and 15 of their associates.

00:18:10.575 --> 00:18:14.985
They proceeded to turn all of them against each other, and successfully

00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:20.495
managed to get several key associates to testify against the brothers.

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:26.815
Eventually, in March of 1969, almost a year after the arrest,

00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:31.115
the twins were tried and sentenced to life imprisonment.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.120
And sure enough, they spent almost all of the rest of their lives behind bars.

00:18:38.563 --> 00:18:42.525
Ronnie’s mental health continued to deteriorate, it continued to

00:18:42.525 --> 00:18:47.555
get worse, and he died in 1995 after suffering a heart attack.

00:18:48.425 --> 00:18:53.035
Reggie was allowed out of prison for a day to attend his funeral

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:57.725
and pay his final respects, but he too died five years later.

00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:02.515
He was allowed out of prison in August of 2000,

00:19:02.515 --> 00:19:05.745
because he was suffering from terminal bladder cancer.

00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:10.725
But his freedom wasn’t to last for long - he lived for just eight and a

00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:15.095
half weeks before going to meet his maker, and rejoining his twin brother.

00:19:16.085 --> 00:19:22.125
They are now buried together, in a cemetery in North East London, a cemetery you can visit today.

00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:30.155
Their gravestone reads “Grant them eternal rest, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine on them”.

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:35.735
Well, these were two men who certainly didn’t rest much while they were alive,

00:19:35.785 --> 00:19:40.625
and it was only when the light of the law shone too brightly on them and

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:44.735
they were thrown into prison that they had time to contemplate their actions.

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:51.725
Neither of the twins, at least publicly, showed any remorse for their crimes, saying they

00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:56.475
would have done exactly the same if they could and that was just the world they lived in.

00:19:57.265 --> 00:20:02.325
Whether or not that’s something the twins truly believed, one can only hazard a guess, but

00:20:02.525 --> 00:20:07.125
perhaps that is what you have to tell yourself when you are one half of the most violent

00:20:07.285 --> 00:20:12.215
and dangerous pair of twins the country, and perhaps even the world, has ever known.

00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:20.205
OK then, that is it for The Kray Twins, the two brothers who ruled the East

00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:25.685
End of London with an iron first, mingled with the stars, befriended and in

00:20:25.685 --> 00:20:30.665
Ronnie’s case, slept with politicians, but were ultimately cold-blooded killers.

00:20:31.255 --> 00:20:36.275
And with that comes the end of this four-part series on criminals and gangsters.

00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:42.885
As a reminder, in part one we heard the story of the Real Peaky Blinders, and learned

00:20:42.895 --> 00:20:47.895
about the criminal underworld of Birmingham in the late 19th and early 20th century.

00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:52.165
Then in part two it was Al Capone, the Chicago

00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:55.525
gangster and most famous mob-boss in American history.

00:20:56.065 --> 00:21:01.145
In part three it was John Dilllinger, the iconic bank robber, and in

00:21:01.145 --> 00:21:05.135
part four, well that was the story of The Kray Twins that we just heard.

00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:08.855
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:11.935
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:17.095
Which of these four sets of criminals do you think had the most interesting life?

00:21:17.425 --> 00:21:22.155
What do you think it is about criminals, people who are often violent and

00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:26.255
really not very nice people at all, that manages to capture our attention?

00:21:26.975 --> 00:21:32.055
I would love to know, and to chat to you about it, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:37.005

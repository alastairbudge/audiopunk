Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.450
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.500
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.530
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.000
talking about The Future of the British Royal Family.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.010
On February 6th of this year, just a couple of days after this episode is set

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.160
to be released, Queen Elizabeth II will celebrate her 70th year on the throne

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.820
of the United Kingdom, and in April she will celebrate her 96th birthday.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.240
She has had quite the formidable life, and reign, but even the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.040
most formidable of reigns must, at some stage, come to an end.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.390
So in this episode we are going to ask ourselves what comes next.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.110
Who will be king of the United Kingdom, and how will they be different from Queen

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.081
Elizabeth, and why, and what does the future hold for the British Royal Family?

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.460
OK then, The Future of the British Royal Family.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.450
The British Royal Family is often thought of as a business, and indeed Prince Phillip, the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:36.100
Queen’s late husband, used to refer to it as “The Firm”, the firm is another word for a business.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.720
So, let me paint you a picture for a minute.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.300
Imagine that you have a family business which is both old – at least 1000 years old – and valuable.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.050
Above all, its brand is unique.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.120
People from all over the world know about it.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.410
Imagine that you are the chairman and chief executive, you’re the boss.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
You have run this business practically all of your adult life, and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.540
you are now approaching the end of your tenure, it’s time to retire.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.790
Like any responsible family business owner, you want to ensure

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.240
that you hand the business on in good order to your successor.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.160
So far, so good.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.170
But, in the case of the British Royal Family there are some major complications and unusual factors.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.270
Firstly, unlike with most family businesses, the leadership is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.010
hereditary; in other words it is handed down from parent to child.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.900
It goes to the first-born, no matter who that person is.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.950
Secondly, and here is another extremely unusual feature of the family business that we are

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.880
discussing, you don’t ever actually retire, the job only stops when you take your last breath.

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:08.800
As a result, the boss of the family business we’re talking about is

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.360
95 years old and her successor, the person who will take over from

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.070
her, is well into his 70s - most people his age have already retired.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.000
Thirdly, there are almost 70 million owners, shareholders,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.906
of this family business, every person in the United Kingdom.

00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:36.096
Sure, British people don’t “own” the royal family, but the royal family

00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:41.726
relies on the support and approval of the British people to continue existing.

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:49.396
And finally, the “service” that this business provides is unusual, and hard to measure.

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:55.076
It provides stability, continuity, and it is also estimated

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:59.186
to bring in around 20 billion Euros to the country’s economy.

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:04.546
But there are plenty of people, plenty of its owners, in fact, plenty of

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:10.626
shareholders, who argue that it is a business that simply shouldn’t exist.

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:13.946
It is a strange situation indeed.

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:18.906
Now let’s just get a couple of things straight before dive right

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:22.106
into the question of the future of the British Royal family.

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:27.816
On a purely practical basis, what will happen when the Queen dies?

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.206
Who will the crown be passed to?

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:38.496
To remind you, the queen has four children, Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward.

00:04:39.116 --> 00:04:43.036
Charles is the eldest, so he is first in line to the throne.

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:49.386
He also has two children, William and Harry, and they both have children of their own.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:55.236
I’m addressing this because lots of people think that there is an option

00:04:55.236 --> 00:05:00.326
for the crown to pass directly to William, skipping Charles out completely,

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:06.488
but that simply won’t happen, or if it does it won’t happen immediately.

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:13.168
When the Queen takes her last breath, assuming her son Charles is still alive, the

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:18.748
throne will immediately pass to Charles, and he will become king, King Charles III.

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:24.528
We’ll discuss shortly what some of the implications of this might be,

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:29.848
but on a practical level this is what is extremely likely to happen.

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:37.818
The other thing to remind you of is what the King or Queen of the United Kingdom actually does.

00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:43.738
The UK is a constitutional monarchy, which means that a monarch

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:47.848
shares power with a constitutionally elected government.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:54.098
But on a practical level, the monarch simply says yes to whatever the

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:58.548
government says, and there is the expectation that the monarch has

00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:03.338
absolutely zero involvement in the day-to-day running of the country.

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:09.998
The British people elect a government, and it governs the country, not the king or queen.

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:15.098
And the monarchy in the UK is still very popular.

00:06:15.498 --> 00:06:19.878
Or should I say, the Queen of England is still very popular, because

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:24.858
for many people the monarchy is inseparable from the current Queen.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:29.928
She has been on the throne for almost 70 years, so the vast

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:34.268
majority of the country will only ever have known her as Queen.

00:06:35.618 --> 00:06:40.308
In terms of quite how popular she is, recent surveys have shown that

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:47.408
around 76% of the British population like her, 13% of people have a

00:06:47.618 --> 00:06:53.658
neutral opinion of her, and only 7% of the population dislike her.

00:06:54.678 --> 00:07:01.098
And most people think she has done a good job as queen - 23% of people think she has done

00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:08.348
a fairly good job, quite a good job, and 59% of people think she has done a very good job.

00:07:09.348 --> 00:07:13.258
These are ratings that most politicians would die for,

00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:17.008
they would love to be viewed as positively as the queen.

00:07:17.928 --> 00:07:22.568
And although she has certainly had her fair share of difficulties, and

00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:27.798
points when she was not as popular as she is now, she will certainly go down

00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:32.888
in history as one of the most popular monarchs the country has ever had.

00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:37.968
This poses a problem for who comes next, Charles.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:44.828
He has had a lifetime in the public eye, over 70 years, yet his approval

00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:52.338
ratings are significantly worse than his mother’s, at 45% vs his mother’s 76%.

00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:57.758
Put simply, the British people just don’t like him nearly as much as

00:07:57.758 --> 00:08:03.698
his mother, or even his son, William, who has an approval rating of 66%.

00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:10.228
Few people are saying that Charles is an inherently bad man,

00:08:10.368 --> 00:08:14.888
but that he is on the dull and unimaginative side, it seems.

00:08:15.448 --> 00:08:22.428
He isn’t inspiring, and he seems old and out of touch even to people of his generation.

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:29.528
He has also been shown to have tried to interfere with British politics by writing letters

00:08:29.528 --> 00:08:35.538
to politicians urging them to put in place particular policies that he believes in.

00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:41.128
Now, Prince Charles does have many beliefs that now seem

00:08:41.138 --> 00:08:44.758
rather forward-thinking, that now seem rather modern.

00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:49.628
He has always been an advocate for the environment, for planting

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:53.608
of trees, and a general supporter of environmental issues.

00:08:54.208 --> 00:09:01.108
But the point isn’t that he was urging MPs to take action on the wrong issues, it’s

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:07.528
that he was interfering in politics at all - this is considered to be taboo for a

00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:13.138
British monarch, and his mother is viewed to have kept her nose firmly out of politics.

00:09:14.318 --> 00:09:19.998
Now, Charles has evidently had his entire life to consider what he would do

00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:25.748
as king, so let’s move on to look into our crystal ball and think about some

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:30.638
of the actions that he will likely take when the crown is placed on his head.

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:38.778
Firstly, he will probably slim down the official Royal Family, the number of people who are

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:44.548
actually on the payroll, and official members of the royal family will reduce in number.

00:09:45.478 --> 00:09:47.638
He will do this for two reasons.

00:09:48.258 --> 00:09:54.078
Firstly, because there is already debate about the purpose of minor royal family

00:09:54.078 --> 00:09:59.608
members, and their cost to the British taxpayer through things like police protection.

00:10:00.748 --> 00:10:05.888
There is a long list of people who could theoretically become king or queen,

00:10:06.098 --> 00:10:10.648
and given that we don’t live in the Middle Ages now and they aren’t going to be

00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:16.958
killed in battle or die from disease, there simply isn’t the need to have so many

00:10:17.028 --> 00:10:22.118
official members of the royal family, we don’t need to have all these “back-ups”.

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:28.348
Secondly, because it is clear that the more official members of a family you

00:10:28.348 --> 00:10:33.688
have, the more chance there is of one doing something wrong and reflecting

00:10:33.718 --> 00:10:38.848
badly on the royal family as a brand, on the royal family as a whole.

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:45.628
We are seeing this at the moment with the Queen’s disgraced son, Charles’ brother,

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:50.708
Prince Andrew, and his relationship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

00:10:51.648 --> 00:10:58.158
Indeed shortly before I started writing this episode Andrew was officially stripped of his

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:05.491
royal duties, and time will tell whether he actually ever faces trial and even goes to prison.

00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:12.947
And although this incident with Andrew is certainly the worst, he, and his ex-wife Sarah

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:19.117
Ferguson, have caused significant upset and controversy to the royal family over the years.

00:11:19.687 --> 00:11:25.337
His wife was photographed sucking a man’s toe, then several years later

00:11:25.627 --> 00:11:30.117
offering to sell access to the royal family to an undercover journalist.

00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:37.417
You might be thinking…why hasn’t this happened before, why didn’t they already reduce the

00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:42.957
size of the official royal family, if there were members that had caused such embarassment?

00:11:43.617 --> 00:11:48.747
Well, there was certainly scandal in the Royal Family before, perhaps scandal

00:11:48.797 --> 00:11:54.537
even worse than that of Prince Andrew, but it was simply a lot easier 100 or

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:59.857
200 years ago to keep these scandals quiet, so they weren’t public knowledge.

00:12:00.497 --> 00:12:03.917
Out of sight, out of mind, so the saying goes.

00:12:05.247 --> 00:12:11.003
So, Charles might understandably think, let’s reduce the number of royals,

00:12:11.047 --> 00:12:17.027
let’s keep the core, most important, reliable ones, and keep only those we

00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:22.147
really need and can trust to behave well and the country can be proud of.

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:27.907
This would not be in any way an original or surprising thing to do.

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:32.347
You only have to look across the North Sea to see what happened

00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:35.367
to Northern European monarchies after the Second World War.

00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:42.767
They underwent self-imposed slimming down processes, and this has certainly helped their survival.

00:12:44.087 --> 00:12:50.087
Moving on to our second prediction, or at least possibility, this relates to how

00:12:50.107 --> 00:12:55.327
Charles will deal with his son, the next in line to the throne, Prince William.

00:12:56.547 --> 00:13:03.067
When Prince Charles becomes King Charles he will be at the very youngest, 73 years old.

00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:11.077
Although he has been waiting for this chance for his entire life, most 73 year olds don’t want to

00:13:11.087 --> 00:13:17.757
start a completely new job that requires them to travel up and down the country, shake thousands of

00:13:17.757 --> 00:13:23.787
people’s hands every week, travel around the world and sleep in a different bed every other night.

00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:30.147
There is one possibility that he might rule semi-jointly with William,

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:35.417
so that Charles is still king and does the main official duties of the

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:39.967
king, such as meeting with the Prime Minister and meeting foreign leaders.

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:45.917
But William would do the foreign tours, the opening of public buildings,

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:51.347
and be the public face of the monarchy, all while remaining a prince.

00:13:52.187 --> 00:13:55.987
He is, after all, popular with the British people, and

00:13:56.027 --> 00:14:00.617
he’s only 39 - certainly not too old to be put to work.

00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:08.617
And the British public do tend to see William, not Charles, as the future of the British monarchy.

00:14:09.687 --> 00:14:16.347
Although the British public is split over who should actually take over as king, there are

00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:23.317
the same amount of people who say Charles as who say William, 65% of people think that William

00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:30.317
would have the most influence over the future of the royal family vs only 10% saying Charles.

00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:36.627
So, this is certainly a possibility that would seem to allow Charles to get what he

00:14:36.637 --> 00:14:43.017
wants - to rule as king - and to allow the British monarchy to look like it is modernising

00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:49.617
through having increased access to the media-savvy Prince William, and his young family.

00:14:50.847 --> 00:14:56.247
Now, this brings us nicely on to our next point, our next prediction,

00:14:56.527 --> 00:15:00.527
which is about the Royal Family becoming more open to the public,

00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:06.517
increasing access to it, and making it seem like more of a normal family.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:13.147
The Queen, to her credit, actually set the wheels in motion for this as early

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:19.197
as the 1960s, when she decided to allow documentary makers into Buckingham

00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:25.147
Palace for the first time to film the private lives of the queen and her family.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:34.007
This documentary, released in 1969 and simply called “Royal Family”, was a roaring success.

00:15:34.187 --> 00:15:38.797
It attracted 30 million viewers in the UK and has

00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:43.757
now been seen by over 350 million people worldwide.

00:15:44.727 --> 00:15:51.047
Of course, there are many more ways for people in 2022 to have a glimpse into the

00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:56.827
private lives of others, and Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton, have proved

00:15:56.877 --> 00:16:02.807
to be very skillful with portraying themselves as normal parents, like any other.

00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:09.183
And just like with the 1969 documentary, people love it.

00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:17.363
It is this slight contradiction that the royal family only exists because it is a special family,

00:16:17.693 --> 00:16:25.253
existing in that position for no reason other than birth, yet the public love to see how, behind

00:16:25.263 --> 00:16:32.733
all of the royal palaces and expensive clothes, the members of the royal family are just like them.

00:16:33.203 --> 00:16:38.873
They watch TV, they play with their kids, they are, after all, human beings.

00:16:39.683 --> 00:16:44.543
So, what will this “opening up” mean in practical terms?

00:16:45.623 --> 00:16:50.773
Prince Charles might well decide to make Buckingham Palace open to the public.

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:54.533
There is no need for him to spend time there.

00:16:54.913 --> 00:17:00.103
Charles has been an advocate for sustainable living, and he already has five

00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:06.783
royal residences, so there is no need to live in a palace with 775 rooms.

00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:13.563
And if it were open to the public, it would certainly bring in even more tourists, and

00:17:13.563 --> 00:17:19.653
reduce the burden on the taxpayer, so it would be an easy win for the Royal Family.

00:17:21.313 --> 00:17:26.353
Let’s move on to the relationship between monarch and parliament, and ask

00:17:26.353 --> 00:17:31.443
ourselves the question of whether the UK will ever get rid of its monarchy.

00:17:32.943 --> 00:17:37.593
Charles, as we heard earlier, has made no secret of his political

00:17:37.593 --> 00:17:42.483
beliefs, and has actively tried to influence government policy.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:48.663
For the sake of the longevity of the British monarchy, he will need to stop this.

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:54.473
He will rule only because he is allowed to rule, and the minute that the

00:17:54.513 --> 00:17:59.733
British public feels that he is overstepping the mark, that he is doing more

00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:04.413
than he should be, there will be questions about the role a monarch plays.

00:18:05.513 --> 00:18:11.933
It just so happens that, at least about things like environmental protection, he has proved to

00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:17.383
have been right, or at least his views are now the views of the majority of the British people.

00:18:17.753 --> 00:18:23.973
But it will be different when he is king and has, in theory at least, real power.

00:18:25.473 --> 00:18:32.303
Ultimately, the continued success, or at least the continued existence, of the British monarchy is

00:18:32.313 --> 00:18:38.983
likely to come down to one thing and one thing only: the actual people in the British Royal Family.

00:18:39.853 --> 00:18:44.223
In the past couple of centuries dozens of countries around the world have

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:49.213
got rid of their monarchies, some peacefully, some not so peacefully.

00:18:50.143 --> 00:18:54.963
And in the United Kingdom, the main reason debate about whether or not the country should

00:18:55.003 --> 00:19:00.833
actually have a monarch has been so quiet comes down to Queen Elizabeth, the current queen.

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:05.293
She has been consistent, silent, and present.

00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:10.153
When she took the throne she was 25 years old.

00:19:10.703 --> 00:19:17.773
The country was emerging from the aftermath of a world war, the British Empire was disbanding, the

00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:24.383
world was changing rapidly, and the world has continued to do so for the entirety of her reign.

00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:27.525
It was far from an easy situation.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:34.735
Her role was to be constant, to be a beacon of stability in a sea of change.

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:37.745
And she performed this role very well.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:43.955
Now, there are question marks about whether this is the sort of role that the

00:19:43.955 --> 00:19:48.795
future monarch should play, to be in the background while the world changes.

00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:54.165
Evidently, the fact that Charles will become king when he is already in his

00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:59.695
70s, and might rule for 20 years if he is lucky, complicates the situation.

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:07.985
But looking even further ahead, past Charles, past William, and to whoever might come in the future,

00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:15.135
the collapse of the British monarchy, whether it is in 10 years, 100 years or 500 years, seems

00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:21.275
most likely to come when the British public decides that it doesn’t like whoever is on the throne.

00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:26.175
The debate about the role of the monarchy will come because of who

00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:30.565
is on the throne, rather than the existence of the throne itself.

00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:35.275
Now, there is little doubt that the next British monarch

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:38.595
will be Charles, Charles III of the United Kingdom.

00:20:39.345 --> 00:20:45.575
And, given that he’ll be Charles III, you’ll know that there have been two King Charles before.

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:51.465
The first one was so terrible that he was the only British monarch to be publicly

00:20:51.505 --> 00:20:57.515
executed, and after his death the monarchy was actually abolished for 11 years.

00:20:58.085 --> 00:21:02.695
The second was a notorious party animal, nicknamed the Merry

00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:06.815
Monarch, and left at least 12 illegitimate children behind him.

00:21:07.885 --> 00:21:12.485
Time will only tell what sort of monarch King Charles III will be.

00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:20.475
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Future of the British Royal Family.

00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:25.685
If you’re listening to this episode on the day it comes out, then well done, you are

00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:31.045
on top of things, and you have just two days to wait until an important day for the UK.

00:21:31.615 --> 00:21:36.785
If you’re listening to this on February 6th of 2022, then you should raise a

00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:42.705
glass to the 70th anniversary, the Platinum Jubilee, of Queen Elizabeth II.

00:21:43.305 --> 00:21:47.285
And if you’re listening to it after that, perhaps even when there’s

00:21:47.285 --> 00:21:51.435
a King Charles or even King William on the throne, then you’ll be

00:21:51.445 --> 00:21:55.915
able to see for yourself how these predictions fared against reality.

00:21:56.695 --> 00:21:59.975
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:03.865
What do you think lies ahead for the British royal family?

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:08.255
Who should become the next king, Charles or William, and why?

00:22:09.035 --> 00:22:11.985
What does the royal family need to do to survive,

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:15.585
and is it even right for it to continue to survive?

00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:20.015
I would love to know so let’s get this discussion started.

00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:23.305

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:16.173
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:21.063
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:28.053
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Robert Maxwell.

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:34.903
Now, you may not have heard this name before, or if you have, you might have

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:39.773
heard it recently in conjunction with his daughter, Ghislaine Maxwell, who

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:44.333
is accused of being involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking ring.

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:48.603
But we aren’t going to talk about Ghislaine Maxwell, or Jeffrey Epstein.

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:55.243
Instead, we are going to be talking about Ghislaine’s father Robert.

00:00:56.873 --> 00:01:02.973
His story takes us from Czechoslovakia to France, to the British Houses of Parliament, to

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:10.143
the top of the British media and ends as we'll find out just off the Canary Islands of Spain.

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:15.133
So without further ado, let's get cracking.

00:01:16.823 --> 00:01:22.283
Our story starts in a small town called Slatinské Doly in

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:26.483
what was then Czechoslovakia, but now is part of Ukraine.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:37.373
On the 10th of June 1923, Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch was born to a poor orthodox Jewish family.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:44.283
Not a huge amount is known about his early life, but he claimed

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:48.823
to not have owned a pair of shoes until he was seven years old.

00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:56.433
When he was 16 years old, in 1939, the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:04.363
Obviously, it wasn’t a good time or place to be Jewish, and the teenager fled to France.

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:11.723
It proved to be an act that saved his life, as most of his family were left behind

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:17.863
in Czechoslovakia, and ended up being sent to Auschwitz and murdered by the Nazis.

00:02:19.363 --> 00:02:25.993
The young Hoch enlisted in the Czechoslovakian army, and fought the Nazis throughout France.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:32.673
He then transferred over to the British army, and was promoted several

00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:37.663
times, achieving the rank of Captain, and winning the Military Cross.

00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:43.873
After the war ended, he settled in Britain, with his new, French wife,

00:02:44.423 --> 00:02:49.543
and ended up having 9 children over the next 16 years, the youngest

00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:53.633
of whom, Ghislaine, is the one you may be hearing about at the moment.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:03:00.943
And it was when he got to Britain that he really turned his attention to business.

00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:07.933
His ambition was to build up an empire, and he got to work right away.

00:03:09.183 --> 00:03:11.543
But first, he needed a new name.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:17.813
He was starting a new life in the United Kingdom, and so he needed a British name.

00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:26.123
In June 1948, after having become a British citizen two years earlier, he changed

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:32.603
his name to Ian Robert Maxwell, you might say a classic British name at the time.

00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:38.793
Maxwell quickly got to business, and started building up his empire.

00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:47.463
He started by distributing scientific books, and he then bought a small company that he renamed

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:53.963
Pergamon Press, which he turned into a publishing powerhouse over the next 20 years or so.

00:03:55.463 --> 00:04:01.723
Although he was an avowed socialist, which was unusual for people in the media back then,

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:09.303
he was known for being a ruthless operator, religiously cutting costs, sacking people, and

00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:15.133
generally, not doing things that would go down very well with any modern HR department.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:22.323
The company was a huge success, and he floated it, it went public, in

00:04:22.323 --> 00:04:27.693
nineteen sixty four, for today's equivalent of around 30 million dollars.

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:35.233
Now, in the era of billion dollar companies, 30 million might not sound like

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:41.333
very much, but it was a huge sum at the time, and made him a multi-millionaire.

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:47.143
And he wasn’t the kind of person to be quiet in the background,

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:50.713
keeping out of the public eye and maintaining a low profile.

00:04:51.543 --> 00:04:52.493
Quite the opposite.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:59.613
He rented a large mansion house outside Oxford, directly from the Oxford

00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:05.463
Council, and traveled to his office in London every day in a helicopter.

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:10.943
His London headquarters were named Maxwell House, of course.

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:16.263
I wonder if you can think of any comparisons with any modern

00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:19.133
public figures who like to put their names on buildings?

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:26.218
Maxwell had all the trappings of a multimillionaire, the Rolls Royces,

00:05:26.273 --> 00:05:30.613
the yacht, and he even owned a couple of British football clubs.

00:05:32.093 --> 00:05:37.213
And, as seems to be even more common nowadays with media personalities,

00:05:37.543 --> 00:05:43.533
he tried his hand at politics, becoming a Labour Party MP in 1964.

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:51.983
But his politics, and his background were to be a problem when trying to expand his media empire.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:06:01.243
He tried to buy the tabloid newspaper The News of The World in 1969, but the family who

00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:07.963
owned it were loathed to sell it to an immigrant, especially one with socialist views.

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:14.773
When he was making a bid for the newspaper, when he was trying to buy it, the editor

00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:21.103
published an opinion piece on the front page saying “This is a British paper, run by British

00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:26.563
people ... as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding ... Let us keep it that way".

00:06:28.063 --> 00:06:34.723
Instead, the News of the World was sold to another media tycoon, a man called Rupert Murdoch.

00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:42.749
Now, if you have listened to the episode on Fox News, you will know all about Rupert Murdoch.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.009
He became a bitter rival of Maxwell’s, and they both ended up fighting for

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.669
control over various British newspapers over the next couple of decades.

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:01.139
The deal for which Maxwell is most remembered is for the Mirror Group, which is

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:07.319
a large British publishing company that mainly published pro-Labour tabloids,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.719
but Maxwell's politics and his business interests didn't always align.

00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:19.469
He had been a Labour MP, but he got into big fights

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:22.709
with the trade unions when it came to sacking people.

00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:28.375
So much so that the unions even tried to kick him out of the Labour Party.

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:36.265
Buying companies and sacking people wasn’t a very socialist thing to do, and there was

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:42.155
an obvious contradiction here between his politics and his personal business interests.

00:07:43.975 --> 00:07:47.335
Now, we’re not going to list out every single one of

00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:51.265
Maxwell’s business dealings, because, well, he had a lot.

00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:55.845
He ended up buying companies all over Europe and the United

00:07:55.845 --> 00:08:00.305
States, and it’s said that he was worth over a billion dollars.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:06.455
Quite an impressive rise for someone who didn’t have a pair of shoes until he was 7 years old.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:12.490
However, this rise wasn't without controversy, the biggest

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.200
of which will have to wait until the end of the episode.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.290
Firstly, he was, according to many who worked for him, just an awful boss.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.370
He would routinely bully his employees and fire them without any reason.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:36.149
He reportedly worked up to 17 hours a day, 7 days a week, and was

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:41.909
constantly on the hunt for his next purchase, a way to expand his empire.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.586
He was never happy with what he had, he was always looking for more.

00:08:48.046 --> 00:08:54.876
The line between truth and fiction was quite blurred for Maxwell, and he would apparently

00:08:54.886 --> 00:09:01.136
try to impress visitors to his office by picking up the phone and saying ‘Get me Number

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:08.126
10’ - which is the home of the British Prime Minister, or ‘Get me the White House’, then a

00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:12.576
few minutes later the phone would ring back and he’d pretend to be having a conversation.

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:19.766
However, this all pales in comparison when it comes to what happened next.

00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:26.616
On the 5th of November, 1991, he was sailing just off the Canary Islands

00:09:26.846 --> 00:09:31.086
on his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, named after his youngest daughter.

00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:36.786
He had spoken to his son, Kevin, the previous day, and

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:41.546
was last seen by the crew around 4.35 in the morning.

00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:46.246
But later that morning, he was nowhere to be found.

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:47.946
He had disappeared.

00:09:49.446 --> 00:09:54.346
Later that day, his naked body was spotted by some Spanish

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:59.324
fisherman, floating about 15 miles from where he was last seen.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:08.379
Maxwell was a big man, weighing about 140kg at the time, and I can imagine it must

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:14.509
have been quite a surprise to see this huge, naked man just floating in the ocean.

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:21.029
After his death, it was found that he had taken huge amounts of money

00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:26.709
from his staff’s pensions, almost 500 million pounds that had been put

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:31.759
aside by the employees of his companies, to be saved for their retirement.

00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:38.086
Maxwell was badly in debt, and he had raided the pension

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:41.936
pots of his employees in order to try to save his companies.

00:10:43.278 --> 00:10:46.778
Obviously, it was highly illegal to take this money

00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:49.768
that his staff had been saving for their retirement.

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:53.988
Rumours quickly began to circulate.

00:10:54.718 --> 00:11:00.298
This all seemed very suspicious - it looked like Maxwell had been on the

00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:06.068
cusp of being found out, of this huge fraud and theft being discovered.

00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:08.738
Did he kill himself?

00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:11.958
Or was he pushed by someone?

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:16.538
After the autopsy, nothing strange was found.

00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:23.330
Apparently Maxwell liked to pee off the edge of the boat, and it’s suspected that he had

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.810
a heart attack and fell off in the middle of the night, and none of the crew heard him.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:38.000
Certainly, those who knew him say that suicide is unlikely, given the kind of person Maxwell was.

00:11:38.862 --> 00:11:44.170
He thought he was invincible, and the idea of him throwing himself off a boat

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.560
to avoid being found out just wasn’t believable to many of those who knew him

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.905
.  
In the months after his death, there were large protests from the employees of his companies.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:03.575
Their hard earned money that had been taken from them - who was going to help them get it back?

00:12:05.075 --> 00:12:10.798
The British government did step up, and provided some of the money to repair the pension fund.

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:16.485
But not all of it, and his employees lost half of

00:12:16.515 --> 00:12:19.625
the savings they had put aside for their retirement.

00:12:21.105 --> 00:12:25.195
Although now it’s been almost 30 years since his death,

00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:29.755
he has had a lasting impact on British popular culture.

00:12:31.255 --> 00:12:35.915
If you have seen the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, there is a

00:12:35.935 --> 00:12:41.595
media baron called Eliot Carver who is thought to be inspired by Maxwell.

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:49.042
If you remember the film, the baddy - the bad guy - Carver is killed by James Bond.

00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:55.032
But this is covered up by the British secret service, who issue a

00:12:55.032 --> 00:12:59.532
press release saying that Carver died falling overboard his yacht.

00:12:59.532 --> 00:13:05.892
And, of course, Maxwell’s legacy is back in the news, given what

00:13:05.892 --> 00:13:08.992
has come to light with his daughter, and her relationship with

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:13.582
Jeffrey Epstein, and the crimes that she is accused of committing.

00:13:15.082 --> 00:13:20.302
Robert Maxwell’s story is one of rise and fall, of how someone can go from

00:13:20.552 --> 00:13:25.272
arriving penniless in a country to controlling a large part of the media.

00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:33.172
At his height, he was admired by many as a business guru and a tale to emulate.

00:13:34.162 --> 00:13:42.372
However, shortly after his death, with no way to hide what he had been up to, it soon became evident

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:49.752
that a large part of his success was a scam, that despite pledging to be a man of the people,

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:56.882
and a devout socialist, he was actually stealing from the very people he was pledging to support.

00:13:58.202 --> 00:14:02.942
And unfortunately for him, that is the legacy of Robert Maxwell.

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:08.962
OK then that is it for today's episode.

00:14:09.442 --> 00:14:12.142
As always, I would love to know what you think.

00:14:12.582 --> 00:14:15.742
Had you heard of Robert Maxwell before, or at least,

00:14:16.082 --> 00:14:19.032
had you heard of him before hearing about his daughter?

00:14:19.872 --> 00:14:22.312
Are there similar stories in your country?

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:23.992
I would love to know.

00:14:24.262 --> 00:14:27.972

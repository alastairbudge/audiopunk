Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:16.236
English the show where you can listen to interesting stories and learn weird

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:22.081
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:26.221
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.661
talking about the hidden cost of food delivery apps.

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:37.165
Getting takeaway food, of course, isn't a new thing, but a whole

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:42.595
range of new apps and services have made this easier than ever before.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.570
Getting the food you want has never been easier.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.620
Just open your phone, choose a restaurant and half an

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.100
hour later, some delicious food arrives at your doorstep.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.910
Restaurants sell more food, you don't have to get up off your sofa and everyone's a winner, right?

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.710
Well, as we'll discuss today, it's not quite so simple.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.940
Before we get right into the main course of this episode, though, let me just remind

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.970
you that you can get every single episode, including all the bonus ones, plus subtitles,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.790
transcripts, and key vocabulary over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.430
Just listening to these episodes will be really helpful, but having all of

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.990
the materials in front of you will help you progress just so much faster.

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:40.295
So that's definitely worth checking out if you haven't done so already.

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:44.035
The link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:48.675
Right then, food delivery apps.

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:54.345
Depending on the country you live in, you may know things like Uber

00:01:54.375 --> 00:02:01.095
Eats, Glovo, Deliveroo, Bolt, Wolt, Rappi, Ifood, Postmates, or GrubHub.

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:07.888
There are some differences with how they work, but the principle is

00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:13.108
pretty simple there is an app that is free for anyone to download.

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:18.148
You go on the app, you see a list of restaurants that you can choose from, you choose

00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:23.548
your dishes and then, like magic, a person arrives at your door with the food ready.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:30.412
It's great for you, the consumer; you get lovely restaurant food delivered to your door.

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:35.842
It's convenient, as often you can just pay with a card directly on

00:02:35.842 --> 00:02:40.192
the app, so there isn't the awkward encounter where you have to ask

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:43.792
for change, or you don't have exactly the right amount of money.

00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:49.852
And in these past few months where people have been at home more frequently

00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:54.952
than usual, it has proven to be a very welcome convenience for lots of people.

00:02:56.482 --> 00:03:03.262
All for a small fee, sometimes even zero fee for you, or a fee that seems very

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:08.872
reasonable for the service of someone literally delivering the food to your door.

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:14.142
And the selling point for restaurants, the advantage for restaurants,

00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:18.312
is that they can sell more food and that they can make more money.

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:23.818
Restaurants, being physical locations, are of course

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:27.718
limited by the amount of people that can sit inside them.

00:03:28.288 --> 00:03:31.738
If they're full, they're full, and they have to wait until

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:35.458
someone leaves a table until they can accept new customers.

00:03:37.028 --> 00:03:42.158
These food delivery apps promised restaurants that they would be free of their

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:47.678
physical constraints, the only limit to how much food they could sell and how much

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:52.138
money they could make would be how quickly they could actually produce the stuff.

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:57.770
Plus there would be fewer costs, no serving staff, no washing

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.060
up, no advertising to get customers, the app would manage it all.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.140
All the restaurant would have to do is concentrate on making

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.145
great food and everything else would be taken care of by the app.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.735
What could possibly go wrong?

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:20.526
Well, when these apps first started, in many cases almost

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:25.176
10 years ago, in some cases almost 20, everything was great.

00:04:25.746 --> 00:04:32.796
They were a welcome new source of customers and restaurants that partnered with them ended up

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:39.785
being able to increase the amount of money they made, and in many cases becoming more profitable.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.279
Yes, these apps did take quite a large commission on the cost of food, often

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:53.939
up to 35%, but that was sort of okay; they were doing the deliveries, doing

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:59.429
the marketing, and that was a, just about acceptable percentage to take.

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:05.309
The restaurants could still make more money through partnering with these apps.

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.769
It was a win-win situation.

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:17.249
However in recent years, how helpful these food delivery apps actually are has come into question.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:23.665
Firstly, there are some quite shady tactics that some of these

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:28.465
companies have employed to force restaurants to use their service.

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:35.765
One in the United States, Grubhub, was found to have created its own versions

00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:41.225
of websites for restaurants so that customers think that they are on the website

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:46.745
for a restaurant and think they are ordering directly, but it turns out they

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:51.755
are ordering through another company, which then takes a slice of commission.

00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:58.205
With these websites and within their app, they use a different phone number,

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:06.255
so that phone call goes to a centralised number that you or I might think is

00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:11.565
the number for a restaurant, but actually it belongs to the food delivery app.

00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:17.925
The reason that this matters is that these apps often charge

00:06:17.955 --> 00:06:22.695
restaurants just for receiving a phone call like this from a customer.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:30.195
There was a case in America where a restaurant was charged $9 by a food delivery

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:36.480
app just because a customer called up to ask whether they had gluten-free pasta.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.800
So restaurants are paying these apps, even if they don't make any money from customers.

00:06:45.374 --> 00:06:53.042
The amount that these apps take in commission has also come under renewed scrutiny from restaurants.

00:06:54.294 --> 00:07:01.298
It can be up to 35%, which, on second thought, is an awful lot for a restaurant.

00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:05.858
Yes, there is no washing up, no costs for serving

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:09.068
staff, and all they need to do is provide the food.

00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:15.818
But restaurants work with very small margins they don't generally make

00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:22.298
much profit anyway, and paying a third of the money you get out to a

00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:27.529
food delivery app can make running a sustainable business very difficult.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:36.961
What's more, when these food delivery apps run offers, so $10 off or get 20% off today

00:07:37.231 --> 00:07:42.961
in order to entice customers, the commission that they take from the restaurants is

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:50.461
often calculated from the normal non-discounted price, so it's the restaurant that is

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:55.171
giving you the big discount the food delivery app is still getting all of its money.

00:07:56.299 --> 00:08:03.477
To give you an idea of exactly how bad this can be, there was a photo that was shared by the

00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:11.317
owner of a Chicago pizza restaurant called Chicago Pizza Boss which detailed exactly how much

00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:18.067
money his restaurant really got after all of the fees that the food delivery app had taken.

00:08:19.877 --> 00:08:24.784
This restaurant had partnered with Grubhub, the food delivery app we heard about

00:08:24.814 --> 00:08:31.492
earlier that made the websites for companies without their permission, and out of a

00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:42.562
total of $1042 worth of pizzas that it had sold over 42 different orders, after all

00:08:42.562 --> 00:08:51.502
of the fees and commissions that Grubhub took, the restaurant was left with just $376.

00:08:51.742 --> 00:09:00.022
So it was left with $376 after selling a total of $1042 worth of pizza.

00:09:00.952 --> 00:09:06.082
So it received 36% of what it would have normally done.

00:09:07.254 --> 00:09:11.818
Obviously for a lot of restaurants, this just isn't viable.

00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:13.708
They can't continue like this.

00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:19.623
Especially during coronavirus times when lots of them have had to

00:09:19.623 --> 00:09:24.888
shut their doors to dine-in customers, it has been even harder.

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:31.548
They have become even more reliant on these food delivery apps, and even if they

00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:37.548
hate paying the commission, having some money coming in is better than none.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:44.360
But despite the fact that these apps are all taking such high commissions,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.143
at least from the restaurant's point of view, the majority of them

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:52.913
are still losing large amounts of money they are not profitable.

00:09:54.323 --> 00:10:00.023
They are all doing basically the same thing bringing you exactly the same food from

00:10:00.023 --> 00:10:05.873
the same restaurants, and the only thing they can really compete on right now is price.

00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:13.734
So they are running all of these discounts and promotions, offering incentives for both restaurants

00:10:13.734 --> 00:10:20.844
and customers to use their app, but they still aren't making enough money to be viable businesses.

00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:28.284
And this has led a lot of people to believe that this business model of

00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:34.584
instant on-demand food delivery just isn't possible at such low prices.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:42.234
At the moment it is being funded by the investors of the companies; they believe that if

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:47.874
they put enough money into these companies, then eventually they will turn profitable.

00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:53.726
But in the meantime, there is intense competition, discounts

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:59.306
and offers in what's called a race to the bottom of pricing.

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:04.686
If you can get exactly the same meal delivered by three

00:11:04.836 --> 00:11:08.166
different food delivery apps, which one would you go for?

00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:12.196
Well, I know what I'd go for I'd go for the cheapest of course.

00:11:13.536 --> 00:11:16.296
And this unfortunately is where the problem lies.

00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:22.771
These food delivery apps are incredibly convenient for us, for consumers.

00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:28.741
They are cheap, too cheap even, and the result is that the restaurants that

00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:34.891
actually make the food are being squeezed, they are suffering with these large fees.

00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:40.881
So if the current model isn't feasible in the longterm, what

00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:45.141
will the future hold for restaurants and food delivery apps?

00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:50.871
One quite interesting development is something called dark kitchens.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:57.401
These are space normally in cheap industrial areas that can

00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:01.421
be rented by restaurants to have delivery-only kitchens.

00:12:02.287 --> 00:12:08.753
Instead of having all of the food cooked inside your normal restaurants, a restaurant can

00:12:08.903 --> 00:12:16.523
rent a fully functioning kitchen and have its chefs work in there, but only for delivery.

00:12:17.683 --> 00:12:22.063
This means that it's much easier to increase the amount of meals

00:12:22.213 --> 00:12:27.103
that a restaurant produces without taking on extra fixed costs.

00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:32.826
The concept was made famous by someone called Travis

00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:38.244
Kalanick, who was the CEO of Uber, the ride-hailing company.

00:12:39.784 --> 00:12:45.244
But now these are all over the world, so you might think that you're ordering your food

00:12:45.244 --> 00:12:50.104
from your favourite restaurant, and you can imagine the people in the kitchen lovingly

00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:57.634
preparing your food, but in fact, they may be in a trailer in a carpark or industrial

00:12:57.634 --> 00:13:03.514
zone in a completely different kitchen, or even cooking beside chefs from other

00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:09.694
restaurants, making you the same delicious food, but from a place you've never been to.

00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:17.146
There are some serious investors betting that this is the future, saying that,

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:22.336
much like people used to make their own clothes 300 years ago, but we don't

00:13:22.336 --> 00:13:28.906
now, in 50 years time the idea of making your own food will be equally foreign.

00:13:30.716 --> 00:13:35.331
I'm not sure I completely agree with that, and I, for one, think

00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:38.871
it would be a real shame if we lost the joy of home cooking.

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:49.791
But food delivery is evidently booming and it is predicted to be a $365 billion industry by 2030.

00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:54.231
So it certainly isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

00:13:55.146 --> 00:14:01.578
One thing you can do, if you want to support your local restaurant, is to bypass the

00:14:01.578 --> 00:14:07.338
food delivery apps and order directly from the restaurants, if they offer delivery

00:14:08.688 --> 00:14:13.398
Especially in times like now restaurants need as much help as their customers

00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:19.818
can give, and ordering directly is an easy and free way to help out.

00:14:21.823 --> 00:14:26.503
And as a final point, we haven't even talked about the delivery drivers,

00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:31.843
the people who are doing the often thankless work of actually going to pick

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:35.713
up the food from the restaurants and take it to the person who ordered it.

00:14:37.323 --> 00:14:45.773
In many cases, the pay that they receive from the food delivery app is very low and unpredictable.

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:52.223
It is coming under scrutiny in the UK where it has been shown that

00:14:52.223 --> 00:14:57.443
drivers are often earning significantly below the minimum wage

00:14:57.653 --> 00:15:01.673
and these delivery apps can just get rid of them with no reason.

00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:08.063
If they fall off their bike or they aren't able to work, then there is, in most

00:15:08.063 --> 00:15:14.228
cases, no kind of sick pay or anything like that; they are completely on their own.

00:15:15.808 --> 00:15:21.148
So yes, food delivery apps can be incredibly convenient, and for many

00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:25.738
people, especially over the past few months, they have been a great thing,

00:15:26.638 --> 00:15:31.468
but it is always good to know that there is a hidden cost to everything.

00:15:32.093 --> 00:15:35.033
And food delivery apps are no exception.

00:15:37.143 --> 00:15:42.543
Okay then, that is it for today's episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:46.293
I hope it's been an interesting one, and you now know something

00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:49.803

Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to another members-only English Learning for

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:10.849
Curious Minds podcast.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.359
Firstly, thank you for your ongoing membership.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.139
It couldn't be possible without you and I really am truly grateful.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.879
Today we are going to be talking about vocabulary in English.

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:30.834
When focusing on vocabulary is important, when it's not so important.

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:38.064
We'll talk about some of the myths around vocabulary and we'll talk about some of the techniques

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.454
that you can use to help build up your vocabulary.

00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:49.044
For starters, as you may know, like you, I'm also a language learner.

00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:56.814
Aside from my mother tongue English, I've learned Italian, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish,

00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:59.214
but to very different levels.

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:06.654
The order I just gave was actually the order of how well I speak those languages - I speak Italian

00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:12.534
with my wife, but I'm only just starting Spanish and would probably sound like a small child.

00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:17.154
And I'm definitely not anything special.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:25.389
I have the same issues as anyone with motivation, with remembering words, with making mistakes.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:34.329
So what I'm going to share with you today is my perspective on this, coming at it from a perspective

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.759
I guess very much like yours.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:46.029
Too often you see stuff on the internet which is mainly from people whose entire lives are taken up

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:53.409
by learning languages who are teaching you things that would only apply if you speak 10 languages.

00:01:54.249 --> 00:02:00.369
It's really not very helpful for people who aren't making a career of learning just dozens of

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:00.969
languages.

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.939
So today we are going to approach it from a normal person's point of view.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.794
Firstly, what is vocabulary and why building up your vocabulary is important.

00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:19.954
This might sound ridiculously obvious, but let's just define vocabulary.

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:25.604
Vocabulary is the body of words used in a particular language.

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:28.364
It's the words that make up a language.

00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:31.694
It's the bricks with which language is built.

00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:41.934
And in English, like in almost every language, there are an awful lot of bricks, a lot of words.

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:52.104
In a project between Harvard university and Google in 2010, they looked at a large collection of

00:02:52.524 --> 00:03:03.024
digitized books, and estimated that they were 1,022,000 words in English, and that the number of

00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:07.914
words would continue to grow by several thousand every year.

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:18.034
This number includes all the different forms of the word though, plus a load of archaic, very old

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:20.494
words, which aren't in use anymore.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:30.564
If we reduce this down to just word forms, so that means you don't count verb conjugations, plurals

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:38.214
and so on, there are still around 600,000 different words in the Oxford English dictionary.

00:03:39.564 --> 00:03:44.904
But of course, this dictionary uses loads of words that aren't currently in use.

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:55.539
You might say that a more useful number would be 171,476 which is the number of words that are

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.899
currently in use according to the Oxford English dictionary.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:07.569
But that's still a huge amount, and most native speakers evidently don't have a vocabulary that's

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.429
nearly as large as that.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:21.039
It's estimated that most adult native English speakers have a vocabulary of between 20-35,000 words.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:31.160
That's of course a big variation and the type of vocabulary that you have, both in terms of the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.370
number of words that you know and the types of words that you know will vary according to things

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.140
like the job that you do, your education level, your interests, and so on.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.370
If I'm a neurosurgeon, I will probably know some words that someone who has a keen interest in

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.770
pigeons, let's say, won't.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.760
And of course vice-versa, unless that neurosurgeon also has a keen interest in pigeons.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.810
So even if we take this lower number, the 20,000 words, that's still a very large amount of words,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.200
right?

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.370
If you set yourself the task of learning 10 new words a day, and you started from scratch, it would

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.500
take you almost six years to get there.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.470
And if you already have a vocabulary of, let's say 3000 words, which is the number in the Oxford

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.070
3000, the 3000 most important words to know in English, according to the Oxford English dictionary,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:44.070
then getting to a native speaker level of 20,000 if you learnt 25 new words a day would take you

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.420
almost two years.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.425
And that's assuming that you don't forget any of those words, which I'm sure you'll agree, is a bit

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:53.115
optimistic.

00:05:55.968 --> 00:06:03.462
What I'd recommend, however, is to stop worrying about how many words you know or don't know, to

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:06.792
actually embrace it when you don't understand a word.

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:14.442
We'll talk about some of the strategies that you can use to figure out what a word means and

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:17.592
remember it even if you've never heard it before.

00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:26.792
To start though, I just want to talk about a few myths which are pretty common with people learning

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:31.642
English and are really not very helpful when you're trying to learn.

00:06:33.422 --> 00:06:39.092
Our first myth is that the more words you know, the better you are at English.

00:06:40.872 --> 00:06:48.372
Of course, there is often a correlation, people who have a higher level of English tend to have a

00:06:48.372 --> 00:06:49.482
better vocabulary.

00:06:50.502 --> 00:06:55.542
But just knowing vocabulary does not make you a better English speaker.

00:06:56.592 --> 00:07:01.132
As we know words are just the bricks with which language is formed.

00:07:02.152 --> 00:07:08.152
If you don't know how to put these bricks together, then it doesn't matter how many you have.

00:07:08.872 --> 00:07:16.072
The best you can do, if we are to continue the analogy, is to build a massive pile of bricks.

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:29.327
An example of this is in 2015, the person who won the world championship of the word game Scrabble

00:07:29.617 --> 00:07:34.747
in French was actually a New Zealander, a person from New Zealand.

00:07:35.842 --> 00:07:43.113
And no, he wasn't someone who was brought up bilingually or had spent decades working as a professor

00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:45.183
at the Sorbonne university in Paris.

00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:48.123
He doesn't actually speak French at all.

00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:54.673
He had just memorised the French dictionary in apparently nine weeks.

00:07:56.023 --> 00:08:01.783
He knew all of the words, he just didn't have a clue what they meant or how to put them together.

00:08:03.623 --> 00:08:07.193
So vocabulary alone, obviously, isn't enough.

00:08:08.423 --> 00:08:14.813
Yes, it's important to continue to make sure you are increasing the amount of words in your arsenal,

00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:21.768
that you are able to use, both from a comprehension point of view and from a production point of

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:30.048
view - so by that, that's words that you can both recognise when someone else says them, but that

00:08:30.048 --> 00:08:34.338
you can also use in conversation yourself without having heard them first.

00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:40.758
But more important is to be able to use these words in context.

00:08:41.898 --> 00:08:48.408
You'll sound a lot more confident and a lot more fluent if you're using English in a way that's

00:08:48.438 --> 00:08:56.958
clear, easy to understand, and free from errors instead of using sentences that are full of unusual

00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.318
words, but peppered with basic errors.

00:09:02.273 --> 00:09:09.282
This brings us on to our second myth, which is that the best way to learn vocabulary is through

00:09:09.342 --> 00:09:11.202
memorising vocabulary lists.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:19.122
I should just preface this by saying that an even more important rule is that you should do what

00:09:19.122 --> 00:09:19.872
works for you.

00:09:20.232 --> 00:09:25.242
And for some people, vocabulary lists work, but not for most.

00:09:25.624 --> 00:09:33.094
The best way to learn vocabulary in almost every case, is through exposure to English, so you are

00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:34.804
learning in context.

00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:43.054
There are a myriad of ways to do this, so many different ways - reading, speaking with people,

00:09:43.174 --> 00:09:44.524
podcasts, of course.

00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:52.624
What people don't do, what most people don't do at least, is to read or listen actively.

00:09:53.674 --> 00:10:00.199
Instead, they just allow new pieces of vocabulary to sort of drift over them.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:08.059
It's completely natural that when you're listening to a podcast, watching a film, speaking with a

00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:16.429
native speaker, you don't always want to have to press pause or ask your friend to stop speaking in

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:21.439
order for you to find out what that word means or clarify its definition.

00:10:22.624 --> 00:10:27.544
So it's important to use resources that are appropriate to your level, of course.

00:10:28.324 --> 00:10:33.214
This podcast is aimed at people who are intermediate and above.

00:10:33.754 --> 00:10:39.334
If you're a beginner, evidently you'd have to press pause a lot and it would be pretty disruptive.

00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:48.094
And research suggests that you should aim for material where the ratio of new words to words that

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:52.324
you know is about between 1:20 to 1:50.

00:10:53.227 --> 00:10:59.744
So you should understand most of the words and be able to learn new words in context.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.994
Why is learning in context better?

00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:13.024
Well, it provides you with information on how the word is actually used, not just the theory of how

00:11:13.024 --> 00:11:14.014
it could be used.

00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:22.524
English is a particularly tricky language, as there are lots of words that have multiple meanings.

00:11:24.024 --> 00:11:31.794
For example, the word 'set' in English - S E T - I guess you might say that you know what this

00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:32.784
means, right?

00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:33.984
You know what 'set' means?

00:11:34.854 --> 00:11:40.554
You probably know some of its meanings, but I'd imagine that you won't know all of them.

00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:46.139
I definitely couldn't list all of them, and most native speakers couldn't.

00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:47.819
Why?

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:53.639
Well, set has a total of 430 different meanings.

00:11:54.989 --> 00:12:00.899
You're not going to learn that by memorising a vocabulary list or through flashcards.

00:12:01.349 --> 00:12:03.659
It's just not an effective way to do so.

00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:06.059
And it would also be really boring.

00:12:07.964 --> 00:12:15.594
Our third myth, which is one that language schools are particularly guilty of peddling, of pushing,

00:12:16.044 --> 00:12:22.554
is that you need to get a certain number of words in your vocabulary in order to be able to

00:12:22.854 --> 00:12:26.244
communicate at certain levels or do certain things.

00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:35.409
You need X thousand words to work in an office, an extra X thousand to get into an English speaking

00:12:35.409 --> 00:12:36.729
university and so on.

00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:45.199
Yes, these might be useful guides and they are certainly useful for schools that want to sell

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:52.579
courses, but as we heard from myth number one, if you don't know how to use these words in context,

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:54.259
you may as well not know them.

00:12:55.944 --> 00:13:03.654
Someone with a vocabulary of just 3000 words might sound like a much more accomplished speaker than

00:13:03.654 --> 00:13:12.834
someone with 6,000 words, if they used their vocabulary, their words, thoughtfully, and asked for

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:19.614
clarification when they didn't understand, as opposed to someone who just used words in the wrong

00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:20.184
context.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:30.141
And our final myth, which actually leads us onto our next point, is that there are hacks to master

00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:33.141
vocabulary, hacks, shortcuts, tricks.

00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:40.851
I cringe, I feel terrible, when I see things like 'follow my seven tips to master English vocabulary

00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:48.656
in three weeks', or people who are selling false hope, and are promising completely unrealistic

00:13:48.656 --> 00:13:49.256
results.

00:13:50.926 --> 00:13:57.676
Instead of hacks and shortcuts, the way to think about learning vocabulary is through solid

00:13:57.676 --> 00:14:04.666
foundations, things that you can start doing today that will help you build up your vocabulary over

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:06.226
the weeks and months to come.

00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:15.671
And the nice thing about this is that it compounds, meaning that vocabulary you learn today will

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:18.731
help you learn more and more vocabulary in the future.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:28.221
And from a motivational point of view, it's pretty demotivating to constantly have to stop to look

00:14:28.221 --> 00:14:28.941
up words.

00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:37.316
The more your vocabulary expands, the more enjoyable it will be to read books or articles, to listen

00:14:37.316 --> 00:14:43.466
to podcasts or to watch films in English, which will mean you'll do it more and you'll learn faster.

00:14:46.116 --> 00:14:51.996
So, without further ado, what are some of the things that you can do to try to help build up your

00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:52.596
vocabulary?

00:14:55.056 --> 00:15:01.931
Firstly, and this is hardly revolutionary, but it's always worth saying, it's to consume as much

00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:05.141
original content as possible in English.

00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:14.111
Whether that's reading podcasts like this, films, the more you are exposed to English, the more your

00:15:14.111 --> 00:15:15.521
vocabulary will grow.

00:15:17.411 --> 00:15:24.431
You should aim for things where you can understand at least 80% and then it won't be a huge chore,

00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:30.851
it won't be super frustrating because you should be able to still enjoy it, even if you don't

00:15:30.851 --> 00:15:32.261
understand every word.

00:15:33.912 --> 00:15:36.542
And what should you do when you don't understand a word.

00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:44.432
Of course, if you can understand it through context, great, if you can wait a little bit and figure

00:15:44.432 --> 00:15:46.052
out what it means, fantastic.

00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:53.947
If you need to look it up either in a dictionary or in a vocabulary list like the ones that we give

00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:56.497
for these podcasts, then do that too.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:05.197
But don't just find the definition there and then, and do nothing other than solve your immediate

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:06.337
comprehension problem.

00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:14.017
For the vast majority of people, and I'm definitely in this category, you will forget it unless you

00:16:14.017 --> 00:16:20.782
continue to encounter it, unless you continue to see the word over the coming days and weeks.

00:16:22.522 --> 00:16:29.422
Whether this is through flashcards, through keeping your own little vocabulary book, through writing

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:35.752
Post It notes on your bathroom mirror, through something called the gold list method or any other

00:16:35.752 --> 00:16:40.552
technique, the important thing is that you're doing something that means you are likely to

00:16:40.552 --> 00:16:43.612
re-encounter that word, to come across it again.

00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:51.767
You may call me old fashioned here, but for me nothing beats a little notebook that you can carry

00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:52.427
around with you.

00:16:53.957 --> 00:17:00.137
I wish I had a photographic memory, but I don't, and I guess that you probably don't either.

00:17:01.782 --> 00:17:08.177
Our next technique, and this is really an extension of our first technique, is to practice using

00:17:08.177 --> 00:17:11.207
your new pieces of vocabulary whenever you can.

00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:17.327
If you're lucky enough to have people that you can practice English with face to face, great.

00:17:17.807 --> 00:17:20.987
Make sure that you use that new word or phrase with them.

00:17:23.057 --> 00:17:28.937
And if you don't have that chance, well then you can write down different uses of that word in

00:17:28.937 --> 00:17:29.687
context.

00:17:30.077 --> 00:17:33.017
The more you use it, the more you are likely to remember it.

00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:42.753
Then there are other more technical skills that we're not going to go into huge depth on today, such

00:17:42.753 --> 00:17:49.323
as to work on your ability to recognise word routes, prefixes, and suffixes.

00:17:50.043 --> 00:17:54.393
And obviously a knowledge of things like Latin and Greek come in handy here.

00:17:55.683 --> 00:18:03.483
Things like words with 'pan' in it, right 'pan', they probably refer to the concept of something

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:05.403
being wide or far reaching.

00:18:05.883 --> 00:18:07.923
Panorama, pandemic, so on.

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:17.643
For a word, starting with 'ab', AB or 'a' means, it probably means the opposite of what the rest of

00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:18.453
the word means.

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:22.383
So abnormal, amoral, and so on.

00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:29.798
And I just have two more tips, which might sound like they are completely in opposition to each

00:18:29.798 --> 00:18:31.988
other, but they really aren't.

00:18:33.898 --> 00:18:40.738
The first one again might sound obvious and it's to concentrate on words and vocabulary that are

00:18:40.798 --> 00:18:45.748
actually relevant to you to how you need to use English.

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:54.028
Don't concern yourself with vocabulary that you are likely never going to encounter as it just

00:18:54.028 --> 00:18:54.988
simply doesn't matter.

00:18:57.928 --> 00:19:04.803
And the final one is to always try to use an unusual word, even when you know the usual one.

00:19:06.963 --> 00:19:15.423
As an exercise, trying to avoid saying the word 'good' and try to say instead great, fantastic,

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:21.323
splendid, excellent, marvelous, superb, wonderful, you get the gist.

00:19:22.623 --> 00:19:27.213
Working on your vocabulary isn't just useful, It can also be a lot of fun.

00:19:27.963 --> 00:19:34.989
I don't know about you, but when I suddenly remember a really obscure word or I try to use an

00:19:34.989 --> 00:19:40.029
obscure word when I'm speaking a foreign language, it brings me a huge amount of joy.

00:19:41.104 --> 00:19:47.104
For example, just the other day, I needed to say the word for seesaw in Italian.

00:19:48.094 --> 00:19:55.769
If you don't know what a seesaw is, it's the children's toy you might find in a playground where one

00:19:55.769 --> 00:19:59.399
child sits on either end and they bounce up and down.

00:20:00.749 --> 00:20:04.619
Anyway, I knew the word as 'zittolo zottolo'.

00:20:05.979 --> 00:20:12.809
In fact, this is actually a really old expression from Trieste in Northeastern Italy

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:19.169
The actual Italian word is 'Altalena', which is the same as the word for swing.

00:20:20.531 --> 00:20:26.826
The point is that even though this word was completely useless anywhere outside a city in

00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:33.216
Northeastern Italy, it made me really happy that I'd actually remembered it and put a huge smile on

00:20:33.216 --> 00:20:33.816
my face.

00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:37.836
And that's the real joy of language learning.

00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:43.206
Yes, it's great to be able to communicate and yes, you should be practical.

00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:50.661
But sometimes it's these magical moments that really make you happy, even if the next day you forget

00:20:50.661 --> 00:20:52.341
the word for something super easy.

00:20:53.661 --> 00:21:00.801
So yes, focus on vocabulary that is relevant for you, but also sometimes rejoice in the magic of

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.241
completely pointless words.

00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:10.441
Okay then that is it for this little episode on vocabulary in English.

00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:16.376
I hope it has been interesting, and that, if it didn't teach you anything new, at least it helped

00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:22.986
solidify some ideas and theories that we all sort of know, but that it's useful to have someone

00:21:22.986 --> 00:21:24.366
remind us from time to time.

00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:30.801
I'm Alastair Budge and you've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:21:30.801 --> 00:21:31.236
English.

00:21:31.506 --> 00:21:33.996
I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.712 --> 00:00:15.862
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:21.002
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:29.052
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Strangest Laws in the UK.

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:34.582
Now, perhaps you think of the UK as quite a sensible country.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.542
Or perhaps you think it is a bit of a ridiculous place.

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:44.352
Whatever you think, the reality is that English law is the

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:48.202
legal system of choice for a lot of international contracts.

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:53.612
It’s considered to be well-developed, clear, and fair for everyone.

00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:58.662
What most people don’t know though is that there are some

00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:03.442
laws in the UK that are, quite frankly, completely ridiculous.

00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:10.042
Laws about carrying fish, laws that might surprise you about drinking

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:16.692
alcohol, and laws about what the Queen can and cannot do to swans.

00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:23.442
Today’s episode is going to be a little bit ridiculous, but I hope it will be an interesting one.

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:31.252
So, rather than me just telling you that there are ridiculous laws in the UK, let’s just talk

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:36.674
about them, and you can make up your own mind about whether you think they’re ridiculous or not.

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:45.594
OK the, firstly, did you know that it is illegal in the UK to “handle salmon suspiciously”?

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:53.464
The Salmon Act of 1986 was intended to legislate against the illegal fishing

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:57.755
of salmon, to stop people being able to catch salmon without permission.

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:04.835
But there was a section in there that says it is illegal to handle salmon suspiciously,

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:11.855
without any kind of clarification about exactly what suspiciously actually means.

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:18.155
It would probably be suspicious for you to be carrying a raw salmon in

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:22.965
your hands walking down the street, and some people might say it would

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:27.435
be suspicious for you to add tomato ketchup to a smoked salmon sandwich.

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:32.402
You probably wouldn’t be arrested for doing these things, but you

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:37.032
should watch out - handling salmon suspiciously is against the law.

00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:42.482
It’s worth pointing out that this law actually is pretty recent, from 1986.

00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:49.572
Most of the laws that we’ll talk about today are a lot older than

00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:54.172
that, and they have really just been left there, never changed.

00:02:54.592 --> 00:02:58.622
So it is a little strange to see something that was

00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:03.862
created so recently be so weird, or at least, so ambiguous.

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:10.292
Our second law is related to swans, the majestic white

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:14.202
birds that you might see floating down a river or on a lake.

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:18.882
There are a few strange laws relating to swans in the UK.

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:23.902
Firstly, all swans in the UK are protected.

00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:31.882
It is illegal to kill one, and you can be given a large fine of up to £5,000 for killing a swan.

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:37.963
Fair enough, you might think - swans seem pretty nice, who would want to kill one?

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:42.673
But the law and swans gets a little stranger.

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:47.113
There is one breed of swan, one type of swan, called

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:52.303
a mute swan, and this breed is owned by the Queen.

00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:58.783
Every single mute swan in the country is technically owned by Queen Elizabeth.

00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:05.963
She is even allowed to eat this breed of swan, but only if she

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:10.933
eats it when she is a guest of a college at Cambridge University.

00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:16.673
However, these swans are still protected, and even though the

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:21.123
Queen is legally allowed to eat one, it is illegal to kill it.

00:04:22.403 --> 00:04:25.483
It’s not really very clear how that works out.

00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:30.393
It seems like if the Queen was keen on eating a swan, she could

00:04:30.393 --> 00:04:35.513
do it, but she would have to pay the £5,000 for killing it.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:40.463
Luckily for the swans, the Queen hasn’t shown much

00:04:40.483 --> 00:04:44.273
interest in exercising her legal right to eat one yet.

00:04:45.773 --> 00:04:51.543
While we are on the subject of The Queen, let’s talk about another law that involves

00:04:51.543 --> 00:04:59.223
her, and that is relating to money, postage stamps, or anything that has the reigning

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:03.971
monarch’s picture on it, the king or queen who is on the throne at that time.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:08.991
Now, the law is actually quite simple on this.

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.901
You can’t deface it, meaning you can’t willfully damage it.

00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:21.511
So if you buy a stamp, then write all over that or tear it up, that is a crime.

00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:28.271
Similarly, with a banknote, if you deface that, you write on it, you rip it up,

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:35.721
or do anything that on purpose that damages it, you could be fined up to £200.

00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:41.211
So, not only would you have lost the money, because it would now

00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:46.651
be unusable, but also you could get slapped with a very large fine.

00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:49.921
Certainly one to avoid I think.

00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:55.891
Moving on, those of you who have been to the UK will know

00:05:55.941 --> 00:06:00.651
that pubs, and drinking, are quite a feature in British life.

00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:04.401
So the next law might surprise you.

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:09.391
It is actually illegal to be drunk in public.

00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:18.551
The Licensing Act of 1872 states that “every person found drunk in a highway or other public

00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:26.351
place, whether a building or not, or on any licensed premises can be fined up to £200”.

00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:33.911
I couldn’t find any statistics on this, but I would be pretty sure that this is the law

00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:40.171
that is most commonly broken in the United Kingdom, and that, unfortunately, whether

00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:46.341
you are listening to this episode at 8pm on a Friday evening, or at 8am on a Tuesday

00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:52.261
morning, there will be someone, somewhere in the UK, who is drunk in a public place.

00:06:53.671 --> 00:07:01.141
I should say that this law isn’t really enforced in the UK, but what is illegal, and

00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:06.111
what you would get punished for, is something called being ‘drunk and disorderly’.

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:10.837
Essentially this is being drunk in public and causing trouble.

00:07:11.677 --> 00:07:15.437
But of course, as a loyal member of Leonardo English, I’m sure that

00:07:15.447 --> 00:07:19.187
you are unlikely to be drunk and disorderly on the streets of the UK.

00:07:20.687 --> 00:07:24.947
And we have just one more slightly strange law relating to alcohol.

00:07:25.847 --> 00:07:28.697
Naturally, like almost every country in the world,

00:07:29.027 --> 00:07:32.097
it is against the law to be drunk and drive a car.

00:07:33.117 --> 00:07:36.187
Obviously, this makes a lot of sense, and I’m certainly

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:38.837
not saying that this is strange or ridiculous.

00:07:39.757 --> 00:07:45.627
But did you know that it is also illegal to be drunk and ride a horse?

00:07:47.137 --> 00:07:53.947
This law came in along with the one about being drunk in public, in the Licensing Act of 1872.

00:07:54.947 --> 00:08:02.167
It states that it is an offence to be drunk in charge of a “carriage, horse, cow or steam engine.”

00:08:03.207 --> 00:08:06.257
So a carriage, just to explain that quickly, is the

00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:09.657
four wheeled vehicle that would be pulled by a horse.

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:13.547
And a steam engine means, essentially, an old train.

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:20.567
Luckily these two things are not really in use any more, but if you were thinking about

00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:25.967
having a few drinks and then riding a horse, think again - you’re breaking the law.

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:30.566
Our next law is one that, if you have been to London, you might have broken.

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:34.763
Certainly I've witnessed many tourists breaking this law.

00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:41.167
You might know that forming a queue, making a line when you are

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:45.337
waiting for something, is almost part of the DNA of Britain.

00:08:46.457 --> 00:08:51.847
We are exceptionally good at making queues, and whereas in other countries

00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:56.797
it often seems like there is a mad rush to get to the front of the line,

00:08:57.137 --> 00:09:03.397
and people push past each other, in the UK we like to form an orderly queue.

00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:11.767
But what you might not have known is that, when it comes to the laws of TfL, Transport for London,

00:09:12.027 --> 00:09:19.807
which administers the underground network, there is a specific regulation relating to queues.

00:09:21.307 --> 00:09:26.877
If you are directed to join a queue by an authorised person at TfL, Transport

00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:32.037
for London, you must join the end of the queue and obey their instructions.

00:09:33.047 --> 00:09:36.337
It’s not just that in London we don’t like queue-jumpers,

00:09:36.857 --> 00:09:40.317
it’s the law, or at least, the by-law of TfL.

00:09:41.817 --> 00:09:45.847
Now, this has so far been a little bit of a silly episode.

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:52.637
Of course, the UK has some ridiculous laws that should probably be fixed, or at least updated.

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:58.287
They make little sense, are often ignored, and are just confusing.

00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:04.797
However, it is not just the UK that is guilty of having strange and mysterious

00:10:04.817 --> 00:10:10.747
laws, and all over the world there are laws that are, well, unorthodox.

00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:17.997
In the small Pacific state of Samoa, it is illegal for a man to forget his wife’s birthday.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:23.087
It’s not quite clear what the sentence is, what the punishment would

00:10:23.087 --> 00:10:28.337
be if a man did forget his wife’s birthday, but it is there in the law.

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:34.607
As a loyal husband of course, I can’t imagine ever forgetting my wife’s birthday, although I

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:42.287
hear for some men it can be an issue… In France, it is actually legal to marry a dead person.

00:10:43.297 --> 00:10:47.567
This might sound weird, but it does actually make some sense.

00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:54.127
It was first passed after the First World War, to allow the girlfriends of men

00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:59.507
who were killed in the war to marry them posthumously, after they were dead, so

00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:04.927
that these girlfriends, or now wives, could receive death benefits from the state.

00:11:04.927 --> 00:11:10.377
Since then though, the law around it has been tightened up a little.

00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:13.987
Now, if you want to marry a dead person, you need

00:11:13.997 --> 00:11:17.417
to get express permission from the French president.

00:11:18.917 --> 00:11:25.227
And apparently only 1 in 4 requests are actually allowed, which is also slightly strange.

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:31.417
And going to Italy, there was a story going around about 15 years ago

00:11:31.727 --> 00:11:36.807
that the local government of Turin had put in place a law saying that

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:41.857
if you owned a dog, you needed to walk it at least 3 times a day.

00:11:43.207 --> 00:11:47.757
However, despite this story seeming to be all over the global

00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:52.307
news, it appears to be fake, or at least, now it's not true.

00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:58.997
I spent about half an hour combing through the Turin local government legislation so you

00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:04.407
don’t have to, and there is nothing about dogs needing to be walked three times a day.

00:12:05.477 --> 00:12:10.317
Not that your dog wouldn’t appreciate it, of course, it’s just not against the law.

00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:17.577
There are, actually, a load of laws that people think are true, that just aren’t.

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:22.367
They make for funny little news articles, or moderately

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:26.647
amusing little podcast episodes, but a lot of them aren’t true.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:33.287
There is a rumour in the UK that killing a swan is treason, which isn’t true.

00:12:33.737 --> 00:12:37.967
It was considered treason, but the law was changed in 1998.

00:12:39.207 --> 00:12:42.997
There’s another rumour that the law states that a pregnant

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:47.077
woman can urinate, she can pee, in a policeman’s hat.

00:12:47.747 --> 00:12:48.927
That’s not true either.

00:12:50.377 --> 00:12:55.517
There’s a rumour that it is illegal to die in the Houses of Parliament, and that

00:12:55.517 --> 00:13:01.107
you are somehow punished after you die if you happen to pass away inside them.

00:13:01.717 --> 00:13:03.097
That is not true either.

00:13:04.497 --> 00:13:08.817
And there’s another rumour, which I have to confess, I thought was true

00:13:09.027 --> 00:13:14.167
until I did my research, that it was still legal to kill a Scotsman,

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:19.257
a man from Scotland, within the city walls of the town of York.

00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:23.547
Sorry to disappoint you - that’s not true either.

00:13:25.127 --> 00:13:30.917
At least in the UK, there is a bit of an effort to try to ‘clean up’ the

00:13:31.057 --> 00:13:36.547
law, to try to remove old, pointless legislation that no longer applies.

00:13:37.347 --> 00:13:43.607
But of course this is less of a priority than adding new laws for new technologies

00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:50.637
and new possibilities that didn’t exist 100 years ago - from what happens if you fly

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:56.448
a drone over an airport to what happens to cross-border cryptocurrency transactions.

00:13:57.468 --> 00:14:02.948
Obviously, these are more important than clarifying the law around alcohol and

00:14:02.948 --> 00:14:09.138
horses, or updating the law on what ‘handling salmon suspiciously’ really means.

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:15.144
There are, probably, some incredibly weird laws that very few people

00:14:15.344 --> 00:14:20.764
even know exist, and nobody has even thought to repeal, to get rid of.

00:14:21.814 --> 00:14:27.484
In fact, until the year 1960, it was technically required by law in the

00:14:27.484 --> 00:14:34.104
United Kingdom that every man between the age of 17 and 60 was required

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:39.994
to keep a longbow, those long bows that you use to fire arrows from.

00:14:41.174 --> 00:14:46.864
The Unlawful Games Act of the year 1541 required this, and

00:14:46.864 --> 00:14:51.194
said that every man needed to practise archery regularly.

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:57.894
This was kept in place for 400 years, and it was only repealed 60 years

00:14:57.894 --> 00:15:02.804
ago, centuries after people had actually stopped practising archery.

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:09.609
Shortly after they got rid of this law, the UK set up something called the The

00:15:09.614 --> 00:15:15.514
Law Commission, which was tasked with modernising the law; updating laws that

00:15:15.784 --> 00:15:20.744
need modernising, and getting rid of outdated laws that are no longer relevant.

00:15:22.244 --> 00:15:27.134
It has got rid of over 2,000 different laws so far, but

00:15:27.164 --> 00:15:30.954
it seems that there is still a bit more work to be done.

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:38.654
OK then, that is it for this little look at some of the strangest laws in the UK.

00:15:39.504 --> 00:15:43.314
I’ve certainly learned a lot researching this, and I hope you have too.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:48.764
And we both now know that the next time we want to have a few drinks and ride

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:54.604
a horse, we fancy killing a swan, or we want to push past in the queue to

00:15:54.604 --> 00:16:00.210
get our tube ticket, you and I both know those things are against the law.

00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:04.999
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:07.999
What strange laws do you have in your country?

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:13.369
Surely there must be some fun ones from where you live that nobody else knows about.

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:17.939

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:16.915
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:21.465
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:28.285
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Industrial Revolution.

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:35.065
There are few events in history that have had such a transformational impact on the world

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:40.855
we live in, and it is hard to overestimate the importance of The Industrial Revolution.

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:47.566
So today we are going to talk about what actually happened, why it happened first in

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:54.136
Britain, what its impact was on society and people at the time, as well as now, with

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:59.586
the aim that this will help us better understand the present, as well as the future.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.306
This episode has been incredibly interesting to make,

00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:06.296
and I’m thrilled to be sharing it with you today.

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:13.946
It’s also going to be the first of a three-part mini series on The Age of Revolution - part

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:19.806
two will be The American Revolution, and part three will be on The French Revolution.

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:26.816
And, for the members among you, the bonus episode before this was on The Enlightenment, a knowledge

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:32.766
of which can be really helpful when it comes to understanding all of these three revolutions.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:39.016
Before we get right into today’s episode, let me just quickly remind you that you can get

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:44.906
all of the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:50.736
this episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:55.506
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:55.706 --> 00:02:00.986
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:06.056
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:10.116
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:14.096
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.686
OK then, The Industrial Revolution.

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:25.346
What was it, how did it start, what actually happened, who was affected, and how,

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:30.346
and what can it tell us about the world we live in right now, and the world our

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:35.356
children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren will live in in years to come?

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:42.696
There are some big questions there, but let’s start with one that crops up quite frequently, one

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:48.876
that we hear quite frequently, and is important to the nature of this mini series on ‘revolution’.

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:53.246
And that question is “was The Industrial Revolution

00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:58.026
actually a revolution?” or was it an “evolution”?

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:04.396
Certainly, there was no one great military event, no storming of

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:09.206
the Bastille, no battles, no overthrowing of the ruling class.

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:14.696
And there was not one single definite start date, or end date.

00:03:15.316 --> 00:03:20.956
It was, compared to many other revolutions, quite gradual, and indeed

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:26.726
historians don’t agree on exactly when it started and ended in Great Britain.

00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:31.906
Most agree that it started somewhere in the mid 18th

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:36.666
century, and went on until around the mid 19th century.

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:43.226
So, it wasn’t an overthrow of a government, it wasn’t a rebellion led by the people,

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:48.676
and therefore there are arguments to be made that it wasn’t really a revolution at all.

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:51.676
It was much more of an evolution.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:59.056
But if we think of a revolution as being a huge, seismic shift in society, a

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:05.096
complete change in the way things worked, there are arguably few revolutions

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:10.046
more deserving of the term ‘revolution’ than The Industrial Revolution.

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:16.756
Over the space of around 100 years Britain, as the first country that was

00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:22.906
undergoing this shift, was irreversibly changed, and with it, the world.

00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:29.456
People living in the early 18th century lived a very similar day-to-day

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:35.600
life to people who had lived 100, 500, even 1000 years before them.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.020
The relationship that most people had with the land was a close one.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.910
Most people lived in villages, in the countryside, and worked in agriculture.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.850
The food you ate came from the land around you.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.280
The clothes you wore were made by someone in your village, or perhaps you even made them.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.500
The products you engaged with were limited, there wasn’t a huge amount that someone had in

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.670
1750 that was so massively different to what someone might have had a thousand years before.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.190
Yet just 100 years later, everything had changed.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.720
There had been mass migration to the cities, and for the first time

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.400
in history over half the British population lived in urban areas.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.750
Instead of working in the fields, people worked in factories or in mines.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.420
Instead of people making their own clothes, they were produced in a factory.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.460
Instead of living your life by the seasons and the weather, you lived it by a clock.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.590
There were huge productivity gains, things got so much more efficient, that The

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.720
Industrial Revolution allowed people to do so much more with so much less stuff.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.390
From better machines that could produce more cotton through to inventions

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.850
like the steam engine, Britain turned from a society where people had spent

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.900
most of their lives working with their hands through to one where they worked

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.590
with machines to achieve results that were so much greater than before.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.580
And The Industrial Revolution is the story of what actually happened.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.590
Now, today’s episode isn’t going to go into huge detail on the inventions that

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.940
propelled The Industrial Revolution forward, because there are too many to name, and

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.180
there wasn’t one single invention, it was more of a case of continual improvement.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.850
The most common inventions that you probably associate with The

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.800
Industrial Revolution would be the steam engine, textile factories,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.520
and machines that helped people make things in a more efficient way.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.440
But there are two points that are particularly worthy of note, two particularly

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.650
important points, when it comes to the inventions that enabled the Industrial Revolution.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.280
Firstly, there was no one single invention, no one

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.810
thing that is responsible for The Industrial Revolution.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.550
If we take the example of the steam engine, the first

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.930
instance of the steam engine was actually in the 17th century.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.350
Then throughout the 18th century it was improved and improved, inventors looked for

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.970
ways to make it more efficient, and through trial and error, it got better and better.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.840
By 1778, when the Englishman James Watt showed his new and improved version of

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.450
the steam engine, it was about 5 times more efficient than the previous one.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.660
And although Watt is credited with inventing the steam engine, his version was far

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.880
from the final one, and he spent his entire life working on improving his invention.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.590
And the second point is just how much more efficient the inventions

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.720
of The Industrial Revolution were, compared to the status quo.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:29.110
This wasn’t that difficult to do, as the status quo was, for the main part, people working by hand.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.270
Throughout history, people had laboured with their own muscle, their own bodies.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.030
Then, we enlisted some animals to help, from horses to

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.970
carry heavy stuff to oxen to pull ploughs in the fields.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.540
But we were reliant on animal strength.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.220
The inventions of the Industrial Revolution enlisted the help

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.070
of machines, and this caused a huge leap in productivity.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:05.020
When it comes to the textile industry, the amount of cotton a worker could process

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:11.028
was increased by a factor of 500 when the steam-powered cotton spinning machine

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:17.278
was invented, these spinning machines could produce 500 times what a person could.

00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:25.408
And even simpler, non-mechanical things like canals caused huge improvements in productivity.

00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:32.278
Now, canals have existed throughout history, they aren’t unique to The Industrial Revolution.

00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:38.994
They are useful when it comes to transporting large amounts of heavy goods within a country,

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:45.454
as it’s obviously a lot easier to transport something on water than to pull it on land.

00:09:46.394 --> 00:09:52.994
But in a society that doesn’t have the ability to mass produce stuff, canals aren’t

00:09:53.004 --> 00:09:57.407
really that useful, because you don’t need to transport large amounts of goods.

00:09:58.017 --> 00:10:03.027
Suddenly, when you have factories that can produce vast amounts of goods,

00:10:03.217 --> 00:10:07.987
being able to take them to different places to sell becomes important.

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:13.837
And to do this, Britain built thousands of miles of canals, which

00:10:13.837 --> 00:10:17.957
were full of boats transporting goods to and from the factories.

00:10:18.997 --> 00:10:21.661
And why were these canals important?

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:28.031
Because it meant that the same amount of goods could be transported by just one man

00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:34.651
and a horse as it would take at least 100 horses carrying them on their backs by road.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:41.501
So the point to remember here is that these weren’t small productivity

00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:47.351
gains, it wasn’t a case of things getting 20, 30 or 50 percent better,

00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:53.331
things got 50, 100, or 500 times better, in terms of productivity at least.

00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:59.951
Producing stuff became so much easier, every person could produce

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:04.111
more of it, because of all of these fantastic technological advances.

00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:11.361
Now, if you are thinking that this meant people would be out of work because machines were now

00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:16.801
doing their jobs, you actually couldn’t be further from the truth, you couldn't be more wrong.

00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:23.491
In Britain The Industrial Revolution actually caused a boom in the demand for

00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:28.911
labour, so that there was an increase in average wages, people were paid more.

00:11:30.027 --> 00:11:36.371
Before The Industrial Revolution work had been primarily agricultural - most people

00:11:36.371 --> 00:11:42.761
would work on the land, growing crops, raising animals, and not doing a huge amount else.

00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:48.881
There would be - what's called - cottage industries, many women would make clothes

00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:54.771
at home, but working life was based around what you needed to make to survive.

00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:00.491
With The Industrial Revolution, there were suddenly huge factories that

00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:05.811
sprung up in the cities, offering higher pay, more money, and fixed hours.

00:12:06.471 --> 00:12:10.261
People flocked to the cities in droves, especially the

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.881
northern English cities with large textile industries.

00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:17.981
And the populations of these cities swelled.

00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:24.331
Manchester grew from 20,000 people in the 1750s through to

00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:29.821
400,000 people 100 years later, an increase of 20 times.

00:12:30.691 --> 00:12:34.971
Birmingham had 71,000 people in 1801.

00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:40.251
Within 40 years the population had doubled to 140,000, and just

00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:47.671
20 years later it had more than doubled again, to 296,000 people.

00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:54.001
And in England alone, from 1750 to 1850 the population

00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.751
nearly tripled, it increased by a factor of three.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:04.451
This alone was a really interesting phenomenon, as philosophers and economists

00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:09.531
had believed that a population couldn’t continue growing and growing, because

00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:15.101
it would run out of food, then the poorest would die, and the population would

00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:20.491
revert to its correct level, it would go back to the right amount of people.

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:27.001
The leading proponent of this theory was an Englishman called Thomas Malthus,

00:13:27.061 --> 00:13:32.491
and it’s from him that we get the idea of the Malthusian catastrophe.

00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:36.831
Malthus believed that the country wouldn’t be able to

00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:40.101
produce enough food to feed its growing population.

00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:45.171
The population of Britain continued to grow and grow, but the country

00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:49.511
didn’t run out of food, its people didn’t starve, and although the

00:13:49.641 --> 00:13:53.938
rate of growth has slowed, it hasn’t stopped growing ever since.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:58.438
The mistake Malthus made was to assume that there was

00:13:58.448 --> 00:14:01.948
a limited amount of food that the land could produce.

00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:10.378
In fact, improvements in agricultural technology meant that crop yields increased, that the land

00:14:10.378 --> 00:14:17.268
could produce much more food, and there wasn’t some huge food crisis that meant that people starved.

00:14:18.097 --> 00:14:21.377
At the same time, there were great improvements with

00:14:21.437 --> 00:14:25.317
infant mortality, so fewer and fewer babies were dying.

00:14:26.007 --> 00:14:31.157
The result of this was this huge increase in population, and a demographic

00:14:31.187 --> 00:14:37.495
shift in the population, where children now made up the largest part.

00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:44.516
To be precise, in 1826, 40% of the entire population of Britain

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:46.524
was under 15 years old.

00:14:46.524 --> 00:14:47.527
For reference,

00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:50.097
now it’s around 13%.

00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:55.667
These children, as you will probably know, were instrumental in The Industrial Revolution.

00:14:56.027 --> 00:14:59.137
They worked in the coal mines, and in the factories.

00:14:59.447 --> 00:15:03.177
They worked 12 hour days, being taken out of school by

00:15:03.177 --> 00:15:06.827
their parents, and were put to work from a very young age.

00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:13.567
When it comes to criticisms of The Industrial Revolution, one thing that is often

00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:20.447
pointed at is child labour, that it is hideously cruel to put a child to work

00:15:20.457 --> 00:15:26.787
in a factory, where they would spend their days doing mindless work at best, or

00:15:26.887 --> 00:15:33.447
at worst, they might lose a finger, a hand, or die, either through industrial

00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:38.727
accidents or through diseases by breathing in poisonous air in the factories.

00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:42.587
Of course, a factory is no place for a child.

00:15:43.117 --> 00:15:48.577
But what most people don’t necessarily think about is that children were put to

00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:53.227
work before The Industrial Revolution, they were just doing different things.

00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:56.877
They would have been working in the fields, or at home.

00:15:57.297 --> 00:16:03.237
Their working conditions might not have been much better, and if they were working for

00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:08.365
their parents, they would probably have been working unpaid, or at least not directly paid.

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:12.435
The major change that happened during The Industrial

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:16.525
Revolution was the types of work that children could do.

00:16:17.525 --> 00:16:22.315
Given that a large amount of factory work was unskilled, it didn't

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:26.885
require particular knowledge and it also didn't require strength, it

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:31.427
could be done by children, who could be paid much less than adults.

00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:36.887
Instead of paying 10 adult men to do a job, you could

00:16:36.887 --> 00:16:40.747
pay 10 children, and pay one adult to look over them.

00:16:41.737 --> 00:16:47.127
And given the fact that factory work was indoors, it didn’t rely on the

00:16:47.127 --> 00:16:52.177
weather, and it could happen at any time of the day, working days were

00:16:52.187 --> 00:16:57.767
very long, with children often working 12 hour days in terrible conditions.

00:16:58.707 --> 00:17:03.397
So, although you might have had a better chance of surviving past

00:17:03.487 --> 00:17:08.317
infanthood, The Industrial Revolution wasn’t a great time to be a child.

00:17:09.073 --> 00:17:11.777
It also wasn’t a great time to be a woman.

00:17:12.487 --> 00:17:17.647
Before The Industrial Revolution, in an agricultural society, women

00:17:17.657 --> 00:17:22.207
had enjoyed a similar kind of status to men when it came to work.

00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:27.577
The men might work in the fields, but women would do all of the housework,

00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:32.777
they might make or repair clothes, and there was a kind of equality

00:17:32.777 --> 00:17:37.827
of work, both women and men did work of similar levels of importance.

00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:43.847
And given that women worked at home, they could continue to work after having children.

00:17:44.547 --> 00:17:49.247
I guess you could claim that an agricultural society was the original

00:17:49.297 --> 00:17:53.597
work from home, and work-life balance that people talk about today.

00:17:54.637 --> 00:17:59.287
Yet when the Industrial Revolution arrived and people went to the

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:03.587
factories, this caused a shift in the way society was structured.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:10.257
A woman might work in a factory as a child, or as young, unmarried woman

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:15.211
but as soon as she got married and had children, it was very difficult for

00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:20.331
her to continue to work, and to continue to have any sort of independence.

00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:25.881
The husband would continue to work, and given that he would be paid quite well,

00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:31.721
compared to agricultural work, there was suddenly a big imbalance of earnings.

00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:35.471
Women were expected to stay at home and look after

00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:39.041
children, while the man went out and earned all the money.

00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:44.391
To many people now, this might not sound all that radical, but it

00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:48.621
was a large shift in the balance of power between men and women.

00:18:49.271 --> 00:18:53.931
Now, we’ve covered some of the inventions of the Industrial Revolution, as well

00:18:53.931 --> 00:18:59.251
as some of the impacts it had on society, but the one pressing question that

00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:04.561
you might still have is “why did it happen when it did, and why in Britain?”.

00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:11.811
That’s an excellent question, and one that historians now still aren’t in complete agreement on.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.441
And it’s not one single factor, but a combination of

00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:20.231
several things, many of which are related to one another.

00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:24.321
To begin with, Britain has lots of coal.

00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:29.451
The machines of the Industrial Revolution were powered by coal, and being

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:35.211
able to dig down and literally take the stuff out of the ground is an

00:19:35.211 --> 00:19:40.281
advantage that many countries, for example neighbouring France, didn’t have.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:46.451
Secondly, Britain was going through a pretty stable period politically.

00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:55.151
Just over 100 years before the start of the Industrial Revolution, in 1649, Britain had gone through

00:19:55.191 --> 00:20:02.674
a traumatic and bloody civil war, which ended with the public execution of its king, Charles I.

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:08.761
Since then, it had enjoyed a period of relative domestic peace.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.541
Peace is good for business, unless you’re a weapons dealer,

00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:17.071
and these stable conditions encouraged people to invest.

00:20:18.041 --> 00:20:22.551
Thirdly, and a related point, is that Britain had its empire,

00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:27.391
which came in very useful in terms of things like importing cotton.

00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:32.951
It had also meant that there were a lot of people in Britain with a lot of money

00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:37.991
to invest in things like new technologies, which ties in with the next point.

00:20:38.551 --> 00:20:45.161
And that is because the political climate in Britain was very entrepreneurial, and the

00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:51.321
government encouraged entrepreneurs and inventors in Britain to just get on with it, really.

00:20:52.081 --> 00:20:56.981
When compared to the attitude of the French, for example, the British

00:20:57.001 --> 00:21:02.351
government didn’t really interfere with inventors, whereas the French

00:21:02.451 --> 00:21:07.331
wanted new inventions to be standardised, and managed by the government.

00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:12.081
And finally, point number five is that Britain had an excellent

00:21:12.091 --> 00:21:17.261
system of ports and canals, which makes moving goods around very easy.

00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:21.941
These are some of the main reasons that it was able to start, but

00:21:22.071 --> 00:21:26.701
once it got going it was clear that there was enormous opportunity,

00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:31.661
and that these changes were irreversible, there was no going back.

00:21:32.551 --> 00:21:36.971
Working conditions in the factories might have been pretty awful, but

00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:42.331
earning a secure wage and having enough food on the table was preferable

00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:46.481
to working in the fields and going hungry if there was a bad harvest.

00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:52.011
And one final interesting thing about The Industrial Revolution, which I

00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:56.831
think is particularly relevant to us today, is that at the time that all of

00:21:56.831 --> 00:22:01.731
this was happening, not everyone knew quite how significant it was to be.

00:22:02.541 --> 00:22:09.201
Indeed, the term Industrial Revolution first appeared in 1799, but only

00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:15.731
became commonly used in the late 1830s, about 80 years after it had started.

00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:21.261
And that begs the question of today, tomorrow, and the future.

00:22:22.101 --> 00:22:27.271
There is often talk of us being in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution.

00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:33.546
The first is the one we’ve been talking about, the second was the period just before World War I,

00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:39.351
with the standardisation of industrial production, and the development of things like the railways.

00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:44.921
Then the third industrial revolution, or The Digital Revolution, is the use

00:22:44.941 --> 00:22:50.351
of computers and information technology, starting in the 1940s and 1950s.

00:22:50.851 --> 00:22:55.451
And then today is, or could be, the fourth Industrial Revolution.

00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.931
But as was the case during the first, second, and third industrial revolutions,

00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:07.611
it’s not clear whether this is actually a revolution, and if it is, it’s not

00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:12.131
exactly clear what the most important inventions to come out of it will be.

00:23:12.781 --> 00:23:14.221
Artificial Intelligence?

00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:15.691
Blockchain technologies?

00:23:16.281 --> 00:23:17.181
3D printing?

00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:20.901
Perhaps something that the vast majority of people have never

00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:24.851
heard of, or perhaps something that nobody has even invented yet.

00:23:25.591 --> 00:23:30.791
Of course, nobody can predict the future, but it is fascinating to think about the

00:23:30.841 --> 00:23:36.341
kind of seismic shifts in society that were caused by The Industrial Revolution,

00:23:36.801 --> 00:23:42.381
and to ask oneself whether revolutions of the future will cause similar shifts.

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:48.191
When it comes to questions like the extent to which artificial intelligence will

00:23:48.211 --> 00:23:53.801
replace our jobs, is this going to be a huge change for society, where hundreds

00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:59.321
of millions, or even billions, of people are just redundant, replaced by robots?

00:23:59.761 --> 00:24:04.481
Or do we look at the example of The Industrial Revolution and say that

00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:09.511
people had exactly the same fears back then, but society developed,

00:24:09.931 --> 00:24:13.741
new jobs were created, and everyone’s standards of living increased?

00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:20.451
I’ll let you answer that question for yourself, but what is undeniable is that the society

00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:25.021
we all live in today wouldn’t have been possible without The Industrial Revolution.

00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:31.921
Whether you live in Birmingham or Bogota, Manchester or Moscow, Liverpool or Lima, for

00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:37.051
better or worse, the world you live in today was shaped by The Industrial Revolution.

00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:44.701
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Industrial Revolution.

00:24:45.061 --> 00:24:49.241
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that it’s

00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:55.041
made you think a little bit more about how society develops, and some of the reasons why.

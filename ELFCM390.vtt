Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:15.516
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:19.516
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:24.996
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Edward VIII.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:32.346
He was King of Britain, but only for 325 days, before dramatically,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.726
scandalously, quitting the job to be with the woman he loved.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:44.986
For some, it is the ultimate love story, for others it is one of treason and selfishness.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:51.556
So, in the next twenty minutes or so we are going to explore the life and times of Edward VIII.

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:56.466
We’ll meet glamorous Americans, extramarital affairs, Prime Ministers,

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:02.266
Hitler and Mussolini, kidnap plots, sacrifice, bitterness and betrayal.

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:08.563
OK then, Edward VIII, the King Who Said No.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:16.123
Since the first king of England, back in the year 827, a grand

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:21.433
total of 62 people have held the title of king or queen of England.

00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:24.703
It is the most exclusive job in the country.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:29.683
You get access to huge riches, palaces, cars, servants,

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:33.066
all the worldly possessions you could ever wish for.

00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:39.321
For centuries, people would go to war to try to become king or queen, with

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:44.731
countless lives lost over different people’s quests to sit on the British throne.

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:52.931
But on December 12th, of 1936, to a stunned British public, the

00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:58.221
then British king Edward VIII released this message on the BBC:

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:07.925
a few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:09.666
He went on:

00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:20.666
But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:27.746
carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:37.076
as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:46.427
He used some slightly old-fashioned language there, but to translate this into more plain English,

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:53.037
he said “I have decided to stop being king, because I can’t be king without the woman I love”.

00:02:54.387 --> 00:03:01.147
In so doing, he became the first and, to date, only British monarch to give up the job.

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:07.567
So, to better understand how it got to this point, and then learn about what he

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:12.027
would spend the rest of his life doing, we need to go right back to the start.

00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:17.848
Like many royals, King Edward VIII had a lot of names.

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:22.748
His name was Edward Albert Christian George Andrew

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:25.868
Patrick David, which would have been quite a mouthful.

00:03:26.568 --> 00:03:32.029
His family called him “David”, but we’ll use his public name, “Edward”.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.879
He was born in 1894, still during the reign of his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria.

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.039
Shortly before his 16th birthday his father, George V, became king,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.269
making Edward first in line to the throne, and meaning he automatically

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.279
became the Duke of Cornwall, the title held by Prince William today.

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.899
A month later, he was made Prince of Wales, in preparation for the

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:06.919
inevitable, his eventual accession to the British throne, becoming king.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:13.444
He studied at Oxford University, although this was not due to any great academic

00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:18.174
excellence, and indeed, he left with no academic qualifications whatsoever.

00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:22.974
The only thing he did seem to learn there was how to play polo.

00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:28.864
He served in the First World War, far from the front line, of course, although

00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:33.304
he did visit the trenches and see the horrors endured by his contemporaries,

00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:37.704
the young men who were forced to live and die in squalor in the name of war.

00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:43.424
This experience clearly left a mark on him, and will come back

00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:46.764
to play an important part in his political views later on.

00:04:48.224 --> 00:04:53.084
With war over, and returning to England, he developed a reputation

00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:57.824
as something of a dandy, a handsome and eligible bachelor.

00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:04.284
He had multiple affairs with a series of married women, he would be seen dashing around on

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:10.434
the polo pitch, and was generally having a good time as an eligible young heir in waiting.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.150
At this point he was exceptionally popular, well-liked by the British public.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.910
One person who didn’t like him very much, or at least didn’t approve

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.980
of his behaviour, was the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.910
The young Prince of Wales was gadding around Europe, having sexual affairs

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.790
with married women, writing love letters that could come back to haunt him,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.220
and, most importantly not doing the one thing that a young prince was meant

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.010
to do: finding an eligible bride, getting married and producing an heir.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.440
Edward's father, King George V seemed to share the Prime Minister’s concerns, once

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.950
declaring about his son "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months."

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.090
How right he would be…

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.270
This ruin, if indeed we can call it a “ruin”, all began in 1930.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.680
An American lady called Lady Furness, who was married to a British aristocrat and was

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.970
a lover of Edward’s, introduced him to a fellow American, a lady called Wallis Simpson.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.400
With her dark hair and bright red lipstick, Edward was

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.000
immediately smitten, it seemed to be love at first sight.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.870
Now, it is impossible to tell the story of Edward VIII without mentioning Wallis

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.673
Simpson, so let me tell you a little bit about her life before she met Edward.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.400
She was born in Baltimore, in the United States in 1896, almost to the day two years after Edward.

00:06:55.841 --> 00:07:00.931
Her father died suddenly after she was born, and with her mother unable

00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:05.231
to support her financially, the pair went to live with wealthy relatives.

00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:09.241
She was clearly an impressive young lady.

00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:14.731
She was driven and intelligent, and appeared to have grand ambitions.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.170
She got married young to a military pilot, but it was an unhappy marriage to

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.870
an alcoholic and distant husband who was constantly abroad with the airforce.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.520
It was during this marriage that she found love, but not with her husband.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:36.629
She had a series of affairs, first with an Argentine diplomat.

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.689
Then, while living in China where her husband was posted, she

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:45.279
had an affair with a man who would become Mussolini’s son-in-law.

00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:51.446
During this affair she reportedly fell pregnant and had an abortion in

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:55.856
an operation that sadly left her infertile, unable to have children.

00:07:57.136 --> 00:08:02.216
If this rumour is indeed true, its relevance will become clear in a few minutes' time.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:08.256
And one language-related anecdote about Wallis Simpson, one that perhaps gives you

00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:13.606
an insight into her character, is that she spent a whole year living in China but

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:19.626
reportedly the only Chinese she managed to learn was "Boy, pass me the champagne".

00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:24.116
Whether that’s true or not, I cannot tell you, but it gives you

00:08:24.116 --> 00:08:28.276
some idea of the public perception of the kind of person she was.

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:35.505
Her first marriage ended in 1927, by which time she was already romantically

00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:40.165
involved with another married man, an Anglo-American shipping executive

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:44.395
called Ernest Simpson who had divorced his wife to be with Wallis.

00:08:45.655 --> 00:08:49.865
Wallis Simpson, as she had become, was then living the high life.

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:55.185
A house in Mayfair, the most fashionable and expensive district of London, a blank

00:08:55.215 --> 00:09:01.015
chequebook to buy anything she wanted, and a fleet of servants to attend to her every need.

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:09.205
And then in 1930, three years into her second marriage, she was introduced to Edward, the

00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:14.805
Prince of Wales, introduced, by the way, by a married friend that he was having an affair with.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:19.835
Don’t worry if it’s getting a little difficult to follow who is having an affair with

00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:25.245
who - essentially everyone is romantically involved with someone they aren’t married to.

00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:30.205
The only person who isn’t married, in fact, is Edward.

00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:37.045
It doesn’t take long for Edward to grow closer and closer to this new American, Wallis Simpson.

00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:42.335
They start to spend more and more time together, despite her still being

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:47.115
married to her second husband, Ernest Simpson and Edward still being in

00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:51.295
a relationship with Lady Furness, who was still married to her husband.

00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:53.055
I told you it was confusing.

00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:58.575
The relationship between Edward and Wallis was kept secret from the British

00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:03.915
public, and initially he tried to keep it secret even from his own family.

00:10:05.408 --> 00:10:09.918
When his father found out, he was deeply disapproving of the match.

00:10:10.918 --> 00:10:15.088
Wallis was not only not of royal blood, of aristocratic

00:10:15.108 --> 00:10:18.188
heritage, she had already been married twice.

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:22.588
The king most likely didn’t know this, but she was also

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:25.538
not able to bear children after her botched abortion.

00:10:27.097 --> 00:10:31.097
She was not the type of woman a future British monarch should be marrying.

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:35.107
Edward’s father didn’t have a huge amount of time to be

00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:39.520
cross about this, though, as he died in January of 1936.

00:10:40.717 --> 00:10:46.527
The throne immediately passed to his eldest son, the then 41-year-old Prince Edward.

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:52.687
Prince Edward became King Edward VIII, but he had no intentions

00:10:52.687 --> 00:10:55.867
of breaking things off with the still married Wallis Simpson.

00:10:57.317 --> 00:11:03.477
Amazingly, perhaps, in the modern era of gossip magazines and obsession about every last movement

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:09.327
of the royals, the British press were aware of but did not heavily publicise the relationship.

00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:14.357
In fact, it was better known in the United States than in Britain.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:20.317
And the British establishment did everything it possibly could to keep the scandal

00:11:20.337 --> 00:11:25.857
shut, the scandal that the King was in a relationship with a divorced American.

00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:30.947
Extraordinary lengths were gone to, with one report even claiming that

00:11:30.987 --> 00:11:36.317
American newspapers and magazines were removed, or all bought up, from London

00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:40.697
newsstands, so that the story wouldn’t become known to the British people.

00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:47.717
But the story couldn’t be kept quiet forever, and the new king needed to make a choice.

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:51.207
He needed to marry and produce an heir.

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:56.877
The woman he loved and wanted to marry, however, was deeply problematic.

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:02.787
Firstly, the British monarch is also head of the Church of England.

00:12:03.917 --> 00:12:08.057
Until 2002, the Church of England didn’t allow divorced

00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:11.777
people to remarry if their previous partner was still alive.

00:12:12.717 --> 00:12:17.677
Both of Wallis Simpson’s previous husbands were still alive, so if Edward

00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:22.777
married her he would be going directly against the regulations of his own Church.

00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:27.757
Secondly, there was the question of how the public

00:12:27.757 --> 00:12:30.877
would react to the King marrying a twice-divorced woman.

00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:37.377
Divorce was still somewhat taboo, it wasn't socially accepted, and

00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:41.817
questions were raised over Wallis’ character if she had been divorced

00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:45.767
already, and would need to get divorced again to marry Edward.

00:12:47.327 --> 00:12:49.147
But Edward had an idea.

00:12:49.907 --> 00:12:54.587
He went to the British Prime Minister and proposed something called a morganatic

00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:59.597
marriage, which would allow him to marry Wallis but would mean that she wouldn’t become

00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:05.137
an official queen, and any children they might have wouldn’t become heirs to the throne.

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:10.597
The Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, agreed to ask his cabinet, and

00:13:10.687 --> 00:13:13.877
the Prime Ministers of the other Dominions of which Edward was king.

00:13:15.267 --> 00:13:17.287
Their response was definitive.

00:13:17.973 --> 00:13:21.867
Edward’s proposal of a morganatic marriage, or any kind

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:25.617
of marriage to Wallis Simpson, was soundly rejected.

00:13:26.377 --> 00:13:30.017
Edward could not marry Wallis and remain king.

00:13:30.947 --> 00:13:32.377
The choice was clear.

00:13:32.817 --> 00:13:36.967
Leave Wallis, or abdicate, stop being king.

00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:42.367
For Edward, he was completely obsessed with Wallis, he

00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:46.567
couldn’t imagine life without her, and his mind was made up.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:50.117
Love must come above duty.

00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:52.037
He was going to abdicate.

00:13:53.387 --> 00:13:57.717
When Wallis found out about this, she was reportedly horrified,

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:02.254
and immediately told Edward that the pair should split.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.060
The Crown must come above any affairs of the heart.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.560
Now, there is another theory that she was still in love with a previous

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.870
lover, a man called Herman Rogers, and in fact she tried to use this crisis

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.760
as a way of leaving Edward, but that is not the way that things panned out.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.030
Without any way of resolving the situation, Edward stunned the country by announcing that he

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:35.592
would abdicate the throne, passing it to his brother “Bertie”, who would become King George VI.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.180
That was the message you heard at the start of the

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.710
episode, which was broadcast on December 12th, of 1936.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.270
But what happens when a king abdicates?

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.230
What happens to an ex-king?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.940
It was a question the country had never had to ask itself before?

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.760
King no longer, Edward was made Duke of Windsor, an

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.610
important-sounding title but one without any responsibilities.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.930
The day after abdicating he travelled to Europe, and the following

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.370
year, free from his royal obligations, he was able to marry Wallis.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:21.420
There was no grand romantic wedding full of smiles, tears of joy and happy families.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:28.530
Relations between Edward and the rest of the royal family were incredibly cold, and

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:33.690
a grand total of zero members of the royal family attended the couple’s wedding.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:40.490
But if the royal family and senior British politicians might have hoped that, now they could

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.590
be married, the pair would live out the rest of their lives quietly and posing no further

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:51.250
problems to the British establishment, then they would find themselves sorely disappointed.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.550
Although they now had no official role, one of the first acts of

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.390
the newly-married couple was to go and visit a European leader.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.180
But this was no vanilla, minor, uncontroversial European leader.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:17.010
In October of 1937, the pair went to meet Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, and Edward

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:23.270
and Hitler had a private meeting while Wallis was entertained by Eva Braun and Rudolf Hess.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:31.340
Now, nothing is known about what exactly Hitler and Edward spoke about, but it has become the

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:38.130
subject of much speculation, so let’s spend a moment indulging ourselves and looking at some

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.321
of the reasons why the two met, and what could have been the subject of their discussion.

00:16:44.908 --> 00:16:48.668
As a reminder of what was happening in Europe at the time, we are

00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:52.028
still two years away from the outbreak of the Second World War here.

00:16:52.988 --> 00:16:57.928
Most British politicians were desperate to avoid war if possible,

00:16:58.218 --> 00:17:01.718
and Edward was certainly in the category of people who believed that

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:06.139
everything should be done to avoid repeating the horrors of World War I.

00:17:07.048 --> 00:17:10.608
He was deeply affected by his experience in World War I,

00:17:11.058 --> 00:17:14.368
or at least the atrocities that he saw in the trenches.

00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:19.328
He believed that everything should be done to stop this from happening again.

00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:26.388
He believed in the policy of appeasement, essentially, of making concessions to Hitler to stop war.

00:17:27.678 --> 00:17:32.978
And, unlike his brother, the new King George VI or his niece, Queen

00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:37.438
Elizabeth II, he wasn’t the sort of person to keep his mouth shut.

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:44.318
Both as a young man and when he was briefly king, Edward had publicly

00:17:44.318 --> 00:17:49.218
expressed a desire to be involved in politics, involved in shaping policy.

00:17:50.218 --> 00:17:56.238
He saw himself as something of a moderniser, someone who could be a 20th century king.

00:17:57.738 --> 00:18:02.928
He believed that the true enemy of Europe was communism, not fascism.

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:08.058
Edward’s relations, the Romanovs, had been murdered by the

00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:13.298
communists, and he thought the real enemy was further to the East.

00:18:14.838 --> 00:18:20.488
The Nazis were aware of Edward’s views, and in fact from the early 1930s

00:18:20.918 --> 00:18:25.808
Hitler had tried to link the British and German royal houses; he had

00:18:25.828 --> 00:18:30.216
tried to get Edward to marry a young  German princess and reel him in.

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:39.276
He had to wait a few years, but in 1937 he got his chance to woo the abdicated king.

00:18:40.206 --> 00:18:41.826
So, picture this.

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:46.616
You have Edward, now Duke of Windsor, with his new wife, Wallis Simpson.

00:18:47.636 --> 00:18:53.246
They have no official duties, they are not allowed the status that they believe they deserve.

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:59.696
And all of a sudden they are treated like royalty, given an official visit,

00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:04.196
the red carpet rolled out by an increasingly powerful European leader.

00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:09.506
Yes, he would prove himself to be a murderous dictator, and his

00:19:09.556 --> 00:19:13.116
anti-Semitic worldview was already clear for anyone to see by then.

00:19:13.806 --> 00:19:19.456
But you can perhaps appreciate why the pair might have accepted this invitation, and when you

00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:24.706
learn that Edward was in favour of appeasement, of some kind of agreement being made with Hitler,

00:19:25.236 --> 00:19:30.916
then the reason for the pair being courted by the Nazis starts to become somewhat clearer.

00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:36.786
And this wouldn’t be the only time the pair would cross paths with the Nazis.

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:41.756
There is even a theory that the Nazis were keeping Edward close because

00:19:41.766 --> 00:19:47.196
they wanted to install him as a puppet king if Britain fell to the Nazis.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:52.002
He might no longer be king , but he could come in useful down the road.

00:19:53.312 --> 00:19:59.912
And when war broke out in 1939, Edward’s position was even more precarious.

00:20:00.522 --> 00:20:03.012
He was an ex-King living in Europe.

00:20:03.582 --> 00:20:08.512
What would happen if he was captured by the Nazis and used as a bargaining chip?

00:20:10.091 --> 00:20:15.621
This soon became a very real threat, as there was a Nazi plot to kidnap

00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:20.141
him and bring him to Germany in an attempt to force Britain to surrender.

00:20:21.548 --> 00:20:26.538
As a result, he was swiftly evacuated from Europe and given the post of the

00:20:26.568 --> 00:20:31.198
Governor of the Bahamas, the small collection of islands in the Caribbean.

00:20:32.638 --> 00:20:38.768
This was very much a ceremonial role where he would be both safe from danger and not

00:20:38.778 --> 00:20:44.008
be able to cause too much trouble, and for the most part, it had its intended effect.

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:49.668
After the war he was able to return to Europe, and lived out the rest

00:20:49.668 --> 00:20:54.078
of his life in France with Wallis, in a villa in Northwest Paris.

00:20:55.308 --> 00:20:59.688
And in terms of the rest of Edward’s life, it was characterised by

00:20:59.738 --> 00:21:04.514
bitterness and a sense of being an outcast until his death in 1972.

00:21:05.538 --> 00:21:12.948
His last words were, reportedly, “Wallis, Wallis, Wallis”, but the love

00:21:12.948 --> 00:21:17.518
of his life was not by his side; he was accompanied only by his nurse.

00:21:18.834 --> 00:21:23.402
Unlike every other king or queen, he was not given the honour of a state funeral.

00:21:24.272 --> 00:21:29.172
He died alone, cast out and chastised by his family and country.

00:21:30.092 --> 00:21:34.692
Indeed, the entirety of his life after meeting Wallis Simpson had been

00:21:34.692 --> 00:21:39.412
punctuated by conflict and tension with his family, the British royal family.

00:21:40.202 --> 00:21:46.862
He was incredibly bitter for how he felt he had been treated, angry at not being able to do what

00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:52.902
he wanted to do, resentful at not being able to both be king and be with the woman he loved.

00:21:54.273 --> 00:22:00.423
And on the royal family’s side, he was seen as a traitor, someone who had betrayed his

00:22:00.423 --> 00:22:06.883
country, someone who had failed to do his duty, and worse, a threat to the monarchy, a man

00:22:07.053 --> 00:22:13.153
who had interfered in politics and got into bed with the 20th century’s most famous dictator.

00:22:14.553 --> 00:22:18.523
Clearly, there are two sides to every story, and perhaps your

00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:22.493
sympathies lie with Edward, perhaps they lie with the royal family.

00:22:23.993 --> 00:22:29.903
Of course, you might have noticed some similarities between this story and a more modern story

00:22:29.943 --> 00:22:35.873
involving a British royal prince and an American divorcée, the story of Harry and Meghan.

00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:42.293
That is a story for another day, but before we end the story of Edward,

00:22:42.443 --> 00:22:46.913
the king who wasn’t, I want to briefly reflect on Wallis Simpson.

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:51.228
The history books have not been kind to her.

00:22:52.133 --> 00:22:57.753
She is typically described as someone who forced Edward’s hand, a seductress who turned

00:22:57.753 --> 00:23:02.823
a king against his country, and a woman who inflicted deep damage against the monarchy.

00:23:04.032 --> 00:23:07.032
We now know that perhaps not all of that is true.

00:23:07.942 --> 00:23:12.312
To address the question of whether she intended to tear him away from the throne

00:23:12.462 --> 00:23:17.082
from the outset, well, according to one prominent biographer, she tried to

00:23:17.082 --> 00:23:21.062
leave Edward when she realised that he would have to abdicate to be with her.

00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:26.422
When he did choose to abdicate, well, she had little choice but to stay with him.

00:23:27.642 --> 00:23:32.342
And, to go a bit further down the path of historical “what ifs”,

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:35.832
what would have happened if Edward had never met Wallis Simpson?

00:23:36.892 --> 00:23:41.702
He wanted to be more involved in politics than is normal for a monarch, he held sympathies

00:23:42.002 --> 00:23:47.302
for the Nazis, he later said that he never thought Hitler was such a bad chap, and he was

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:53.222
an ardent proponent of appeasement, he wanted to come to some kind of deal with Hitler.

00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:58.942
It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that, had he been on the throne, he

00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:03.512
would have forced through some kind of alliance or agreement with Nazi Germany.

00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:10.192
And bringing it back to Wallis, according to one biographer, stopping Edward

00:24:10.392 --> 00:24:15.812
from being king was exactly what she wanted, but it was for a good reason.

00:24:17.112 --> 00:24:22.642
She wanted to marry Edward so she could stop him from becoming the king she feared.

00:24:23.822 --> 00:24:28.412
She saw what might happen if he became King, she knew that he couldn’t become

00:24:28.412 --> 00:24:33.882
king if the pair were together, and this master plan was rudely interrupted by

00:24:33.882 --> 00:24:38.112
the death of Edward’s father, putting Edward on the throne ahead of schedule.

00:24:39.312 --> 00:24:43.392
Essentially, she wanted to save Britain from a Nazi king.

00:24:44.762 --> 00:24:50.062
If that truly was the case, this presents a very different picture of Wallis Simpson.

00:24:50.952 --> 00:24:55.352
One not of an evil American temptress who tore the country apart,

00:24:55.862 --> 00:25:00.742
but, as one British newspaper put it, “the woman who saved Britain”.

00:25:03.432 --> 00:25:09.512
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Edward VIII, the king who said no.

00:25:10.152 --> 00:25:12.912
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that this was a fun

00:25:12.942 --> 00:25:16.522
exploration of the problems that come with having a monarchy.

00:25:17.342 --> 00:25:22.102
If you want to dive further into the subject, I wouldn’t blame you, as it is a fascinating story.

00:25:22.402 --> 00:25:27.282
In terms of books, I’d recommend both “The Traitor King” and “The Real Wallis

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:31.732
Simpson”, for two differing viewpoints, and if you haven’t yet watched the

00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:36.642
Netflix series The Crown, then you’ll also learn about their story in that.

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:40.572
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:40.962 --> 00:25:43.462
What do you think about the story of Edward VIII?

00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:48.012
Was he a traitor and Nazi sympathiser or a good-hearted

00:25:48.012 --> 00:25:50.542
man who just wanted to be with the woman he loved?

00:25:51.702 --> 00:25:53.232
And what about Wallis Simpson?

00:25:53.642 --> 00:25:57.892
Troublesome American, woman caught in the middle, or saviour of Britain?

00:25:58.402 --> 00:26:01.682
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

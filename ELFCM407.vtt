Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.990
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.670
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.400
part series where we will explore British high society.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.210
As a reminder, in part one we talked about the titles of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.580
the British aristocracy: Duke, Earl, Viscount and so on.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.470
In part three we are going to look at the real lives of the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.120
people who waited on British aristocrats, their servants.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.450
And today we are going to look at where they went to school.

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:53.210
Eton College, the most famous school in Britain.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.749
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.250
If you have to think back to your school years, perhaps someone from

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.700
your school went on to some important job or position in society.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.659
Perhaps someone from your school wrote a well-known book, had

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.910
a hit single, or went into business and made a lot of money.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.530
Perhaps you went to school with an actor, a football player, someone who is now a famous YouTuber.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:27.529
Maybe someone from your school went into politics, perhaps

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:30.939
they even became Prime Minister or President of your country.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.330
For most people it is unlikely, but for a student at

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.979
Eton College, it is almost a given, it is a certainty.

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:49.990
This one school has produced 20 Prime Ministers, countless politicians,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.200
playwrights, actors, journalists, economists, historians, princes and kings.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.070
You will no doubt have heard of many of them.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.860
Princes William and Harry.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.859
George Orwell, the author of 1984 and Animal Farm, Guy Burgess,

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.539
who you might remember from our mini-series on The Cambridge Five.

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.600
The explorers Ranulph Fiennes and Bear Grylls.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.709
Actors such as Damian Lewis, who you might know from Homeland or Band of Brothers.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.960
Eddie Redmayne, who you might remember as Stephen Hawking from The Theory of Everything.

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.820
Or Dominic West, who you might know as McNulty from The Wire.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.790
This one school has produced more public figures than any other in the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.290
UK, and in today’s episode we are going to lift the curtain on why.

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.810
To start off, I want to tell you about a confusion in the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.720
English language, and a confusion that is specific to the UK.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.109
In the UK, there are state schools, government schools.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:06.910
Every child in the UK has the right to a free education provided by

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.600
the government, they have the right to go to one of these schools.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.320
And there are also private schools, schools which are not free,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.810
and in many cases cost tens of thousands of Euros a year to attend.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.800
Some of these are “boarding schools”, where students don’t just study

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.490
at the school; they sleep and spend weekends at the school as well.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.720
The confusing thing is that the most expensive and most

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.599
prestigious private schools are called public schools.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.245
And right at the top of the list of the most prestigious public schools in the

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:56.190
UK is Eton College, which teaches around 1,350 students aged between 13 and 18.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.570
Now, we are going to divide this episode into three parts.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.590
First we’ll talk about the history of Eton, as it

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.490
has a lot of history, and it is rather interesting.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.400
Then we’ll talk about what life at Eton is actually like, as I’d be pretty

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.720
confident that it is very different from the experience you had at school.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.100
And finally we’ll talk about how Eton has adapted and

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.830
evolved over the years, and what the future might look like.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.570
Right, first off, some history.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.323
The school was founded in the year 1440 by King Henry VI.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.270
The king chose a small grassy area on the River Thames for his new school, which was

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.569
to be just north of Windsor Castle, and is around 20 kilometres to the west of London.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.670
And the school is still there today, with many of the original buildings still standing.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.959
In fact, if you ever fly into London Heathrow Airport from the west, you will fly right

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.270
over Eton College; it’s only a few kilometres away from the country’s busiest airport.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.560
Now, it might be the most exclusive school in the country, but when it was first

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.270
founded the King ensured that it had space for 70 so-called “poor boys” who

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.080
could live at and attend the school free of charge, without paying anything.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.170
Other boys could go to the school for free, but they would have to pay for their accommodation.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.720
This was the case when it was founded, in 1440, and

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.520
interestingly enough, it is still broadly the case today.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.650
Approximately 20% of the students are given some form of

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.510
financial assistance, and around 8% don’t pay anything at all.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.970
We’ll talk more about this later on.

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:05.390
To this day boys sleep and study at the school, living in “boarding houses”.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.080
And, in case you thought it was a slip of the tongue, I did mean “boys”, not “boys and girls”.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.850
Eton is one of the few remaining public schools in the UK that doesn’t allow girls.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.980
Some things, fortunately, have changed.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.320
When the school first opened the language of instruction

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.570
was not English, not French, not Old English but….Latin.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.580
And for the boys who went there, it was a pretty harsh existence.

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.000
According to the Eton website, “The school day began

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.100
at 5am with prayers, before lessons began at 6am.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.689
Lessons finally finished at 8pm, and there was a single hour of play allowed each day.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.750
There were two holidays in the year, at Christmas and in

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.150
the summer, although the boys did not go home at Christmas.”

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.870
Imagine that, you would arrive at the school in

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.610
September, you would not leave until the following July.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.959
You would spend 7 days a week there, for 10 months of the year, and you would rise

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.320
at 5 o’ clock in the morning and not finish studying until 8 o’ clock in the evening.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.540
It must have been pretty intense.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:32.030
Soon enough, this school became the “go-to” school for the British aristocracy.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.120
Boys were educated there, in this tiny bubble of society where

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.020
they spent five years with boys who came from similar backgrounds.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.909
Firstly, this was because it was expensive.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.900
We’ll talk about exactly how much it costs in a minute, but the price

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.210
to go there was out of reach for all but the richest in society.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.990
Secondly it was because you had to be accepted, and for many years, your probability of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.399
being accepted was determined not by you and your abilities but by who your parents were.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:12.120
And in most cases, who your father was.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.360
It helped if your father had gone to Eton himself, and as recently as

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:25.230
1960, 60% of the boys at Eton had fathers who had also gone to the school.

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:33.309
I should say that this number is now down to 20%, but it still gives you some idea of how

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.920
traditional the place is, and how it educated generation after generation of the same family.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.660
Another particularly traditional part of life at Eton is

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.230
the uniform, the clothes that boys are required to wear.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.410
Now, wearing a uniform at a school in Britain is not unusual;

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.640
in fact, most schools do require it, both state and private.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:07.880
But the uniform for Eton is something else, it takes formality to an entirely new level.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.930
Until 1948 boys were required to wear a top hat.

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:20.350
And this requirement was only removed because of rationing in

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.380
the post-war period, not because of any great modernisation.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.880
Today, boys still need to wear a black three-piece suit with long

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.439
tails, and they wear a starched stiff collar with a white “tie”.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.620
If you close your eyes and imagine dressing up a 15 year old boy

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.040
as an 18th century English aristocrat, you have probably imagined

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.930
something very similar to the official uniform of Eton College.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.449
Now, one thing that we haven’t talked about yet is the actual

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.750
quality of the tuition at Eton, about the schooling itself.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.170
It is widely known as one of the best schools in the country.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:13.440
The exam results that students get are very good, a high proportion go to the best universities

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.910
in the country, and, as you can see from the lengthy list of famous ex Etonians, famous old

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:26.590
boys of the school, lots go on to success in everything from business to politics to acting.

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:32.560
As to the question of “why”, or how can one school achieve

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.650
such brilliant results, there are differing theories.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:44.230
One is that these are boys who typically come from very privileged backgrounds anyway, so they have

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:50.127
the family connections and wealth to give them a head start, in a way that most children do not.

00:10:51.127 --> 00:10:56.010
Another is that going to a school with children that often come from rich and

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.530
successful families is bound to give a child the sense that they can achieve

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.690
anything, even if they didn’t come from this kind of background themselves.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:11.519
To quote an article that was written in Eton’s student magazine by a 16-year-old

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:17.940
pupil at the school, “Strain every nerve, parents of Britain, to send your son to this

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.660
educational establishment… Exercise your freedom of choice because in this way you

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:29.479
will imbue your son with the most important thing, a sense of his own importance.”

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.020
That 16-year-old pupil, by the way, the author of the article

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.910
was Boris Johson, who would go on to be a British Prime Minister.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.330
Now, what is undeniable even to the school’s biggest critics is that the

00:11:45.369 --> 00:11:50.400
quality of tuition at Eton, the quality of teachers, is incredibly high.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:59.520
The student to teacher ratio is 8 to 1, meaning that there is one teacher for every 8 students.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:07.240
In standard British schools this ratio is 16.4 to one, which means

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.230
that Eton has more than double the number of teachers per student.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.839
And the teachers at the school are very high quality: it is one of the

00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:21.810
most desirable schools in the country, and the pay is very high, with

00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:28.460
more than 40 teachers being paid over £100,000, so that’s around €120,000.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:37.199
For reference, the average salary for a teacher in the UK is £42,000, so just under €50,000.

00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:43.840
Now, as to the question of how Eton is able to pay its teachers so much,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.750
well here’s where I tell you how much it costs for a boy to go to Eton.

00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:55.096
There are three terms per year, and each term currently costs

00:12:55.486 --> 00:13:03.216
£16,666, so that’s £50,000 a year, just for the tuition.

00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:10.916
And with five years in total plus the cost of the uniform, trips, additional classes

00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:19.773
and so on, it will end up being closer to £300,000, so that’s around €350,000.

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:25.846
It is, to state the obvious, a lot of money, so much that you have

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:29.706
to be right in the top earning bracket to be able to afford a place.

00:13:30.956 --> 00:13:35.936
But winning a place at Eton is now about much more than how many

00:13:35.946 --> 00:13:40.436
zeroes you, or rather, your parents, have on your bank balance.

00:13:41.226 --> 00:13:43.956
There is a very tough application process.

00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:49.546
Every boy needs to apply, then have an interview at the age of 11.

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:54.966
If they impress the interviewer, they will be offered a place, contingent

00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:59.429
on getting excellent  grades at an exam they take at the age of 13.

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:05.778
No longer can you simply say who your father is, cough up the money and expect to be

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:10.518
welcomed with open arms; you need to be academically capable to be offered a place;

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:15.778
Indeed, in many cases, you don’t need to pay anything at all to win a place.

00:14:17.168 --> 00:14:22.908
Eton’s stated aim is to encourage applications from candidates with as diverse a

00:14:22.908 --> 00:14:27.428
range of backgrounds as possible who meet the academic standard required for entry.

00:14:28.528 --> 00:14:35.878
Your ability to pay the fees should not, in theory, be an obstacle, and as you heard, 20%

00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:42.178
of boys at the school don’t pay full fees, with one in every 13 boys paying nothing at all.

00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:49.848
And this is one of the contradictions of Eton, or at least a contradiction in the public eye.

00:14:51.218 --> 00:14:55.848
On the one hand it is seen as an exclusive club where only the

00:14:55.848 --> 00:15:00.818
richest may apply, a school which perpetuates social injustice by

00:15:00.818 --> 00:15:04.548
giving an unfair advantage to boys who are already privileged enough.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:10.918
British tabloids use Eton as the quintessential example of upper class

00:15:10.948 --> 00:15:15.548
privilege, a school that perpetuates social inequality by offering a

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:20.608
superior education to the one available to 99.99% of the population.

00:15:22.228 --> 00:15:28.168
But on the other hand, Eton is now much more meritocratic than it is given credit for.

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:32.188
It gives the opportunity for a first-class quality of

00:15:32.188 --> 00:15:35.298
education to boys who would otherwise not have received it.

00:15:36.288 --> 00:15:40.688
The school will happily offer a completely free place, worth many

00:15:40.688 --> 00:15:45.168
hundreds of thousands of Euros, to a clever and ambitious young boy who

00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:49.188
would otherwise almost certainly have received an inferior education.

00:15:50.108 --> 00:15:55.198
Sure, it only does this for a very small number of boys in the grand scheme of things,

00:15:55.508 --> 00:16:01.898
but on a micro level, for the boys that win these free places, this will in all likelihood

00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:07.308
be a life changing experience in terms of social mobility and life opportunities.

00:16:08.698 --> 00:16:14.328
And, interestingly enough, the type of boy who goes to Eton and pays the full

00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:19.588
fees has also changed significantly over the past twenty to thirty years.

00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:26.478
Even 30 years ago, it was expensive but significantly more affordable than it

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:34.883
is today, it was around £12,000 a year in 1995 versus £50,000 a year today.

00:16:35.673 --> 00:16:41.328
Yes, expensive, but still affordable to many “old money” families.

00:16:41.868 --> 00:16:46.168
So, it was full of the sons of old Etonians, old boys of the school,

00:16:47.078 --> 00:16:51.768
who you were, who your father was, this was the deciding factor.

00:16:53.118 --> 00:16:59.148
The fact that it is now so expensive has really priced this type of parent out, the

00:16:59.148 --> 00:17:05.168
parent that might have historically had lots of money, land, and so on, but not the

00:17:05.178 --> 00:17:10.468
almost million Euros in cash that it does today to educate two boys at the school.

00:17:11.358 --> 00:17:14.868
And this has changed the type of boy that you will find at the school.

00:17:15.658 --> 00:17:22.018
Gone, or at least substantially reduced, are these “old money” types, and there has been an increase

00:17:22.018 --> 00:17:28.088
of boys from families that are able to pay the fees but might not have come from a traditional

00:17:28.158 --> 00:17:34.408
Eton background themselves: immigrant families, wealthy Asian or Middle Eastern parents, and so on.

00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:42.188
This is a big change for the school; if you were to look at an Eton school photo from

00:17:42.288 --> 00:17:48.448
any time before the 1960s, you would have been presented with a wall of white faces.

00:17:49.348 --> 00:17:54.788
In fact, the first black boy to complete his studies at Eton ended up writing

00:17:54.798 --> 00:18:00.603
a book about the terrible racist treatment he received, and this was in 1969.

00:18:02.128 --> 00:18:07.468
Nowadays, 20% of the students are Black or Asian, which

00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:11.258
is, in fact, a higher percentage than the UK average.

00:18:12.628 --> 00:18:19.718
So, to wrap things up, yes Eton College is still where the British elite is educated.

00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:25.248
There is, statistically speaking, most probably a future British Prime

00:18:25.248 --> 00:18:30.708
Minister studying there right now, putting on his stiff collar, adjusting

00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:36.168
his coat tails, and perhaps even reciting Latin verses in his room at night.

00:18:37.548 --> 00:18:43.578
But this “elite” Etonian from 2023 is a very different type of

00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:49.594
elite compared to his predecessor from 1923, or even from 2003.

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:55.918
His father probably didn’t go to Eton, perhaps his father isn’t even

00:18:55.918 --> 00:19:01.848
British, he won his place on merit alone, and perhaps he isn’t paying a

00:19:01.878 --> 00:19:06.448
penny for the privilege of going to the most famous school in Britain.

00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:12.648
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Eton College.

00:19:12.988 --> 00:19:16.108
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:17.058 --> 00:19:22.008
I should say that you can actually visit the school, you can go on a tour of the college

00:19:22.278 --> 00:19:27.948
during the summer months, so if you are in London between May and September and you

00:19:27.948 --> 00:19:32.578
would like to peek inside the most famous school in the country, then you can do that.

00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:36.658
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:37.098 --> 00:19:39.018
Had you heard about Eton College before?

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.558
Are there private schools in your country?

00:19:42.038 --> 00:19:43.678
And what do you think about them?

00:19:44.348 --> 00:19:48.668
Can they sometimes be a vehicle for social change, or are they

00:19:48.668 --> 00:19:52.328
something that perpetuates social inequality and should be abolished?

00:19:52.788 --> 00:19:56.078
I know we have loads of current and ex teachers, so

00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:58.178
I would particularly like to know what you think.

00:19:59.018 --> 00:20:02.438

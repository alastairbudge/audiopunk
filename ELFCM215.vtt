Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:17.157
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.857
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:29.817
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Fantastic Life of Oscar Wilde.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.267
He was a playwright, a journalist, an intellectual,

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:39.287
a wit, an academic, a husband, a father, and a lover.

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:44.857
He was one of the great writers of the 19th century, along with the novelist Charles

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:51.547
Dickens, one of the first literary celebrities, but his work was overshadowed by his

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:57.747
private life, culminating in his trial for homosexuality and subsequent imprisonment.

00:00:58.177 --> 00:01:05.067
So, in this episode we are going to talk about his fantastic life, from his early childhood as

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:13.077
the son of two prominent Dublin intellectuals, his boy genius stage at university, finding his

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:19.827
own identity and the Aesthetic Movement, becoming a famous playwright and the talk of the town

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:26.923
right through to his double life, his eventual trial and imprisonment and his tragic final years.

00:01:27.593 --> 00:01:35.363
He only lived to the age of 46, but he managed to achieve a lot in a relatively short space of time.

00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:39.723
So, without future ado, let’s get right into it.

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:48.194
Oscar Fingal  O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was born in Dublin on the 16th

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:54.954
of October 1854 to a prominent Anglo-Irish family of intellectuals.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:59.294
Anglo-Irish, by the way, is a term that’s used for

00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:03.164
Irish people with English roots, English heritage.

00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:08.594
It doesn’t mean half-Irish, half-English, it means Irish with English heritage.

00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:16.324
Wilde’s father was a prominent surgeon, and a regular contributor to medical journals.

00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:21.114
Wilde’s mother was a poet with the pen name “Speranza”,

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:25.314
which the Italian speakers will know is Italian for “hope”.

00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:31.824
Both Wilde’s parents were very clever, witty people, and Wilde grew

00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:36.444
up in a privileged environment full of intellectual conversation.

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:41.614
Oscar was clearly a talented boy from a young age.

00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:49.144
As a teenager he claimed he could read two opposite pages of a book at the same time, and he

00:02:49.144 --> 00:02:55.954
would be challenged by his classmates to read long passages of text in very short periods of time.

00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:02.574
He wrote that he would be able to read a three-volume novel, so that would be around

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:08.734
900 pages, in half an hour, and to be able to give an accurate summary of the story.

00:03:09.354 --> 00:03:16.184
If he had an hour to read it then he would be able to give a narrative of the most important scenes.

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:23.384
He was clearly a very gifted child, and he knew how to please his audience.

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:29.124
His academic talents led to a scholarship to study Classics, meaning

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:33.454
the language and literature of Ancient Greece and Rome, at Trinity

00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:38.904
College Dublin, Ireland’s most prestigious university, at the age of 16.

00:03:39.774 --> 00:03:45.624
Now, of course this was impressive, but it wasn’t completely unheard of for

00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:51.254
students to start university at a much younger age than students currently do.

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:55.934
Charles Darwin, for example, also started when he was 16.

00:03:57.054 --> 00:04:01.264
Wilde, however, was anything but a normal student.

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:08.814
He excelled academically, and came top of his class in his first year, then won another

00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:16.834
scholarship to Oxford University, where he again studied Classics from 1874 to 1878.

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:23.344
While at Oxford he became particularly well-known to other students.

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:31.274
He would wear flamboyant clothes, had long hair, and decorated his room with flowers.

00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:38.474
Remember, this was in Victorian England, where men of a certain class had short

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:45.644
hair, they wore dark suits, and lived pretty plain, non-ostentatious lives.

00:04:46.624 --> 00:04:52.974
Although it was Sigmund Freud who was to popularise the term repression to mean sexual

00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:59.814
repression in the first years of the twentieth century, this was a highly repressed society.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:05.654
Wilde was at the forefront of a movement called Aestheticism, which

00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:11.994
emphasised how something looked and felt, it put a focus on beauty.

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:19.984
Victorian norms, especially with masculine values, put an emphasis on practicality

00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:26.764
or morality, and there was limited value placed on how beautiful something should be.

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:34.594
A quote you may have heard associated with this movement is “art for art’s sake”, meaning that

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:41.854
art should be created for its own beauty and qualities, it shouldn't try to serve something else.

00:05:43.154 --> 00:05:51.044
Because of Wilde’s unorthodox beliefs and behaviour, he often became a target at Oxford, and

00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:56.844
there are reports of other students bursting into his room with the intention of beating him up.

00:05:57.696 --> 00:06:03.714
But, Wilde was a big man, he was 1 metre 90, and quite chunky too.

00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:09.904
He was able to fight off a group of 4 undergraduates, he was certainly no pushover.

00:06:11.024 --> 00:06:17.044
His extravagant lifestyle of flowers, fancy clothes, porcelain china and

00:06:17.134 --> 00:06:22.944
beautiful objects came at a high price though, Wilde lived an expensive life.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:29.784
He was supported by scholarships and by an allowance from his parents, but

00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:37.364
after his father’s death in April of 1876 not only did the money dry up, his

00:06:37.524 --> 00:06:42.864
allowance stopped, but it was discovered that his father was deeply in debt.

00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:50.024
With an expensive lifestyle to support, Wilde needed to find a source of income.

00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:56.114
Although he would have certainly been capable, he didn’t want to be an academic.

00:06:56.904 --> 00:06:57.694
He wrote.

00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:01.341
“ I’ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist.

00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:06.861
Somehow, or other, I’ll be famous, and if not famous, notorious”.

00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:11.651
Well, he ended up famous and notorious.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:17.341
Shortly after his graduation from Oxford he returned to Ireland, partly to see

00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.781
a woman it’s thought that he was in love with, a lady named Florence Balcombe.

00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:30.151
But, to his disappointment, she was engaged to another man, Bram Stoker, a

00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:35.911
name you may recognise as he was the author of the Gothic horror novel Dracula.

00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:41.251
Wilde packed his bags and moved to London, where he began

00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:45.761
publishing poems and short stories for literary magazines.

00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:50.841
He was the Victorian equivalent of a newspaper columnist, really.

00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:57.061
Although he made a decent amount of money from this, it was to be a lecture

00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:02.641
tour of the United States that was the real money-maker for the young Wilde.

00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:12.431
In 1882, aged 27, he embarked on a year-long tour of America where he lectured on

00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:18.091
Aestheticism, this new movement that was taking much of the literary world by storm.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:25.581
He was very well aware of his own talents, and he was certainly not a modest man.

00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:33.371
You may be aware of one of his most famous quotes, where he is reported to have said to a

00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:40.671
customs official when he arrived in the US, “I have nothing to declare except my genius”.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.900
While on tour in the US and after returning home, a rich

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.947
man, he loved the attention and fame that followed him.

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:54.945
There were reports of him walking down Piccaddily, a famous street

00:08:54.975 --> 00:08:59.665
in London, carrying a lily flower and with his long hair flowing.

00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:06.725
When he was asked whether he actually did this or not he responded, "It's not

00:09:06.765 --> 00:09:12.325
whether I did it or not that's important, but whether people believed I did it".

00:09:13.555 --> 00:09:19.365
While he was a wealthy man by many people’s standards, he had very expensive

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:25.325
tastes, and he needed to find another source of income to support his lifestyle.

00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:31.815
He found one, or rather, he fell in love with a rich woman, a lady

00:09:32.055 --> 00:09:36.055
called Constance Lloyd, who was the daughter of a wealthy lawyer.

00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:44.235
Luckily for Wilde, she had similarly expensive tastes, and after they married and moved

00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:51.235
in together in 1884 their London house was decorated to exceptionally high standards.

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:56.625
Oscar Wilde was now married, and within the period of

00:09:56.745 --> 00:10:00.685
two years they had two children in quick succession.

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:07.119
Wilde was, by all reports, a devoted father and husband, and it looked

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:11.649
like he might put his eccentric days of Aestheticism behind him.

00:10:13.061 --> 00:10:19.329
But there was another side to his character that he perhaps hadn’t fully discovered by that point.

00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:25.649
Remember, Wilde had spent almost 7 years studying Classics at

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:29.409
two of the most prestigious universities in the British Isles.

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:35.679
He had studied Roman and Greek literature in depth, and became very interested

00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:41.229
in the idea, prominent amongst the early Greeks in particular, of older

00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:47.068
men having close, perhaps even intimate, relationships with younger men.

00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:51.838
His entire philosophy was about doing what felt

00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:55.918
right, and that one shouldn’t repress one’s feelings.

00:10:57.088 --> 00:11:03.218
What’s more, homosexuality, if you were wondering where this is going, homosexuality

00:11:03.218 --> 00:11:09.868
was illegal in Great Britain, it was literally a crime to engage in homosexual acts.

00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:13.968
This wasn’t to be an obstacle to Oscar Wilde.

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:19.118
It’s not clear exactly when and with whom his first homosexual

00:11:19.118 --> 00:11:24.038
relationship was with, but it’s thought to be with a Canadian-British

00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:29.928
journalist in 1886, the year after Wilde’s second child was born.

00:11:31.068 --> 00:11:37.918
The late 1880s saw Wilde spending an increasing amount of time away from his wife and family.

00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:43.368
In terms of his literary output, he wrote a few short stories

00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:47.978
and essays, but nothing that brought him serious fame.

00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:53.918
It wasn’t to be until 1890, with the publication of A

00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:58.638
Picture of Dorian Gray that he was really catapulted to fame.

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:05.808
A Picture of Dorian Gray, if you haven’t read it, is a novella or short novel

00:12:05.938 --> 00:12:12.178
about a beautiful man who stays young while his portrait grows old and ugly.

00:12:13.068 --> 00:12:20.348
Throughout the book there is a theme, an undercurrent of male beauty, and you

00:12:20.348 --> 00:12:26.508
can sense Wilde’s appreciation of and love for the male form when you read it.

00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:32.398
Wilde knew that the book would be controversial, and in the preface to

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:38.608
the book he wrote, “There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.808
Books are well written, or badly written.

00:12:42.298 --> 00:12:43.368
That is all.”

00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:49.818
Shortly after the publication of A Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde met a young

00:12:49.818 --> 00:12:56.138
man by the name of Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas, otherwise known as Bosie.

00:12:57.278 --> 00:13:04.208
When they met, in 1891, Bosie was 20 and a student at Oxford University,

00:13:04.508 --> 00:13:11.078
while Wilde was 37, a famous author and a married father of two children.

00:13:12.198 --> 00:13:16.558
They immediately fell in love, beginning a passionate relationship.

00:13:17.378 --> 00:13:21.348
Wilde was spending less and less time with his wife and children,

00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:25.908
instead moving from hotel room to hotel room with Bosie.

00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:33.288
Although Wilde was an eccentric, flamboyant individual, he did his best to keep

00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:39.848
the relationship quiet - homosexuality was, remember, still a crime at the time.

00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:46.598
Bosie’s father, however, soon found out and he took exception to his

00:13:46.598 --> 00:13:52.258
son’s relationship with Wilde, he hated the fact that his son was openly

00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:57.558
gay, and he claimed that Wilde was distracting him from his studies.

00:13:58.758 --> 00:14:05.148
Bosie came from an aristocratic family, and his father was the Marquis of Queensberry.

00:14:05.948 --> 00:14:12.358
If you are a boxing fan and the name Queensberry rings a bell, well that’s

00:14:12.358 --> 00:14:17.858
because Bosie’s father invented the rules of modern boxing, Queensberry Rules.

00:14:19.118 --> 00:14:22.368
The Marquis of Queensberry did everything possible

00:14:22.398 --> 00:14:26.528
to try to disrupt his son’s relationship with Wilde.

00:14:26.848 --> 00:14:30.238
He threatened him privately and publicly.

00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:36.788
On the opening night of what would be one of Oscar Wilde’s most successful plays, The

00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:42.478
Importance of Being Earnest, the Marquis of Queensbury even turned up at the theatre

00:14:42.638 --> 00:14:49.128
with a basket of rotting vegetables that he intended to throw at Wilde to embarrass him.

00:14:50.298 --> 00:14:57.098
Later on that week the Marquis would do something that would change Wilde’s life forever.

00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:02.678
He turned up at Wilde’s private members club, a place called

00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:06.868
the Albemarle in London, and left a card at the reception.

00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:13.198
On it he had written “For Oscar Wilde, posing sodomite”.

00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:19.298
A sodomite is an old-fashioned derogatory word for homosexual.

00:15:20.168 --> 00:15:25.298
Although these words might have been true, and it was no secret that

00:15:25.348 --> 00:15:30.688
Oscar Wilde and Bosie were engaged in a sexual relationship, Wilde was

00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:35.798
deeply offended that Bosie’s father had publicly accused him of a crime.

00:15:36.618 --> 00:15:41.728
Instead of dropping it, of ignoring the matter, or breaking off the

00:15:41.728 --> 00:15:48.008
relationship, he accused Bosie’s father of libel, the crime of stating in

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:52.808
writing a false statement about someone that can affect their reputation.

00:15:53.598 --> 00:15:59.848
This meant that Bosie’s father was arrested, and he faced up to two years in prison.

00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:08.048
The only way that he could avoid prison would be if he could show that what he had claimed was true.

00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:14.798
Of course, both Bosie and Wilde denied it, but the Marquis had

00:16:14.978 --> 00:16:19.968
hired private detectives to dig deep into Wilde’s private life.

00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:26.058
They found several male prostitutes who were ready to testify that they had

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:31.708
had sexual relationships with Wilde, and therefore the accusation was true.

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:36.168
What’s more, Wilde didn’t help himself during the

00:16:36.178 --> 00:16:40.788
trial, and he certainly enjoyed the spectacle of it.

00:16:42.048 --> 00:16:50.248
When Wilde was asked whether he had ever kissed one particular boy, Wilde responded, "Oh, dear no.

00:16:50.438 --> 00:16:56.148
He was a particularly plain boy – unfortunately ugly – I pitied him for it."

00:16:57.148 --> 00:17:03.828
Of course, if you are trying to convince a courtroom that you are not gay then saying that the

00:17:03.828 --> 00:17:10.068
reason you didn’t kiss a boy was because he was ugly isn’t a very good way of going about it.

00:17:11.008 --> 00:17:16.808
When it became clear that the libel case was going nowhere, and that the Marquis

00:17:16.808 --> 00:17:22.428
had evidence that Wilde had hired male prostitutes, Wilde dropped the case.

00:17:23.788 --> 00:17:29.278
The Marquis was free to go, but now the spotlight turned to Wilde.

00:17:30.358 --> 00:17:35.048
He was arrested, and put on trial on the charges of homosexual activity.

00:17:36.048 --> 00:17:39.290
On these charges, he was certainly guilty.

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:44.698
It emerged that Wilde would frequently hire young, male prostitutes.

00:17:44.908 --> 00:17:48.838
He would pay for them to have lavish dinners with him,

00:17:49.218 --> 00:17:53.088
then they would return to his hotel room, often with Bosie.

00:17:54.488 --> 00:17:59.608
During the trial, Wilde spoke passionately about the beauty of true

00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:04.928
love and passion, and of “the love that dare not speak its name”.

00:18:05.947 --> 00:18:12.328
But the judge was having none of it, and Wilde was sentenced to two years in prison.

00:18:13.708 --> 00:18:20.638
By this time Oscar Wilde was pretty much the most famous living playwright in the country.

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:27.588
He was flamboyant and controversial but he was incredibly talented and well-known.

00:18:28.488 --> 00:18:33.648
And just like that he was locked up, shut up in a prison, even

00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:38.588
denied any writing materials for the majority of his time in prison.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:47.658
Now, for anyone, prison must be a terrible experience, but for Wilde it was almost a death sentence.

00:18:48.538 --> 00:18:53.648
Imagine, this is an incredibly talented playwright who had spent

00:18:53.658 --> 00:18:59.198
his afternoons and evenings in literary salons, had met Victor Hugo,

00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:04.888
Toulouse Lautrec, Degas, who was used to a life of considerable luxury.

00:19:05.628 --> 00:19:11.918
Then in an instant he was forced to wear prison clothes and walk on a treadmill

00:19:11.928 --> 00:19:17.538
for 5 hours a day, with no contact with anyone from the outside world.

00:19:18.678 --> 00:19:24.088
When he was freed, two years later, he emerged a broken man.

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:28.898
The same evening of his release from prison he set sail

00:19:28.948 --> 00:19:33.438
for France, and never returned again to the British Isles.

00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:41.328
His wife had left him, too embarrassed to be married to the country’s most public homosexual.

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:49.458
He was bankrupt, as he had had to pay all of the Marquis’s legal fees when he lost the libel case.

00:19:50.338 --> 00:19:54.278
And the rest of the life of Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie

00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:58.878
Wills Wilde was, I’m sorry to say, a pretty sad affair.

00:20:00.638 --> 00:20:08.388
He was released from prison in 1897, and three years later he was dead at the age of 46.

00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:16.758
He died, in fact, on November 30th, exactly 121 years from when this episode was released.

00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:23.148
His last years had been spent mainly in Paris and Northern France, where

00:20:23.248 --> 00:20:28.078
he could be found drifting from one cafe to another, begging friends

00:20:28.098 --> 00:20:32.558
and acquaintances for more money to buy another drink and a hot meal.

00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:39.368
He only wrote one more poem after leaving prison, a long poem called “The Ballad

00:20:39.428 --> 00:20:44.948
of Reading Gaol”, in which he wrote of the harsh treatment prisoners face in jail.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.310
Even on his deathbed he retained his trademark wit and humour.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.730
He was lying in bed, dying from meningitis.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:03.570
His last words were, reportedly, “This wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.920
Either it goes or I do.”

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.480
The wallpaper won, and Wilde died penniless and disgraced in

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.570
France, exiled from the country he had come to call home, Britain.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.830
Now, when it comes to the legacy of Oscar Wilde, although he produced some

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:30.870
brilliant plays and novels, his legacy is certainly one of wasted talent.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:38.120
Wilde was someone who was persecuted and criminalised for the crime of being gay.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:46.050
Spending time in prison destroyed him, and although he wasn’t directly killed for his homosexuality,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:54.480
his literary career and perhaps even life was cut drastically short because he spent time in prison.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:02.140
It’s worth pointing out that Wilde was given a posthumous pardon, he was pardoned

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:09.790
for being sent to prison for homosexuality, but this came in 2017, somewhat too late.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:16.940
In terms of how people think about Wilde today, he is best known for his wit and humour.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.030
He was evidently an incredibly intelligent, sharp and

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.120
funny man, a “wit” in the classic sense of the word.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:33.120
He is one of the most quoted authors not just of the 19th century, but really ever.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:40.610
He knew the power of a well-put-together sentence, the power of words to amuse and insult.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:49.560
His literary legacy is huge, with his play The Importance of Being Earnest being regularly produced.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:56.590
Above all, perhaps, he is considered a gay icon and is much celebrated by popular

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:02.760
and prominent gay celebrities, such as the polymath and TV presenter, Stephen Fry.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.920
Ultimately, he was a victim of his time, a victim of a cruel law that not only meant he had

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:17.590
to live part of his life in hiding, but when he was challenged meant he was thrown in prison.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.910
Wilde once said, “To live is the rarest thing in the world.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.980
Most people exist, that is all.”

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.710
Well, his life may not have been long, but it’s undeniable

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.990
that Oscar Wilde did a lot more than simply “exist”.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.590
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Fantastic Life of Oscar Wilde.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.900
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that it might even

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:57.960
have inspired you to pick up a Wilde poem, novel or play, and see what all of the fuss is about.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.040
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.820
Have you read any Oscar Wilde, or seen any of his plays

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.510
performed, both in English or in your native language?

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.340
What did you think of them?

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.130
What were the laws around homosexuality like in your country?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.470
Were they as cruel as those in the UK?

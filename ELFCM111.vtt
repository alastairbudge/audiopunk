Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:16.392
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:21.072
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:27.252
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about British pubs.

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:33.452
If you have ever been to the UK, you’ll know quite how important pubs are.

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:38.582
British people love them, and the average person in Britain will

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:45.882
spend over €100,000, and 14 months of their entire life, in the pub.

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:52.362
So today we are going to talk about where pubs come from, how they have

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:57.832
developed over the years, what role they play, why they are so popular,

00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:02.792
and talk about some of the existential threats facing the British pub.

00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:10.182
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get straight into talking about British pubs.

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:15.402
The concept of the British pub is quite hard for a

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:20.282
non-British person to truly grasp, to truly understand.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:30.252
Some people try to liken it to a bar or cafe in European countries like France, Spain or Italy.

00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:33.602
But that is an imperfect comparison.

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:39.172
The pub has a place in many Brits' hearts that is difficult

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:43.242
to compare to anything you might find in another country.

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:49.202
For many people it’s a second home, a hub, a place to

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:53.412
meet friends, relax, chat, and of course, drink beer.

00:01:54.692 --> 00:02:02.032
It might surprise many Brits though to find out that the pub is debatably an Italian

00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:07.742
invention, or at least, the early concept was brought to Britain by the Romans.

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:13.802
After the Romans invaded Britain, in 84 AD, they built an

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:18.502
extensive road network, a lot of which still exists today.

00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:25.362
Roman soldiers traveling around the country needed somewhere to rest on their trip,

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:31.382
and they built what were effectively the first pubs, called in Latin tabernae.

00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:37.322
The word later got corrupted into the English ‘tavern’,

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:41.182
and these ‘taverns’ appeared all over Britain.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:48.952
They served beer, which had been brewed and drunk in Britain well before the arrival of the Romans.

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:56.032
Now, if you are thinking that this was some kind of a lager type beer, fizzy

00:02:56.032 --> 00:03:01.582
and cold, a sort of Heineken or Budweiser type drink, you are most mistaken.

00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:08.192
This beer was flat, it wasn’t fizzy, and it quickly became the drink of choice in

00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:13.632
these taverns, more popular than the wine that the Romans had been used to drinking.

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:21.632
After the Romans left Britain, towards the end of the fourth century AD, the taverns remained.

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:30.602
Often, settlements and villages had formed around them, and they had become social hubs.

00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:37.722
Many continued to serve their original purpose, of providing accommodation for travellers.

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:42.802
Indeed, if you’ve been to the UK you’ll probably have seen ‘inns’

00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:48.492
and ‘pubs’, and you might be wondering what the difference is.

00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:56.312
The difference is that an ‘inn’ traditionally had accommodation, so that travellers

00:03:56.532 --> 00:04:02.082
could spend a night there, and of course enjoy a meal and some beer at the same time.

00:04:03.312 --> 00:04:06.042
Pub is more of a catch-all term.

00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:10.182
Pubs don’t have to have accommodation, inns do.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:16.292
And just on a further linguistic note, pub comes from the term ‘public

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:21.322
house’, and it’s a term used for any establishment that is open

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:26.862
to the public, serves beer, and whose main job is to serve drinks.

00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:34.262
And what we now call a pub used to be called an ‘alehouse’; the words are used interchangeably.

00:04:36.032 --> 00:04:41.572
So, the words pub, inn, alehouse, tavern, they are all a pretty

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:46.322
similar thing, and fall under the umbrella term of ‘the pub’.

00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:54.062
Pubs continued to spring up, and by the year 1577 in England and Wales there were

00:04:54.172 --> 00:05:07.952
14,202 ale houses, 1,631 inns, and 329 taverns, which was one pub for every 187 people.

00:05:09.132 --> 00:05:14.662
To give you a sense of how things have changed, there is now roughly one pub for

00:05:14.662 --> 00:05:21.662
every 1,200 people, so if you think that there are a lot of pubs in the UK now,

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:28.242
back in 1577 there were six and a half times more of them, proportionally speaking.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:33.202
In the 17th century came the pub’s first real threat,

00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:37.722
and that came in the form of another alcoholic drink.

00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:41.282
Gin, and The Gin Craze.

00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:46.912
Now, if you want to learn more about this, we actually did a whole episode

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:51.952
on it, which was Episode 37, you can listen to that one on the website.

00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:59.482
In short, there was a Gin epidemic, and Britain was flooded with cheap gin,

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:06.302
turning hundreds of thousands of people mad and completely dependent on this drink.

00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:12.812
Gin wasn’t normally drunk at pubs though, it was sold at little gin shops.

00:06:13.782 --> 00:06:21.372
And the fact that people were drinking so much of it posed an existential threat to the British pub.

00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:27.902
Luckily, for the pubs at least, the British government was relatively quick

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:34.072
to act, putting laws into place to deal with Britain’s gin problem, and

00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:39.752
it started encouraging people to drink beer and to go back to the pubs.

00:06:41.142 --> 00:06:46.792
Indeed, beer back then was viewed as a harmless, healthy drink.

00:06:47.902 --> 00:06:52.962
It was safer to drink than water, because there were limited ways of purifying

00:06:52.962 --> 00:06:57.972
water, and of course cities didn’t have public water systems back then.

00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:03.852
Drinks like tea and coffee were too expensive, and gin would send you mad.

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:08.302
So, beer was the safest and healthiest drink available.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:16.712
Given this, in 1830, as a reaction to the gin epidemic, the government relaxed

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:22.042
the laws around the production of beer with something called The Beerhouse

00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:28.152
Act, making it far easier for anyone to start brewing and selling beer.

00:07:29.322 --> 00:07:32.832
The government considered beer to be a much better

00:07:32.862 --> 00:07:36.492
option than gin, and encouraged people to drink it.

00:07:37.752 --> 00:07:41.202
And when I say people, I don’t just mean adults.

00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:46.372
Children were also encouraged to drink beer, albeit a

00:07:46.372 --> 00:07:50.502
slightly less alcoholic version of it, called ‘small beer’.

00:07:51.722 --> 00:07:55.132
At least it was better than drinking the super alcoholic

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:58.352
gin that many children had previously been drinking.

00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:04.182
The expression ‘small beer’ actually still exists in British

00:08:04.182 --> 00:08:08.102
English, it means something that is small and unimportant.

00:08:09.202 --> 00:08:14.352
With the Gin Epidemic over, pubs were back, and they continued

00:08:14.402 --> 00:08:19.742
to play a vital role in British society, albeit an evolving one.

00:08:20.972 --> 00:08:25.472
During both world wars the pubs remained open, with leaders

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:29.962
considering them to play an important role in keeping up morale.

00:08:31.242 --> 00:08:38.932
The role of pubs, and what actually happens inside pubs has changed dramatically over the years.

00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:45.442
In the 19th century they would often be split into different rooms for

00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:51.732
different classes of person, similar to how a train or an aeroplane might

00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:56.642
have different areas for different ticket types, different ticket prices.

00:08:57.542 --> 00:09:00.452
There was the public bar, or tap room.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:08.822
This was where working class men would meet, and would often be a single room with very few places

00:09:08.822 --> 00:09:17.022
to sit, and a floor covered in sawdust, the little pieces of wood you get from sawing a tree.

00:09:18.072 --> 00:09:22.102
The idea behind the sawdust was that it would absorb

00:09:22.342 --> 00:09:27.342
spilled beer and spit, so the floors were pretty disgusting.

00:09:28.612 --> 00:09:31.162
Women weren’t allowed into the public bar.

00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:37.282
It was a place for men to meet, drink beer, smoke, and not do much else.

00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:44.392
That was the public bar, but there was also a lounge bar, which had better quality

00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:50.382
tables and chairs, accepted women, and had better and more expensive drinks.

00:09:51.522 --> 00:09:57.042
This was a little bit more like most pubs you might go into today, and it was

00:09:57.062 --> 00:10:02.102
an acceptable place for a man and a woman to go and enjoy a drink together.

00:10:03.562 --> 00:10:09.672
During the late 20th century these two rooms started to be combined into one in many

00:10:09.682 --> 00:10:16.682
pubs, and they have evolved into big, open plan rooms with large bars in the middle.

00:10:17.982 --> 00:10:23.842
With almost 50,000 different pubs in the UK, it’s impossible to generalise,

00:10:24.182 --> 00:10:29.462
but especially pubs in small villages and towns are very social places,

00:10:29.622 --> 00:10:34.972
where people of all ages gather to meet, drink, and enjoy a meal.

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:40.642
When I first tried to explain the concept of the pub to my

00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:45.642
teetotal, my non-drinking, Italian mother in law, it was hard.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:49.442
She struggled to understand what I might be doing there.

00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:56.972
The assumption that many people have is that they’re places full of drunks, of alcoholics,

00:10:57.012 --> 00:11:02.652
and it’s hard to understand why they hold such a special place in Brits’ hearts.

00:11:03.782 --> 00:11:08.392
One way to think about it is that there’s something universal about a pub.

00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:14.822
Anyone, at least any adult, can go into any pub, anywhere in the UK.

00:11:15.322 --> 00:11:20.662
It feels familiar, you can sit and enjoy a drink without judgment.

00:11:21.672 --> 00:11:26.342
Or it’s a place to meet friends, a place to go to celebrate with colleagues

00:11:26.392 --> 00:11:32.872
after work, a place to enjoy a Sunday lunch, or simply a place to go and relax.

00:11:34.012 --> 00:11:38.452
As you will no doubt know, Britain isn’t famous for its fantastic weather,

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:45.392
and while those of you living in places like Spain, France or Italy might meet

00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:51.242
friends, colleagues or family members in a square, outside a cafe, or just

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:56.962
outdoors, for the majority of the year in Britain, this isn’t really an option.

00:11:58.192 --> 00:12:05.592
Coffee culture, at least the modern American, Starbucks-style idea of coffee culture didn’t arrive

00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:12.492
in the UK until relatively recently, and so there weren’t many alternative options to the pub.

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:19.662
This has had the effect of turning Brits into some of the world’s biggest drinkers.

00:12:20.732 --> 00:12:24.602
If you spend hours in a pub then you don’t just drink

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:27.942
one beer, you end up drinking quite a lot of beer.

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:35.992
Non Brits who come to the UK to do things like study at British university or work

00:12:36.302 --> 00:12:41.952
are often stunned, they are very surprised, at how much people drink in a pub.

00:12:43.152 --> 00:12:49.862
Whereas in France or Italy, for example, you might go to a bar and have a bière, a half

00:12:49.892 --> 00:12:56.412
pint, or a glass of wine, if you go to the pub in the UK you might find your British

00:12:56.442 --> 00:13:04.112
colleagues drinking 4, 5, 6 or more pints of beer, so we’re talking 3 or more litres of beer.

00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:10.462
Indeed, there was a survey done a couple of years ago that suggested that over the

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:19.572
average British pubgoer's life they would drink 13,104 alcoholic drinks, so that’s beer

00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:28.562
and wine, and 3,276 shots, that’s small glasses of whisky, vodka, and other spirits.

00:13:29.072 --> 00:13:30.062
It’s a lot, right?

00:13:31.442 --> 00:13:35.292
Obviously, I’m not suggesting that drinking lots of alcohol is a good

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:39.932
thing, everything in moderation of course, I’m just explaining some of

00:13:39.932 --> 00:13:44.802
the cultural reasons that Brits have ended up being such heavy drinkers.

00:13:46.132 --> 00:13:51.842
One fun aspect of British pubs that is always amusing to non-Brits, not

00:13:51.842 --> 00:13:57.052
just non-native speakers, is their names, and the signs outside them.

00:13:58.432 --> 00:14:04.832
The painted signs outside pubs did serve a purpose though, and not just an artistic one.

00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:10.962
When literacy rates were much lower, when fewer people were able to

00:14:10.962 --> 00:14:17.702
read, they helped people locate the pubs, they helped them find the pubs.

00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:23.102
If you were looking for a pub called The Red Lion, it didn’t matter if you couldn’t read,

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:29.602
you’d just go ahead until you found the one with a picture of a red lion on the outside.

00:14:30.862 --> 00:14:35.682
Pubs, and their patrons, are also very proud of their names.

00:14:37.132 --> 00:14:43.622
Many are named after famous people, so there are lots of Duke of Wellingtons or Shakespeares.

00:14:44.742 --> 00:14:48.972
Being a monarchy, there are lots named after kings and queens,

00:14:49.392 --> 00:14:54.182
as well as lots of The Crowns, The King’s Arms, and so on.

00:14:55.422 --> 00:15:02.932
Lots are named after myths and legends, so you have ones like The Green Man and The Black Horse.

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:07.822
And others are simply named after the types of people that used

00:15:07.852 --> 00:15:12.892
to go there - The Bricklayer’s Arms, The Mason’s Arms, and so on.

00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:19.912
There’s even a game that you can play if you’re going on a trip called Pub Cricket, which

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:28.112
involves trying to spot pub signs and getting one point for every ‘leg’ that exists on the sign.

00:15:29.192 --> 00:15:37.262
So if you see, let’s say, The Lord Nelson, that's a person, you get 2 points, because he has 2 legs,

00:15:37.742 --> 00:15:44.942
but if you see a pub sign for ‘The Sun’, you get zero points and the turn goes to the next player.

00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:50.092
This was definitely a staple for long car rides when I was a child,

00:15:50.442 --> 00:15:54.682
and a fun one to play when driving through the English countryside.

00:15:55.692 --> 00:16:03.652
Although pubs are a hugely important part of British culture, they are under threat, and indeed

00:16:03.782 --> 00:16:12.022
even before COVID hit, and the pubs were forced to close, 6 pubs were closing down every single day.

00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:19.332
Rents are increasing, costs are going up, and pubs are struggling to survive.

00:16:20.532 --> 00:16:25.452
Many are being sold and turned into housing, turned into flats.

00:16:25.842 --> 00:16:31.072
They often occupy prime locations in cities, and as the cost of

00:16:31.072 --> 00:16:35.512
their rent increases they simply can’t afford to stay in business.

00:16:36.522 --> 00:16:43.802
Many more now serve food than did 20 or 30 years ago, and they are diversifying in an

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:49.882
attempt to survive, but no matter how much time Brits spend in the pub, and how many

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:55.962
beers we drink or Sunday lunches we eat, pubs are closing at a faster rate than ever.

00:16:57.072 --> 00:17:04.322
Whether or not you’re a pubgoer or a beer drinker, it’s hard to deny the impact that pubs have had

00:17:04.552 --> 00:17:11.402
on British culture, and it’s hard to not be a little bit sad at the rate at which they are closing.

00:17:12.402 --> 00:17:16.462
Many really are historical buildings, a part of our cultural

00:17:16.462 --> 00:17:20.382
heritage, with the added benefit that they are free to visit.

00:17:21.692 --> 00:17:27.022
Today, or at least in pre-COVID times, you could go into the same pub

00:17:27.222 --> 00:17:31.402
that Charles Dickens used to go to, the Cheshire Cheese in London.

00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:38.452
When I was a student I used to go to a pub called the Fitzroy Tavern in London, which used to

00:17:38.452 --> 00:17:46.262
be frequented by people like Dylan Thomas and George Orwell, the author of Animal Farm and 1984.

00:17:47.422 --> 00:17:53.452
In Oxford you can go to the pub where C.S Lewis, the author of classics such

00:17:53.452 --> 00:17:59.392
as Alice in Wonderland, and J.R.R Tolkien, of Lord of the Rings, used to meet.

00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:05.812
And if you’re in Cambridge you can go to the pub where Francis Crick, one of

00:18:05.812 --> 00:18:11.422
the scientists who discovered DNA, announced this groundbreaking discovery.

00:18:12.602 --> 00:18:16.702
So, the British pub is a place where you can go and enjoy

00:18:16.922 --> 00:18:20.682
a delicious pint of beer, but it’s much more than that.

00:18:21.512 --> 00:18:26.332
It’s a truly British institution, a place to meet, celebrate,

00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:31.162
debate, romance, or just to have a little bit of peace and quiet.

00:18:32.322 --> 00:18:38.512
And if and when you get the chance to go to the UK, go to a pub, even

00:18:38.532 --> 00:18:43.482
if you don’t drink alcohol, and just sit and observe, soak it all in.

00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:47.802
At least now you’ll know a little bit more about where

00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:50.912
this unique aspect of British culture comes from.

00:18:53.102 --> 00:18:57.782
OK then, that is it for today's episode on British Pubs.

00:18:58.212 --> 00:19:01.482

00:19:10.362 --> 00:19:12.942
What’s the equivalent of a pub in your country?

00:19:13.492 --> 00:19:16.502

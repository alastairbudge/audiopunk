I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:29.604
about a controversial but defining part of Spanish culture.

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:30.914
Bullfighting.

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:35.674
Some say cultural artform, others say animal cruelty.

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:39.524
It’s a marker of history, politics, geography and

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:44.114
class, a tradition loved by some, and loathed by others.

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:47.894
So, in this episode we are going to look at the past,

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.184
present and future of this controversial activity.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:57.326

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:43.041
OK, let’s get right into it and talk about bullfighting.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:49.271
Quiet falls over the bullring, an anxious energy filling the stadium.

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:55.881
A matador stands tall and faces a snarling bull, its head lowered to the floor.

00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:58.671
There are whistles from the crowd.

00:01:58.823 --> 00:02:01.513
Nervous yelps, and intakes of breath.

00:02:02.363 --> 00:02:08.043
Slowly the bull drags a foot through the clay, and then lunges forward with its horns.

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:11.753
Dusty clouds shoot up into the air.

00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:13.613
The crowd gasps.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.553
The matador calmly steps aside, leading the beast with his cape.

00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:21.383
It turns and lunges towards him again.

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:26.163
Stepping aside a second time, the matador takes his chance.

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:31.393
He rises up, pulls back, and stabs downward at the bull with a sword.

00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:35.793
The arena explodes into cheers, claps and whistles.

00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:39.743
And the bull limps around, its steps unsteady.

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:45.543
Blood pours down onto the clay, a red trail following it around the ring.

00:02:45.953 --> 00:02:47.263
The cheers grow louder.

00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:48.553
Go on, they scream.

00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:49.143
Do it.

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:53.353
The bull collapses to the floor, writhing around in pain.

00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:58.283
Pulling a small blade from his waist, the matador approaches.

00:02:58.873 --> 00:03:00.963
There’s a half-moment of silence.

00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:06.733
He holds the blade high in the air, then plunges it into the top of the bull’s spinal cord.

00:03:07.313 --> 00:03:13.273
A twitching leg slowly comes to a rest and, finally, the bull is dead.

00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:17.903
The crowd rises up in a boom of claps and whistles.

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:22.903
The matador moves into the middle of the ring, his hands raised in acknowledgement.

00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:26.394
He thanks them, his costume splattered with blood.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.433
He bows, and blows kisses, but can’t help but notice that the

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:36.188
crowd - although enthusiastic - is not as big as it used to be.

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.718
There are empty seats dotted around the bullring.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:41.398
It never used to be like that.

00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:45.357
It certainly wasn’t like that when his father was a bullfighter.

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:53.397
As the American novelist and bullfighting fanatic Ernest Hemingway said famously in his 1932 book,

00:03:53.677 --> 00:04:00.377
Death in the Afternoon: “Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death.”

00:04:01.227 --> 00:04:03.387
But is bullfighting an art?

00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:05.067
Or is it a sport?

00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:07.337
Or is it torture?

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:12.067
Well, if we take Spain, the country most synonymous

00:04:12.097 --> 00:04:14.987
with bullfighting, it depends on who you talk to.

00:04:15.737 --> 00:04:19.637
Some would say it is an archaic form of torture, but

00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:23.497
others would say it’s a form of art or cultural event.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:28.605
In fact, even to this day, bullfights are not reported in the

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:33.031
sports sections of Spanish newspapers but in the cultural pages.

00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:36.121
So, what do they actually report on?

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.531
Bullfighting is, simply put, a physical competition between

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.631
a bull and a bullfighter, known as a torero in Spanish.

00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:52.441
I should say here that although bullfighting is most associated with Spain, and no doubt

00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:57.161
our Spanish listeners might get cross if it's referred to as anything other than Spanish,

00:04:57.261 --> 00:05:03.091
it also has deep roots in Portugal, southern France, and in countries across Latin America.

00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:08.044
Anyway, bullfights happen in a circular ring, known as the

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:11.927
plaza de toros, and the bull charges towards the bullfighter.

00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:15.797
You’ve might’ve seen footage before where the bullfighter

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:20.787
uses a cape - often red - to control and turn the bull.

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:26.617
This is where the famous English saying ‘Like a red rag to a bull’ comes from,

00:05:26.997 --> 00:05:31.864
used to mean something that is certain to produce an angry or violent reaction.

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:36.274
But that’s actually a myth - bulls don’t charge at the

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:40.444
colour red because they, like all cattle, are colour-blind.

00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:45.004
The colour red was instead adopted because it covers up all

00:05:45.004 --> 00:05:48.334
the bloody stains the bullfighters get throughout the fight.

00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:54.834
Instead of reacting to the cape, the bulls respond to the movements made by the bullfighter.

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:58.064
And these aren’t just any bulls.

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:02.524
Fully grown fighting bulls can weigh up to 1,600

00:06:02.554 --> 00:06:08.004
pounds - around 600 or 700 kilograms, the weight of a small car.

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:13.214
These are no normal bulls, but an especially aggressive type

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:17.414
bred for centuries to charge and attack bullfighters in the ring.

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:21.634
In traditional Spanish bullfighting, there are normally

00:06:21.804 --> 00:06:25.754
six bulls and three bullfighters, known as matadors.

00:06:26.134 --> 00:06:30.174
Every matador has a small team helping him throughout the fight.

00:06:30.704 --> 00:06:36.164
The picadores perform during the first stage of the fight, known as the tercio de

00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:41.533
varas, and ride on horseback, weakening the bull and preparing it for the matador.

00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:49.463
The banderilleros support the matador throughout the fight, using their capes to distract

00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:54.633
and attack the bull while the matador judges the bull’s movements and temperament.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:07:02.243
They also stab banderillas [sharp, dart-like things] into the bull during the second stage of

00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:07.743
the bullfight - the tercio de banderillas - ahead of the main matador’s entry into the bullring.

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:16.203
Each matador fights two bulls randomly assigned to them and as the bulls grow more and more

00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:22.563
tired, and more and more angry, the bullfighter uses his cape to position the bull for the kill.

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:28.133
He waits for his opportunity, and then, rising up, stabs it between

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:31.873
the shoulder blades in a downwards motion aiming for the heart.

00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:38.083
But, unfortunately this dramatic ending doesn’t always kill the bull outright.

00:07:38.963 --> 00:07:43.363
When they aren’t successful, the bullfighters have to use a special knife

00:07:43.383 --> 00:07:47.893
to sever the spinal cord and instantly put the bull out of its misery.

00:07:48.853 --> 00:07:55.323
So how did such a violent event - sport, torture, art - whatever it is, begin?

00:07:56.193 --> 00:08:02.062
Clearly, and sadly, one could say, human history  is littered with instances of humans

00:08:02.292 --> 00:08:08.262
killing all sorts of animals, and even other humans, in the name of sport and enjoyment.

00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:11.862
And when it comes to fighting bulls in particular,

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:15.930
historians are divided over where exactly it comes from.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.850
What is clear, however, is that the human fascination with bulls goes back a very long time.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.160
Some might say it goes back to Moorish Spain, the Muslim empire that

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.190
ruled Spain for around 800 years from the 8th until the late 15th century.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:41.230
Others might point to ancient Mesopotamia or the bull-taunting rituals of mediaeval Spain.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.837
Although the image of modern bullfighting that we have today, with the bullring

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:51.607
and capes and all the drama, is just a few hundred years old, it is safe to

00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:56.547
say that human interest in and interaction with bulls descends from a long,

00:08:56.827 --> 00:09:01.827
complicated mix of different rituals and cultures that goes back thousands of years.

00:09:02.824 --> 00:09:07.887
Archeologists on the Greek island of Crete, for example, discovered ancient paintings

00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:14.667
of rituals in which people grabbed bulls by the horns dating back to 1500 BC.

00:09:15.377 --> 00:09:20.262
And you are probably familiar with the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur.

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:27.234
Performances involving bulls were also common in ancient Rome, and prior to the Punic

00:09:27.284 --> 00:09:35.564
Wars - a long series of wars between the Romans and Carthaginians between 264 and 146 BC - a

00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:42.212
people called Celtiberians herded wild bulls into groups and used them as a weapon in war.

00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:49.902
In 228 BC historians believe they gathered a group of snarling bulls, tied them

00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:54.981
to wagons, set them on fire, and drove the herd towards the Carthiginian army.

00:09:56.091 --> 00:10:02.461
The Moors later developed a similar military strategy of using bull stampedes to attack the enemy.

00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:08.411
And the Romans were also intrigued by rumours of events held in the southern region of

00:10:08.411 --> 00:10:15.394
Spain now known Andalusia in which men took on a bull and killed it with a sword or axe.

00:10:16.054 --> 00:10:20.534
And as the Iberian Peninsula was invaded and conquered by the

00:10:20.644 --> 00:10:25.484
Vandals and Visigoths, they too lent their influence to bullfighting.

00:10:26.114 --> 00:10:28.064
And the Moors added to this.

00:10:28.464 --> 00:10:34.074
The Moors were known as great horse riders and breeders, and historians believe they were the

00:10:34.074 --> 00:10:39.204
first to fight bulls on horseback, which made killing the animals with their swords easier.

00:10:40.304 --> 00:10:44.224
Bullfighting tournaments were sometimes held between the Muslims and

00:10:44.224 --> 00:10:48.834
Christians, and in many towns they were held in the city squares - known

00:10:48.834 --> 00:10:53.474
as plazas - and that's where the Spanish name for bullring comes from.

00:10:54.894 --> 00:10:58.829
By the end of the 12th century, these types of public bullfights

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:02.999
- often big festive celebrations - were popular across Spain.

00:11:04.127 --> 00:11:10.169
Perhaps the best known is the Fiesta de San Fermín, better known as the Pamplona bull runs.

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:17.354
Immortalised by Ernest Hemingway in his novel ‘The Sun Also Rises’, the tradition of setting groups

00:11:17.354 --> 00:11:23.704
of angry bulls loose in the streets of Pamplona began in the 12th century and lives on to this day.

00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:29.094
Pamplona’s running of the bulls is a nine-day public party with

00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:33.970
lots of food, lots of wine, and plenty of goring -  that’s what it’s

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.703
called when a bull stabs one of the bull runners with its horns.

00:11:38.383 --> 00:11:43.515
Thousands of tourists - brave or foolish, depending on your opinion - travel

00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:48.565
to Pamplona from across the world to test their nerves and run with the bulls.

00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:54.537
And some never make the journey home, since 1911, 16 people have been killed.

00:11:55.117 --> 00:11:58.307
But as thrilling as setting a load of angry bulls

00:11:58.327 --> 00:12:01.580
loose in the street is, it’s not exactly bullfighting.

00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:08.347
It is believed the first Spaniard to kill a bull on horseback in a proper arena

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:14.827
was a man named Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, in the 11th century.

00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:20.037
But this was during the Islamic Empire, and although bullfights were

00:12:20.037 --> 00:12:24.867
part of public festivities and used in competition between Muslims and

00:12:24.867 --> 00:12:29.324
Christians, they were not yet established as a distinctly Spanish tradition.

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:34.894
When the Christians ‘reconquered’ Spain at the end of the 15th century

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:39.340
bullfights quickly became the favourite sport of the Spanish aristocracy.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.590
But they weren’t popular with everyone.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:52.630
The Queen at the time, Isabella I, hated bullfighting, and in 1567 Pope Pius V banned the sport.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.140
He even excommunicated Christian nobles who organised bullfights

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.539
and denied Christian burials to anyone killed fighting a bull.

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:08.249
Just like today, even 500 years ago bullfighting was a controversial topic.

00:13:09.349 --> 00:13:14.769
But as bullfights became more and more popular, eventually the church dropped the ban.

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:21.429
And around this time, in the 16th century, bullfights became such an integral part

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:26.879
of Spanish life and society that special bullfights were held to celebrate holy days.

00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:30.839
Even to this day, the first day of the bullfighting

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:34.199
season is still Easter Sunday in many parts of Spain.

00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:39.999
Later, during the 18th century, the Royal House of Bourbon succeeded

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:44.379
the Spanish throne with Philip V and things began to change.

00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:49.109
The Bourbons didn’t really approve of the tradition they had inherited,

00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:53.879
and the aristocracy slowly began to turn their backs on bullfighting.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:59.179
The Spanish general public, however, hadn’t got bored of bullfights yet.

00:13:59.549 --> 00:14:00.749
They wanted more.

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:07.389
By now bullfights were becoming so popular that the specialist breeding of bulls had become

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:13.609
financially profitable, and bulls were bred with specific bullfighting characteristics.

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:20.859
Spanish bulls were being bred to be bigger, stronger, more likely to be violent, and with

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:26.742
bigger horns - anything to make the spectacle more dangerous and exciting for spectators.

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:33.522
As bullfighting became popular and financially profitable, one of the first

00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:38.642
professional bullfighters to take advantage of this was a man called Joaquín

00:14:38.642 --> 00:14:44.247
Rodríguez Costillares, who was born in the Andalusian city of Seville in 1729.

00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:50.822
Costillares is generally given credit for creating the ‘modern’ bullfighting style we know today,

00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:58.532
especially the luxuriously decorated costumes worn by matators, and the gruesome end to the fights.

00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:06.169
His main rival was a man named Pedro Romero from Ronda, also in Andalusia.

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:14.249
Romero reportedly killed a staggering 5,600 bulls during his career and

00:15:14.489 --> 00:15:19.349
he popularised the red cape so synonymous with Spanish bullfighting today.

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:23.909
Now, despite both being from the same region of Spain,

00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:28.509
Andalusia, Costillares and Romero had very different styles.

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:34.379
From them, the two classic “schools” of Spanish bullfighting were born.

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:41.416
The Ronda style is noted for its simpler, slower style, whereas the glamorous,

00:15:41.626 --> 00:15:46.726
flamboyant style that came from Seville is more dramatic and expressive.

00:15:47.786 --> 00:15:52.086
It was around then, at the turn of the 19th century, that the painter

00:15:52.323 --> 00:15:57.946
Francisco de Goya painted and sketched bullfighting scenes, and bullfights

00:15:57.946 --> 00:16:03.336
became an interest of not only painters, but poets, novelists and sculptors.

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:09.186
Goya, Lorca, Botero, Hernandez and other key Spanish artists

00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:12.286
wrestled with the topic of bullfighting in their work.

00:16:13.216 --> 00:16:20.276
In 1836 Francisco Montes, a famous matador, published a rule book called “Tauromaquia”

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:26.321
and then, in 1859, with public demand for bullfighting getting bigger and bigger,

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:31.406
the first official ring built to his dimensions was constructed in Valencia.

00:16:32.266 --> 00:16:38.106
A few years later, in 1868, the first bullfight that used modern day bullfighting

00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:42.776
techniques and rules - namely with 6 bulls and 3 matadors - took place.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:48.736
By now bullfighting was so popular that bullfighters were becoming celebrities.

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:51.666
But they weren’t popular with everyone.

00:16:52.406 --> 00:16:53.156
Far from it.

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:59.149
Spain’s famous ‘98 Generation’ of philosophers, writers and artists were openly

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:04.319
critical of bullfighting’s rise, describing it as reactionary and backward.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:10.989
Even then, 100 years ago, anti-bullfighting sentiment was beginning to grow in Spain.

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:17.049
Now, if you know anything about Spanish history, and particularly if you are one of our

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:22.319
Spanish listeners, you will know that the 20th century was a complicated period for Spain.

00:17:23.389 --> 00:17:29.934
After a bitter Civil War between Nationalists and Republicans from 1936 to 1939,

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:37.270
General Franco took control of Spain and ruled it as a dictator until his death in 1975.

00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:44.719
As part of his authoritarian regime, Franco was keen to encourage and promote bullfighting as

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:51.709
Spain’s ‘fiesta nacional’ and he began tying it to traditional Spanish heritage and identity.

00:17:53.129 --> 00:17:58.509
Using emerging technology, Franco understood the symbolic power of television and

00:17:58.689 --> 00:18:04.039
being able to project nationalistic ideas of Spanishness into people’s living rooms.

00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:10.269
Hoping to equate Spanish identity with patriotism, more and more bullfights

00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:16.059
were televised, and by 1961 the Spanish press had credited televised bullfights

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:20.549
with reviving bullfighting’s ‘essence as a facet of popular culture.’

00:18:21.649 --> 00:18:26.659
Through television, bullfighting grew from a popular but still somewhat

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:31.899
niche sport to a national pastime and even a tourist attraction.

00:18:33.109 --> 00:18:37.189
But there were darker undertones to Franco’s use of bullfights.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:42.509
Not only were they used to construct a national identity favourable to his

00:18:42.509 --> 00:18:48.359
regime, but their popularity was also used to suppress political opposition.

00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:55.469
The most famous bullfighter of the 1960’s, a man named Manuel Benítez,  admitted

00:18:55.469 --> 00:19:00.102
that “if a public protest was planned, we’d organise a televised bullfight.”

00:19:01.229 --> 00:19:07.879
But as bullfights grew in popularity, filling not only the bullrings but now bars and living

00:19:07.879 --> 00:19:13.569
rooms across Spain, bullfighting itself was becoming more controversial and political.

00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:21.223
And as Franco’s popularity waned, as it reduced, opponents of bullfighting often became

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:26.883
involved with anti-nationalist politics and resistance, and treated with suspicion.

00:19:28.063 --> 00:19:33.853
Following Franco’s death in 1975 and Spain’s transition to democracy,

00:19:34.229 --> 00:19:38.923
bullfights remained popular but the anti-bullfighting energy growing in Spain

00:19:39.223 --> 00:19:44.343
became intertwined into separatist sentiment across the Spanish regions.

00:19:45.253 --> 00:19:50.412
However it was in the late-20th and early 21st century that

00:19:50.432 --> 00:19:53.922
the anti-bullfighting movement really began to take off.

00:19:54.922 --> 00:20:00.622
Now, as we’ve touched on already in this episode, for all the history and folklore

00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:05.452
of Spanish bullfighting, there has been an equally long history of opposition to it.

00:20:06.332 --> 00:20:09.772
It’s described as barbarous, animal cruelty, and

00:20:09.772 --> 00:20:13.372
torture, and opponents of bullfighting go back centuries.

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:17.445
But it was at the turn of the 21st century that animal

00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:21.255
welfare and anti-bullfighting groups really gained momentum.

00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:25.015
Famous Spanish celebrities began to speak out.

00:20:25.765 --> 00:20:31.925
And in 1991 bullfighting was even banned on the Canary Islands, but it was never

00:20:31.925 --> 00:20:37.025
very popular there anyway and the islands hadn’t had a bullfight since the 1970’s.

00:20:38.035 --> 00:20:43.135
Then in April of 2004, the regional government in Barcelona

00:20:43.385 --> 00:20:47.525
declared itself a ‘city against bullfighting’ and then a few years

00:20:47.525 --> 00:20:52.445
later, in the summer of 2010, the Catalonian parliament banned it.

00:20:53.565 --> 00:20:57.505
The move was eventually implemented a couple of years later, in

00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:02.283
2012, and I probably don’t need to say that this was a big deal.

00:21:03.403 --> 00:21:08.793
Unlike in the Canary Islands, Catalonia had a rich bullfighting history and culture.

00:21:09.423 --> 00:21:14.643
That a place like Barcelona - Spain’s second city and most popular tourist city,

00:21:14.643 --> 00:21:20.203
no less - banned bullfighting speaks to the changing attitudes in Spanish society.

00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:27.713
But four years later, in 2016, a Spanish constitutional court overturned

00:21:27.713 --> 00:21:32.083
the ban, deciding that regional governments cannot ban bullfights,

00:21:32.443 --> 00:21:35.633
although no new bullfights have taken place in the region since.

00:21:36.711 --> 00:21:41.091
In 2017 the regional government on the island of Mallorca also

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:45.983
experimented with legislation that could bypass the constitutional courts.

00:21:46.793 --> 00:21:52.373
Though they didn’t ban bullfighting outright, the law stopped bulls being killed or

00:21:52.543 --> 00:21:57.843
suffering as part of the fight which clearly changes the nature of what a bullfight is.

00:21:58.653 --> 00:22:02.673
And bullfighting has emerged as a political battleground

00:22:02.713 --> 00:22:07.123
between competing visions of Spain and what it is to be Spanish.

00:22:07.853 --> 00:22:13.343
When bullfights were eventually reintroduced in Mallorca in 2019, the

00:22:13.508 --> 00:22:18.753
facist anthem “Cara al Sol” - the national song under Franco - boomed

00:22:18.793 --> 00:22:22.713
from the bullring and drowned out animal rights protestors in the stadium.

00:22:23.463 --> 00:22:25.303
Now, back to the modern day.

00:22:26.123 --> 00:22:31.643
Like in many parts of the Western world, populist politics have taken over life in Spain.

00:22:32.553 --> 00:22:38.213
You know how it goes - each side picks a battle and makes it a front line of a ‘culture war.’

00:22:38.803 --> 00:22:42.223
In Spain things are no different, and bullfighting

00:22:42.233 --> 00:22:45.213
has become an integral part of these culture wars.

00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:52.673
For the Spanish left - whether socialist, environmentalist or separatist - bullfighting has become

00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:59.683
a symbol of the right and a memory of Franco’s facist regime; a relic of history best left behind.

00:23:00.973 --> 00:23:06.803
For the right, any attempt to ban or limit bullfighting is viewed as an assault

00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:12.543
on Spanish identity and represents an increasingly liberal, secular world.

00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:19.498
Far-right party Vox has made the preservation of bullfighting one of its core political themes,

00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:25.858
and some famous Spanish bullfighters have openly endorsed the party and run for public office.

00:23:26.818 --> 00:23:32.218
In regions with separatist impulses, like Catalonia, their bullfighting

00:23:32.228 --> 00:23:36.508
bans form a broader political vision: that they are separate from the

00:23:36.508 --> 00:23:41.008
rest of Spain and not part of this old-fashioned, traditional image.

00:23:41.998 --> 00:23:43.638
But what about the future?

00:23:43.938 --> 00:23:47.188
Will bullfighting ever be banned in Spain?

00:23:48.078 --> 00:23:55.853
Well, the truth is that it may not even be necessary - bullfighting is, it seems, slowly dying out.

00:23:57.133 --> 00:24:02.203
According to Spain’s Ministry of Culture, between 2007 and 2018,

00:24:02.673 --> 00:24:10.313
The number of bullfights in the country fell from 3,651 to 1,521.

00:24:11.503 --> 00:24:17.723
In 2018/19 just 8 percent of Spaniards went to a bullfight,

00:24:18.001 --> 00:24:21.151
and attendance is particularly low among young people.

00:24:21.851 --> 00:24:26.251
If things continue the way they are going - falling attendances, the regions

00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:30.891
trying to ban or modify bullfights themselves, financial difficulties, and

00:24:31.071 --> 00:24:35.811
young people losing interest - a nationwide ban might not even be necessary.

00:24:36.631 --> 00:24:41.861
And, in any case, it seems unlikely that such a ban could ever pass the Spanish parliament.

00:24:42.931 --> 00:24:45.881
But will it ever die out as a cultural tradition?

00:24:46.327 --> 00:24:50.211
Will it ever stop being such a strong symbol of Spanish identity?

00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:54.831
What seems clear is that bullfighting will always live on as a

00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:59.471
polarising piece of political rhetoric that stirs up memories of civil

00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:04.491
war and dictatorship long after the last bull takes its last breath.

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:11.441
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on bullfighting - the bloody,

00:25:11.561 --> 00:25:15.431
controversial activity that has divided opinion for centuries.

00:25:15.991 --> 00:25:20.591
As always, and in fact even more than usual because we have so many listeners

00:25:24.101 --> 00:25:29.701
What is your opinion about bullfighting, art form or torture, or somewhere in the middle?

00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:34.671
What does the future hold for bullfighting, and is that a good or a bad thing?

00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:38.421

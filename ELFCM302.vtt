Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:16.714
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:20.954
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.624
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:29.604
about a controversial but defining part of Spanish culture.

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:30.914
Bullfighting.

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:35.674
Some say cultural artform, others say animal cruelty.

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:39.524
It’s a marker of history, politics, geography and

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:44.114
class, a tradition loved by some, and loathed by others.

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:47.894
So, in this episode we are going to look at the past,

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.184
present and future of this controversial activity.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:57.326
I should give you a quick warning that this episode does have some descriptions about bullfighting.

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:01.557
So if you would rather not listen to that, please stop listening now.

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:06.992
OK, let’s get right into it and talk about bullfighting.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:13.221
Quiet falls over the bullring, an anxious energy filling the stadium.

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:19.831
A matador stands tall and faces a snarling bull, its head lowered to the floor.

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:22.621
There are whistles from the crowd.

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:25.463
Nervous yelps, and intakes of breath.

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:31.993
Slowly the bull drags a foot through the clay, and then lunges forward with its horns.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:35.703
Dusty clouds shoot up into the air.

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:37.563
The crowd gasps.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.503
The matador calmly steps aside, leading the beast with his cape.

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:45.333
It turns and lunges towards him again.

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:50.113
Stepping aside a second time, the matador takes his chance.

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:55.343
He rises up, pulls back, and stabs downward at the bull with a sword.

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:59.743
The arena explodes into cheers, claps and whistles.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.693
And the bull limps around, its steps unsteady.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:09.493
Blood pours down onto the clay, a red trail following it around the ring.

00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:11.213
The cheers grow louder.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:12.503
Go on, they scream.

00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:13.093
Do it.

00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:17.303
The bull collapses to the floor, writhing around in pain.

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:22.233
Pulling a small blade from his waist, the matador approaches.

00:02:22.823 --> 00:02:24.913
There’s a half-moment of silence.

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:30.683
He holds the blade high in the air, then plunges it into the top of the bull’s spinal cord.

00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:37.224
A twitching leg slowly comes to a rest and, finally, the bull is dead.

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:41.854
The crowd rises up in a boom of claps and whistles.

00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:46.854
The matador moves into the middle of the ring, his hands raised in acknowledgement.

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:50.345
He thanks them, his costume splattered with blood.

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:55.384
He bows, and blows kisses, but can’t help but notice that the

00:02:55.384 --> 00:03:00.139
crowd - although enthusiastic - is not as big as it used to be.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.669
There are empty seats dotted around the bullring.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.349
It never used to be like that.

00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:09.308
It certainly wasn’t like that when his father was a bullfighter.

00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:17.348
As the American novelist and bullfighting fanatic Ernest Hemingway said famously in his 1932 book,

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:24.328
Death in the Afternoon: “Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death.”

00:03:25.178 --> 00:03:27.338
But is bullfighting an art?

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.018
Or is it a sport?

00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:31.288
Or is it torture?

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:36.018
Well, if we take Spain, the country most synonymous

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:38.938
with bullfighting, it depends on who you talk to.

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:43.588
Some would say it is an archaic form of torture, but

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:47.448
others would say it’s a form of art or cultural event.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:52.555
In fact, even to this day, bullfights are not reported in the

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:56.981
sports sections of Spanish newspapers but in the cultural pages.

00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.071
So, what do they actually report on?

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:05.481
Bullfighting is, simply put, a physical competition between

00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:09.581
a bull and a bullfighter, known as a torero in Spanish.

00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:16.391
I should say here that although bullfighting is most associated with Spain, and no doubt

00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:21.111
our Spanish listeners might get cross if it's referred to as anything other than Spanish,

00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:27.041
it also has deep roots in Portugal, southern France, and in countries across Latin America.

00:04:28.045 --> 00:04:31.995
Anyway, bullfights happen in a circular ring, known as the

00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:35.877
plaza de toros, and the bull charges towards the bullfighter.

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:39.747
You might’ve seen footage before where the bullfighter

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:44.737
uses a cape - often red - to control and turn the bull.

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:50.567
This is where the famous English saying ‘Like a red rag to a bull’ comes from,

00:04:50.947 --> 00:04:55.815
used to mean something that is certain to produce an angry or violent reaction.

00:04:56.385 --> 00:05:00.225
But that’s actually a myth - bulls don’t charge at the

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:04.395
colour red because they, like all cattle, are colour-blind.

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:08.955
The colour red was instead adopted because it covers up all

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:12.285
the bloody stains the bullfighters get throughout the fight.

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:18.785
Instead of reacting to the cape, the bulls respond to the movements made by the bullfighter.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.015
And these aren’t just any bulls.

00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:26.475
Fully grown fighting bulls can weigh up to 1,600

00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:31.955
pounds - around 600 or 700 kilograms, the weight of a small car.

00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:37.165
These are no normal bulls, but an especially aggressive type

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:41.365
bred for centuries to charge and attack bullfighters in the ring.

00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:45.585
In traditional Spanish bullfighting, there are normally

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:49.705
six bulls and three bullfighters, known as matadors.

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:54.125
Every matador has a small team helping him throughout the fight.

00:05:54.655 --> 00:06:00.115
The picadores perform during the first stage of the fight, known as the tercio de

00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:05.483
varas, and ride on horseback, weakening the bull and preparing it for the matador.

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:13.413
The banderilleros support the matador throughout the fight, using their capes to distract

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:18.583
and attack the bull while the matador judges the bull’s movements and temperament.

00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:26.193
They also stab banderillas [sharp, dart-like things] into the bull during the second stage of

00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:31.693
the bullfight - the tercio de banderillas - ahead of the main matador’s entry into the bullring.

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:40.153
Each matador fights two bulls randomly assigned to them and as the bulls grow more and more

00:06:40.173 --> 00:06:46.513
tired, and more and more angry, the bullfighter uses his cape to position the bull for the kill.

00:06:47.103 --> 00:06:52.083
He waits for his opportunity, and then, rising up, stabs it between

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:55.823
the shoulder blades in a downwards motion aiming for the heart.

00:06:56.585 --> 00:07:02.033
But, unfortunately this dramatic ending doesn’t always kill the bull outright.

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:07.313
When they aren’t successful, the bullfighters have to use a special knife

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:11.843
to sever the spinal cord and instantly put the bull out of its misery.

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:19.273
So how did such a violent event - sport, torture, art - whatever it is, begin?

00:07:20.143 --> 00:07:26.013
Clearly, and sadly, one could say, human history  is littered with instances of humans

00:07:26.243 --> 00:07:32.213
killing all sorts of animals, and even other humans, in the name of sport and enjoyment.

00:07:32.983 --> 00:07:35.813
And when it comes to fighting bulls in particular,

00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:39.881
historians are divided over where exactly it comes from.

00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:46.801
What is clear, however, is that the human fascination with bulls goes back a very long time.

00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:53.111
Some might say it goes back to Moorish Spain, the Muslim empire that

00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:58.141
ruled Spain for around 800 years from the 8th until the late 15th century.

00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:05.181
Others might point to ancient Mesopotamia or the bull-taunting rituals of mediaeval Spain.

00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:10.787
Although the image of modern bullfighting that we have today, with the bullring

00:08:10.817 --> 00:08:15.557
and capes and all the drama, is just a few hundred years old, it is safe to

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:20.497
say that human interest in and interaction with bulls descends from a long,

00:08:20.777 --> 00:08:25.777
complicated mix of different rituals and cultures that goes back thousands of years.

00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:31.837
Archeologists on the Greek island of Crete, for example, discovered ancient paintings

00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:38.617
of rituals in which people grabbed bulls by the horns dating back to 1500 BC.

00:08:39.327 --> 00:08:44.213
And you are probably familiar with the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur.

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:51.184
Performances involving bulls were also common in ancient Rome, and prior to the Punic

00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:59.514
Wars - a long series of wars between the Romans and Carthaginians between 264 and 146 BC - a

00:08:59.514 --> 00:09:06.162
people called Celtiberians herded wild bulls into groups and used them as a weapon in war.

00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:13.852
In 228 BC historians believe they gathered a group of snarling bulls, tied them

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:18.932
to wagons, set them on fire, and drove the herd towards the Carthiginian army.

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:26.412
The Moors later developed a similar military strategy of using bull stampedes to attack the enemy.

00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:32.362
And the Romans were also intrigued by rumours of events held in the southern region of

00:09:32.362 --> 00:09:39.344
Spain now known Andalusia in which men took on a bull and killed it with a sword or axe.

00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:44.484
And as the Iberian Peninsula was invaded and conquered by the

00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:49.434
Vandals and Visigoths, they too lent their influence to bullfighting.

00:09:50.064 --> 00:09:52.014
And the Moors added to this.

00:09:52.414 --> 00:09:58.024
The Moors were known as great horse riders and breeders, and historians believe they were the

00:09:58.024 --> 00:10:03.154
first to fight bulls on horseback, which made killing the animals with their swords easier.

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:08.174
Bullfighting tournaments were sometimes held between the Muslims and

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:12.784
Christians, and in many towns they were held in the city squares - known

00:10:12.784 --> 00:10:17.424
as plazas - and that's where the Spanish name for bullring comes from.

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:22.779
By the end of the 12th century, these types of public bullfights

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.949
- often big festive celebrations - were popular across Spain.

00:10:28.078 --> 00:10:34.119
Perhaps the best known is the Fiesta de San Fermín, better known as the Pamplona bull runs.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:41.305
Immortalised by Ernest Hemingway in his novel ‘The Sun Also Rises’, the tradition of setting groups

00:10:41.305 --> 00:10:47.655
of angry bulls loose in the streets of Pamplona began in the 12th century and lives on to this day.

00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:53.045
Pamplona’s running of the bulls is a nine-day public party with

00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:57.921
lots of food, lots of wine, and plenty of goring -  that’s what it’s

00:10:57.921 --> 00:11:01.654
called when a bull stabs one of the bull runners with its horns.

00:11:02.334 --> 00:11:07.466
Thousands of tourists - brave or foolish, depending on your opinion - travel

00:11:07.476 --> 00:11:12.516
to Pamplona from across the world to test their nerves and run with the bulls.

00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:18.487
And some never make the journey home, since 1911, 16 people have been killed.

00:11:19.067 --> 00:11:22.257
But as thrilling as setting a load of angry bulls

00:11:22.277 --> 00:11:25.530
loose in the street is, it’s not exactly bullfighting.

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:32.297
It is believed the first Spaniard to kill a bull on horseback in a proper arena

00:11:32.657 --> 00:11:38.777
was a man named Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, in the 11th century.

00:11:39.543 --> 00:11:43.987
But this was during the Islamic Empire, and although bullfights were

00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:48.817
part of public festivities and used in competition between Muslims and

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:53.275
Christians, they were not yet established as a distinctly Spanish tradition.

00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:58.845
When the Christians ‘reconquered’ Spain at the end of the 15th century

00:11:59.216 --> 00:12:03.291
bullfights quickly became the favourite sport of the Spanish aristocracy.

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.541
But they weren’t popular with everyone.

00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:16.581
The Queen at the time, Isabella I, hated bullfighting, and in 1567 Pope Pius V banned the sport.

00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:21.091
He even excommunicated Christian nobles who organised bullfights

00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:25.489
and denied Christian burials to anyone killed fighting a bull.

00:12:26.699 --> 00:12:32.199
Just like today, even 500 years ago bullfighting was a controversial topic.

00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:38.719
But as bullfights became more and more popular, eventually the church dropped the ban.

00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:45.379
And around this time, in the 16th century, bullfights became such an integral part

00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:50.829
of Spanish life and society that special bullfights were held to celebrate holy days.

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:54.789
Even to this day, the first day of the bullfighting

00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:58.150
season is still Easter Sunday in many parts of Spain.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.950
Later, during the 18th century, the Royal House of Bourbon succeeded

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.330
the Spanish throne with Philip V and things began to change.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.060
The Bourbons didn’t really approve of the tradition they had inherited,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.830
and the aristocracy slowly began to turn their backs on bullfighting.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.130
The Spanish general public, however, hadn’t got bored of bullfights yet.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.700
They wanted more.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:31.340
By now bullfights were becoming so popular that the specialist breeding of bulls had become

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:37.560
financially profitable, and bulls were bred with specific bullfighting characteristics.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:44.810
Spanish bulls were being bred to be bigger, stronger, more likely to be violent, and with

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:50.692
bigger horns - anything to make the spectacle more dangerous and exciting for spectators.

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:57.472
As bullfighting became popular and financially profitable, one of the first

00:13:57.562 --> 00:14:02.592
professional bullfighters to take advantage of this was a man called Joaquín

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:08.197
Rodríguez Costillares, who was born in the Andalusian city of Seville in 1729.

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:14.772
Costillares is generally given credit for creating the ‘modern’ bullfighting style we know today,

00:14:15.242 --> 00:14:22.482
especially the luxuriously decorated costumes worn by matators, and the gruesome end to the fights.

00:14:23.652 --> 00:14:30.119
His main rival was a man named Pedro Romero from Ronda, also in Andalusia.

00:14:31.219 --> 00:14:38.199
Romero reportedly killed a staggering 5,600 bulls during his career and

00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:43.299
he popularised the red cape so synonymous with Spanish bullfighting today.

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:47.859
Now, despite both being from the same region of Spain,

00:14:48.309 --> 00:14:52.459
Andalusia, Costillares and Romero had very different styles.

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:58.329
From them, the two classic “schools” of Spanish bullfighting were born.

00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:05.366
The Ronda style is noted for its simpler, slower style, whereas the glamorous,

00:15:05.576 --> 00:15:10.676
flamboyant style that came from Seville is more dramatic and expressive.

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:16.036
It was around then, at the turn of the 19th century, that the painter

00:15:16.274 --> 00:15:21.896
Francisco de Goya painted and sketched bullfighting scenes, and bullfights

00:15:21.896 --> 00:15:27.286
became an interest of not only painters, but poets, novelists and sculptors.

00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:33.136
Goya, Lorca, Botero, Hernandez and other key Spanish artists

00:15:33.197 --> 00:15:36.236
wrestled with the topic of bullfighting in their work.

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:44.227
In 1836 Francisco Montes, a famous matador, published a rule book called “Tauromaquia”

00:15:44.536 --> 00:15:50.271
and then, in 1859, with public demand for bullfighting getting bigger and bigger,

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:55.356
the first official ring built to his dimensions was constructed in Valencia.

00:15:56.216 --> 00:16:02.056
A few years later, in 1868, the first bullfight that used modern day bullfighting

00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:06.726
techniques and rules - namely with 6 bulls and 3 matadors - took place.

00:16:07.536 --> 00:16:12.686
By now bullfighting was so popular that bullfighters were becoming celebrities.

00:16:13.526 --> 00:16:15.616
But they weren’t popular with everyone.

00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:17.106
Far from it.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:23.100
Spain’s famous ‘98 Generation’ of philosophers, writers and artists were openly

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.270
critical of bullfighting’s rise, describing it as reactionary and backward.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.940
Even then, 100 years ago, anti-bullfighting sentiment was beginning to grow in Spain.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:41.000
Now, if you know anything about Spanish history, and particularly if you are one of our

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:46.270
Spanish listeners, you will know that the 20th century was a complicated period for Spain.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:53.885
After a bitter Civil War between Nationalists and Republicans from 1936 to 1939,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:17:01.220
General Franco took control of Spain and ruled it as a dictator until his death in 1975.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:08.670
As part of his authoritarian regime, Franco was keen to encourage and promote bullfighting as

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:15.660
Spain’s ‘fiesta nacional’ and he began tying it to traditional Spanish heritage and identity.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.460
Using emerging technology, Franco understood the symbolic power of television and

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.990
being able to project nationalistic ideas of Spanishness into people’s living rooms.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:34.220
Hoping to equate Spanish identity with patriotism, more and more bullfights

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:40.010
were televised, and by 1961 the Spanish press had credited televised bullfights

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.500
with reviving bullfighting’s ‘essence as a facet of popular culture.’

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.610
Through television, bullfighting grew from a popular but still somewhat

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.850
niche sport to a national pastime and even a tourist attraction.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.140
But there were darker undertones to Franco’s use of bullfights.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.460
Not only were they used to construct a national identity favourable to his

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:12.310
regime, but their popularity was also used to suppress political opposition.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:19.420
The most famous bullfighter of the 1960’s, a man named Manuel Benítez,  admitted

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.052
that “if a public protest was planned, we’d organise a televised bullfight.”

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:31.830
But as bullfights grew in popularity, filling not only the bullrings but now bars and living

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:37.520
rooms across Spain, bullfighting itself was becoming more controversial and political.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:45.174
And as Franco’s popularity waned, as it reduced, opponents of bullfighting often became

00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:50.834
involved with anti-nationalist politics and resistance, and treated with suspicion.

00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:57.804
Following Franco’s death in 1975 and Spain’s transition to democracy,

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:02.874
bullfights remained popular but the anti-bullfighting energy growing in Spain

00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:08.294
became intertwined into separatist sentiment across the Spanish regions.

00:19:09.204 --> 00:19:14.362
However it was in the late-20th and early 21st century that

00:19:14.382 --> 00:19:17.872
the anti-bullfighting movement really began to take off.

00:19:18.872 --> 00:19:24.572
Now, as we’ve touched on already in this episode, for all the history and folklore

00:19:24.572 --> 00:19:29.402
of Spanish bullfighting, there has been an equally long history of opposition to it.

00:19:30.282 --> 00:19:33.722
It’s described as barbarous, animal cruelty, and

00:19:33.722 --> 00:19:37.322
torture, and opponents of bullfighting go back centuries.

00:19:37.772 --> 00:19:41.395
But it was at the turn of the 21st century that animal

00:19:41.395 --> 00:19:45.205
welfare and anti-bullfighting groups really gained momentum.

00:19:46.025 --> 00:19:48.965
Famous Spanish celebrities began to speak out.

00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:55.875
And in 1991 bullfighting was even banned on the Canary Islands, but it was never

00:19:55.875 --> 00:20:00.975
very popular there anyway and the islands hadn’t had a bullfight since the 1970’s.

00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:07.085
Then in April of 2004, the regional government in Barcelona

00:20:07.335 --> 00:20:11.475
declared itself a ‘city against bullfighting’ and then a few years

00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:16.395
later, in the summer of 2010, the Catalonian parliament banned it.

00:20:17.515 --> 00:20:21.455
The move was eventually implemented a couple of years later, in

00:20:21.665 --> 00:20:26.233
2012, and I probably don’t need to say that this was a big deal.

00:20:27.353 --> 00:20:32.743
Unlike in the Canary Islands, Catalonia had a rich bullfighting history and culture.

00:20:33.373 --> 00:20:38.593
That a place like Barcelona - Spain’s second city and most popular tourist city,

00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:44.153
no less - banned bullfighting speaks to the changing attitudes in Spanish society.

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:51.663
But four years later, in 2016, a Spanish constitutional court overturned

00:20:51.663 --> 00:20:56.033
the ban, deciding that regional governments cannot ban bullfights,

00:20:56.393 --> 00:20:59.583
although no new bullfights have taken place in the region since.

00:21:00.662 --> 00:21:05.042
In 2017 the regional government on the island of Mallorca also

00:21:05.052 --> 00:21:09.933
experimented with legislation that could bypass the constitutional courts.

00:21:10.743 --> 00:21:16.323
Though they didn’t ban bullfighting outright, the law stopped bulls being killed or

00:21:16.493 --> 00:21:21.793
suffering as part of the fight which clearly changes the nature of what a bullfight is.

00:21:22.603 --> 00:21:26.623
And bullfighting has emerged as a political battleground

00:21:26.663 --> 00:21:31.073
between competing visions of Spain and what it is to be Spanish.

00:21:31.803 --> 00:21:37.293
When bullfights were eventually reintroduced in Mallorca in 2019, the

00:21:37.459 --> 00:21:42.703
facist anthem “Cara al Sol” - the national song under Franco - boomed

00:21:42.743 --> 00:21:46.663
from the bullring and drowned out animal rights protestors in the stadium.

00:21:47.413 --> 00:21:49.253
Now, back to the modern day.

00:21:50.073 --> 00:21:55.593
Like in many parts of the Western world, populist politics have taken over life in Spain.

00:21:56.503 --> 00:22:02.163
You know how it goes - each side picks a battle and makes it a front line of a ‘culture war.’

00:22:02.753 --> 00:22:06.173
In Spain things are no different, and bullfighting

00:22:06.183 --> 00:22:09.163
has become an integral part of these culture wars.

00:22:10.083 --> 00:22:16.623
For the Spanish left - whether socialist, environmentalist or separatist - bullfighting has become

00:22:16.623 --> 00:22:23.633
a symbol of the right and a memory of Franco’s facist regime; a relic of history best left behind.

00:22:24.923 --> 00:22:30.753
For the right, any attempt to ban or limit bullfighting is viewed as an assault

00:22:30.763 --> 00:22:36.493
on Spanish identity and represents an increasingly liberal, secular world.

00:22:37.219 --> 00:22:43.449
Far-right party Vox has made the preservation of bullfighting one of its core political themes,

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:49.809
and some famous Spanish bullfighters have openly endorsed the party and run for public office.

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:56.169
In regions with separatist impulses, like Catalonia, their bullfighting

00:22:56.179 --> 00:23:00.459
bans form a broader political vision: that they are separate from the

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:04.959
rest of Spain and not part of this old-fashioned, traditional image.

00:23:05.949 --> 00:23:07.589
But what about the future?

00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:11.139
Will bullfighting ever be banned in Spain?

00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:19.804
Well, the truth is that it may not even be necessary - bullfighting is, it seems, slowly dying out.

00:23:21.084 --> 00:23:26.154
According to Spain’s Ministry of Culture, between 2007 and 2018,

00:23:26.624 --> 00:23:34.264
The number of bullfights in the country fell from 3,651 to 1,521.

00:23:35.454 --> 00:23:41.674
In 2018/19 just 8 percent of Spaniards went to a bullfight,

00:23:41.951 --> 00:23:45.101
and attendance is particularly low among young people.

00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:50.201
If things continue the way they are going - falling attendances, the regions

00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:54.841
trying to ban or modify bullfights themselves, financial difficulties, and

00:23:55.021 --> 00:23:59.761
young people losing interest - a nationwide ban might not even be necessary.

00:24:00.581 --> 00:24:05.811
And, in any case, it seems unlikely that such a ban could ever pass the Spanish parliament.

00:24:06.881 --> 00:24:09.831
But will it ever die out as a cultural tradition?

00:24:10.278 --> 00:24:14.161
Will it ever stop being such a strong symbol of Spanish identity?

00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:18.781
What seems clear is that bullfighting will always live on as a

00:24:18.781 --> 00:24:23.421
polarising piece of political rhetoric that stirs up memories of civil

00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:28.441
war and dictatorship long after the last bull takes its last breath.

00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:35.391
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on bullfighting - the bloody,

00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:39.381
controversial activity that has divided opinion for centuries.

00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:44.541
As always, and in fact even more than usual because we have so many listeners

00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:47.661
from Spain, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:53.651
What is your opinion about bullfighting, art form or torture, or somewhere in the middle?

00:24:54.361 --> 00:24:58.621
What does the future hold for bullfighting, and is that a good or a bad thing?

00:24:59.071 --> 00:25:02.371
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

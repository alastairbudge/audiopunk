Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:16.402
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:20.912
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:28.013
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part one of a three-part mini-series on  Disney.

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:31.683
When I was writing this episode, I was struggling

00:00:31.683 --> 00:00:35.123
to find a word to describe what Disney actually is.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.295
Is it a film company?

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.415
Is it an entertainment company?

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:41.205
Is it a cartoon company?

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:46.055
But what about the toys, the books, the adventure parks, Disney is

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:50.945
actually a lot harder to describe in one, snappy word than one might think.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:56.585
Disney means different things to different people, but it is associated with magic,

00:00:56.635 --> 00:01:02.785
with entertainment, with adventure and with fun, and has been for almost 100 years now.

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:09.255
In part one of this mini series we are going to talk about the history of Disney, the story

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:14.895
of how it all started, and went from being a dream to the world’s biggest magic company.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:20.305
In part two, which is going to be available exclusively on the website, leonardoenglish.com,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:25.125
we’ll talk about the business of Disney, of some of the reasons that it is such

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:30.265
a powerful, successful company, because that also really is a fascinating story.

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:36.175
And finally, in part three we’ll talk about the magic of Disney, of some of

00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:41.615
the emotional reasons that it works, and how a Disney story all fits together.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.565
You can, of course, listen to them independently, but

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:49.075
they will be even more fun when listened to in sequence.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:55.240
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:01:55.265 --> 00:02:00.395
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcripts, and the key vocabulary for this

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:05.495
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:09.855
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:15.285
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:19.875
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.785
So if that is of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:27.475
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:31.824
OK then, the history of Disney.

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:37.493
Our story starts in Chicago in 1901, with the birth of

00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:41.694
Walter Elias Disney, otherwise known as Walt Disney.

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:47.424
From a young age, he was a keen artist, and when he was just

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:51.794
18 years old he got his first job as a commercial illustrator.

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:59.143
His first few years of work weren’t filled with any notable success - he was actually laid

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:05.384
off, he lost his job, then started his first business, but that didn’t really go anywhere.

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:10.374
When he was just 21 years old, he set off for the west

00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:14.264
coast of America, to California, to seek his fortune.

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:20.869
Disney’s first hope, reportedly, was to be a live-action director, not a

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.439
cartoonist, and to have a shot at achieving his dream he needed to be in Hollywood.

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.939
His older brother–and future business partner–Roy

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.259
Disney was also there, recovering from tuberculosis.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:40.869
A few years prior to arriving in California, Disney had created a series called

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.869
Alice Comedies, which were short films about a girl in an animated, cartoon world.

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.899
It was loosely based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:55.129
the 1865 novel by the English author Lewis Carroll.

00:03:55.882 --> 00:04:01.312
They were a mixture of cartoons and live-action films, you can still find a lot of

00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:05.812
them on YouTube, just search Alice Comedies, and you’ll see where it all started.

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:12.582
Going back to our story, when he arrived in California, he looked for companies that

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:17.602
would distribute these films, companies that would pay him for the Alice series.

00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:20.732
And it didn’t take him long to find one.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:29.762
He arrived in California in July 1923, and by October he had found a distributor, M.J.

00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:30.912
Winkler Productions.

00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:40.632
The distributor agreed to pay Disney $1,500 per reel of film, today’s equivalent of around $23,000.

00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:46.268
And it was this money that acted as funding for the company.

00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:53.868
Together with his brother Roy, Walt Disney formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in 1923.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.339
Walt was the artist, the creative one.

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.199
Roy handled the business side of things.

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.488
The money they made from the distribution company meant they were

00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:08.428
able to hire other illustrators, and the company started to grow.

00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:13.638
One thing that is important to remember is that actually creating a film

00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:19.288
was very expensive, and cartoons, animated films, were even more so.

00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:23.178
Every scene needed to be drawn by hand.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:28.128
You needed lots of people to do it, and this made them very expensive to make.

00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:35.438
Nevertheless, by 1927 Walt Disney had decided that he wanted to go full time

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:40.868
into cartoon making, and he created a character called Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:47.184
In the first year, he produced 26 short films with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:51.314
His studio would make the cartoons, then they would

00:05:51.324 --> 00:05:54.764
be distributed by a company called Universal Pictures.

00:05:55.914 --> 00:06:00.454
When Walt Disney went back to Universal Pictures for more money to continue

00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:04.438
making the cartoon, he realised that something terrible had happened.

00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:11.558
Universal Pictures, the distribution company, in order to try to save money, had gone

00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:18.530
directly to Walt Disney’s illustrators, his employees, trying to cut Disney’s studio out.

00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:22.920
Surely they can’t do that, the young Disney must have thought.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.243
Oswald The Lucky Rabbit is my creation, someone else

00:06:27.243 --> 00:06:30.723
can’t just make Oswald films without my permission?

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:36.463
However, looking closely at the contract Disney realised that he

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:40.983
didn’t actually own the rights to Oswald - Universal Pictures did.

00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:44.143
There was nothing that Walt Disney could do.

00:06:45.393 --> 00:06:50.153
This was a tough lesson for young Walt, but it was to be a valuable one.

00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:54.763
From then on, Disney made sure that he owned everything

00:06:54.773 --> 00:06:58.593
he made, so that this experience could never be repeated.

00:06:59.823 --> 00:07:04.213
As he couldn’t use Oswald, Disney had to come up with a new character,

00:07:04.613 --> 00:07:09.033
a character that you will no doubt now be familiar with - Mickey Mouse.

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:15.103
Mickey Mouse’s first breakout appearance was in the 1928 film

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:19.763
‘Steamboat Willie’, which was one of the first ‘sound cartoons’.

00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:25.273
Now, to briefly explain what ‘sound cartoon’ means, and why

00:07:25.273 --> 00:07:29.813
it is important, before ‘sound cartoons’ movies were silent.

00:07:30.187 --> 00:07:35.577
There was normally music, but it wasn’t synchronised to what was happening on the screen.

00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:41.527
With a sound cartoon, what you heard reflected what was happening on screen.

00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:46.777
If on screen a character hit his head, you would hear the bang, and so on.

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:54.597
To you or me now, this might sound pretty basic, but it was a big development back in 1928.

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:59.687
After this appearance in Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse was an

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:04.783
almost instant success,  and to this day he is the symbol of Disney.

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:11.383
Relatively soon after the creation of Mickey Mouse, Disney realised the potential

00:08:11.423 --> 00:08:17.213
of merchandising his characters, he realised that people didn’t just want to watch

00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:22.793
Mickey Mouse on screen, they wanted Mickey Mouse on pencils, on toothbrushes, there

00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:28.053
were Mickey Mouse comic books, and the face of this little mouse was everywhere.

00:08:29.024 --> 00:08:34.114
Not only was this good because Disney was paid by companies to use Mickey Mouse,

00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:40.144
but all of these Mickey Mouse objects acted as adverts for Mickey Mouse movies.

00:08:41.344 --> 00:08:45.724
This is one of the magical parts of the Disney business, which we’ll come on to

00:08:45.724 --> 00:08:50.224
discuss more in the second part of this mini series, but the point here is that

00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:54.514
it was the start of Disney realising that there was a lot of money to be made

00:08:54.574 --> 00:08:59.894
from the characters, which he could then reinvest in making more and more movies.

00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:07.234
As the studio continued to grow, Disney was able to make more ambitious, more expensive, movies,

00:09:07.624 --> 00:09:12.974
the first of which was one I’m sure you will have seen, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:18.594
Before Snow White, Disney mainly made short films, and Snow

00:09:18.594 --> 00:09:23.444
White was the first animated feature film, the first long film.

00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:29.124
Now, by modern standards, it’s quite short, it’s only 1 hour and

00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:33.174
28 minutes, but it was really pushing the boundaries for Disney.

00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:39.774
When Walt Disney first suggested it to his animators, they weren’t all sold on

00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:44.794
the idea, they didn’t all think that it was sensible, but Disney was convinced.

00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:51.584
It took three years to make, but on December 21st 1937 it

00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:55.524
was released to the general public, and was a huge hit.

00:09:56.694 --> 00:10:01.284
It was the highest grossing film of all time, it was the film that made the most money

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:07.784
at the box office, and it wasn’t until 1939 that it was overtaken, by Gone With The Wind.

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:12.564
If anyone had any doubts about whether Disney should make these

00:10:12.564 --> 00:10:16.644
longer, feature-length films, these doubts had now been erased.

00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:24.054
However, they were still incredibly expensive films to make, and film-making was a risky business.

00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:29.544
If you made one dud film, one bad film, that didn’t do

00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:33.034
well at the box office, your company could go bankrupt.

00:10:34.054 --> 00:10:39.994
And Disney, despite all of its commercial success, was in quite a dangerous position.

00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:45.714
Nevertheless, Disney didn’t slow down, and the 1940s saw the

00:10:45.714 --> 00:10:50.044
creation of some of the films we now regard as timeless classics.

00:10:50.704 --> 00:10:56.684
Pinocchio and Fantasia in 1940, Dumbo in 1941, Bambi in 1942.

00:10:57.943 --> 00:11:01.574
But there was something else going on in the world in the early

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:05.204
1940s that was exceptionally bad for business: World War II.

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:11.352
The European markets were dead, because the cinemas were closed, these films, weren't

00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:18.300
commercial successes, Disney ended up $4 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:24.900
After the war was over, it was difficult for Disney to get right back into the flow of things, and

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:32.520
it wasn’t until the 1950s that he started to produce hit films again, such as Cinderella, in 1950.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.170
By this time, Walt Disney was dreaming bigger and bigger, and of diversifying.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:46.100
In 1953, after the release of Peter Pan, he created a film production

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.060
company called Buena Vista, which started off by making nature documentaries.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.070
Now, compared to cartoons, nature documentaries were very profitable,

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.300
because you didn’t have to painstakingly draw out every single clip.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.770
But his biggest dream, perhaps his most ambitious project, was for an amusement park.

00:12:07.903 --> 00:12:13.533
He used to take his own children to amusement parks, to fairgrounds, but what always

00:12:13.543 --> 00:12:18.733
happened was that he would end up sitting on the bench while his kids had all the fun.

00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:25.251
He thought, what if there was a magical place where adults and children could

00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:30.131
have fun, where entire families could go and nobody would feel left out?

00:12:31.202 --> 00:12:34.692
His creation was, as you’ve probably guessed, Disneyland.

00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:40.490
This new park opened in 1955, in Anaheim, California.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.120
Now, I imagine that some of you may have been to this

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.310
Disneyland, or another kind of Disney theme park.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.140
If you haven’t been to one, I’m sure you will have seen pictures.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:57.710
Walt Disney’s original vision for Disneyland was that it should never be completed,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.511
that new attractions, new areas, new rides should always be added, that as long as there

00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:10.211
was imagination left in the world, new rides, new areas, and new magic should be added.

00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:17.695
And from this original Disneyland in California, there are now 11 more, 12 parks

00:13:17.705 --> 00:13:23.545
in total, from Florida to Tokyo, Paris to Hong Kong, and hundreds of millions

00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:28.632
of people, perhaps even you, have gone through the gates at one of these parks.

00:13:30.062 --> 00:13:36.794
So, by the early 1960s, Disney hadn’t only cemented its reputation as the world’s favourite

00:13:36.844 --> 00:13:43.688
producer of cartoons, but had branched out into nature films, theme parks, and merchandise.

00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:49.748
Then, in 1966, Walt Disney died, aged 65.

00:13:50.778 --> 00:13:56.498
He was a heavy smoker, and died one month after his doctors discovered cancer in his lungs.

00:13:57.408 --> 00:14:02.018
Over the course of his life he had been involved in 81 feature length

00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:07.768
films, was nominated for 59 Academy Awards, and won 22 of them.

00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:13.936
Since his death, much has been written about him as an individual, but

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:18.836
it seems that historians are divided over the man’s actual character.

00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:24.666
From the outside, he was the face of Disney, the face of happiness for

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:30.036
children, someone who always had a big smile on his face, always ready to laugh.

00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:37.917
But, reportedly, he was very shy, and embarrassed in public, and he only managed by putting

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:43.644
himself in a different, public-facing character, almost playing a different role when he

00:14:43.644 --> 00:14:49.324
was Walt Disney of the Walt Disney Company rather than just ordinary Walt Disney at home.

00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:55.096
Indeed, in a documentary that aired back in 2015, it was

00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:59.236
reported that Walt Disney told a friend "I'm not Walt Disney.

00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:02.186
I do a lot of things Walt Disney would not do.

00:15:02.614 --> 00:15:04.254
Walt Disney does not smoke.

00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:05.334
I smoke.

00:15:05.934 --> 00:15:07.444
Walt Disney does not drink.

00:15:08.094 --> 00:15:08.724
I drink."

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:13.829
So, he was painfully aware of the difference between

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:17.919
what he was expected to be, and his own true character.

00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:23.479
And, like after the death of any slightly mysterious but very famous

00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:28.169
person, all sorts of accusations came out about who he actually was.

00:15:29.056 --> 00:15:32.786
Since his death he has been accused of anti-semitism, of

00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:36.626
racism, and of being a manipulator of American culture.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:42.676
But, his critics are far outnumbered by those who have a positive view on him,

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:48.096
and he is considered above all to be the founding father of modern animation.

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:55.094
Since his death, it’s telling that nobody has even come close to achieving what Walt Disney has.

00:15:56.094 --> 00:16:01.054
After he died, his brother, Roy, took over, and the company went from strength to strength.

00:16:02.214 --> 00:16:05.664
Like many successful businesses, it was good at adapting.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:11.222
By the 1980s the market for family films that had been Disney’s bread and

00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:17.322
butter had started to diminish, and there was demand for teenage movies.

00:16:18.382 --> 00:16:23.242
Disney stepped up to the challenge, establishing a new company called Touchstone

00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:27.972
Pictures, and starting to produce films for teenagers and young adults.

00:16:29.032 --> 00:16:32.762
Now, there are some names here that you might not have known were Disney

00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:38.268
films, such as Good Morning, Vietnam, Pretty Woman, and Dead Poets Society.

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:43.258
These were all Touchstone Pictures films, which was ultimately owned by Disney.

00:16:44.011 --> 00:16:47.951
But you wouldn’t see any mention of Disney on the films - the company

00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:51.721
wanted to keep the Disney brand out of the picture, out of sight.

00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.711
And this is a strategy that Disney has continued to this day.

00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:02.141
Firstly there are the films made by companies that are part of the Disney family but

00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:07.721
most people might not be aware are Disney films, such as Armageddon or Pearl Harbour.

00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:13.761
But also Disney has snapped up, it has bought up other production companies,

00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:18.621
it’s bought up the rights to distribute other films, as well as TV channels.

00:17:19.628 --> 00:17:25.358
Now, The Walt Disney company owns ABC, a broadcasting company, a news company.

00:17:25.748 --> 00:17:29.378
It owns ESPN, an American sports network, it owns cruise

00:17:29.378 --> 00:17:32.508
lines, it owns a subscription TV service called Hulu.

00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.588
And in the past decade it has gone on a huge spending spree, a massive shopping trip,

00:17:39.018 --> 00:17:45.878
buying up Lucasfilm, the company behind the Star Wars franchise, and then in 2017 it

00:17:45.908 --> 00:17:51.318
announced that it was acquiring 21st Century Fox, another huge American media company.

00:17:52.288 --> 00:17:56.698
And coming back to the original, family-friendly movies that Disney

00:17:56.698 --> 00:18:01.948
became famous for, it has continued to make smash-hit after smash-hit,

00:18:02.388 --> 00:18:06.548
breaking its own records, and making more and more films every year.

00:18:07.338 --> 00:18:13.018
Indeed, between the animated and non-animated Disney films, so between things

00:18:13.028 --> 00:18:19.064
like Frozen and Star Wars, Disney has made 25 films that have each made over

00:18:19.094 --> 00:18:23.783
a billion dollars at the box office, and that’s before you take into account

00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:29.183
sales of merchandise - toys, pencils, comic books, computer games, and so on.

00:18:30.003 --> 00:18:33.723
We’ll talk more about the actual business of Disney in part two of this

00:18:33.723 --> 00:18:38.284
mini series, but the point to remember is that it is now an absolute

00:18:38.344 --> 00:18:43.574
giant, and has tentacles that stretch far further than most people realise.

00:18:44.964 --> 00:18:48.582
If you look at the mission of Disney, it has changed a bit over

00:18:48.582 --> 00:18:53.022
the years, as would be expected, but it all comes down to creating

00:18:53.022 --> 00:18:58.172
happiness, to provide enjoyment and entertainment for people of all ages.

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:02.927
And as far as that is concerned, it’s hard to debate that the

00:19:02.927 --> 00:19:06.797
world is a lot more magical thanks to Walter Elias Disney.

00:19:09.177 --> 00:19:14.227
OK then, that is it for part one of this three part mini-series on Disney.

00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:19.176
As a reminder, part two is going to be all about the business of Disney, and

00:19:19.176 --> 00:19:23.186
how it has managed to create such a hugely successful commercial enterprise.

00:19:23.456 --> 00:19:27.996
That will be coming out exclusively on the website, leonardoenglish.com, on Tuesday.

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:32.786
And then part three is going to be on some of the theories about why people

00:19:32.786 --> 00:19:37.315
love Disney so much, why it has such a universal appeal, why this isn’t

00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:42.525
going to go anywhere any time soon and how a Disney story is created.

00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:45.385
So, that is all to come.

00:19:46.215 --> 00:19:50.805

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:16.198
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:20.508
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:25.258
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:29.498
mini-series, this time on the loose theme of education.

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:35.628
In part one, today’s episode, we are going to talk about the UK university crisis.

00:00:35.998 --> 00:00:41.198
In part two, we will talk about the history of private tutoring, one-on-one

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:47.138
tutoring, and ask ourselves whether it is the reason for the “geniuses” of the past.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.988
And in part three, we will look into a crystal ball and talk about

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:56.258
some of the most interesting ideas about the future of education.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:02.438
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the UK university crisis.

00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:10.198
When Tony Blair became British Prime Minister in 1997 he proudly said that the

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:17.188
top three priorities of his government would be “education, education, education”.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.178
It was a slogan, but a powerful one.

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:27.748
After all, who doesn’t like the idea of better schools for children, better training and

00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:33.918
pay for teachers, and more young people going to university and getting a quality education?

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:42.028
Since this famous speech, the number of people going to university in the UK has almost doubled.

00:01:43.018 --> 00:01:46.898
There are 2.9 million people studying at universities

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:50.818
in the UK, almost 1 in 20 people in the country.

00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:57.038
And as you may know, the UK has some of the best universities in the world.

00:01:57.648 --> 00:02:02.168
Oxford and Cambridge are two that I imagine you will have heard of, but they are

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:08.758
just two of the country’s 166 universities, many of which are very high quality.

00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:14.578
In fact, the UK is second only to the United States in terms

00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:18.548
of the number of universities in the top 100 in the world.

00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:24.658
But there is a growing crisis at British universities, a series

00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:28.858
of headwinds, dangerous conditions, that threaten to do serious,

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:33.889
longstanding damage to the sector, and as a consequence, to the country.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.509
So, what’s going on?

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:43.329
Well, first let me tell you about some peculiarities of UK universities, and explain

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.239
why they are probably a little different from the universities in your country.

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:55.649
Unlike in many countries, universities in the UK are technically not owned by the government,

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.686
they aren’t “state” in the same way that most universities in Italy or France or Spain are.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.599
They are autonomous institutions, which means they manage their own finances, they choose what to

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.799
teach, and they are responsible for making sure they provide a good education to their students.

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.122
They are run more like a business than a branch of government; it is the

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:24.606
responsibility of the university to attract students, deliver courses,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.516
and make sure that its income is the same or greater than its expenses.

00:03:30.496 --> 00:03:33.966
In other words, it needs to balance its own books.

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:39.186
This doesn’t mean that there is no public funding whatsoever; the British

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:44.226
government does provide some financial support through research grants and public

00:03:44.226 --> 00:03:51.786
funds, but this only accounts for around 28% of the income of UK universities.

00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:56.626
So, where does the rest of the money come from, if it’s not the government?

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.866
Well, the students, for the most part.

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:05.616
Tuition fees, paid directly by university students, make up

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.836
53%–just over half–of the total income at British universities.

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:16.106
As you might know, British universities are expensive to attend.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:26.436
If you are from the UK, as an undergraduate you pay £9,250 per year, so that’s around €11,000.

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:33.386
That’s the maximum you'll pay if you are British, and it’s the same whether you go to the best

00:04:33.386 --> 00:04:39.536
university in the country or the worst, whether you do an expensive course to deliver, like medicine

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:45.586
or veterinary science, or whether you do a less-expensive course, like a humanities subject.

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:52.359
So, just under €11,000 is the absolute maximum you will pay for your tuition.

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:58.859
But if you are an international student there is no limit to the amount you might pay.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.639
International students typically pay between £20,000

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:10.186
and £30,000 per year, so between €25,000 and €35,000.

00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:18.170
And the most expensive course is just under £70,000, or €85,000.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.440
That’s the undergraduate medicine course at Cambridge, by the way, and it lasts for 6

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.650
years, so the tuition fees alone will set back a student almost half a million Euros.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.880
So the dirty little secret, or not really a secret if you look at the student numbers, is

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.570
that the tuition fees British students pay are heavily subsidised by international students.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.063
A Cambridge medical student from China or Saudi Arabia, or anywhere

00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:57.003
outside Britain for that matter, is essentially paying for multiple

00:05:57.013 --> 00:06:01.083
British students to be able to take the course, through the high fees.

00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:05.163
Without international students, the British university

00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:08.614
system as it is currently structured would collapse.

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:14.762
British universities, especially the better ones and on the most intensive

00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:20.782
courses, lose money on every British student that enrols, with one recent report

00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:27.962
putting this figure at an average of £2,500 a year lost on every British student.

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:34.412
Again, if you went to university and you didn’t pay anything, or you paid a

00:06:34.422 --> 00:06:38.742
nominal fee–a few hundred Euros or something–you are probably thinking that this

00:06:38.742 --> 00:06:44.249
sounds ridiculous, and that British universities must be horrendously mismanaged.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.689
They aren’t.

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.169
It’s primarily a question of who pays.

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:57.767
In the UK, the student pays most of it and the government contributes little; in your country, if

00:06:57.777 --> 00:07:04.417
you paid nothing or a nominal fee, it’s the reverse, the government pays most and you pay a little.

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:13.372
And the reality is that this fee, nearly £10,000 a year, might be very high compared to most

00:07:13.382 --> 00:07:19.812
countries, but it isn’t high enough to plug the gap; there is a shortfall between what it

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:25.962
costs to deliver most courses and the amount of money that British students pay to take them.

00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:34.056
One reason is that this fee has only been increased once in 12 years, and given

00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:38.466
the inflation that has happened in this period, it simply isn’t high enough.

00:07:39.486 --> 00:07:45.656
So, universities have been relying on international students to make up the difference.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:53.254
These students, as you’ve heard, pay much higher fees, and in many cases, universities are using

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:59.034
the profit they make from international students to subsidise the education of domestic students.

00:08:00.018 --> 00:08:05.795
It has worked, so far, but this model is teetering on collapse.

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:13.805
For one, it makes universities highly dependent on the continued flow of international students.

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:19.885
Overall at British universities, international students are still very much

00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:25.645
in the minority, making up just under 12% of the undergraduate population.

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:31.965
Yet they contribute just under half of university tuition fee income.

00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:38.640
In other words, a small percentage of the student population pays for everyone else.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.370
This is all good, it’s all fine and dandy when hundreds of thousands of international

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.760
students want to come to the UK to study, but it is a fragile situation.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.860
Just a small drop in the number of international

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.610
students can make the entire system come crashing down.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.190
And this is what’s happening, to a certain extent, at the moment.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.424
After years of rising every year, the number of international

00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:12.374
students enrolling at British universities has started to drop.

00:09:13.864 --> 00:09:16.034
There are a few reasons for this.

00:09:16.534 --> 00:09:18.004
Firstly, Brexit.

00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:24.314
When the UK was part of the European Union, students from EU countries could come

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:29.704
and study at British universities and pay the same tuition fees as domestic students.

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:35.534
Because many EU students enrolled in less-expensive courses to deliver,

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:41.017
for example, humanities subjects, even though they paid the same fees as

00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:45.767
domestic students, they were still a net benefit to British universities.

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:52.947
After Brexit, students from EU countries now have to pay international fees.

00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:59.017
And given that universities in EU countries are often highly subsidised or

00:09:59.027 --> 00:10:05.077
free, someone now has to really want to go to a British university, and more

00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:09.167
importantly, have parents with deep enough pockets to allow them to do so.

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:13.927
Unsurprisingly, the number of students from EU countries

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:20.044
has plummeted, falling by 67% between 2020 and 2023.

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:27.437
Yes, the EU students who are coming are paying more for the privilege, but the overall number

00:10:27.587 --> 00:10:33.617
has dropped so drastically that the total revenue from EU students is significantly down.

00:10:34.777 --> 00:10:39.227
This was something that British universities had suspected would happen ever

00:10:39.227 --> 00:10:44.617
since the Brexit vote back in 2016, and they had made preparations for it.

00:10:45.857 --> 00:10:51.317
Specifically, trying to attract students from countries such as China, India

00:10:51.337 --> 00:10:56.507
and Nigeria, large countries with more than enough aspiring parents who would

00:10:56.517 --> 00:11:00.937
happily pay through the nose to send their child to a British university.

00:11:02.497 --> 00:11:07.617
And at least in the years directly following Brexit, this strategy worked.

00:11:08.707 --> 00:11:13.235
There were just under 13,000 students from Nigeria in 2016,

00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:20.627
but by 2022 this had jumped to 72,000, a 5 times increase.

00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:27.627
It is a similar story with China and India, and these three countries now make

00:11:27.627 --> 00:11:32.857
up more than half of all the international students at British universities.

00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:38.819
But clearly, being so reliant on a few countries is risky.

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:45.019
Any change in diplomatic relations or visa policies, which is particularly

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:48.699
high risk with China, could mean that a major source of international

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:53.497
students, and therefore university revenue, is cut off in an instant.

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:59.927
And internal, domestic changes in these countries can have a similar effect.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:06.667
In the case of Nigeria, as you may know, there was a currency crisis last year, where

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:12.981
the Nigerian currency lost 80% of its value against the British pound, thereby making

00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:18.301
an already expensive British university five times more expensive than it was before.

00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:25.551
It is a little early to see the full impact of this, as the most recent university statistics

00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:33.567
haven’t yet been released, but visa applications from Nigeria are down by more than 50% between July

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:42.011
2023 and June 2024, so the number of Nigerian students is likely to have taken a serious haircut.

00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:47.047
And this brings us nicely on to point number three.

00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:52.021
As you may know, immigration has been an increasingly

00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:55.961
hot potato in British politics over the past few years.

00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:02.411
The previous British government, under Rishi Sunak, tightened the rules on spousal

00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:08.221
visas, visas for partners and dependents of someone working or studying in the country.

00:13:09.527 --> 00:13:15.873
As a result, it became much harder and more expensive for an international student–someone

00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:20.773
doing a postgraduate degree for example–to bring their partner or their family with them.

00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:27.573
Clearly, this has done nothing to increase the attractiveness of British universities.

00:13:28.503 --> 00:13:33.531
Imagine you are someone from Nigeria hoping to study in the UK, you have found your

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:39.401
dream university and been offered a place on the course, but in between applying

00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:44.031
and the course starting your currency has collapsed, making it five times more

00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:48.921
expensive and you then realise that your loved one won’t be able to come with you.

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:55.041
Or you’re from China or India, and your currency might not have collapsed

00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:59.801
but you realise that you can’t take your husband or wife, and the entire

00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:04.771
process of getting a visa has become a lot more complicated and expensive.

00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:09.841
It is hardly surprising that the number of international students has dropped.

00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:12.971
Now, what does this mean?

00:14:13.441 --> 00:14:17.161
Well, the cash cows are no longer so great in number.

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:22.501
And this has led to some serious problems at British universities.

00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:31.171
According to a recent report, 40% of British universities expect to run a deficit this year.

00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:35.631
In other words, almost half will lose money.

00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:41.754
And this isn’t a crisis that affects all British universities equally.

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:49.104
The top-tier universities—places like Oxford, Cambridge, University College London, and the London

00:14:49.104 --> 00:14:54.859
School of Economics—they are still able to attract a steady stream of international students.

00:14:55.349 --> 00:15:00.689
They have prestigious reputations, strong global rankings, and a long history

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:04.329
of academic excellence that appeals to students from all over the world.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:07.065
But what about the other universities?

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:11.595
The less prestigious universities, often outside of

00:15:11.595 --> 00:15:14.785
London or the South East, they don't have the same pull.

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:18.165
They can’t charge the same high fees to international

00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:21.855
students and aren’t as attractive to students from abroad.

00:15:23.095 --> 00:15:27.295
As a result, they are facing significant financial strain.

00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:34.535
It leads to cuts—cuts to academic programmes, cuts to student services, and cuts to staff.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:42.085
Lecturers and support staff lose their jobs, class sizes increase, and students feel the impact.

00:15:42.655 --> 00:15:45.025
The quality of education suffers.

00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.875
And it’s a vicious downward spiral.

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:54.015
Quality decreases therefore they become less attractive, enrolments

00:15:54.135 --> 00:15:58.685
drop even further, more cuts need to be made, and the cycle repeats.

00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:02.935
Of course, lecturers are affected too.

00:16:04.315 --> 00:16:08.215
Over the past few years, lecturers and other university staff

00:16:08.415 --> 00:16:13.095
have gone on strike over pay, pensions, and working conditions.

00:16:14.445 --> 00:16:20.535
The reality is that many of the people working in universities feel underpaid and

00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:27.235
overworked, and they’re often on insecure short-term contracts with little job stability.

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:30.495
So, what’s the solution?

00:16:31.415 --> 00:16:36.756
Well, many universities are having to make tough decisions about the courses that they offer.

00:16:37.776 --> 00:16:41.696
If there aren’t enough students on a course, and it loses money

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:46.066
year after year, it becomes more likely than ever to be cancelled.

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:53.836
And there is increasing discussion by politicians about funnelling students into courses that

00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:59.616
are more likely to have a positive economic impact on the country and away from courses that,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:06.280
statistically speaking, have less economic value, so called “mickey mouse courses” to their critics.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:12.320
Universities are now required by law to publish data on things like the

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.150
percentage of alumni in employment after graduation and their average

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:21.790
salary, and–as you might expect–there are some stark differences.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.190
The average computer science graduate from the University of Oxford has a

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:34.250
first-year salary of £52,000, while for the average drama, dance and cinematics

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:39.633
graduate from the University of Bristol that number is under £20,000.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:45.360
Both of those students, if they are British, domestic students, will

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.140
have paid exactly the same for their tuition but one will leave with a

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.268
degree that is significantly more economically valuable than the other.

00:17:55.532 --> 00:18:00.234
Over the course of a lifetime, statistically speaking the former will

00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:04.626
go on to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in taxes and have a net

00:18:04.696 --> 00:18:08.916
positive impact on the country’s finances, while the other will not.

00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:14.166
Of course, there is the argument to be made that a country full only of computer

00:18:14.166 --> 00:18:19.206
scientists, bankers, lawyers and engineers would be a less attractive place to

00:18:19.206 --> 00:18:23.976
live, and that people should be encouraged to follow their interests and passions.

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:27.599
After all, that’s what university is about, is it not?

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:34.368
But there is the counter argument that it is deceptive for an education system

00:18:34.588 --> 00:18:40.538
to value both degrees equally, and there is enough statistical evidence to show

00:18:40.538 --> 00:18:45.148
that someone studying a subject like drama, dance and cinematics will lead to

00:18:45.148 --> 00:18:50.818
a low salary, and they would probably have been better not taking on loans, and

00:18:50.818 --> 00:18:55.148
instead should have just started some form of vocational training straight away.

00:18:56.348 --> 00:19:01.528
And because this person is unlikely to ever repay the loans for their tuition, which are

00:19:01.528 --> 00:19:07.048
provided by the government, their university studies are essentially funded by the taxpayer.

00:19:08.198 --> 00:19:13.198
Ultimately, the question is this: should universities primarily serve

00:19:13.198 --> 00:19:18.348
the economy, or should they provide a broad and diverse education that

00:19:18.378 --> 00:19:22.798
enriches society in ways that aren’t always measurable in economic terms?

00:19:24.268 --> 00:19:29.318
This is, in some ways, the crux of the UK university crisis.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:34.008
It’s not just about money—it’s about the role of universities in the 21st

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:38.708
century, and what kind of education we believe is worth investing in.

00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:44.068
Should British students be pushed towards “value for money” degrees in

00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:48.198
subjects like science and technology, which are more likely to result

00:19:48.198 --> 00:19:51.928
in higher salaries for them and more economic benefits for the country?

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:57.288
Or should British students be free to study whatever they want, with their

00:19:57.288 --> 00:20:01.798
fees being subsidised by masses of international students paying sky-high fees?

00:20:02.438 --> 00:20:06.018
Should a greater financial burden be placed on British students,

00:20:06.318 --> 00:20:09.968
with domestic fees increasing to match the real cost of tuition?

00:20:10.618 --> 00:20:13.938
Or should the government step up to plug the gap?

00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:20.028
There are many warning signs that the current situation is not sustainable,

00:20:20.348 --> 00:20:24.778
with almost 1 in 2 British universities losing money every year.

00:20:26.078 --> 00:20:28.238
Clearly, this cannot continue.

00:20:29.488 --> 00:20:33.948
Britain has an almost 1,000-year history of higher education,

00:20:34.348 --> 00:20:38.188
with the University of Oxford being founded in the year 1096.

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:46.448
There are now 166 universities in Britain, and not a single one has ever gone bankrupt.

00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:53.578
That is an impressive record, and time will only tell how long it will last.

00:20:55.314 --> 00:20:59.891
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the UK university crisis.

00:21:00.231 --> 00:21:04.249
I hope it's been an interesting one, and if you were wondering about how British

00:21:04.249 --> 00:21:08.709
universities worked, well that it has shone a little light on the subject.

00:21:09.429 --> 00:21:13.019
As a reminder, this is part one of a three-part mini-series.

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:18.359
Next up will be a look at private, 1:1 tuition and the concept of genius.

00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:24.429
And in part three we will look into our crystal ball and talk about the future of education.

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:29.389
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:34.899
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

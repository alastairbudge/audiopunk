Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:15.438
Minds by Leonardo English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:21.168
learn interesting things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.479
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:30.464
to be talking about etymologies, where words come from.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:38.714
We'll first talk about some interesting and weird ones, we'll then talk about some

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:43.567
etymologies that most people think are true but actually aren't.

00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:50.797
And then we will finish with some pretty common words that people just have no idea

00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:56.692
where they came from, and we will have a bit of a think about what this might mean.

00:00:57.472 --> 00:00:58.732
It's going to be an exciting one.

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:02.512
Okay then let's get started.

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:11.362
First up is the word 'decimate', which now in English means to

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:16.282
kill a large number of something or to reduce something severely.

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:24.457
So colloquially you might hear someone using the word decimate for a big win

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:28.987
at a football match, for example, that team was decimated by the other one.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.518
Now the Latin scholars among you might recognise

00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:40.018
something here, and indeed the word decimate does have Latin roots.

00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:45.553
You might see the first part of it 'deci', D, E, C I,

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:49.783
you might think that has got something to do with 10.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:52.113
And you would be right.

00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:54.783
There is a connection with the number 10.

00:01:55.737 --> 00:02:01.583
The connection is that the Roman army would punish groups of mutinous

00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:09.173
soldiers, soldiers who had tried to rise up, to escape or do something else that they shouldn't

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:14.962
have, and they would punish them by killing one out of every 10 of them.

00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:19.732
So the word started out as a very

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:24.202
precise term, to reduce something in size by a 10th.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:32.422
However, it has sort of morphed, it has changed into meaning completely destroy

00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:38.286
or obliterate, which has a ruffled a few feathers, it has annoyed

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:44.826
a few linguistic purists who say that it's a tragedy that now the accepted

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:51.006
definition is just to destroy when historically it had a very specific definition.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:56.376
The response given by the Cambridge Dictionary to

00:02:56.406 --> 00:03:00.711
these linguistic purists was, 'well, words change,

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:06.081
language changes, language always evolves and just deal with it'.

00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:12.933
Secondly, we have the word 'nightmare', when you have a bad dream.

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:18.160
Now, if you look at this word you might think it is formed

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.770
of two different parts: night, I think we know what night is, it's the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:31.750
opposite of day and mare, which you may know is the word for a female horse.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.910
So you might think, hang on female horse in the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.230
night, that's strange, but it doesn't make much sense.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.820
In fact, mare in this case doesn't actually refer to a female horse, Alastair Budge:

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.720
but refers to a female goblin, a little monster, a little evil spirit.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.950
This evil spirit was thought to sit on your chest while you slept and

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.050
give you this feeling of suffocation, of not being able to breathe.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.150
And interestingly enough, it isn't just in English that there was this idea that nightmares

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:22.750
were caused by animals or spirits coming to visit you in the night and disturbing your sleep.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.500
Similar sorts of ideas and words also exist in various Scandinavian languages and in German.

00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:38.669
Our next weird and wonderful etymology is one that regular

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.209
listeners of this podcast might be aware of, and that is the sandwich.

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.779
Now I'm sure you know what a sandwich is, maybe you've even eaten a sandwich today.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.519
Statistically tens of millions of people will eat a sandwich today.

00:04:57.141 --> 00:05:04.398
But the term sandwich actually comes from the 18th Century when a British man

00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:12.499
called the Earl of Sandwich was too involved in a game of cards and requested to

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:20.059
be brought a slice of meat between two pieces of bread so that he could continue his card game.

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:25.077
Soon enough, people were just asking for 'what

00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:29.787
sandwich has', and this was just shortened to 'sandwich'.

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:33.052
I should say that there is a lot more to

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:37.312
that story, and we actually made an entire episode about it.

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:40.882
It's Episode 19 if you haven't listened to it already.

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:45.970
Next on our list of interesting etymologies comes a

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.130
word that you probably have heard a lot more of in the past couple

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.390
of months than in the past 20 years, and that word is quarantine.

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:03.259
Now, the word quarantine, just to clarify, in case you need

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:09.729
a reminder, is the period of time during which an animal or person that might

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.079
have a disease is kept away from other people or animals

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.579
so that the disease cannot spread, so that other people can not get it.

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:24.995
And for the Italians listening, you may know the origin of this word already.

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:31.285
You would certainly recognise the first part of the word 'quarant' in Italian,

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:36.412
pronounced 'quarant', which sounds a lot like quaranta, 40 in Italian.

00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:44.367
But why would quarantine come from the Italian word for the number 40?

00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:52.751
Well, back in the 14th century, the plague, the black death was ravaging Europe.

00:06:53.951 --> 00:07:00.001
The city of Venice was one of the great ports of Europe, and a great centre for trade.

00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:07.821
Understandably, Venice didn't want to completely cut off trade and stop ships

00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:13.551
from arriving, but it did want to stop the arrival of people with the plague.

00:07:14.253 --> 00:07:15.385
So what did it do?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.188
It made ships that were coming from ports where they had the plague, it made

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:28.528
them wait off shore for 40 days until the passengers were allowed to come ashore.

00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:36.088
The logic being that this would be enough time for symptoms to develop, and if

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:41.368
nothing had happened after 40 days, well then it was fine to allow the sailors ashore.

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:48.173
And it's from this, from the 40 day rule that quarantine comes.

00:07:49.123 --> 00:07:50.173
Fascinating, right?

00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:54.441
So we've talked about a few weird and wonderful

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:59.931
etymologies in English, but of course for words like quarantine, the

00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.731
equivalent in languages like Spanish and French are also pretty similar.

00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:10.011
So they aren't unique to English, but they are pretty interesting nonetheless.

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:18.186
Now it's time to talk about a few more weird and wonderful origins of words, words

00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:25.446
with fantastic backstories that lots of people know and talk about, but there's only one problem.

00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:29.736
And that problem is that they aren't true.

00:08:31.123 --> 00:08:33.673
But they do come with an interesting story,

00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:37.933
so it's worth talking about a few of them, in any case.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.910
Firstly, it is the origin of the word quiz.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.260
Q U I Z.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:52.790
Now, legend has it that there was a Dublin theatre owner who made a bet

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:59.575
that he could create a new nonsense word in English, a word that made

00:08:59.575 --> 00:09:06.325
no sense, and within 48 hours, everyone in Dublin would be using it.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:14.213
To do this he reportedly got a load of street children to go and write this word

00:09:14.633 --> 00:09:21.743
on the walls all over Dublin so that people would see it, be surprised and start talking about it.

00:09:22.852 --> 00:09:24.733
The word was quiz.

00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:29.036
The story goes that the whole of Dublin was

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:33.776
talking about this weird word and they weren't sure what it was.

00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:42.566
They thought it was a kind of test to figure out the meaning, so a quiz was just a kind of test.

00:09:44.256 --> 00:09:48.606
It is a great story, but unfortunately that's all it is.

00:09:48.906 --> 00:09:51.366
There is just no evidence that it is true.

00:09:53.068 --> 00:09:57.002
Another word origin story that is quite

00:09:57.002 --> 00:10:01.742
well known in Britain is the origin of the word 'posh'.

00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:11.262
So 'posh', if you don't know, generally means of a high social class or expensive

00:10:11.262 --> 00:10:17.412
and high quality, a person can be posh, but so can a restaurant, a bar, and so on.

00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:25.092
The story goes that the word 'posh', P O S H was an

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:30.192
abbreviation for port out, starboard home.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:37.392
On a ship port is the left side and starboard is the right side.

00:10:38.657 --> 00:10:45.947
The theory has it that when Brits used to travel from Britain to India

00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:53.777
by ship, the most desirable cabins in the ship were on the port side on

00:10:53.777 --> 00:10:59.717
the way out, on the way there, and on the starboard side on the way home.

00:11:00.977 --> 00:11:06.467
So if you had more money to spend on a nice cabin, then you would

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:12.019
have the posh ticket, the port out, starboard home.

00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:15.479
And the only problem with this explanation?

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:19.229
There isn't any evidence for it whatsoever.

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:27.879
I can't tell you the number of times that I have heard people telling me that theory and it

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:34.369
was only doing the research for this episode that I realised that it was completely made up.

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:39.619
I actually had it on my list of words with interesting etymologies

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.665
only to find out that it was completely untrue.

00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:50.225
And this actually takes us onto our next point quite nicely,

00:11:50.615 --> 00:11:54.545
which is just to talk about the origin of words in general.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.258
English, as I'm sure you know, is a beautiful but messy mix

00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:07.948
of lots of different languages: old German, Norse, Latin, Greek, all sorts

00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:13.858
of other languages have had a role in developing English into what it is now.

00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:19.318
And every word started somewhere for a reason.

00:12:20.548 --> 00:12:22.888
That reason might be very logical.

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:26.478
Or it could be just completely random.

00:12:27.868 --> 00:12:32.698
But the first variant, the first version of every word,

00:12:32.728 --> 00:12:37.228
was decided by someone, somewhere for a particular reason.

00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:44.828
Linguists and historians have a lot of fun trying to trace to, to

00:12:44.828 --> 00:12:50.798
find the etymology of certain words, but there are some in English

00:12:51.376 --> 00:12:53.903
that they just have no idea where they came from.

00:12:55.443 --> 00:13:00.843
Some of these words are so common that you might think 'really?

00:13:01.713 --> 00:13:06.377
People have got no idea where that word came from?' I was certainly

00:13:06.377 --> 00:13:10.847
surprised when I looked into this and I wanted to share a few of them with you.

00:13:13.077 --> 00:13:14.667
Firstly 'big'.

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:20.367
Now you know what 'big' means, but only fairly recently, did it

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:25.257
become the main way of describing something that was large in size.

00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:34.897
Until the 14th century, people used to use the word 'great', or even the old English word, ‘mickle’.

00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:40.530
Big' just seems to have appeared out of nowhere, and nobody seems to know why.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:48.990
There are a few theories, perhaps it's from the Scandinavian word for a rich and powerful man.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.510
Or maybe there was someone called big, a Mr.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.010
Big, who I imagine was big, and that's where it came from.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:08.310
Anyway, this is probably one of the first words that any English language learner learns, yet we

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:15.600
have pretty much no idea where it comes from, certainly no definitive evidence about its origin.

00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:20.632
Secondly, and this is another word that

00:14:20.632 --> 00:14:25.132
you will know, it is 'bad', the opposite of 'good'.

00:14:26.582 --> 00:14:31.892
We have some pretty reasonable ideas about the origins of the word 'good.'

00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:39.276
And it's very similar to the German word for the same concept, but 'bad' is unique.

00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:45.156
We don't have any concrete evidence for where it actually came from.

00:14:46.231 --> 00:14:51.361
There are a few theories, such as it was a shortening of the

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:58.381
old English word for hermaphrodite, 'bæddel', but people just don't know.

00:14:58.906 --> 00:15:03.286
And it has troubled historical linguists for years.

00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:12.287
And finally it's the word 'girl', and there's a bit of a fun story to this one too.

00:15:14.307 --> 00:15:19.737
So the point is that we know some of the roots, the etymologies

00:15:19.797 --> 00:15:24.627
of some words that mean a similar thing to 'girl' in English.

00:15:26.037 --> 00:15:32.937
The word 'maiden' has German roots and the word 'damsel' has French roots.

00:15:33.987 --> 00:15:37.347
These are both pretty old words, so don't worry if you

00:15:37.347 --> 00:15:40.167
don't recognise them or you haven't heard of them before.

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:45.087
But 'girl', we just really don't know.

00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:49.497
One interesting thing about the word girl though,

00:15:49.977 --> 00:15:53.904
is that it just used to mean child of either sex.

00:15:54.624 --> 00:16:00.594
So you could have a girl who was male, actually called a 'knave girl'.

00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:08.024
I should of course, point out that this stopped over 500 years ago, and I think that

00:16:08.024 --> 00:16:15.524
if you called a 14 year old boy, a 'knave girl', well, he probably wouldn't be very happy with you.

00:16:17.404 --> 00:16:23.614
Okay then that is it for this little look at some weird etymologies in English.

00:16:24.154 --> 00:16:28.084
I hope that it has been an interesting one and that you have discovered

00:16:28.084 --> 00:16:33.094
a few new things about the English language that you didn't know 20 minutes ago.

00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:43.024
As a native speaker in English at least, you probably know 15 to 20,000 words, but you never

00:16:43.024 --> 00:16:50.284
really stop to think twice about where they came from, about the fact that some of these words have

00:16:50.284 --> 00:16:57.244
been said by people for hundreds, thousands of years and have a fascinating history behind them.

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:05.539
And even for those words that we don't know the origin of, I find this equally fascinating

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:12.319
in one way, the fact that a word as common as a 'big' or 'bad', which have probably

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:18.559
been said hundreds of thousands of times by people, even in the short time you've been

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:24.109
listening to this podcast, yet we have really no idea at all where they came from.

Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:15.538
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:20.598
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:27.918
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.248
It is a place deep in the Arctic Archipelago, where copies

00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:37.748
of almost all the seeds in the world are kept as a backup.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.828
It’s an awesome project that I only recently found out

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.338
about, so I’m thrilled to share this episode with you today.

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:49.818
So, let’s just get right into it.

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:57.948
Deep inside a mountain, on a super remote island to the north of Norway, is this amazing

00:00:57.948 --> 00:01:04.738
place called the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, or Svalbard globale frøhvelv in Norwegian.

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:08.668
Apologies to any Norwegians listening if my pronunciation

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.048
was a little off, but I think that was about right.

00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:18.808
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is essentially the world’s backup for seeds.

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:26.548
If you think of backing up your photos or files on an external hard drive, and

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:31.958
then putting that somewhere safe, that is one way to think about what the Svalbard

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:38.648
Global Seed Vault is, apart from it’s for seeds, for the things that form crops.

00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:45.568
There are over 8 billion people on the planet right now, and that

00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:50.408
obviously requires a mammoth amount of food to keep us all alive.

00:01:51.938 --> 00:01:56.008
Despite the fact that there are more people on the planet today than

00:01:56.008 --> 00:02:01.728
ever before, and we require more food than ever before, the diversity

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:07.358
of plants and animals that exist today is less than any time in history.

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:14.728
For crops, for the plants that we eat, the diversity has reduced and reduced, as

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:21.078
humans tend towards a bunch of crops that are the easiest and cheapest to grow.

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:28.388
The others are pushed out, and once the last one dies, unless there is a seed

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:33.648
from which more can grow, they are gone, they are extinguished from the world.

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:42.428
Indeed, now only about 30 different crops provide 95% of all of our food.

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:48.808
In China, before mass agricultural reform and the mass production

00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:53.668
of crops, a wide variety of different kinds of rice was eaten.

00:02:55.068 --> 00:03:01.918
Now, only 10% of the rice varieties that were eaten in 1950 are cultivated.

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:06.148
The rest is gone, or at least, not in use.

00:03:07.848 --> 00:03:10.438
If you are surprised by this, I don’t blame you.

00:03:11.238 --> 00:03:11.858
I was too.

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:20.068
But if you’re thinking, ‘so what’, then it’s worth talking about why concentrating

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:26.398
our food supply into such a small number of crops is a problem, or at least a risk.

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:31.898
There’s a phrase in English which is ‘variety is the spice

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:36.848
of life’, and in the case of crops, it's pretty true.

00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:43.398
Having an effective monoculture, where there really isn’t much variety, means that

00:03:43.398 --> 00:03:48.998
we are at a much greater danger of things like diseases that affect an entire type of

00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:55.678
crop, or unforeseen weather patterns that have a huge effect on another kind of crop.

00:03:56.988 --> 00:04:00.698
If you have hundreds of different varieties, and one gets

00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:04.438
wiped out, it gets destroyed, that’s not a huge issue.

00:04:05.398 --> 00:04:09.298
But if you only have one or two varieties, and one

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:12.658
gets wiped out, then obviously you are in trouble.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:20.168
The idea behind the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is to act as the world’s backup.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:29.268
Almost every country has its own backups, its own reserves of seeds in its own vault, but since

00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:37.368
its founding in 2008, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has served the role of backup of the backup.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:43.968
If a country runs out of a particular crop, and there are no seeds left

00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:49.318
available in its own storage, its own backup, then it can go to the

00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:53.978
Svalbard Global Seed Vault and retrieve the seeds that it deposited there.

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:56.458
Pretty cool, right?

00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:00.528
And not just cool in theory, but also cool in practice.

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:10.238
In 2015, after the civil war, Syria lost access to its own genebank, its own store of seeds.

00:05:11.088 --> 00:05:14.958
The Syrian scientists and researchers who were working with

00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.528
these kinds of seeds had lost all access to their seeds.

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:27.838
Luckily, Syria had deposited seeds with the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and the scientists were

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:35.558
able to get their samples of wheat, chickpeas, lentils, and other seeds, and start work again.

00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:41.428
They planted the seeds, generated more seeds, and have now been able to

00:05:41.568 --> 00:05:47.488
redeposit seeds back in the bank, to put more seeds back in the bank.

00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:52.618
This is an example of how it works in practice, and fortunately this wasn’t

00:05:52.668 --> 00:05:57.618
a completely catastrophic situation that needed to be resolved - these

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:01.748
seeds did exist, the scientists just didn’t have access to them.

00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:10.698
But you can imagine how, in the case of some huge plague, nuclear holocaust, or

00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:16.578
something else that completely decimated the food supplies of an entire country

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:22.538
or region, you can see the vital role that the Svalbard Global Seed Vault plays.

00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:28.778
It’s a pretty amazing idea, that there is this one organisation

00:06:29.048 --> 00:06:33.108
that exists for the benefit of everyone in the world.

00:06:34.508 --> 00:06:36.698
It is a non-political organisation.

00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:41.698
It’s managed by three different parties - the Norwegian government,

00:06:42.098 --> 00:06:46.868
something called the Crop Trust, and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center.

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:51.848
But there is no international diplomacy required,

00:06:51.888 --> 00:06:55.488
no rules about what countries can and can’t use it.

00:06:56.328 --> 00:07:00.208
There are seeds from North Korea that sit next to seeds

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.918
from South Korea, and close to seeds from the United States.

00:07:04.798 --> 00:07:09.758
There was a quote I liked from a spokesperson for the seed vault, a

00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:14.348
man called Brian Lainoff, who said “the seeds don’t care that there

00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:17.678
are North Korean seeds and South Korean seeds in the same aisle.

00:07:18.198 --> 00:07:21.918
They are cold and safe up there, and that’s all that really matters.”

00:07:23.258 --> 00:07:30.288
In the era of countries viewing each kind of international agreement as a way to play political

00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:35.928
games and get an advantage over another country, I think this is a pretty special thing.

00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:41.558
Of course it’s in the advantage of every country for us to preserve the

00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:48.118
diversity of seeds around the world, but making this happen is less obvious.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:55.738
You could say that it’s obvious that every country should work together to solve global

00:07:55.748 --> 00:08:01.409
health problems or to reduce the impact of climate change, however we all know with

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:07.189
both of these examples that just having the right intentions isn’t always enough.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:14.419
To achieve what the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has done is very impressive, and

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:20.239
it’s worth just spending a few minutes thinking about how it has managed to do it.

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:27.619
Firstly, it’s partly managed by the Norwegian government, and Norway has proved to

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:33.439
be a country that is sufficiently wealthy, isolated, and independent that it doesn’t

00:08:33.439 --> 00:08:40.039
need to be entering into agreements with other countries and playing global politics.

00:08:41.319 --> 00:08:44.559
Secondly, the location of the vault helps.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:49.719
You heard at the start that it is deep in the Arctic Archipelago,

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:54.589
but it’s worth stressing just how far that is away from anywhere.

00:08:56.099 --> 00:09:03.309
It’s over 2,000 km from Oslo, 800 km north of the northernmost

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:09.369
part of Norway, and it’s only about 1,000 km from the North Pole.

00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:16.689
The distance from Oslo to the global seed vault is only just less than the distance

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:24.359
from London to Greenland, so that gives you a sense of quite how isolated it is.

00:09:25.582 --> 00:09:29.702
Being that close to the North Pole, in summer there almost

00:09:29.732 --> 00:09:33.752
isn’t a night, and in winter, night never really ends.

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:41.002
The tiny island that it is on is home to only around 2,000 people.

00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:48.998
The vault itself is cut right into a mountain, and it is about 150 metres underground.

00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:54.038
There’s a large tunnel that leads to it, and it consists

00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:57.888
of three rooms which are filled with boxes of seeds.

00:09:59.588 --> 00:10:05.488
Being almost at the North Pole, and submerged under a large icy mountain keeps

00:10:05.488 --> 00:10:10.178
it pretty cold, but the temperatures are monitored closely to make sure that

00:10:10.178 --> 00:10:15.878
it’s always minus 18 degrees Celsius in the vault, to keep the seeds frozen.

00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:23.658
So, the fact that it is so isolated, completely in the middle of nowhere, and that

00:10:23.658 --> 00:10:29.148
it’s on an island with polar bears means you don’t have to invest in the same kind

00:10:29.148 --> 00:10:34.648
of security that you would do if the vault were in the middle of a populated country.

00:10:36.018 --> 00:10:43.348
And since it opened, in 2008, this seed vault has been used by almost every country in the world.

00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:50.308
It is able to store 4.5 million varieties of seeds, and each variety

00:10:50.388 --> 00:10:56.978
can have 500 different seeds, so there is space for 2.5 billion seeds.

00:10:58.428 --> 00:11:01.168
The good news is that it’s not full yet.

00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:07.491
It currently holds just under a million types of seeds, from bog standard

00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:13.521
things like major varieties of corn or wheat, through to obscure types

00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:18.531
of seeds from countries all over East Asia, South America, and Africa.

00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:26.261
Seeds that might not be in danger now, but if there’s a drought or an infestation of

00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:33.031
pests, and if the original backups in those countries are lost, for whatever reason,

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:39.481
then the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is the world’s insurance policy for those seeds.

00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:47.711
And to make things even better, and to remove any barriers that a country might have from depositing

00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:53.961
seeds with the Global Seed Bank, it’s completely free for countries to deposit seeds there.

00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:59.671
The Norwegian government and The Crop Trust pay for the operational

00:11:59.691 --> 00:12:03.651
costs of keeping the seeds, the countries don’t pay a penny.

00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:11.711
There is, however, some bad news, and some problems that are lying ahead for the Global Seed Bank.

00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:18.171
Ironically enough, one of the problems that the vault is facing is one that

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:24.121
the vault was created, at least partially, to protect against - global warming.

00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:32.041
The seed bank needs to be kept at -18 degrees for the seeds to keep, for them to be preserved.

00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:38.921
The area around Svalbard is heating as the ice melts, and the vault is having to deal

00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:44.091
with more and more pressures to keep the seed bank at the same, freezing temperature.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:50.841
It’s a cruel twist of fate, but a reminder of how these challenges affect us all.

00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:56.141
Like an insurance policy, the aim for the Svalbard Global Seed

00:12:56.181 --> 00:13:00.971
Vault is for it never to need to be called upon, never to be used.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.661
It exists as a backup of a backup, something to be turned

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:09.191
to after all other possibilities have been exhausted.

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:13.731
It has been dubbed the Noah’s Ark of seeds.

00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:20.581
We just have to hope that the tide never rises, and we don’t have a need for that particular boat.

00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:28.091
OK then, that is it for this episode on the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

00:13:28.761 --> 00:13:33.681
It’s the story of what happens when countries collaborate for something that is in

00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:39.101
everyone’s benefit, and the story of what can be achieved when we actually do so.

00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:46.501
It’s an example for us all, and there are a lot of learnings that we can all take from its story.

00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:51.791
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:13:52.201 --> 00:13:54.911
If you have ever been to the Svalbard Global Seed

00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:57.631
Vault, I would love to know what your experience was.

00:13:58.161 --> 00:14:04.961
It’s not a tourist attraction, it’s a working vault, but the island does sound absolutely amazing.

00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:10.241
Or even if you haven’t been there, please do get in touch - I’d love to hear from you.

00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:14.831

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.080
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.740
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.710
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the National

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.520
Rifle Association, the NRA, the American pro-gun control organisation.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.000
It is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.240
United States, and holds immense power over politicians.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.900
You may well have heard of it, and seen its representatives on

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.040
TV defending the right of Americans to bear arms, to carry guns.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.740
But you might not know that it wasn’t always so controversial, and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.810
it used to be a very different organisation to the one we see today.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.440
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about the origin of the NRA, where it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.311
came from and what it used to do, how it has developed over the years, how influential

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:25.351
it has become, and how it continues to dominate the debate on gun ownership.

00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:30.903
Before we get right into today’s episode though, I want to remind you that you

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:35.743

Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:02:08.123 --> 00:02:13.923
it the most interesting place for curious people like you to improve their English.

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:18.783
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:23.463
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:31.303
OK then, the National Rifle Association, the NRA.

00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:39.413
If you look on its website, nra.org, you will see that the NRA describes

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:44.093
itself as “America's longest-standing civil rights organization.

00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:49.843
Together with our more than five million members, we're proud defenders

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:55.163
of history's patriots and diligent protectors of the Second Amendment.”

00:02:56.243 --> 00:03:01.173
To clarify, the Second Amendment is the amendment to the United

00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:06.753
States Constitution, and protects the right to keep and bear arms.

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:10.053
Essentially, to own and carry a gun.

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:19.323
This is what the NRA does now, but when it first got going, its purpose was very different.

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:25.193
After the American Civil War, which finished in 1865,

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:28.453
a small group of American soldiers got together.

00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:35.173
They had noticed that lots of their soldiers were actually not very good at

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:41.423
shooting, they weren’t very good at managing their guns and hitting their targets.

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:48.323
Indeed, a Union Army general, Ambrose Burnside, complained that out of

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:55.013
1,000 shots that were fired by his men, only one hit a Confederate soldier.

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:59.433
Put simply, the soldiers were rubbish with guns.

00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:05.343
Despite the civil war being over, they looked across the ocean to

00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:10.553
Europe, and saw the continuous wars that had plagued the continent.

00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:17.223
The world was far from a peaceful place, and if there was to be similar

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:22.643
violence again in the United States, or if the United States was invaded,

00:04:22.883 --> 00:04:27.683
then it would be a good thing to have people who knew how to use guns.

00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:33.323
Gun technology was improving, they were getting more accurate, and so with the

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:38.523
right training, the US could be much better prepared if it needed to fight.

00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:44.913
So, in 1871, the National Rifle Association was created.

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:46.693
Its purpose?

00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:49.323
To train people how to use guns.

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:53.943
It built a shooting range, a place where people could

00:04:53.953 --> 00:04:58.663
practise, and encouraged people to start their own rifle clubs.

00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:06.593
It’s important to note that at this time anybody could have a gun - the NRA existed to

00:05:06.593 --> 00:05:12.463
help people get better at using them, rather than to protect people’s rights to have them.

00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:17.713
And given that the world was going through a tumultuous period, a

00:05:18.023 --> 00:05:23.983
period of change, and America was about to enter into two world wars,

00:05:24.263 --> 00:05:29.303
having men who knew how to use guns was not a controversial idea at all.

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:33.193
Quite the opposite - it was considered to be very sensible.

00:05:34.113 --> 00:05:43.823
Indeed, until 1927 the US Department of War provided free ammunition, free bullets, for gun clubs.

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:51.291
And the American President, Ulysses S Grant, was an early President of the NRA.

00:05:52.313 --> 00:06:00.153
In fact, in the early 1930s the NRA actually helped to introduce some of the first

00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:06.413
gun control laws in the US, when submachine guns, the really fast machine guns,

00:06:06.543 --> 00:06:12.923
and sawn-off shotguns, which were guns mainly used by gangsters, were banned.

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:18.473
So, at this time the NRA was a far cry from what it is now.

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:24.743
Back then, it was actually helping the government to create laws to limit gun ownership.

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:26.578
Surprising, right?

00:06:27.383 --> 00:06:34.033
The NRA’s support for gun control continued into the 1960s, even partially

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:39.703
supporting something called the Gun Control Act, which was passed in 1968.

00:06:40.393 --> 00:06:48.623
The 1960s had seen some high profile assassinations: John F Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:54.983
Bobby Kennedy, and there was a growing public feeling that more should be done to make it

00:06:55.013 --> 00:07:01.363
harder for people to get a gun because, well, a gun is a very effective way of killing someone.

00:07:02.473 --> 00:07:06.887
It was shortly after this bill, though, that the NRA

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:10.943
morphed, it changed, into something very different.

00:07:11.813 --> 00:07:19.143
It went from being an organisation that supported gun use and gun training, with some limitations,

00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:26.783
to one that essentially vigorously opposed every restriction proposed against gun ownership.

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:31.863
From the early 70s, it found an incredibly effective

00:07:31.863 --> 00:07:35.243
way of doing this, which it has been doing ever since.

00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:43.493
Political lobbying, so paying to try to influence the decisions of politicians and lawmakers.

00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:52.193
Since the NRA created its lobbying arm, its lobbying department, in 1971, it has

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:59.633
constantly pushed legislators to relax, or rather avoid tightening, gun control laws.

00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:03.243
And it has been immensely successful.

00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:10.003
Although there have been some temporary bans on gun control, US gun control laws are

00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:16.851
pretty similar to what they were after the Gun Control Act of 1968, more than 50 years ago.

00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:25.651
Since 1968, over one and a half million Americans have been killed by guns during “peacetime”.

00:08:25.997 --> 00:08:32.744
That's more than the 1.2 million Americans who have been killed in every war in US history.

00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:38.354
Now, this isn’t to say that guns should or shouldn’t be banned or

00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:42.454
regulated, but it is amazing to think that there has been very little

00:08:42.464 --> 00:08:47.760
change in the gun laws despite these literally millions of deaths.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:55.130
Bringing us to the present day, and what the NRA has been doing for the past 50 years

00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:01.690
or so, it has continued its change from a relatively small organisation teaching people

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:09.280
how to use guns to a huge, sprawling organisation with a reported more than 5 million

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.390
members across the United States, with one in every 40 American adults a member.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:23.010
It relies on contributions from these members to support its work, but it also receives

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:30.540
donations from gun manufacturers, and makes money from selling magazines, advertising and so on.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:37.000
Of course, if an organisation is funded by gun companies and people passionate

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.900
about guns, well, it’s obvious what its policies are going to be on gun control.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.900
So, where does all this money go?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.430
Well, on doing everything it possibly can to promote

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.110
gun usage and limit gun control in the United States.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.730
Broadly, this can be put into five main categories:

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.110
Firstly, political lobbying.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:09.543
The NRA is one of the most powerful interest-groups in Washington DC, and it works

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:15.133
hard to persuade politicians to support gun rights at every level of government.

00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:21.153
Secondly, it supports political candidates who are pro-guns.

00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:27.963
It supports them through donations, through telling its members to vote for them, and uses all

00:10:27.963 --> 00:10:35.353
the tools at its disposal to make sure politicians favourable to gun ownership are elected.

00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:40.713
And thirdly, on the flip side of this, it does everything it can

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:45.493
to fight politicians who they believe to be anti-gun ownership.

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:51.502
From running negative adverts about them to telling their members how terrible

00:10:51.502 --> 00:10:57.252
they are, it fiercely fights candidates it believes to be anti-gun control.

00:10:58.192 --> 00:11:04.032
As an example of this, in the 2016 presidential election between Donald

00:11:04.042 --> 00:11:09.382
Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Trump campaign was given $30 million

00:11:09.382 --> 00:11:15.132
by the NRA, $19 million of which went on attacking Hillary Clinton.

00:11:16.082 --> 00:11:24.472
The NRA even makes it very clear for people to see a politician’s view on gun control, and produces

00:11:24.722 --> 00:11:32.072
detailed scorecards about politicians, giving them a score for how much they support gun rights.

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:39.032
The fourth activity, which is really thousands of different activities rolled

00:11:39.052 --> 00:11:45.472
into one, is to do all sorts of what’s called grassroots campaigns supporting

00:11:45.642 --> 00:11:51.132
and encouraging the use of guns, from shooting clubs to sponsoring events.

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:57.092
This is really what it has always done, and has the effect of encouraging

00:11:57.162 --> 00:12:02.374
an interest in gun ownership, and ultimately, public support of the NRA.

00:12:03.534 --> 00:12:09.114
Now, the final main activity of the NRA could be described as being the

00:12:09.114 --> 00:12:15.176
public face of gun ownership and of controlling the media debate about guns.

00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:22.766
Whenever there is a public debate about guns in the US, the NRA makes sure that

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:29.386
it is part of it, with its leaders staunchly defending the right to gun ownership.

00:12:30.336 --> 00:12:37.116
In the US, these debates tend to happen, tragically, after every mass shooting.

00:12:38.096 --> 00:12:45.436
The NRA has a tried and tested formula for what to do after a mass shooting.

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:52.056
It stays quiet for a little while, offers sympathy to the victims

00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:56.126
and their family, and condemns the actions of an evil killer.

00:12:56.906 --> 00:13:01.956
Then, when there are the obvious questions about “how did this person get a

00:13:01.956 --> 00:13:07.206
gun?”, and “could this tragedy have been avoided if there was more strict gun

00:13:07.206 --> 00:13:14.006
control?”, one of the NRA spokespeople goes on conservative TV defending guns.

00:13:14.826 --> 00:13:18.736
The defence normally follows the same arguments.

00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:25.776
Firstly, guns don’t kill people, people kill people, and actually it is society

00:13:25.956 --> 00:13:31.316
with its violent video games, movies and rap music that should be blamed.

00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:36.816
It points to countries like Switzerland, where around 1 in 4 people

00:13:36.826 --> 00:13:40.936
have a gun, yet the gun crime rate is tiny, it is very small.

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:47.456
Secondly, they add that the the right to carry a gun is enshrined in the US

00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:53.036
constitution - it’s something that is a God-given right, and should never be taken away.

00:13:53.586 --> 00:13:59.646
And finally, perhaps even grotesquely, that perhaps if more people had

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:04.706
guns then this tragedy could have been averted, it could have been avoided.

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:12.326
Here’s the boss of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, saying exactly that multiple times.

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:19.136
The only thing only way, the best way, the surest way to stop a bad

00:14:19.136 --> 00:14:24.826
guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun is a good woman with a gun.

00:14:27.496 --> 00:14:30.976
Good guys, carrying guns can and do, make a difference.

00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:37.046
The surest way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:46.876
And after a certain amount of time, the debate dies down, and America has to

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:52.236
wait for its next mass shooting for it to be continued, when Wayne LaPierre,

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:57.876
or another member of the NRA, will go on TV and say exactly the same thing.

00:14:58.326 --> 00:15:04.286
And while you might think that after a mass shooting there is a rise in anti-NRA

00:15:04.286 --> 00:15:10.756
and anti-gun sentiment, anti-gun feeling, in fact it’s completely the opposite.

00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:17.066
The NRA does such an excellent job at changing the argument that

00:15:17.306 --> 00:15:22.526
donations to it almost always increase after a mass shooting.

00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:29.316
After the mass shooting at Parkland Florida, when 14 teenagers and 3 members

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:34.536
of staff were killed by a 19-year-old man armed with a semi-automatic

00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:40.446
rifle, donations to the NRA tripled, they went up by three times.

00:15:41.446 --> 00:15:44.466
And it’s not just donations to the NRA.

00:15:44.896 --> 00:15:51.576
Whenever there is a mass shooting, in the period immediately afterwards gun sales go up.

00:15:52.436 --> 00:15:57.696
While one can only hazard a guess as to the reasons why this is, the fact that

00:15:57.696 --> 00:16:03.316
representatives of the NRA are all over the TV talking about how important

00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:07.826
it is to protect yourself with a gun must surely have a large impact.

00:16:09.266 --> 00:16:17.856
Now, to another factor that is the most significant driver both of NRA memberships and of gun sales.

00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:20.126
Who is in the White House.

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:25.776
And while the NRA is most closely linked to the Republican party, a

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:31.316
Republican President is actually, on one level, terrible news both for

00:16:31.316 --> 00:16:36.466
the NRA and for gun manufacturers, or at least, for the money they make.

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:43.600
Yes, a Republican president is less likely to restrict gun ownership than a Democrat,

00:16:43.976 --> 00:16:49.616
but the result of this is that when a Republican is in the White House people don’t

00:16:49.616 --> 00:16:54.956
feel that anyone is coming for their guns, they feel that their guns are safe.

00:16:55.436 --> 00:17:01.256
And if you feel that your guns are safe, then you are less likely to feel like you need to

00:17:01.256 --> 00:17:07.526
donate to an organisation that protects them, and you are less likely to go out and buy more.

00:17:08.396 --> 00:17:13.696
Strangely enough, given how many more guns were sold in America during his

00:17:13.716 --> 00:17:20.806
presidency, Barack Obama is often referred to as “the best gun salesman in America”.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:26.596
And on the other hand, when Donald Trump came to power, donations to the

00:17:26.596 --> 00:17:33.356
NRA dropped drastically, and the NRA has actually been battling bankruptcy.

00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:40.146
It hasn’t released its most recent financial accounts, but no doubt the arrival of

00:17:40.156 --> 00:17:46.056
Joe Biden to the White House has been very good news for the NRA’s bank balance.

00:17:46.926 --> 00:17:53.876
I should add that it has also been accused of abusing its status as a non-profit organisation, and

00:17:54.036 --> 00:18:00.456
its executive vice-president, Wayne LaPierre has been accused of spending millions of dollars of

00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:07.866
NRA money on fancy suits, holidays, haircuts, and all sorts of things that he shouldn’t have done.

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:16.416
Now, the majority of listeners to this show come from countries where gun ownership is highly

00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:23.296
restricted, so the idea that you can have this incredibly powerful organisation that exists

00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:30.316
solely to stop restrictions on gun ownership probably seems a little strange, a little bizarre.

00:18:31.316 --> 00:18:32.616
It certainly does to me.

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:40.246
But as we both know, gun ownership is a highly political, and polarising issue in the United States.

00:18:41.486 --> 00:18:48.736
A recent poll suggested that around 44% of Americans live in a household with a gun.

00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:55.606
53% of Americans say that they would support stricter gun laws, with Democrats

00:18:55.626 --> 00:18:59.906
being much more likely to support stricter gun laws than Republicans.

00:19:00.476 --> 00:19:07.646
And Americans are divided over whether having fewer guns would lead to fewer mass shootings.

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:14.456
49% of adults say that there would be fewer mass shootings if it was harder for

00:19:14.456 --> 00:19:21.116
people to obtain guns legally, while 42% say this would make no difference and

00:19:21.386 --> 00:19:27.356
9% say there would actually be more mass shootings if there were fewer guns.

00:19:28.206 --> 00:19:32.326
I’m not quite sure what the argument of the 9% is, probably that

00:19:32.476 --> 00:19:36.466
people would commit fewer mass shootings if they were more afraid

00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:41.346
of being shot, which seems slightly tenuous to me, but there you go.

00:19:42.256 --> 00:19:46.446
The reality is that gun ownership is incredibly important

00:19:46.576 --> 00:19:49.526
to a large proportion of the American population.

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:57.566
It is literally in the Constitution, a document that Americans worship in an almost religious way.

00:19:57.896 --> 00:20:03.156
And the NRA is a fundamental part of that debate on gun ownership.

00:20:03.926 --> 00:20:11.106
Like it or loathe it, it is hard to deny that it has done an incredibly effective job at promoting

00:20:11.106 --> 00:20:17.986
gun ownership, and portraying a gun not as a weapon, but as a symbol of American freedom.

00:20:18.816 --> 00:20:23.716
There are an estimated 390 million guns in the United

00:20:23.716 --> 00:20:27.976
States, more than one for every man, woman and child.

00:20:28.456 --> 00:20:34.156
And the NRA is going to make sure that they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

00:20:37.326 --> 00:20:43.216
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the National Rifle Association,

00:20:43.236 --> 00:20:48.766
the NRA, an organisation that might have started out with honourable, some

00:20:48.766 --> 00:20:54.076
might even say “defensive” ambitions, but is now quite a different beast.

00:20:54.986 --> 00:20:58.716
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:02.246
It’s obviously a hot topic, so what do you think

00:21:02.256 --> 00:21:06.076
about gun ownership, both in general, and in the US?

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:12.436
What do you think of the NRA, and is there a similar type of organisation in your country?

00:21:12.826 --> 00:21:14.076
I would love to know.

00:21:14.376 --> 00:21:18.506

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.220
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.910
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.189
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part three of our

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.759
three-part mini-series on great American business frauds.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.010
In part one we learned about Enron, the energy company that spectacularly

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:42.159
collapsed and ended in lengthy jail sentences for its top executives.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:49.869
Then in part two, it was on to Theranos, the blood testing company started by the Stanford

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.149
dropout that promised to revolutionise healthcare, but turned out to be a huge fraud.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.510
And in part three, the last part of this mini-series, it is on to the biggest

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.420
crook of them all, the biggest criminal of them all,, Bernie Madoff, the man who

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.709
stole, or lost, $65 billion dollars, and was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:24.499
You might also notice that before this mini-series there was an episode on WeWork, which was

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.709
another company that collapsed spectacularly, but it wasn’t really a fraud, it was more a

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:37.140
case of everyone getting caught up by a charismatic leader, and some bad decisions being made.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.729
But you can think of that one as a warm-up for this mini-series.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.870
OK then, without further ado, let’s learn about why a judge thought

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.990
it necessary to sentence a 71 year old man to 150 years in prison.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.159
Bernard Lawrence Madoff, otherwise known as Bernie Madoff, grew up in Queens, New York City.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.620
He was the son of Jewish immigrants, and his family came from Poland, Romania, and Austria.

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:17.570
He didn’t grow up poor, but from a young age seemed to be motivated by

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.880
making something of himself, by proving that he was worth something.

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.060
A large part of this motivation is thought to have come from

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.150
proving to his girlfriend’s father that he was good enough for her.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.940
He had met Ruth Alpern, who was later to become Ruth

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.410
Madoff, his wife, while they were teenagers in high school.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.620
Her father was a wealthy accountant, and the young Bernie

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.130
wanted to prove that he was worthy of his daughter.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.300
He did seem to have a knack for, a talent for, making money.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.189
He started his first business with savings from summer jobs, and by the early 1960s,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.390
when he was in his late 20s, he was starting to make a name for himself on Wall Street.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.070
His business, Bernard L.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.670
Madoff Investment Securities, was involved with trading what’s called ‘over the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.273
counter’ stocks, shares in companies that are not listed on a public exchange.

00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:33.073
The 1960s was boomtime for these kinds of stocks, and Madoff started to taste some early success.

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:38.443
His company would make a little bit of money every time one of these

00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:44.463
stocks was bought or sold, and as the market grew, so did Madoff’s company.

00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:52.013
By the 1980s he was one of the highest paid people on Wall Street, and his company was

00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:58.883
reportedly responsible for trading around 5% of all of the over the counter stocks at the time.

00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:08.023
He was a very wealthy, respected financier, and had developed a reputation as a king of Wall Street.

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:12.393
So, where did things start to go wrong?

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:17.053
Alongside Madoff’s main trading business, Bernie Madoff

00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:20.483
had another business, where he would manage people’s money.

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:28.613
If you had a chunk of money, perhaps retirement savings if you were an individual, or your

00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:34.893
store of donations if you were a charity, Bernie Madoff would invest it on your behalf.

00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:40.503
Because Madoff was considered to be such a financial expert, because

00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:44.753
he was so good at picking stocks, he would be able to deliver you

00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:50.693
a good return on your money, normally between 12 and 15% a year.

00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:55.014
So, if you had a million dollars invested with Madoff,

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:59.533
the next year he might have made you $120,00, and so on.

00:05:00.623 --> 00:05:04.847
There are two important things to note about Madoff’s business.

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:09.917
The first one was that the returns that he delivered investors

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:14.537
were not huge, they were consistent, they were reliable.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:21.377
There were other companies, especially in the boom years of the 1990s, who might be able

00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:29.897
to deliver 20 to 40% returns, making you much more money, but this was a lot more risky.

00:05:30.917 --> 00:05:35.177
Bernie Madoff made you just enough money for it to be attractive,

00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:39.937
but not too much so that it was risky, or too good to be true.

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:46.187
The idea behind putting your money with Madoff was that it was a safe

00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:51.167
bet, that you knew Bernie would look after it, and you knew you would make

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:56.337
a good but not incredible return every single year, come rain or shine.

00:05:57.677 --> 00:06:01.837
The second point is that in the early days Bernie Madoff

00:06:01.877 --> 00:06:05.857
never advertised or promoted this service anywhere.

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:12.467
Indeed, to the general public, there was no option to invest with Bernie Madoff.

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:18.977
You had to be invited by someone, you had to be vouched for by them, you

00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:23.667
had to have a connection to someone who could put in a good word, and

00:06:23.697 --> 00:06:27.907
only then would you be able to give money to Bernie Madoff to manage.

00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:35.107
Initially, the money almost exclusively came from the Jewish community in New York.

00:06:35.787 --> 00:06:40.157
Bernie was Jewish, as was his wife, and he allowed several

00:06:40.157 --> 00:06:44.497
Jewish charities and wealthy Jewish families to invest with him.

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:50.057
In return, they would recommend Bernie to their friends, saying “Let

00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:55.697
me see if I can find a way to get you in”, and the fund grew and grew.

00:06:56.957 --> 00:07:03.854
Unlike some other funds, which needed to advertise to find investors, the way Bernie Madoff

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:11.217
positioned his fund was that he was almost doing you a favour by allowing you to invest in it.

00:07:12.627 --> 00:07:16.477
And for years, the fund delivered healthy returns.

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:21.457
If you invested your money with Bernie Madoff, every year you would make more

00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:26.537
money, you would be sent statements showing the shares that Madoff had bought on

00:07:26.537 --> 00:07:31.897
your behalf, and you would see that you now had more money than you did a year ago.

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:39.724
If you needed to take out some money, to buy a house, for a child’s college education,

00:07:39.744 --> 00:07:45.174
or for whatever reason, you could just request it, and your money would be returned.

00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:52.204
To the outside world, Bernie Madoff was an excellent custodian of people’s money.

00:07:52.714 --> 00:07:57.424
He would make you money every single year, without fail, and if you

00:07:57.434 --> 00:08:00.874
needed to take out any money, he would return it to you promptly.

00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:06.614
But beneath the surface, it was all a huge lie.

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:10.104
It was what’s called a Ponzi scheme.

00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:15.384
Madoff wasn’t investing the money anywhere, he kept it all in

00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:20.584
a large bank account at JP Morgan Chase, a large New York bank.

00:08:21.694 --> 00:08:25.024
These returns that he showed investors, the returns

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:29.354
that he was supposedly delivering every year, were fake.

00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:35.434
He would send investors statements showing the shares that the fund had

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:40.734
bought and sold, but the reality was that they hadn’t bought or sold anything.

00:08:41.774 --> 00:08:47.584
When writing these reports, he would look back at the share prices from a few days before,

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:54.084
then choose the shares that had increased in price, and say that he had bought those ones.

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:59.794
If investors wanted to take out their money, this wasn’t a problem for

00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:03.514
Madoff, because he would just take this money out of the bank account.

00:09:04.464 --> 00:09:09.464
As long as there was more money coming in, in the form of new investors,

00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:13.954
than was going out, the going was good, the fraud could continue.

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:17.344
But it couldn’t continue forever.

00:09:17.964 --> 00:09:22.704
Nobody knows exactly when Madoff started it, but it is

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:26.816
thought that it could have been as early as the 1980s.

00:09:27.814 --> 00:09:35.529
He had been promising 12-15% returns every single year, and, given the power of compound

00:09:35.549 --> 00:09:43.689
interest, 12-15% a year for 30 years means that the amounts that investors believed that

00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:49.809
Madoff had for them were significantly larger than the cash that was actually in the bank.

00:09:51.122 --> 00:09:57.190
Madoff had to start finding more investors, and after initially being an exclusive

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.140
investment opportunity for the Jewish community in New York, he began accepting anyone.

00:10:04.031 --> 00:10:08.481
Large institutional funds invested, and money flooded in from

00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:13.421
all over the world: Abu Dhabi, Switzerland, China, everywhere.

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:20.891
Throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and most of the 2000s, the going had been good for Bernie Madoff.

00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:24.761
He had all of the trappings of a New York financier.

00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:29.161
The penthouse, the yachts, the expensive cars, clothes,

00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:32.021
holiday houses in the most desirable locations.

00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:36.511
He was a great philanthropist, he was on the board of several

00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:40.334
charities, and was a large donor to the Democratic party.

00:10:41.114 --> 00:10:45.704
All he needed to do was to keep enough money in the fund so that people

00:10:45.714 --> 00:10:50.444
wouldn’t realise it was a fraud, so they wouldn't realise it was a Ponzi scheme.

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:56.004
When the times were good, when the stock market was healthy, this wasn’t a problem.

00:10:56.744 --> 00:11:01.984
But in the late 2000s there was an event that Madoff had not prepared for.

00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:08.284
The subprime mortgage crisis that started in 2007, and peaked in autumn

00:11:08.398 --> 00:11:14.884
of 2008, saw share prices drop dramatically, and investors panicked.

00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:20.924
Madoff’s investors trusted Madoff, but they didn’t trust the stock market.

00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:26.914
They wanted their money out, and called up Madoff to ask for their money back.

00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:31.594
The problem was, there was no money, or at least there

00:11:31.594 --> 00:11:34.834
wasn’t nearly as much money as Madoff had said there was.

00:11:35.824 --> 00:11:40.884
For several weeks, Madoff spent every waking minute trying to find new

00:11:40.884 --> 00:11:46.324
investors, trying to find new suckers to invest money in his fund, with

00:11:46.324 --> 00:11:50.194
which he could pay back the people who had asked for their money back.

00:11:51.374 --> 00:11:54.184
His bank account, which at one point that year

00:11:54.324 --> 00:11:59.988
contained $5 billion, was down to a mere $234 million.

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:06.394
With furious investors demanding their money back, Madoff had no choice.

00:12:06.984 --> 00:12:08.414
The game was up.

00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:15.714
On the evening of December 10th 2008, just under three months after the collapse of

00:12:15.894 --> 00:12:21.904
Lehman Brothers, Bernie Madoff asked his two adult sons to follow him to his apartment.

00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:29.384
And it was there that he confessed that it was, and I’m quoting, “one big lie”.

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:32.434
Madoff’s sons were appalled.

00:12:32.824 --> 00:12:37.384
They worked with their father, but in the legal trading part of the business.

00:12:38.204 --> 00:12:42.534
They had no idea that the man they had looked up to, the man

00:12:42.704 --> 00:12:47.292
who was a king of Wall Street, was the city’s biggest fraudster.

00:12:48.384 --> 00:12:54.114
The next day they called up a lawyer, and they reported their father’s crimes to the police.

00:12:55.284 --> 00:12:59.734
Bernie Madoff was arrested in his penthouse apartment, the king of

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:05.064
finance brought to his knees and his true self revealed to the world.

00:13:06.504 --> 00:13:12.254
As investigations continued, the true extent of the fraud started to be uncovered.

00:13:13.434 --> 00:13:17.874
It’s still not completely clear exactly how much was stolen,

00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:21.934
and there are disagreements about how to calculate it.

00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:30.864
The highest number, which is $65 billion, factors in the ‘fake returns’ that Madoff had promised.

00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:36.714
There are lower numbers, of between $10 and $17 billion, which

00:13:36.854 --> 00:13:40.954
just take into account the cash that was invested and not returned.

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:47.113
As is the nature of a Ponzi scheme, not everyone lost money with Bernie Madoff.

00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:52.234
If you put money in early on, and withdrew it before it collapsed,

00:13:52.504 --> 00:13:57.494
you would have made a very nice return, around 12-15% a year.

00:13:58.594 --> 00:14:04.424
It was only really the people who still had money with Madoff at the end who lost their money.

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:09.494
But, of course, this was no consolation for those that lost money.

00:14:10.394 --> 00:14:14.404
For many, they had trusted Madoff with their life savings,

00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:17.787
their inheritance, their children’s college funds.

00:14:18.697 --> 00:14:23.264
For charities, Madoff had lost millions of dollars in donations.

00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:28.154
And, from some of the interviews of burnt investors,

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:32.424
one of the worst things was the sense of betrayal.

00:14:33.684 --> 00:14:38.024
Not only did they feel betrayed by a man they trusted, but for

00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:42.354
many of them they had also recommended Bernie Madoff to friends

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:46.844
and family, who had also invested money and lost it all with them.

00:14:48.324 --> 00:14:51.814
When he stood trial, a year later, Madoff pleaded

00:14:51.834 --> 00:14:55.404
guilty, and said he was solely responsible for the fraud.

00:14:56.264 --> 00:15:00.974
He was 71 years old at the time, not a young man by any means.

00:15:01.184 --> 00:15:06.304
And the judge decided to make an example of him, to show that although

00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:10.904
this might have been a white collar crime, and Madoff didn’t physically

00:15:11.074 --> 00:15:15.394
injure anyone, it was an incredibly serious crime nonetheless.

00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:22.144
Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison, to never see the light of day again.

00:15:23.024 --> 00:15:28.274
And although listening to this story you might not have a huge amount of sympathy

00:15:28.464 --> 00:15:33.684
for Bernie Madoff the man, the Madoff family has suffered great tragedy since then.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:37.304
Both Madoff’s sons are now dead.

00:15:37.754 --> 00:15:43.284
The older son, Mark, killed himself on the second anniversary of his father’s arrest.

00:15:43.544 --> 00:15:46.124
He said that he could not live with the shame.

00:15:47.224 --> 00:15:52.320
And Madoff’s younger son, Andrew, died of cancer in 2014.

00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:58.364
He had beaten cancer back in 2003, but said that the stress of his

00:15:58.364 --> 00:16:03.104
father’s crimes caused the cancer to return, and that was what killed him.

00:16:04.294 --> 00:16:09.174
Now, the question you might have about Bernie Madoff is...why?

00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:17.094
He was a very rich man, he had a successful business, and he didn’t need to commit this huge fraud.

00:16:17.864 --> 00:16:18.834
Why did he do it?

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:26.394
Madoff died earlier this year, in April 2021, and took his secret to the grave with him.

00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:29.574
So we can only hazard a guess.

00:16:30.194 --> 00:16:36.194
It seems that Madoff hated the idea of letting people down, of disappointing them.

00:16:36.924 --> 00:16:42.274
He had reportedly lost a little bit of money for investors in the 1960s, and

00:16:42.414 --> 00:16:47.974
had disguised this loss, he had hidden this loss by adding new client money.

00:16:49.244 --> 00:16:53.954
Perhaps, he realised that this was a relatively easy thing to do, it was

00:16:53.984 --> 00:16:58.864
easier than having to provide someone with bad news, and so he continued.

00:16:59.264 --> 00:17:04.074
And then he continued and continued, it got too big to control, the power

00:17:04.104 --> 00:17:09.158
of compound interest meant that he couldn’t stop, and so he had to continue.

00:17:10.268 --> 00:17:14.438
He wasn’t engaging in the fraud to subsidise his lifestyle.

00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:21.588
Unlike some other notorious fraudsters, Bernie wasn’t stealing this money and using it for himself.

00:17:21.948 --> 00:17:26.558
Yes he had a luxurious lifestyle, but he could have had that anyway.

00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:32.728
Indeed, even Bernie Madoff doesn’t seem to have really known why he did it.

00:17:34.028 --> 00:17:37.598
During his trial he said, “I am responsible for a

00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:40.758
great deal of suffering and pain, I understand that.

00:17:41.348 --> 00:17:47.107
I live in a tormented state now, knowing of all the pain and suffering that I have created.

00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:50.937
I have left a legacy of shame, as some of my victims

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:53.847
have pointed out, to my family and my grandchildren.”

00:17:54.817 --> 00:18:01.597
He might have accepted some kind of responsibility, but he never really explained why he did it.

00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:06.471
Of course, that is not really any consolation to the thousands of people

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:11.111
who lost their life savings with Bernie Madoff, but there is perhaps

00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:15.371
some consolation in knowing that things finally caught up with him.

00:18:16.281 --> 00:18:19.991
The only truthful thing that Bernie Madoff seems to have said,

00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:23.461
is what he told his two sons on the night of his confession.

00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:26.921
“It was all one big lie”.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:36.600
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Bernie Madoff, the man who stole $65 billion.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:44.560
And with that comes the end of this three-part mini-series on Great American business frauds.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.790
As a reminder, part one was on The Enron Scandal, part two was on

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:55.530
Theranos, and we had a related episode, a part zero if you like, on WeWork.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.290
If there’s one moral of these stories, it’s that fraud doesn’t pay,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.650
and that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.700
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.110
Which of these frauds did you know about?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
Are there similar stories in your country?

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:24.060
Of the crimes of Enron, Theranos, and Bernie Madoff, how would you think about them differently?

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.200
Let’s get the discussion started.

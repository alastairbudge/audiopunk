Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:16.345
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:20.905
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:28.266
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about where the English language comes from.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:34.246
Now, you might think the answer is obvious, England, but it is

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:38.096
a lot more complicated–and indeed more interesting–than that.

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:45.586
English is a strange mix of different languages, and for the past almost two millennia

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:50.819
it has been in a constant state of change, taking words and influences from all

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:56.299
sorts of other languages to create the strange language that I am speaking today.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.659
It goes without saying that this is a subject that is super interesting to me, with

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:08.559
my linguist’s hat on, and should also be a fun one for you, as an English learner.

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.589
So I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.209
Before we get right into that though, I first want to want to thank my father,

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.619
who is an English teacher, and was a huge help in writing this episode.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.089
So, thanks dad.

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.629
And my second administrative point is to remind you that you can follow along to this

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.119
episode with the subtitles, the transcript and its key vocabulary, so you don’t miss a word

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:39.989
and build up your vocabulary as you go, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.869
For those of you who aren’t yet members of Leonardo English,

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.739
I’d definitely recommend checking out our membership.

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.679
It gives you access to all of the bonus episodes, so I think that’s almost

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.679
50 hours in total, plus our live sessions, learning materials, and more.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.379
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.219
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.909
OK then, English.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.099
You’ve no doubt heard all sorts of statistics about how many people speak English.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.269
If you Google it, you’ll find the Internet telling you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.439
that something like 1.3 billion people speak English.

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:30.859
Then digging down deeper, you’ll find that, of those, around 360 million people

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.729
are native speakers of English, that they were brought up speaking English.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:41.989
And as I imagine we both know, English is the most commonly studied second

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.549
language in the world, with a supposed 1.5 billion people learning it.

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:55.979
Now,  the definition of ‘learning’ here is quite loose, and not all of these 1.5 billion

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:01.779
people are diligent students like you are, but the point is that there can be little

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.239
doubt that English has come to be the world’s dominant language by a significant margin.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:15.759
For all of the newspaper headlines about how Mandarin, Spanish or Arabic might be the languages

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:21.949
of the future, none of these languages have anywhere near the global attractiveness of English.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.379
English has come to be the world’s lingua franca.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.519
Jobs, universities, life has all started to require

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.009
English in a way that it didn’t even 20 years ago.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.589
But of course you know this, because you are listening to a podcast in English.

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:47.619
What is a lot more interesting than me spouting off statistics about how important English

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:53.739
has become is to actually learn about the history of the language, and to ask ourselves

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:59.799
how it developed over the years, and how it reached this position of global dominance.

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.939
So, let’s do that.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.049
One of the main reasons why English has become such a dominant language is its

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:14.549
adaptability, and its ability to constantly absorb words from other languages.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.039
You see, despite what your English teacher might have told you,

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.379
English is a language that is completely unconcerned with purity.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:31.159
It has developed over the years precisely because of its ability to become less and less

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:37.479
pure, because of its ability to breed with other languages and grow stronger and stronger.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.519
There are two analogies that I think are useful here, when thinking about English.

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:53.059
The first is of a mongrel, which is what you get when two dogs of different breeds have a puppy.

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.499
It’s impure, in the sense that it will be a mix of

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.889
the two, but it doesn’t make it any less beautiful.

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.159
English is in many respects, a mongrel language.

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:14.769
And our second analogy is of a big pot, a big saucepan, that you use to cook soup in.

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:20.414
If you are cooking a soup, you might start with a base of something, but

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:25.704
you keep the pot cooking over time, and add more and more ingredients.

00:05:26.664 --> 00:05:32.134
The flavour develops, and as you add more and more ingredients, perhaps even

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:37.874
exotic ingredients like spices, the soup develops a more and more unique flavour.

00:05:39.154 --> 00:05:44.394
This is perhaps the best way to think about English, as a soup that has been cooking

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:50.704
for almost two millennia, where the cook is happy to add almost any ingredient

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:56.994
he is presented with, and the result is this complicated but rich language soup.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:03.484
So, keeping with our soup analogy, the base for English comes

00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:09.454
from three tribes - the Saxons, the Jutes, and the Angles.

00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:16.574
These tribes originally weren’t British, or at least they didn’t come from Britain - they

00:06:16.574 --> 00:06:23.094
came from continental Europe, the areas around modern day Denmark and northern Germany.

00:06:24.144 --> 00:06:31.374
It’s the last of these three tribes, the Angles, who gave English its name, and the base of

00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:38.014
our English soup comes from the language spoken by the Angles and the Saxons, Anglo-Saxon.

00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:42.831
You might have heard this referred to as Old English.

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:48.431
These tribes came to Britain after the Romans left in the middle of

00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:53.671
the fifth century, and the language they spoke is the base for English.

00:06:54.701 --> 00:07:01.251
Now, if you or I heard someone speaking Anglo-Saxon now, would we understand them?

00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:02.971
Probably not.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:10.311
The vast majority of Anglo-Saxon words have died out, they have disappeared from modern

00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:15.971
day English, but the words that have survived are words that you certainly will know.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:26.321
Love, big, green, ship, kind, wife, these are all examples of words that come from Anglo-Saxon.

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:32.391
As a general rule, and of course there are thousands of exceptions to this,

00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:38.611
English words that come from Anglo-Saxon are usually short, without many syllables.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:45.871
Indeed, words with Anglo-Saxon origins are some of the most common words in the English language,

00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:53.341
accounting for around 70% of the English that you will hear in normal, day-to-day speech.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:08:01.001
That’s not to say someone who only spoke Anglo-Saxon could listen to this podcast and understand 70%

00:08:01.321 --> 00:08:07.711
of what I was saying - these words have been adapted since then, but they have roots in Anglo-Saxon.

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:14.981
And a tip for you is to use short, Anglo-Saxon words whenever you can.

00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:20.271
I can’t take any credit for this tip, it actually comes from Winston

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:25.291
Churchill, probably the most famous orator in the English language.

00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:33.151
He famously said that “Short words are best, and old words when short are best of all.”

00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:37.411
So, when in doubt, use short words.

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:43.881
I know this might sound uncomfortable for native speakers of certain languages, where

00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:51.181
using longer, more complicated vocabulary is considered better, but in English it isn’t.

00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:56.781
So, we have our base for English soup, but what next?

00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:02.601
We’ve only got to the 5th century AD, and the soup has only started bubbling.

00:09:03.551 --> 00:09:10.691
The next big event in the English language was the invasion by the Vikings, in the 8th Century AD.

00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:16.661
For those of you that want to learn more about that, Episode 96 is the one for you.

00:09:17.721 --> 00:09:20.881
Anyway, the Vikings came mainly from modern day

00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:25.191
Scandinavia, and settled in the north and middle of England.

00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:32.401
Aside from terrorising the local population, they left a linguistic mark on the English language,

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:40.221
and words such as husband, sky, and skull come from the Norse languages spoken by the Vikings.

00:09:41.441 --> 00:09:48.031
Fast forward around 300 years and we have the next big addition to our English soup,

00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:54.761
and that was the invasion by the Norman French, by William The Conqueror in 1066.

00:09:55.971 --> 00:10:01.121
Now, these Normans were, technically, Vikings themselves, they had

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:06.851
settled in Northern France about 200 years earlier, but they spoke Norman

00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:11.691
French, a language similar to the French that is spoken in France today.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:18.591
As is often the case with invaders, they didn’t make much attempt to speak the local language,

00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:24.421
which was at that time a mix of Anglo-Saxon and Norse–we can't really call it English

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:31.641
yet–and instead Norman French was the language of courts, and the language of administration.

00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:35.551
And it continued like this for several hundred years.

00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:44.131
In fact, it wasn’t until the year 1415, after the English victory over the French at Agincourt, that

00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:51.601
English started to become the official language, and indeed the letter sent back to England telling

00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:58.611
the news of the unexpected victory was one of the first official ones to be written in English.

00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:06.721
But, the switch wasn’t immediate, and Norman French left a large impact on the local language.

00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:13.771
This is especially the case for words that describe law and government - the

00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:19.251
laws and administration were all in Norman French, and thus even

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:24.291
when the language switched to English, Norman French words remained.

00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:32.481
So, if you think of words like justice, which is ‘justice’ in French, traitor, which is ‘traitre’

00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:39.661
in French, sovereign, which is ‘souverain’ in French, and parliament, ‘parliament’ in French.

00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:45.011
French also brought new, interesting, inventions to

00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:49.691
English, such as different words for animals and their meat.

00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:56.831
To give you an example, you have a cow when it’s alive, or beef when it’s on a plate.

00:11:57.441 --> 00:12:01.401
Sheep when it’s in a field, and mutton when it’s on a plate.

00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:04.491
And a pig becomes pork when you eat it.

00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:11.931
These are all French borrowings, they are words from French, before this English

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:17.081
didn’t have these extra words to describe the different states of an animal.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:24.751
And words taken from the French tended to be considered more fancy, more important.

00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:32.476
So the Anglo-Saxon ‘cook’ has an alternative of ‘chef’, which sounds a lot more fancy.

00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:41.296
And, like with cook and chef, in many cases, English doesn’t replace the previous words with

00:12:41.296 --> 00:12:48.016
the French ones - the French ones just take on a slightly different, often superior, meaning.

00:12:49.176 --> 00:12:54.256
This is one of the reasons why English is so rich in synonyms,

00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.856
why there are so many different ways of saying the same thing.

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:05.886
To give you another example of this, let’s take a look at different ways that you can say ‘smell’.

00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:14.986
You can say stink, pong, whiff, perfume, fragrance, scent, essence, bouquet and aroma.

00:13:16.076 --> 00:13:22.096
Now, the first three on that list, stink, pong, whiff, all now have slightly

00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:28.126
negative connotations, you might walk into a rubbish dump and say ‘it stinks’.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:31.746
These three all come from Anglo-Saxon.

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:37.406
The remaining ones come from French, and all have positive connotations,

00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:43.606
when you think of fragrance, perfume, or a bouquet, this is more likely to be

00:13:43.616 --> 00:13:49.486
associated with the smell of flowers or something nicer than a rotting fish.

00:13:50.816 --> 00:13:54.816
And it’s through French’s origins as a Romance language

00:13:54.976 --> 00:13:58.146
that most of our Latin words are added to English.

00:13:59.376 --> 00:14:03.266
One question you might have is, well, if the Romans

00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:06.816
conquered Britain, why isn’t English more similar to Latin?

00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:13.686
The Romans did leave some linguistic influences on English, but most Latin

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:18.826
words were actually added to English well after the Romans had departed.

00:14:20.132 --> 00:14:25.566
Latin was the language of the church, and thus a lot of the English words

00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:32.576
that come from Latin are religious - gospel, candle, pope, school, and so on.

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:40.316
But although many words in English do have Latin roots, these are mostly words

00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:43.996
that have come from the French, which is of course a Latin-based language.

00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:50.776
And then it comes to words that are invented by innovative Brits themselves - English

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:55.626
isn’t only a language of thieves, we also create a lot of our own words.

00:14:56.166 --> 00:15:00.936
The most famous of these creators of words is, of course, William Shakespeare.

00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:08.626
Shakespeare is thought to have invented about 1,700 words, many of which are

00:15:08.646 --> 00:15:16.166
in common use today, from bedroom to kissing, critic to eyeball, Shakespeare is

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:21.246
without a doubt the most prolific individual contributor to the English language.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:27.286
So, when people say that English is the language of Shakespeare, it really is.

00:15:28.285 --> 00:15:33.233
And as the British started to venture further afield, to colonise

00:15:33.253 --> 00:15:36.973
large parts of the world, they brought language back to Britain.

00:15:37.828 --> 00:15:43.947
Words like pyjama and chutney come from India, safari from the Arabic, and

00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:48.757
ketchup from Hokkien, a language spoken in modern day south-east China.

00:15:50.087 --> 00:15:56.477
Now, borrowing words from other languages isn’t unique to English, almost every language does it,

00:15:56.737 --> 00:16:02.687
but it’s the extent to which English takes words from other languages and makes them an important

00:16:02.737 --> 00:16:09.387
part of English that separates English from most other languages, and adds to its richness.

00:16:10.497 --> 00:16:14.147
You might be surprised that we’ve got so far in the history of

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:17.817
the English language without mentioning the place with the most

00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:21.487
native English speakers in the world, the United States of America.

00:16:22.537 --> 00:16:26.957
The centre of the English language now isn’t the small island where it first

00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:31.557
developed, but the world’s most powerful country, across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:38.097
And although we can spend hours talking about the linguistic reasons that English has been such

00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:44.957
a successful language, the main reason is that it’s the most commonly spoken language in the US.

00:16:46.017 --> 00:16:48.987
Note, I didn't say the official language because it’s not

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:51.927
actually the official language, you might find that surprising.

00:16:52.297 --> 00:16:56.987
The US doesn’t have an official language, although English is of

00:16:56.987 --> 00:17:00.717
course the most common language, and de facto national language.

00:17:02.057 --> 00:17:07.107
And now, there are 55 countries that have English as an official language,

00:17:07.267 --> 00:17:12.447
from the United Kingdom to Malta, Pakistan to the Philippines, and in

00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:15.877
each of these countries there’s a slightly different English spoken.

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:23.067
I’m not just talking about accents, but different words, expressions, ways of saying things.

00:17:24.117 --> 00:17:28.237
Yes, we might all be able to understand each other, and we are all

00:17:28.287 --> 00:17:32.977
technically speaking the same language, but the beauty of English is its

00:17:33.047 --> 00:17:38.857
adaptability, its willingness to change, to absorb new words as time goes on.

00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:46.537
The Oxford English Dictionary, arguably the bible of the English language, publishes a list of

00:17:46.537 --> 00:17:53.487
new words every year, and every year when this list comes out there are letters in to newspapers

00:17:53.877 --> 00:17:59.787
lamenting the decline of the language, saying how we need to preserve this beautiful language

00:17:59.797 --> 00:18:06.407
and that it is ridiculous that we accept any new word just because it has become mildly popular.

00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:12.337
But, I would argue that one of the main reasons that English has become so

00:18:12.397 --> 00:18:17.937
popular, and gone from a language spoken by a few thousand people on a small,

00:18:17.977 --> 00:18:23.147
wet island in Northern Europe through to the world’s de facto second language

00:18:23.487 --> 00:18:29.417
is precisely because of its willingness to adapt, to evolve in order to survive.

00:18:30.347 --> 00:18:37.407
So, to return to our original analogy of the soup, we now have this huge pot, or perhaps

00:18:37.607 --> 00:18:42.717
a series of different large pots cooking away in different countries all over the world.

00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:49.077
And the beautiful thing is that we are all cooks, or should I say chefs, and

00:18:49.327 --> 00:18:54.187
that almost every ingredient we add makes the soup richer, more delicious,

00:18:54.507 --> 00:18:58.207
and able to be enjoyed by even more people from all over the world.

00:19:01.217 --> 00:19:06.047
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The History of The English Language.

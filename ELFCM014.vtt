Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.111
by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.821
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.211
Firstly, Happy New Year.

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:22.846
I hope you had an excellent New Year's Eve and that the New Year and the new decade is off to a

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:24.046
great start.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:31.576
If you're wondering why we celebrate January the first as New Year and thinking, well, I wish

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:38.926
someone would make a fun 10 minute podcast about that, then you probably missed episode 13, the one

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:43.756
that came out on New Year's Eve, so that's one to listen to after this.

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:47.176
It tells you literally everything about it.

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:54.084
It's also time for your customary reminder that if you don't have them already, you can grab a copy

00:00:54.084 --> 00:00:59.034
of the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.504
Leonardoenglish.com

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:08.954
Okay, so today we are going to be talking about a subject that's pretty close to my heart.

00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:12.584
Or actually two subjects that are close to my heart.

00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:15.882
Language learning and babies.

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:22.105
Language learning because, well, I'm a bit of a language learning geek and I'm fascinated with

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:25.165
languages and how people learn them.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.210
And babies because a few months ago I became a dad for the first time.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.219
So looking after a baby has quickly become quite a feature in my life.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.569
So today it's babies and languages.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.665
We'll discuss why babies are the ultimate language learners and talk about what we can learn from

00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:49.760
babies about how to learn English more effectively.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.571
Babies might not seem like the obvious examples of how to be a good language learner.

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.132
They can't really speak any languages well.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.522
They make a load of mistakes, even if they can speak.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.671
They don't really ever appear to study.

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.081
I mean, they don't study.

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.451
And they don't keep for vocabulary books.

00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:13.051
They never make any notes and they are very easily distracted.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.070
So on the face of it, babies don't really have any of the main characteristics that you might

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.070
traditionally associate with good language learners and good language students.

00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:33.658
But we can actually learn a huge amount from babies and their results are normally pretty incredible

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:36.756
despite all of the deficiencies we've just mentioned.

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:45.581
So most babies by the age of five or so, they can speak and understand at least one language with

00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:47.428
some speaking, two or more.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.162
I'll have to update you in a few years on the progress of my little baby as he's currently being

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:55.412
brought up trilingualy, so three languages.

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:57.092
So I speak English to him.

00:02:57.092 --> 00:03:01.682
His mother speaks Italian to him, and at nursery he'll speak Maltese.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.749
So most babies can understand and speak at least one language.

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:12.194
And babies, even if they move to a different country where they speak a different language, the

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:15.314
babies normally pick up the language faster than the parents.

00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.764
So babies are pretty good at learning languages.

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:20.744
But why is this?

00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:24.794
Yes, there are all sorts of advantages that babies have.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.460
Their little brains are like sponges and purely from a neurological point of view, it is easier to

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:40.080
take on new information and learn a new language when you are one or two years old rather than 21,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.400
51 or 91.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.457
But this shouldn't mean that we adults throw our hands up in the air and admit defeat saying that

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:53.617
our old brains just can't absorb new information at the same rate as babies' brains can.

00:03:54.697 --> 00:04:01.807
Instead, let's look at five of the ways in which we can try to be more like babies to be better

00:04:01.837 --> 00:04:02.767
language learners.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.049
So firstly, babies are naturally curious.

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.655
For a baby, everything is new.

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:13.125
They know nothing.

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:16.965
So in order to learn, they have to be curious.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:23.025
They have to ask what something is called, they have to ask or point if they don't understand a

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:26.745
word, they're constantly in discovery mode.

00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:32.887
Just take a look at the next baby you come across when they're awake, of course, their eyes are

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:34.387
constantly looking around.

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:41.767
They're interested in everything from the wall to the wardrobe, from the fan to a small spoon.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.887
They just want to understand the world.

00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:53.827
As a curious language learner, you should also be constantly trying to learn new words and phrases.

00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:59.307
You should be asking if you don't understand something, and you should always hunt out new and

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:06.597
interesting material to learn from, to look at every single situation as a learning experience.

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:13.566
And like a baby, you should be constantly exploring, constantly discovering new words and phrases,

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:20.796
and you shouldn't retreat into what you know, but instead reach out into the mysterious yet magical

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:22.596
world of what you don't know.

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:25.806
So you should be as curious as a baby.

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:33.581
So the natural curiosity that babies have is something that's an enviable quality, and I think as

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.831
adult language learners, we should all try to be a little bit more like babies in that respect.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:48.151
Secondly, babies learn language through acquisition So multiple studies have shown that the most

00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:55.791
effective way to learn a language, to be able to speak a language, is through what's called

00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:58.641
acquisition, not through traditional language learning.

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:05.301
So to translate this into plain English, this means that you should improve your English through

00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:13.731
actually using English, through listening, reading, and consuming content in the target language, in

00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:14.241
English.

00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:22.251
Doing stuff like listening to this podcast as opposed to listening to boring traditional listening

00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:27.058
exercises that are nothing like what you would encounter in the real world.

00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:35.561
Or you should be doing stuff like reading original content rather than just pouring over vocabulary

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:43.796
or grammar books, which will not only be monotonous, and I dare say, quite boring for you, but a lot

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:49.586
of studies have shown that they're actually significantly less effective than many teachers and

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:51.476
language schools might have you believe.

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:55.706
Babies learn in context, right?

00:06:55.706 --> 00:07:01.316
So they see a frog and they hear the word frog and they know what it's called.

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:04.826
They don't study books with the names of all the animals in.

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:08.756
Or if they do, they are reading a story about a frog, right?

00:07:08.836 --> 00:07:13.732
They are learning about the names of animals through a story that tells the name of different

00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:14.242
animals.

00:07:14.572 --> 00:07:19.582
So they learn language through acquiring it, through using it in a natural way.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.002
Thirdly, babies listen.

00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:27.309
Everyone listens to a certain extent when they learn a language.

00:07:27.804 --> 00:07:30.624
But nobody listens quite like a baby.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:38.004
In fact, babies spend the first six months or so of their lives, mainly just listening.

00:07:38.814 --> 00:07:45.407
Yes, those first months are full of all sorts of marvelous other learning experiences other than

00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:50.336
learning language, but babies are constantly in listening mode.

00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:56.066
From a language learning point of view, they can't really do anything else other than the occasional

00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:59.246
'guh' or 'buh' or strange baby sounds.

00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:07.661
One big mistake that many language learners make when they start learning a language is to start

00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:10.061
speaking right from day one.

00:08:11.232 --> 00:08:16.829
Yes, there are all sorts of people all over the internet that will tell you that you need to speak

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:22.709
from day one, but I just want to say two things about that kind of strategy.

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:30.343
Firstly, a lot of these courses that will push you into speaking from day one, a lot of them will be

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:36.496
actually aimed at English native speakers who are learning a second language to what's called

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:37.966
'holiday standard', right?

00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:44.586
Being able to have some basic conversations and impress friends and family, and there's nothing

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:45.276
wrong with this.

00:08:45.306 --> 00:08:45.756
Indeed.

00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:51.051
It's an admirable thing that English speakers are pulling their finger out and actually trying to

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:57.861
learn another language, but most are not getting to the kind of level that I'm sure you want to be

00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:59.511
getting to in English.

00:09:00.357 --> 00:09:06.260
And secondly, there's actually a lot of academic research that shows that a period of listening

00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:10.682
before actually trying to start to speak is hugely valuable.

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:20.177
So one of my personal heroes is a guy called Professor Stephen Krashen, and you can just Google him

00:09:20.177 --> 00:09:26.447
if you're interested, I'm also put some links in the show notes, but a lot of his work suggests that

00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:34.757
you should actually focus on listening before trying to speak, and students who start their language

00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:42.317
learning process with a period of listening as opposed to just dashing straight into speaking

00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:44.927
actually end up speaking better.

00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:50.944
One of the reasons for this is that speaking right from the beginning can be a very stressful

00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:57.604
exercise and that language is acquired more easily in low stress situations.

00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:03.754
I guess you might remember when you first started learning English, speaking in class could be

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:05.434
pretty stressful, right?

00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:12.364
And there's a lot of evidence that speaking from the start and being in a stressful environment

00:10:12.634 --> 00:10:16.474
actually inhibits, it slows down, the speed at which you learn.

00:10:17.752 --> 00:10:20.389
That's not the only reason to prioritise listening though.

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:27.559
Another reason is that it's only by listening to native speakers that you will be actually able to

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:30.829
understand how native speakers really speak.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.860
If you listen to things like this podcast and you're listening to native speakers, then you have

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:44.273
direct access to how native speakers construct sentences, pronounce words, and use language in a

00:10:44.273 --> 00:10:44.933
real way.

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:51.500
If you just try speaking from day one without first listening or really understanding how native

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.890
speakers use the language, then you'll probably just use very similar structures to your mother

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.310
tongue and just translate as you speak.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.200
And this is bad.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.360
This is really, really bad.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.320
Yes, you will probably get more confident at speaking.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.590
You'll be able to speak faster, and it might appear to you that you're getting more fluent in the

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.770
sense of words coming out of your mouth more quickly.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:24.865
But if you're not listening critically to how native speakers really speak, and if you're just

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:31.339
memorising more words so you can speak more quickly while always just translating from your native

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:37.789
tongue, it will be painfully obvious to any English native speaker and you'll continue to make

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.369
mistake after mistake in your English.

00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:48.649
I'm sure you are all familiar with this kind of English speaker, the kind that speaks really fast,

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:53.659
but probably makes loads of mistakes on the way and has poor pronunciation.

00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:55.759
Don't be like this person.

00:11:56.989 --> 00:12:00.499
Instead, when you are listening, listen critically, right?

00:12:00.499 --> 00:12:07.399
If a native speaker uses a particular word, phrase, or structure, ask yourself why they've used it.

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:10.362
Is it the same as what you would have used?

00:12:10.722 --> 00:12:13.932
Note it down, remember it, and then try and use it yourself.

00:12:14.352 --> 00:12:17.892
The key here is to be an active, a critical listener.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:25.089
And so to bring it back to babies, babies, as I said, do a huge amount of listening and they listen

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:25.989
before they speak.

00:12:26.397 --> 00:12:30.594
Of course, this isn't a nuanced, conscious decision.

00:12:31.014 --> 00:12:36.864
Babies can't speak, so they have to listen first, but we can still follow their example on this.

00:12:37.534 --> 00:12:43.675
And a final point on listening is to make sure you're listening to actual native speakers, not

00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:50.155
people who have learned English to a certain degree and who are probably still making mistakes and

00:12:50.185 --> 00:12:56.186
not pronouncing things in the right way, and, and you'll end up learning from people who have

00:12:56.246 --> 00:12:59.696
learned themselves and who are inevitably going to make some mistakes.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:02.516
So make sure you're listening to native speakers.

00:13:04.939 --> 00:13:11.006
Number four of the special things that babies do when learning languages is that babies are not

00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:12.386
afraid to make mistakes.

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:18.656
Yeah, babies have the advantage of being frequently corrected when they make a linguistic mistake,

00:13:19.046 --> 00:13:24.836
and native speakers might not always correct you if you make a mistake, I'm assuming you're not a

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:29.290
baby, but babies couldn't care less when they make a mistake.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:29.500
Right.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.610
They just don't care.

00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:37.599
When they make a mistake, they are either corrected by an adult or they hear an adult saying

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:40.869
something in a different way and they know that they've made a mistake.

00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:47.978
So next time or the time after that, or the time after that, they don't make that mistake again.

00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:55.643
As adult language learners, we are often so self-conscious of making mistakes, but we shouldn't be.

00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:56.183
Right?

00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:58.253
There's nothing wrong with making a mistake.

00:13:58.673 --> 00:14:00.503
Mistakes are how you learn.

00:14:00.953 --> 00:14:07.244
So as long as you know that you've made a mistake and you make a conscious effort to not make it

00:14:07.244 --> 00:14:09.104
next time, that's the important thing.

00:14:10.548 --> 00:14:17.658
And our fifth and final example from the life of babies and how they learn languages is that babies

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:19.938
are always trying out new things.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:26.620
As an adult language learner, it's easy to retreat into the same comfortable language that we know.

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:34.549
To use a simple word rather than something more colourful, to always say good instead of excellent,

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:36.319
fantastic, marvelous.

00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:45.081
To be the person who just responds to a question as opposed to asking questions or engaging with the

00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:45.741
subject matter.

00:14:46.671 --> 00:14:50.181
But babies and children don't do this.

00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:53.871
They are always trying out new words and phrases.

00:14:54.756 --> 00:15:00.996
Yes, they make mistakes as we talked about in the previous point, but that's the only way that they

00:15:00.996 --> 00:15:01.386
learn.

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:10.724
One of the easiest ways in which you can assess the level of English of a non-native speaker is

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:13.604
through the kind of vocabulary that they use.

00:15:14.024 --> 00:15:21.893
So simple doesn't always mean bad, and on occasion, simple is fine and gets the job done and is

00:15:21.893 --> 00:15:24.143
actually a better way of communicating.

00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:31.861
But if you're striving for fluency, you know that simple isn't always good enough, right?

00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:38.491
You know that you should say something like, well, striving for fluency instead of trying to be very

00:15:38.491 --> 00:15:38.851
good.

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:47.389
It always puts a smile on my face whenever I come across a child who uses complicated vocabulary,

00:15:48.049 --> 00:15:55.548
who says a strange, uncommon word, and I always think that this is a enviable quality of children

00:15:55.983 --> 00:16:03.123
that many adults just lose after a certain amount of time, the quality of just constantly testing

00:16:03.123 --> 00:16:11.943
out new words and phrases and taking a huge amount of pride and rejoicing when they find a

00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:12.933
interesting new word.

00:16:14.804 --> 00:16:20.740
So to conclude, what can we learn about how to learn English from babies and children?

00:16:21.685 --> 00:16:25.705
It turns out a lot more than one might have originally thought.

00:16:26.324 --> 00:16:31.829
Obviously there are loads of things that babies do that you shouldn't try to emulate as a language

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:39.059
learner, but on balance, I think if we all try to be a little bit more like a baby, then I think a

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:42.749
lot of us would find ourselves learning just that little bit faster.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.336
Right that is it for today.

00:16:46.733 --> 00:16:53.745
I normally do the thing where I ask or beg or, um, hope that you will give some kind of review or

00:16:53.745 --> 00:16:55.155
rating to the show.

00:16:55.905 --> 00:17:00.465
And today I'm not gonna do that or I'm not going to do it any more than I've just done.

00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:04.755
But what I want to do today is ask you a question.

00:17:05.175 --> 00:17:09.765
So what I would like to know from you is, what do you like about the show?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.860
What do you not like and what could we be doing differently?

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.300
I want your feedback.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:22.590
I want you to tell me what we should be doing and as an extra little bonus incentive for doing so,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:29.070
if you send in the feedback, then I will correct the feedback if there are any mistakes, of course,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.360
and send it straight back to you.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:37.410
So you can think about it as a free bit of English writing practice, with me.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:45.180
So what you need to do is just send an email to hi@leonardoenglish.com hi, that's

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.800
hi@leonardoenglish.com with feedback in the subject line.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.010
I'm already excited to see what you have to say.

00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:59.525
Okay, you have been listening to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:04.505
I'm Alastair Budge and I'll catch you in the next episode.

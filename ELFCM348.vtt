Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.340
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.350
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.060
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.469
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.589
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.729
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:22.390
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.960
part three, our final part, of our

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.180
mini series on the Cambridge Five:

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.640
the spy ring that infiltrated the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.940
upper echelons of Britain’s political

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.980
and intelligence worlds and leaked

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.430
state secrets to the Soviet Union.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.790
In case you missed them, in part one we

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.190
set the scene, learned about who these men

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.860
really were, and how they were recruited.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.890
In part two, we learned about the true

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.360
extent of their success, how they managed

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.930
to get away with it for so long, and saw

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.139
some clues about where things might start

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.873
to go wrong, some chinks in their armour.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.030
And in today’s episode, part three,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.470
we’ll see how this story ends.

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.619
OK then, let’s get into it and

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.529
talk about the downfall and

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:13.009
defection of the Cambridge Five.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:16.626
It was May 1951.

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.169
Kim Philby held a telegram in his

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.059
hands, a look of horror on his face.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.349
The Americans, he realised, had

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.729
discovered one of the Cambridge Five.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.139
Several years beforehand, Philby,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.909
the first of the Cambridge

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.519
Five to be recruited, had

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.499
been sent to Washington D.C.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.609
Although publicly he was working at

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.249
the British Embassy, in reality he was

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.279
the most senior British intelligence

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:47.909
officer in Washington, or rather, in

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.329
even more reality, he was a double

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.609
agent working for the Soviets.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.329
As you heard in episode two, by the

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.569
late-1940s both the British and the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.089
Americans were becoming suspicious that

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:04.829
there was a mole - that is, that someone

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.009
was leaking information to the Soviets.

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.439
As part of his role, Philby, himself

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.079
a Soviet double agent, of course,

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.459
was involved in this investigation.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.169
There was or had been, the Americans

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.479
believed, a mole working in the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.239
British embassy in Washington

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.609
some time in the mid-1940s.

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:30.579
To Philby’s horror, by the spring of

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.009
1951 he realised that the Americans had

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.899
cracked the Soviets' transmission codes.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.319
They knew who the mole had

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.869
been: a double agent referred

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.869
to by the Soviets as ‘Homer’.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.779
If you remember from part one, Homer

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.399
was the cryptonym, the code name, of

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.899
Philby’s friend, university colleague,

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.259
and fellow double agent, Donald Maclean.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.869
In the mid to late-1940s, Maclean

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.429
had indeed worked in Washington and

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.549
leaked incredibly sensitive information

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.159
about the West’s nuclear capabilities.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.929
He had since been sent back to

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.289
London and put under surveillance,

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.909
one of several suspects.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.209
Then, on the 16th of May, Philby received

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.759
the telegram that set in motion the

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.079
start of the end for the Cambridge Five.

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.669
The intelligence services back in

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.779
London, it seemed, were about to

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.679
take Maclean in for questioning.

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.899
Maclean, he knew, was in an

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.049
increasingly weak mental state.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.229
Philby was terrified he would crack

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.319
under pressure and give up the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.789
identities of the rest of the five.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.949
Time was running out,

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.489
the net was tightening.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.489
What would Philby do?

00:03:49.802 --> 00:03:51.985
How would he get word back to Maclean

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:54.335
in London without arousing suspicion

00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:56.905
in Washington, as he supposedly led

00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:59.425
the very investigation into the mole?

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:01.725
The responsibility would

00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.895
fall, unfortunately, onto the

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:05.845
shoulders of the unpredictable

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:09.115
and erratic drunk, Guy Burgess.

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:13.105
Now, as a quick reminder, Burgess was

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:15.345
one of the five high-flying Cambridge

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:17.155
graduates who had gone on to become

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:19.005
a double agent for the Soviets.

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.025
He had joined the Foreign Office,

00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.145
while his fellow spies had held

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:24.675
other high-powered positions

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:26.075
in the British establishment.

00:04:26.715 --> 00:04:28.965
They had passed literally thousands

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:31.135
of documents full of classified

00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:33.525
material to the Soviets, everything

00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:35.985
from nuclear secrets to the identities

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:37.885
of British spies working in Europe.

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:41.868
Fast forward to the early 1950s,

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:45.025
these men became careless; complacent

00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:47.215
and sloppy in their spycraft.

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:50.695
And a not insignificant part of

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.985
this complacency and sloppiness

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.735
can be traced back to alcohol.

00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:57.915
Though Burgess was known as the

00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.445
biggest drinker of the lot, the

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:01.681
heaviest drinker, in the spring of

00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.985
1950 Maclean too had descended into

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:06.965
a downward spiral of alcoholism

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:09.075
after being transferred to Cairo.

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:11.635
His drinking got so out of

00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:13.685
control that he was sent back to

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:15.995
London in disgrace for desk duty.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:18.355
He was a shadow of his former

00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:21.065
self, and Philby was understandably

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.625
petrified that he would crack under

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.825
pressure, that he would reveal all

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:27.585
if he was taken in for questioning.

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:30.035
Time was running out.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.715
And warning Maclean directly

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:34.435
would have been too obvious, of

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:36.295
course, he was under surveillance.

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:39.485
So, what did Philby do?

00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:42.075
He realised he would have to rely

00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:43.825
on the unpredictable Burgess.

00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:46.545
By then, Burgess was also working in

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.025
Washington DC and living with Philby.

00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:52.555
As you might remember from episode two,

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:55.085
Burgess was hardly the most reliable

00:05:55.115 --> 00:05:57.435
of the Five, and was well-known as a

00:05:57.445 --> 00:05:59.605
careless alcoholic with a big mouth,

00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:02.255
someone who talked a lot and didn’t seem

00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:04.545
particularly good at keeping secrets.

00:06:05.355 --> 00:06:07.755
But he was the only way to get a

00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:10.215
message back to Maclean in London.

00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:13.385
There was a spanner in the works, an

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.445
immediate problem, when Burgess was

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.085
caught speeding in his car by the

00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:20.685
American police, and found to be drunk.

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:23.585
He claimed diplomatic immunity

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:25.575
and was kicked out of the country.

00:06:26.935 --> 00:06:28.755
This caused something of a diplomatic

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:31.565
scandal, but it has been suggested

00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:34.125
that this was all part of the plan,

00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:36.205
that Burgess did this on purpose

00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:38.405
in order to be able to warn Maclean

00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:40.795
without seeming overly-suspicious.

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:44.245
Nonetheless, he eventually arrived back

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:46.865
in London later on in May and contacted

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.445
his Soviet handlers to warn them that

00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.745
the Americans were onto Maclean and

00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:53.905
that he would be questioned any day.

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.495
Incredibly, after Burgess saw the

00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:59.525
mental state of Maclean and his

00:06:59.575 --> 00:07:01.415
uncontrollable drunken behaviour,

00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:04.055
he decided that if Maclean was going

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.795
to escape, he wouldn’t be able to do

00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:08.215
it alone, Burgess would go with him.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.375
This really was, as the expression

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.785
goes, the blind leading the blind.

00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:16.415
But where would they go?

00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:20.045
By late May, Philby’s fears were

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:22.265
confirmed and British intelligence

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.665
had indeed decided they were going to

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:26.665
confront Maclean about their suspicions.

00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:29.655
Remember, Philby at this time was

00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:31.635
a top-ranking counterespionage

00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.065
officer, so he had a front-row seat

00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.665
to all of these investigations.

00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.815
Monday 28th was the day he would

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:41.105
be brought in for questioning.

00:07:42.215 --> 00:07:44.775
When Philby got wind, or heard about this,

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:47.595
he warned Burgess, sending him a telegram.

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:52.505
With time running out, on the 25th of May,

00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:55.765
Burgess bought two ferry tickets, and he

00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:58.225
and Maclean took an overnight ferry from

00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:00.715
Southampton to Saint-Malo, in France.

00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:04.185
The two had breakfast, with beer, of

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:07.185
course, and paid a taxi driver to drive

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:09.405
them to Rennes, the capital of Brittany.

00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:12.505
From there they took a train to Paris,

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:15.015
then continued onto Zurich where they

00:08:15.015 --> 00:08:16.935
received papers from the Soviet Embassy,

00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:19.945
took a flight to Prague, and disappeared.

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:22.815
They had defected to the Soviet

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.595
Union, disappeared behind the

00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:26.645
Iron Curtain, and would not be

00:08:26.645 --> 00:08:28.895
heard from again for five years.

00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:32.065
With the British and Americans wondering

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:33.955
how Maclean had realised they were onto

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:37.475
him, suspicion immediately fell on Philby,

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:39.575
given his relationship with Burgess

00:08:39.615 --> 00:08:41.665
and knowledge of the investigation.

00:08:42.615 --> 00:08:44.605
Philby was recalled to London

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.815
and interrogated by MI6.

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.225
MI6 were sure that Philby was the

00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:52.675
man, the link between Burgess and

00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:55.955
Maclean, but with no hard evidence,

00:08:56.145 --> 00:08:58.635
Philby faced no charges but was instead

00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:01.325
asked to retire quietly from MI6.

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:04.575
As you might imagine, the whole saga

00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:06.675
caused outrage in Washington and

00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:09.055
seriously damaged British and American

00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:11.665
relations at a key time in the Cold War.

00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:15.765
So, two of the Cambridge Five had

00:09:15.765 --> 00:09:17.365
been discovered, but they were

00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:19.085
safely behind the Iron Curtain.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:22.785
Now all eyes were on Philby, but

00:09:23.055 --> 00:09:26.225
neither MI5 nor MI6 had the concrete

00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:28.485
evidence to pin anything on him, to

00:09:28.655 --> 00:09:30.505
prove that he had done anything wrong.

00:09:31.315 --> 00:09:33.625
They knew he had access to top secret

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.695
files, including the ones about the

00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:37.815
mole, and that he had been living with

00:09:37.815 --> 00:09:40.145
Burgess, the man who had just travelled

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:42.115
to London and then disappeared with

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:44.875
Maclean, the man they suspected was Homer.

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:48.275
Clearly, all signs pointed to

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.525
him, but he was still a free man.

00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:53.655
After leaving MI6, he went to

00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:55.485
Beirut to work as a journalist,

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.675
while still maintaining the support

00:09:57.745 --> 00:09:59.575
of many of his MI6 colleagues.

00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:03.375
Like Burgess and Maclean, Philby

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:05.665
was by now a full-blown alcoholic

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:07.565
and spent much of his time in

00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:09.505
bars around the British embassy.

00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:11.745
Some believe he even did the

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:14.535
occasional bit of spywork for MI6,

00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:16.395
despite their suspicions about him.

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:21.525
Anyway, in December of 1961 a high-ranking

00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:24.755
KGB officer defected to the West and

00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:26.785
provided clues that confirmed the

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:28.785
long-held suspicions about Philby

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:31.425
being the ‘third man’ and his role

00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:33.645
in tipping off Maclean and Burgess.

00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:37.480
And when a trusted source told MI6

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.055
that Philby had tried to recruit

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.375
her years before, MI6 made its move.

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:46.455
Now MI6 thought it had enough evidence to

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:48.955
try and get a full confession from Philby,

00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:53.225
so in 1963 a man called Nicholas Elliott,

00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:55.665
one of Philby’s old school friends,

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.815
was sent to Beirut to confront him.

00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:00.565
It didn’t take long for Philby to

00:11:00.565 --> 00:11:03.065
confess in writing that he was a double

00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:05.685
agent, but a few days later, on the

00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:08.495
23rd of January, he boarded a Soviet

00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:10.995
ship bound for Odessa and disappeared.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:13.525
The third of the Cambridge

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:14.845
Five had defected.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.845
Now, some have suggested that

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:19.925
Philby was allowed to defect to

00:11:19.925 --> 00:11:21.925
avoid even more embarrassment for

00:11:21.925 --> 00:11:23.385
the British intelligence community.

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:26.485
Whatever the truth, the fact that it

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.435
was Philby’s school friend that was

00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:30.725
sent and not a proper interrogator,

00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.865
goes to the heart of the ‘good old

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:34.865
chap’ culture that allowed Philby to

00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:37.285
exist as a double agent for so long.

00:11:38.122 --> 00:11:40.712
He was a gentleman, so naturally

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:42.842
having an old school friend go and

00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:44.582
talk to him was the appropriate action,

00:11:44.892 --> 00:11:47.382
instead of police officers or soldiers.

00:11:47.892 --> 00:11:50.152
Let’s remember, he was accused of

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:52.242
committing treason, which is legally

00:11:52.372 --> 00:11:54.192
one of the worst crimes possible.

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:56.962
And he was allowed to slip away

00:11:56.962 --> 00:11:59.072
quietly to the Soviet Union.

00:12:00.192 --> 00:12:02.832
But instead of receiving the hero's

00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:05.562
welcome that he expected, when he arrived

00:12:05.572 --> 00:12:08.252
in the Soviet Union Philby was put in

00:12:08.252 --> 00:12:11.832
a flat in Moscow and shunned, rejected

00:12:12.022 --> 00:12:14.102
by Soviet intelligence, who had always

00:12:14.102 --> 00:12:16.602
been suspicious of how Philby had risen

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:20.402
so quickly in MI6 and even feared he was

00:12:20.402 --> 00:12:23.082
a triple agent working for the British.

00:12:24.262 --> 00:12:26.442
In 1988 he died of

00:12:26.442 --> 00:12:27.892
heart failure in Moscow.

00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:31.832
So, what came of the other two defectors

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:34.192
- Burgess and Maclean, the other two

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:36.492
men who had fled to the Soviet Union?

00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:39.222
Maclean integrated into Soviet

00:12:39.222 --> 00:12:41.982
society, he went by the name of Comrade

00:12:41.982 --> 00:12:44.442
Madzoevsky and he lived a life of

00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:46.992
luxury compared to the average Soviet.

00:12:47.902 --> 00:12:50.002
He died in Moscow in March of

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.912
1983, and he was described in his

00:12:52.932 --> 00:12:54.362
obituary by the Russian newspaper

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.249
Izvestia as “a man of high moral

00:12:57.249 --> 00:12:59.689
qualities and a convinced communist".

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:03.309
Burgess, on the other hand, did

00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:05.459
not receive such a hero’s welcome.

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:08.879
He did not learn Russian, and as

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:10.829
a result he became increasingly

00:13:10.909 --> 00:13:12.845
isolated after his defection.

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:15.829
He spent most of his time alone,

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:18.939
drinking and reading, and, perhaps

00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:21.049
unsurprisingly, he died of liver

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:24.019
failure on the 30th of August in 1963.

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:27.299
So, what of the two other

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:29.159
members, Blunt and Cairncross?

00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:32.409
Well, though both men had provided

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:34.215
vital information to the Soviets

00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:35.525
during the Second World War,

00:13:35.905 --> 00:13:37.895
they both did significantly less

00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:40.327
spying after the Second World War

00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:42.155
than Philby, Burgess and Maclean.

00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:44.975
This seems to have been partly

00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:46.995
ideological, with Blunt in

00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:49.025
particular losing faith in

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:51.655
socialism, and partly practical.

00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:55.075
Whereas the other three all continued

00:13:55.075 --> 00:13:57.085
rising through the ranks in the diplomatic

00:13:57.085 --> 00:13:59.280
and intelligence worlds, Blunt and

00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:02.345
Cairncross focused more on academia and

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:04.935
had less access to top secret information.

00:14:06.143 --> 00:14:08.653
I should say that even after Philby

00:14:08.653 --> 00:14:12.573
defected, in 1963, it wasn’t yet publicly

00:14:12.573 --> 00:14:15.123
known, that there were five double agents.

00:14:16.593 --> 00:14:18.633
British intelligence did have its

00:14:18.643 --> 00:14:21.003
suspicions about Blunt in particular and

00:14:21.123 --> 00:14:23.473
knew he had been good friends with Burgess

00:14:23.483 --> 00:14:26.003
since Cambridge, even suspecting that

00:14:26.003 --> 00:14:27.873
he had helped him and Maclean defect.

00:14:28.413 --> 00:14:30.313
But no way of proving it.

00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:33.543
Even without proof, the net

00:14:33.593 --> 00:14:35.193
was closing on the two men.

00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:38.833
After a handwritten note from Burgess was

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:42.163
found in Cairncross’ flat in 1951, and

00:14:42.343 --> 00:14:44.678
following Burgess and Maclean’s defection,

00:14:44.913 --> 00:14:47.413
Cairncross had been interrogated by

00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:50.743
MI5 but denied he was a Soviet spy.

00:14:51.653 --> 00:14:53.863
However, after Philby’s defection in

00:14:53.863 --> 00:14:56.433
1964, Cairncross was questioned by

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:59.953
MI5 again, and this time, he confessed

00:15:00.093 --> 00:15:03.071
that he was indeed a spy, but in

00:15:03.071 --> 00:15:04.841
exchange for providing information

00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:08.021
he was not prosecuted and his role

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:10.121
in the spy ring was kept a secret.

00:15:11.051 --> 00:15:13.701
Instead he went to the United States and

00:15:13.841 --> 00:15:15.951
began a career as a literary scholar,

00:15:16.351 --> 00:15:18.461
and he wouldn’t be revealed as the

00:15:18.481 --> 00:15:21.031
so-called ‘fifth man’ for many years.

00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:24.981
Anthony Blunt confessed when questioned

00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:27.131
the same year, but was not publicly

00:15:27.131 --> 00:15:29.041
revealed as the ‘fourth’ of the

00:15:29.041 --> 00:15:32.121
Cambridge Five until 1979, when

00:15:32.321 --> 00:15:34.131
someone he had tried to recruit at

00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:36.671
Cambridge in the 1930s told their story.

00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:40.211
The Queen was told that her high-ranking

00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:42.711
employee had been a double agent but,

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:46.031
incredibly, Blunt was allowed to keep his

00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:48.421
job as Surveyor of the Queen’s Pictures.

00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:51.071
He even kept his knighthood, his

00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:53.055
royal honour, until his spying

00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:54.985
past was made public by the British

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:56.715
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

00:15:57.785 --> 00:15:59.855
As a result, the Queen stripped

00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:02.365
Blunt of his knighthood, and he died

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:06.155
in London in 1983 aged 75, without

00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:08.455
spending as much as a night in prison.

00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:11.465
You might be thinking, how  did they

00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:13.435
manage to get away with it for so long,

00:16:13.695 --> 00:16:16.275
and even after they were caught, why

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.035
were they not punished in any way?

00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:21.165
Much of the answer to this comes

00:16:21.165 --> 00:16:22.675
back to something we talked about

00:16:22.675 --> 00:16:24.275
at the very beginning of this

00:16:24.285 --> 00:16:27.245
mini-series: class and social status.

00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:29.905
Because these men were from Britain’s

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:32.035
ruling elite with famous and

00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:34.305
influential fathers, they studied

00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:36.465
at Britain’s top university, worked

00:16:36.575 --> 00:16:38.685
in its elite institutions, they

00:16:38.685 --> 00:16:40.595
were given the benefit of the doubt,

00:16:40.945 --> 00:16:42.965
that is, they were believed despite

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:45.065
evidence or suspicions against them.

00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:48.365
Blunt was embedded in the Royal Family;

00:16:48.735 --> 00:16:51.115
Burgess, Cairncross and Maclean the

00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:53.085
political corridors of power; and

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:55.685
Philby was the very man entrusted

00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:58.115
to fight against Soviet espionage.

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:00.935
Nobody expected that ‘one of their

00:17:00.935 --> 00:17:03.595
own’ - ‘good chaps’ as we might say in

00:17:03.705 --> 00:17:05.605
England - would betray their country,

00:17:05.885 --> 00:17:08.265
and suspicions about them were ignored

00:17:08.275 --> 00:17:10.375
for years because of their status.

00:17:11.035 --> 00:17:13.025
Because of who they were, where

00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:14.945
they went to school, and the elite

00:17:14.945 --> 00:17:16.765
part of society they came from.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.699
Another reason is that revealing the Five,

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.239
and therefore the weaknesses in British

00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:25.419
intelligence, would have had damaging

00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:27.909
consequences on the international stage.

00:17:28.869 --> 00:17:32.039
The slow unmasking, or uncovering,

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:34.509
of the Cambridge Five was incredibly

00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:36.929
embarrassing to the British establishment

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.259
and to the British security forces.

00:17:40.149 --> 00:17:42.779
Not only did these men undermine and

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:45.599
actively work against the UK during

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:47.379
the Second World War and the Cold War,

00:17:47.729 --> 00:17:49.419
but they brought into question the

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:51.789
entirety of British foreign policy.

00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:54.929
The Cambridge Five shook the United

00:17:54.929 --> 00:17:57.939
States’ confidence in the UK, and damaged

00:17:58.023 --> 00:18:00.669
the transatlantic ‘special relationship’

00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:03.399
at a time when cooperation was vital.

00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:07.009
And as the Cold War moved on into the

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:10.502
1970s and 1980s, rumours and gossip

00:18:10.532 --> 00:18:12.582
about the Cambridge Five contributed

00:18:12.772 --> 00:18:15.005
to the paranoia consuming the country.

00:18:15.957 --> 00:18:18.467
If men like the Cambridge Five would

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:20.487
betray their country, who wouldn’t?

00:18:21.117 --> 00:18:23.637
How many of them really were there?

00:18:24.087 --> 00:18:26.147
What if there weren’t just five, but

00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:29.277
six, seven, ten, twenty, or fifty?

00:18:29.587 --> 00:18:31.777
What if there were still double agents

00:18:32.017 --> 00:18:34.427
working in the heart of government?

00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:38.077
For years after, countless people were

00:18:38.087 --> 00:18:40.137
accused of being the sixth or seventh

00:18:40.137 --> 00:18:42.157
or eighth members of the Cambridge

00:18:42.157 --> 00:18:45.417
spy ring, and many of their university

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.857
contemporaries were suspected.

00:18:47.807 --> 00:18:50.067
None were found, or at least,

00:18:50.217 --> 00:18:52.267
none have been publicly revealed.

00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:55.787
If there were more, well if the example

00:18:55.807 --> 00:18:58.027
of the original five is anything to go

00:18:58.027 --> 00:19:00.967
by, they were probably hiding in the most

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:04.627
unexpected place, hiding in plain sight.

00:19:06.637 --> 00:19:09.367
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:11.457
on the Cambridge Five, one of the

00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:13.967
most successful spy rings of all time.

00:19:14.477 --> 00:19:16.337
I hope it was an interesting one, and

00:19:16.487 --> 00:19:18.307
whether you knew a lot about them, or

00:19:18.427 --> 00:19:20.037
this was the first time you’d heard

00:19:20.047 --> 00:19:21.737
anything about the whole thing, well

00:19:21.917 --> 00:19:23.137
I hope you learned something new.

00:19:24.007 --> 00:19:25.927
As always, I'd love to know what

00:19:25.927 --> 00:19:27.207
you thought about this episode.

00:19:27.717 --> 00:19:29.607
Who do you think was the best, or

00:19:29.747 --> 00:19:31.647
most effective, of the Cambridge Five?

00:19:32.107 --> 00:19:33.527
Which of the men do you

00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:34.677
find most interesting?

00:19:35.157 --> 00:19:36.387
What do you think that their

00:19:36.387 --> 00:19:38.467
long careers as double agents

00:19:38.647 --> 00:19:40.307
says about British society?

00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:42.577
I'd love to know, so let’s

00:19:42.577 --> 00:19:43.907
get this discussion started.

00:19:44.347 --> 00:19:45.367

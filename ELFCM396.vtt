Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:16.045
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:19.975
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:26.525
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Kim Dotcom.

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:34.605
To some, he was an Internet pioneer, an entrepreneur who took from the rich and gave to the poor.

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:40.205
To others, he was a thief, a pirate, a criminal who stole hundreds

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:44.685
of millions of dollars and grew magnificently wealthy in the process.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.980
Ok then, Kim Dotcom.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.230
New Zealand is not the sort of place that one traditionally associates with huge police raids.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.970
It is the land of green mountains, beautiful lakes,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.630
it’s a country that famously has more sheep than people.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.590
It’s a peaceful and tranquil place.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.430
But on the 20th of January, 2012, in a small community just north of the capital,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.860
Auckland, this peace and tranquillity were about to be rudely interrupted.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.860
In the early hours of the morning, a police helicopter flew over the green

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.560
fields, the whirring of its blades waking up the sleepy residents below.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.080
At exactly 6.47am, it entered the grounds of a private house, a large mansion to be precise.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.890
It touched down outside.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.480
Four police officers armed with semi-automatic weapons jumped out and ran at the front door.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.500
Seconds later a swarm of police vehicles burst through the gates of the property.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.710
There were 76 police officers in total, including an

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.790
elite anti-terrorism squad and a pack of attack dogs.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.560
As they entered the house, they found a pregnant woman with her three children.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.600
They pressed on, found some guests, and 10 or so members

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.180
of staff, but not the person they were really looking for.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.330
13 minutes into the raid, through a secret door and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.710
hiding in a red safe room, they located their target.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.990
A 37-year-old German man was found sitting on the floor, his hands raised in the air.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.780
He was a large man, 2 metres tall and weighing in at

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.030
around 150 kg, with short cropped hair and glasses.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.410
He was immediately pounced on by the police, he was

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.920
punched, kicked, forced to the floor, and put in handcuffs.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.245
The New Zealand police were acting on the orders of the FBI,

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.700
who wanted to bring this man in to face up to 50 years in jail.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.470
His crime?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.030
Not arms dealing, terrorism, murder, assault, drug trafficking or anything like that.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.390
He was wanted because he operated a website called

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.030
Megaupload.com, a website that you may well remember.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.450
This arrest would just be the start of an ongoing saga to extradite him from New Zealand to the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.816
United States, to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering, and racketeering.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.520
This man was Kim Dotcom, a hero and technology pioneer to his supporters, and a thief

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.637
of hundreds of millions of dollars of copyrighted material to American law enforcers.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:59.240
To understand how it got to this point, we must go back to the northern

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.065
German city of Kiel in 1974, for this is where our story begins.

00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:12.555
Kim Schmitz, as he was originally called, was born to a German father and a Finnish mother.

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:16.875
By all accounts, his childhood was not a happy one.

00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:21.815
His father was an alcoholic, and he beat the young boy and his mother.

00:04:22.913 --> 00:04:27.683
Kim's escape from the horror of his daily life came through computers.

00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:32.783
He persuaded his mother to buy him a Commodore C-16, an

00:04:32.993 --> 00:04:36.103
early computer, on which he taught himself to program.

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:42.733
He wanted to play computer games, but the problem was that the software was expensive.

00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:46.623
So, he figured out how to make copies of it.

00:04:47.423 --> 00:04:50.913
And when he figured out how to do this, well he realised

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:54.123
he could also sell these copies to his school friends.

00:04:55.363 --> 00:05:00.203
As he figured out how to do more and more with computers, he got bolder and bolder,

00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:05.983
pushing the limits of what was possible for a teenage computer enthusiast in West Germany.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:12.223
He broke into the NASA website because he wanted, and I’m quoting directly

00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:16.413
here, “to find out if there was any evidence that aliens existed”.

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:21.703
And during the Gulf War he claimed to have broken into the U.S.

00:05:21.703 --> 00:05:26.513
Defense Department's computer system and "found some servers with real

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:30.433
time connections to spy satellites' monitoring Saddam Hussein's palace.”

00:05:31.423 --> 00:05:34.983
He was a hacker, and clearly a talented one.

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:43.113
And as his hacks grew bolder and more high profile, he started to develop a name for himself.

00:05:44.273 --> 00:05:48.863
His hacker name was “Kimble”, and he would leave a calling card

00:05:49.063 --> 00:05:53.473
of the name “Kimble” and two skulls on any system that he hacked.

00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:59.893
But while some hackers avoid publicity, preferring to remain

00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:04.923
anonymous, in the dark, Kim actively sought the attention of the press.

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:10.303
In a December 1992 edition of Forbes magazine he was

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:14.703
showcased as an example of this new subgenre, the “hacker”.

00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:21.493
The magazine wrote, and I’m quoting directly, “Take this 19 year old called Kimble.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:26.803
Located in Germany, he is the leader of Dope, an international group of hackers.”

00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:32.161
Kim made the most of the fact that the journalists who were writing

00:06:32.161 --> 00:06:36.961
about hackers and hacking culture had essentially zero technical

00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:41.168
knowledge, they knew nothing about the world of computers and of hackers.

00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:49.146
Kim used this to an advantage, he knew he could say anything, and given that the editors wanted a

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:55.016
story about the threat posed by criminal hackers, he knew that whatever he said would be printed.

00:06:56.126 --> 00:07:00.756
He talked about the huge power of the hacker, portraying himself as

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:04.936
someone who had the skills to do anything on the Internet, to hack into

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:10.766
any system, a self-proclaimed teenage Dr Evil armed only with a computer.

00:07:12.228 --> 00:07:16.678
This might have been a slight exaggeration, but it wasn’t far off.

00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:22.268
He boasted that he had made $200,000 hacking American phone

00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:26.478
systems, and of having developed an encrypted, unhackable phone.

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:33.418
This was all before his 20th birthday, and he wasted no time using the money he made

00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:40.628
to buy luxury cars, exotic holidays, and generally live a flamboyant lifestyle, posing

00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:45.498
in front of aeroplanes and superyachts, portraying himself as spectacularly wealthy.

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:52.038
It didn’t take long for his exploits to arouse the attention of the authorities.

00:07:53.328 --> 00:08:00.898
In 1994, when he was 20 years old, he was raided by the German police, but he escaped any serious

00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:06.458
jail time because he was legally underage at the time that any crime would have taken place.

00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:14.558
He claimed to have learned his lesson, and used the fame, at least fame in hacker circles,

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:19.818
to launch what would be a lucrative data security business, helping large companies

00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:25.678
like Lufthansa, the German aircraft company, protect themselves against people like him.

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:33.358
But it didn’t take long for him to get bored and switch back over to the dark side, the hacker

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:39.526
side, or at least the side of the internet entrepreneur who isn’t afraid of a brush with the law.

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:44.598
He was part hacker, part businessman, and for both

00:08:44.598 --> 00:08:47.938
sides of his character he was a talented self-publicist.

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:54.608
He would make grand announcements, like that he had hacked into Osama Bin Laden’s bank accounts,

00:08:54.688 --> 00:09:00.738
or that he had stolen $20 million from Citibank and given it to Greenpeace, knowing full

00:09:00.738 --> 00:09:06.698
well that these catchy headlines would be sure to make it into the press, and the journalists

00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:12.898
writing the story would have little way of verifying Kim’s claims, of checking they were true.

00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:18.888
Greenpeace, by the way, reported that it was completely not true that Kim had

00:09:18.898 --> 00:09:23.308
hacked $20 million from Citibank and given it to them, it was a straight up lie.

00:09:24.548 --> 00:09:28.418
But it didn’t matter, Kim knew that the press would print it.

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:34.918
And he knew something else that would always get the attention of a journalist: money.

00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:42.318
He would always be more than happy to self-report his net worth, how much money he had, with one

00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:50.238
Guardian article from 2001 reporting that the then 27-year-old hacker was worth a billion Euros,

00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:57.700
and another article that year reporting that one of his companies alone was worth €200 million.

00:09:59.118 --> 00:10:02.528
I’ll read you a quote from one of these Guardian articles,

00:10:02.648 --> 00:10:06.478
because it gives you an idea of why he was so easy to write about:

00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:15.378
The 6'4", 18-stone giant has since divided his time between growing Kimvestor - which he

00:10:15.378 --> 00:10:22.368
values at 200m euros - and spending his money on top models, fast cars and expensive boats.

00:10:23.108 --> 00:10:28.368
He now owns a Challenger jet, a helicopter, several sports cars and a yacht.

00:10:29.618 --> 00:10:35.648
Last May he spent $1m chartering a 240-foot luxury yacht for a week,

00:10:36.048 --> 00:10:40.048
mooring it in Monte Carlo harbour for the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix

00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:44.908
and throwing lavish parties for guests including Prince Ranier of Monaco.

00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:46.768
End quote.

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:54.418
And 2001, the year these Guardian articles came out, would also be the year that he had

00:10:54.418 --> 00:10:59.608
his first serious brush with the law, that he would get into trouble with the authorities.

00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:07.758
This was in the era of the dot com boom and then crash, and in the middle of it Kim

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:13.491
bought shares in a struggling almost bankrupt internet company called LetsBuyIt,

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:20.178
and then promptly announced that he was going to invest €50 million in the company.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:28.518
When the news of this got out, people rushed to buy the stock, making the stock price shoot up.

00:11:29.728 --> 00:11:34.098
People thought that Kim must know something they didn’t, this was going

00:11:34.098 --> 00:11:37.888
to be the next big thing; why else would Kim put so much money into it?

00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:43.796
But all Kim did was promptly sell all of his stock when the

00:11:43.844 --> 00:11:48.444
price increased, netting himself a tidy €1.5 million in profits.

00:11:49.994 --> 00:11:53.004
Tidy, perhaps, but it was illegal.

00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:56.064
You can’t do this, it’s called insider trading.

00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:59.884
And it comes with serious legal consequences.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:04.894
He was pursued by the German authorities, but fled to Thailand.

00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:11.284
He maintained that he didn’t know that what he had done was a crime, saying it was a simple mistake.

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:15.784
And indeed, even after he was eventually arrested by the

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:20.024
Thai police and extradited back to Germany, he escaped jail.

00:12:21.444 --> 00:12:26.204
But all of this would pale in comparison for what was to come.

00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:32.094
Instead of going up against the relatively small-fry of business communications

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:37.014
companies and some minor insider trading, he went up against Hollywood.

00:12:37.954 --> 00:12:40.974
Instead of making a few million dollars in profits,

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:44.214
he started a company that made hundreds of millions.

00:12:44.954 --> 00:12:51.554
Instead of some niche websites, he built a website that, at its peak, was the 13th

00:12:51.614 --> 00:12:57.844
most popular website in the world and responsible for 4% of all internet traffic.

00:12:58.804 --> 00:13:01.814
Instead of a knock on the door by the German police would

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:06.043
come helicopters and attack dogs ordered by the FBI.

00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:10.114
And instead of a suspended sentence, no jail time,

00:13:10.544 --> 00:13:13.984
he would face charges of up to 50 years in prison.

00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:20.635
The website in question was called Megaupload.com; you may well remember it.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:24.313
He started the company in 2005.

00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:30.505
It was a free file sharing service, allowing anyone with an internet connection to

00:13:30.555 --> 00:13:35.905
upload a file to the Megaupload servers, so that it could be downloaded by anyone else.

00:13:37.365 --> 00:13:42.355
If you are familiar with things like Google Drive or Dropbox, it was the same

00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:49.815
idea, but with an important distinction, a key difference: Megaupload was a

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:54.535
treasure trove of pirated content, of films and music that had been copied,

00:13:54.925 --> 00:14:00.345
uploaded to Megaupload.com’s servers, and were now free for anyone to access.

00:14:01.485 --> 00:14:07.475
Yes, there was a “Premium” paid tier of Megaupload, which gave people things like faster

00:14:07.475 --> 00:14:13.995
downloads, and this premium tier did bring in over a hundred million dollars in revenue every year.

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:16.795
But for everyone else, it was free.

00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:21.375
You could download the latest Hollywood movies for free, at the

00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:25.285
click of a button, and watch them in the comfort of your own home.

00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:30.135
And over 50 million people did this every single day.

00:14:31.295 --> 00:14:36.095
I was a university student at the height of Megaupload’s popularity, and if

00:14:36.095 --> 00:14:40.295
you put me on the spot and asked whether my friends and I had ever downloaded

00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:44.325
any of these pirated films, I would probably have to say “no comment”.

00:14:45.315 --> 00:14:50.945
But with so many people using the site, so many people watching pirated content

00:14:51.175 --> 00:14:56.535
and Hollywood not seeing a penny from it, the good times would only last so long.

00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:03.585
Kim, who by this time had legally changed his surname from Schmitz to

00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:08.405
Dotcom, had told the authorities that Megaupload was doing everything

00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:12.485
it could to restrict the amount of pirated content uploaded to the site.

00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:18.345
Whenever the content owners contacted Megaupload to inform them of a

00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:22.235
breach of copyright, Megaupload would remove the offending material.

00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:27.365
There were internal tools, checks and balances, to minimise the amount

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:31.905
of copyrighted material that made its way onto the file-sharing service.

00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:35.195
And, Megaupload couldn’t stop everything.

00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:39.252
After all, it was an absolutely massive website, with

00:15:39.432 --> 00:15:42.742
millions of hours of content being uploaded every single day.

00:15:43.322 --> 00:15:44.862
How could you ever keep up with this?

00:15:46.292 --> 00:15:52.522
By this point, Kim had moved again, fleeing Hong Kong, where he had allegedly been

00:15:52.522 --> 00:15:58.472
working in a luxury office suite in a hotel that cost $13,000 every single day.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:05.262
He set up a new base in New Zealand, a very long way away from the European and

00:16:05.262 --> 00:16:10.122
American authorities who might want to ask him uncomfortable questions about Megaupload.

00:16:11.242 --> 00:16:14.812
He received New Zealand citizenship, gave substantial amounts of

00:16:14.812 --> 00:16:18.732
money to the Christchurch earthquake relief fund, brought his family

00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:23.192
with him, and had started a completely new life in the country.

00:16:24.312 --> 00:16:26.682
He wasn’t a completely new man, however.

00:16:27.352 --> 00:16:31.312
He brought with him a fleet of expensive cars, all of his gadgets,

00:16:31.412 --> 00:16:36.232
and leased a sprawling piece of land that he called “Dotcom mansion”.

00:16:37.752 --> 00:16:42.802
But, if he thought that moving to New Zealand would be sufficient, in the

00:16:42.812 --> 00:16:48.162
early morning of January 20th, of 2012, he would realise he was wrong.

00:16:49.702 --> 00:16:55.722
As you heard at the start of the episode, there was a huge police raid, a raid more appropriate for

00:16:55.722 --> 00:17:01.242
some kind of international terrorist ring or drug cartel than a middle aged computer programmer.

00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:05.272
After the raid, he was brought into custody.

00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:10.772
the police confiscated $5 million worth of supercars, eight flat TV

00:17:10.772 --> 00:17:15.062
screens, jet skis, and a plethora of other souvenirs and valuable

00:17:15.062 --> 00:17:18.472
collector’s items that Kim Dotcom had been storing at his house.

00:17:19.492 --> 00:17:23.752
They seized millions of dollars in cash, froze 50 bank accounts

00:17:23.872 --> 00:17:28.052
with links to Dotcom, and–of course–shut down Megaupload.

00:17:29.062 --> 00:17:33.322
The authorities succeeded in taking away much of his worldly possessions

00:17:33.382 --> 00:17:39.002
and shutting down the offending site, but the FBI didn’t have the same luck

00:17:39.052 --> 00:17:43.002
with its goal of extraditing Dotcom to the United States, where he stood

00:17:43.002 --> 00:17:48.592
accused of costing songwriters and filmmakers $500 million in lost revenue.

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:54.792
Kim Dotcom fought the extradition order tooth and nail.

00:17:55.562 --> 00:18:01.072
He argued that the raid was unlawful, and in fact a judge did rule

00:18:01.092 --> 00:18:05.182
in his favour and he ended up winning damages for how he was treated.

00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:12.492
The raid was more than 11 years ago, and the fight against extradition is still ongoing.

00:18:13.422 --> 00:18:17.422
But if you thought that Kim Dotcom would have retreated into the

00:18:17.432 --> 00:18:21.722
background and focussed solely on clearing his name and fighting the

00:18:21.732 --> 00:18:26.102
criminal charges against him, no, that’s not the sort of person he is.

00:18:27.462 --> 00:18:32.542
Since then, he has founded another software company, started his own political party

00:18:32.542 --> 00:18:37.242
in New Zealand, called “The Internet Party”, accused Barack Obama of colluding with

00:18:37.252 --> 00:18:41.872
Hollywood to arrange his arrest, in exchange for support for Obama’s presidential

00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:47.302
campaign, and can generally be found on Twitter tweeting some controversial opinions.

00:18:48.442 --> 00:18:52.962
And another fun piece of trivia about him is that, at the time of his

00:18:52.962 --> 00:18:57.452
arrest, he was also the number one player, the top-ranked player, in the

00:18:57.452 --> 00:19:02.152
entire world at Call of Duty Modern Warfare, a very popular video game.

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:09.092
To conclude, Kim Dotcom is only 49, as of the time of making this episode.

00:19:10.622 --> 00:19:16.302
In the less than half-century he has been alive, he has hacked NASA, moved countries multiple

00:19:16.302 --> 00:19:21.612
times, been chased and arrested by the German, Thai and New Zealand police, started one of the

00:19:21.612 --> 00:19:26.892
most popular websites in the world, become a bogeyman to the most powerful filmmakers in the

00:19:26.892 --> 00:19:32.722
world, and he has even released a music album that got to number eight in the New Zealand charts.

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:37.752
Say what you want about Kim Dotcom, but the one thing

00:19:37.762 --> 00:19:40.972
you can certainly not accuse him of is being boring.

00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:49.834
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the flamboyant, eccentric personality that is Kim Dotcom.

00:19:50.418 --> 00:19:53.348
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:57.178
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:57.618 --> 00:19:59.688
Did you ever use Megaupload.com?

00:20:00.248 --> 00:20:03.278
If so, did you know about the man behind the website?

00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:06.568
And what do you think about Kim Dotcom?

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.278
Hacker who made a few mistakes, or criminal mastermind

00:20:10.488 --> 00:20:13.148
who stole and profited from other people’s work?

00:20:13.778 --> 00:20:16.938
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

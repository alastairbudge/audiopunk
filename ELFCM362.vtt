Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.990
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.150
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.890
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.529
three-part mini-series on The Great American Con Artist.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.729
In case you missed them, in part one we looked at Billy McFarland

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:36.019
and Fyre Festival, the festival in the Bahamas that promised to be an

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:40.210
unforgettable experience of luxury and supermodels and then…wasn’t.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.489
Then in part two,  we looked at a man called Liver King, a man who claimed to have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.239
discovered the secret to true health and happiness by returning to an ancestral

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.480
lifestyle, which involved having ice cold baths and eating raw bull testicles.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.140
But there was one secret that he was keeping close to his chest, that he wasn’t telling people.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.929
And in part three, today’s episode, we are going to be talking

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.970
about Anna Sorokin or Anna Delvey, the fake German heiress.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.530
It’s an amazing story that sounds too good to be true, and involves New York

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.546
high society, social media of course, celebrities and lots and lots of money.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:28.895
OK then, the story of Anna Delvey, the fake German heiress.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:39.275
On April 25th, 2019, a young girl stood in New York’s City criminal court, ready to learn her fate.

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:43.235
She was not the typical occupant of the courtroom.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:47.135
She spoke in a soft, European accent.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:51.825
She had well-kept long brown hair, and large glasses.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:57.105
Several times during the month-long trial, she had even come in

00:01:57.295 --> 00:02:02.025
wearing designer clothing, not the prison-issued orange jumpsuit.

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:08.904
And, like the occupant of the dock, the charges were unusual.

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:13.384
Not petty theft, not stealing or assault.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:19.014
She was accused of multiple cases of what’s called “grand

00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:23.674
larceny”, in other words, stealing large amounts of money.

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:30.813
It would later be revealed that she stole up to $275,000 from

00:02:30.813 --> 00:02:34.993
a mixture of hotels, restaurants, shops, and individuals.

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:41.623
The jury deliberated for two days, but the verdict was clear.

00:02:42.873 --> 00:02:43.373
Guilty.

00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:50.923
She was led away to prison, and would spend three and a half years behind bars for her crimes.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:59.632
Now, to understand how she got to this point, we must go back six years, to 2013.

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:06.313
It was New York fashion week, a time where the who’s who of the fashion world comes together.

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:11.483
People from all over the world fly to the city for fancy

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:15.963
dinners, champagne, and the opportunity to meet and network.

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:20.703
One such person was a young lady called Anna.

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:27.441
She told people that she was a wealthy German heiress, that her father was a wealthy

00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:33.516
entrepreneur, and that she would inherit a large trust fund when she turned 25.

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:39.096
She wore expensive clothes, stylish but not over the top.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:43.396
She was clearly someone who knew and understood fashion.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.006
She seemed like she came from a wealthy background, and was very

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:51.646
accustomed to there being large amounts of money flying around.

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:57.526
She talked about the most fashionable bars and restaurants, she knew the places to go.

00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:02.206
This wasn’t someone who had just read up on some Buzzfeed list of

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:06.603
“The most expensive places to eat in New York City”; she really knew.

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:07.893
She had taste.

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:13.653
She had been working as an intern at a French fashion magazine called Purple.

00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:19.793
The pay wasn’t good, in fact, she was only paid €400 a month–a

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:24.573
pittance for Paris–but the connections she made were priceless.

00:04:25.543 --> 00:04:30.903
She knew people, she had taste, and the assumption of people who met her

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:36.713
was that there was something else she had: money, and bucketloads of it.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:41.053
Over the following year or so, she would be seen at the

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:44.573
most exclusive parties and social events in New York City.

00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:50.333
She seemed to know everyone, and would introduce people as “her

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:54.413
dear friend X or Y”, despite only having met them a few times.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:02.873
The impression was that this girl was connected, and that she had money coming out of her ears.

00:05:04.163 --> 00:05:07.513
Even back in the early days, though, there were strange

00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:11.423
signs that something was off, something wasn’t quite right.

00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:21.213
In 2015 she met a Chinese socialite and art collector called Michael Xufu Huang, and asked

00:05:21.213 --> 00:05:27.073
him if they could go together to the Venice Biennale, a cultural festival in Venice, in Italy.

00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:29.993
Sure, Huang said, it would be fun.

00:05:31.173 --> 00:05:35.753
Anna asked him to book the plane tickets and hotel, which was a bit

00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:39.623
weird because she clearly had a lot of money, but he did so anyway.

00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:44.543
They went to the Biennale, had a lot of fun, Anna paid for

00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:48.328
everything in cash, and tipped generously, as she always did.

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:55.928
But when they returned to New York City, Anna seemed to just forget about paying him back.

00:05:56.758 --> 00:06:00.888
It wasn’t a huge amount, by Huang’s standards, two or three

00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:04.348
thousand dollars, but it was a sign of things to come.

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:09.748
So, what was this Anna actually doing in New York?

00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:15.008
She was no longer working for Purple, she was working on her own project.

00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:22.108
She had a vision for a private members and arts club called The Anna Delvey Foundation.

00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:27.328
Like everything involving Anna Delvey, it would be exclusive,

00:06:27.748 --> 00:06:32.048
have impeccable taste, and require vast amounts of money.

00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:37.878
To try to make her dream a reality, she started scouting for locations.

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:44.098
Now, we aren’t talking about a small house or a disused commercial building, Anna

00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:50.668
wouldn’t settle for anything less than a super exclusive location, and a giant building.

00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:58.268
After all, it would be named after her, it had to turn heads, it had to be a prime location.

00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:05.258
The building she settled on was called Church Missions House, which is an amazing

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:11.178
historic building in Manhattan with six floors and over 3,000 metres of space.

00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:16.268
And in the club itself, no expense would be spared.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.208
There would be exclusive restaurants, a German bakery, and a luxury hotel.

00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:29.418
But at this stage the idea for the club was only that, it was an idea.

00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:36.588
To turn it into a reality she needed capital, money, and lots of it.

00:07:37.808 --> 00:07:43.228
The problem was, Anna told her friends and people involved with the project, she would only come

00:07:43.248 --> 00:07:50.138
into her inheritance when she was 25, so she needed a loan to get the project off the ground.

00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:53.128
And it wasn’t a small loan.

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:56.401
She needed about $25 million.

00:07:57.421 --> 00:08:02.648
A lot of money, sure, but it seemed like this was a relatively insignificant amount

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:07.418
of money for someone like Anna, someone who would spend thousands of dollars a day.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.588
Everything about Anna screamed wealth and luxury.

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:22.341
For starters, she was living in a hotel, 11 Howard, in Soho, Manhattan, in a $400 a night room.

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:29.861
And among the hotel staff she was known for being an incredibly generous tipper, she

00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:35.181
would slip a $100 bill as a tip for anyone who did anything for her - brought her

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.881
shopping to her room, carried her suitcase, or made a restaurant reservation for her.

00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:44.377
Understandably, this made her very popular.

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:48.793
And she actually grew close with one hotel employee

00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:52.353
in particular, the concierge, a lady called Neff.

00:08:53.473 --> 00:08:57.823
In fact, a lot about what we know about Anna’s time at 11 Howard

00:08:58.093 --> 00:09:02.513
comes directly from interviews with Neff, and the long article in a

00:09:02.513 --> 00:09:06.133
magazine called The Cut that would reveal what Anna was really up to.

00:09:07.753 --> 00:09:10.743
Anyway, Neff and Anna grew close.

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:15.073
Anna would take her shopping, she would go out to dinner with her, she even

00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:19.033
offered to finance a film that Neff was hoping to save up enough money to make.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:23.163
It was clearly a strange relationship.

00:09:23.883 --> 00:09:27.473
Transactional, on one level, with Anna giving Neff

00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:30.286
hundred dollar bills every time she did something for her.

00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:33.843
But there was clearly something deeper there.

00:09:35.403 --> 00:09:40.663
It turned out, Neff grew to realise that Anna was actually quite lonely.

00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:46.223
She knew everyone, she would constantly be going out for lunches and dinners at New

00:09:46.223 --> 00:09:51.163
York’s most expensive restaurants, she would introduce people as her great friend.

00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:57.623
But it was the concierge, Neff realised, that Anna would confide in the most.

00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:02.393
She would spend hours at the desk talking to Neff about her hopes

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:06.283
and dreams, taking her on shopping trips, and going out for dinner.

00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:09.653
Anna would always pay for Neff.

00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:13.133
But one evening, something strange happened.

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:21.073
They were out at a restaurant, the bill came, but Anna’s credit card was declined, it was rejected.

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:25.843
Anna had a list of other credit card numbers that she asked

00:10:25.843 --> 00:10:29.553
the waiter to use, but they all came back as rejected.

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.593
It must have been some issue with the card network,

00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:35.833
Anna said, and she asked Neff to pick up the check.

00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:41.303
It was a lot of money, by Neff’s standards at least, but the pair

00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:44.823
were friends, and friends do this sort of thing for each other, right?

00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:52.103
In fact, this was only one of an increasing number of signs that Anna’s financial situation

00:10:52.313 --> 00:10:59.193
wasn’t quite as she suggested, and that Anna Delvey might not be who she said she was.

00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:06.021
The first sign was relating to the financing of her grand eponymous members-club.

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:11.971
She had, it appears, managed to convince an investment company to give her a

00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:17.031
multi-million dollar loan to pay for the start-up costs of The Anna Delvey Foundation.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:23.091
There had been multiple negotiations, Anna had put the investment company in touch

00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:28.601
with a man named Peter Hennecke, who had provided bank statements from her trust fund.

00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:34.571
Peter Hennecke was, according to Anna, her “family advisor”,

00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:37.741
the man entrusted to look after the family fortune.

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.021
Essentially, it was Peter who controlled the purse strings.

00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:46.741
There were some peculiarities about this man though.

00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:52.931
He used an AOL email address, he promised to send financial statements but they

00:11:52.931 --> 00:11:59.101
were either late or incomplete, and there was no evidence of him anywhere online.

00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:04.711
It was strange, but lots about Anna was a little strange.

00:12:05.295 --> 00:12:09.983
Eccentric perhaps, but lots of very wealthy people are a little odd.

00:12:11.253 --> 00:12:14.843
In any case, the investment company agreed to finance

00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:17.073
the loan, they were going to give Anna the money.

00:12:18.443 --> 00:12:22.513
As part of the due diligence process, and a condition of the loan,

00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:27.093
representatives of the investment company would go to Switzerland, where

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:31.543
her fortune was reportedly being held, to speak with her private bankers.

00:12:33.093 --> 00:12:39.223
When Anna got wind of this, when she heard it, she baulked, she got cold feet and

00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:44.003
told them she no longer wanted them to provide a loan, she didn't want their money.

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:48.883
Not exactly the behaviour of someone who is being totally honest…

00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:56.347
Fast forward to March of 2017, things were really starting to go wrong for Anna Delvey.

00:12:57.317 --> 00:13:01.167
It turned out that she had never actually paid her hotel bill at

00:13:01.287 --> 00:13:05.937
11 Howard, the $400 a night boutique hotel where she had met Neff.

00:13:07.317 --> 00:13:12.467
She had been allowed to check into the hotel without having a credit card on file because of who

00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:18.647
she was - a supposed multimillionaire German heiress who knew the richest people in New York City.

00:13:20.107 --> 00:13:24.047
And it wasn’t only the cost of the room, the $400 a night.

00:13:24.727 --> 00:13:28.447
There was room service, champagne, and meals at the

00:13:28.447 --> 00:13:31.737
hotel's Michelin Star restaurant, all billed to her room.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:39.543
After a month and a half of living the high life, this bill had reached $30,000.

00:13:40.817 --> 00:13:46.357
Anna had said it would be settled, it would be paid, by her team, but no payment came.

00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:51.527
Clearly, it was somewhat of a delicate situation for the hotel.

00:13:52.447 --> 00:13:57.947
On the one hand, there was this valued and highly profitable guest, a young girl who was

00:13:57.947 --> 00:14:03.217
spending tens of thousands of dollars at the hotel and who was very generous with her tips.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.097
On the other hand, she was only valued and profitable

00:14:07.127 --> 00:14:10.267
on paper, as no money had actually been received.

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:18.043
Neff, the concierge and the person closest to Anna, was asked to have this delicate conversation.

00:14:19.223 --> 00:14:21.603
Anna promised that the bill would be settled.

00:14:22.493 --> 00:14:25.043
Days went past, but no funds appeared.

00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:30.853
The hotel told Anna, in no uncertain terms, that if the bill

00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:34.513
wasn’t paid they would lock her room, she would be kicked out.

00:14:36.153 --> 00:14:41.788
Finally, as if by magic, the money did appear, all $30,000 of it.

00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:49.118
Anna had some breathing room, she was ok, but she was told by the hotel that she did

00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:53.248
need to have a valid credit card on file if she wanted to continue to stay there.

00:14:54.368 --> 00:14:57.818
But no credit card was added, and the bills piled up.

00:14:58.908 --> 00:15:02.708
Eventually, after continued non-payment, the hotel

00:15:02.728 --> 00:15:06.318
removed all of her stuff from her room and locked her out.

00:15:08.128 --> 00:15:14.288
To detox, to supposedly reset her American visa, and also because she had nowhere else

00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:20.038
to go, she decided to jet off on a trip to Morocco with a group of close acquaintances.

00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:25.288
The venue was Marrakech, and Anna had rented the same

00:15:25.298 --> 00:15:28.048
luxury villa that Khloé Kardashian had stayed in.

00:15:28.698 --> 00:15:33.158
It would cost $7,000 a night, but it would be worth every penny.

00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:38.418
This trip, it would transpire, would be a total disaster.

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:43.318
There were numerous problems with Anna’s credit card, unpaid bills, and

00:15:43.548 --> 00:15:47.578
the friends only just managed to return to New York without being arrested.

00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:52.698
The net was well and truly closing in around Anna Delvey.

00:15:53.758 --> 00:15:59.018
She couldn’t move back into 11 Howard, and instead moved into another luxury hotel.

00:16:00.068 --> 00:16:04.178
It didn’t take this hotel long to realise that Anna had no intention

00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:09.698
of paying, and she racked up an $11,500 bill before being kicked out.

00:16:11.168 --> 00:16:15.258
Things were going from bad to worse for Anna, and even her

00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:18.518
friends had realised that she wasn’t who she said she was.

00:16:19.838 --> 00:16:23.158
Worse still, these friends had had to pay for things on

00:16:23.178 --> 00:16:27.088
Anna’s behalf, and she owed them tens of thousands of dollars.

00:16:28.498 --> 00:16:32.318
All the while, she had been depositing fake checks at banks, and

00:16:32.438 --> 00:16:36.018
withdrawing the money or transferring it to a different bank before

00:16:36.018 --> 00:16:39.398
the cheque had time to bounce, to be discovered as fraudulent.

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.088
This, by the way, was where she got all the cash from.

00:16:44.418 --> 00:16:46.578
It was fraud, pure and simple.

00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:50.648
And clearly, this is a serious crime.

00:16:51.298 --> 00:16:57.385
By now it was far more than a simple case of some angry hotel owners, the police were after her.

00:16:58.998 --> 00:17:02.968
It wouldn’t be until October of that year that she was arrested, in

00:17:02.968 --> 00:17:07.188
the fitting location of a luxury addiction facility in California.

00:17:08.848 --> 00:17:14.238
And this brings us back to the start of the episode, her trial and subsequent imprisonment.

00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:20.338
It turned out that Anna Delvey was indeed not who she said she was.

00:17:21.418 --> 00:17:26.298
She wasn’t German; she was Russian, but had moved to Germany when she was 16.

00:17:27.318 --> 00:17:32.428
She wasn’t an heiress; her father was a truck driver who then opened a small

00:17:32.448 --> 00:17:36.978
energy company, and was far from the multi-millionaire she said he was.

00:17:37.828 --> 00:17:41.652
Her name wasn’t even Anna Delvey; it was Anna Sorokin.

00:17:42.422 --> 00:17:44.592
It was all one giant lie.

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:51.212
And the amazing thing about this story is that she almost got away with it.

00:17:51.802 --> 00:17:57.062
It seems like she did work very hard, she did have this big vision for what she wanted

00:17:57.062 --> 00:18:03.182
to achieve, everyone who met her said that she was smart and determined, and if she had

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:08.322
been able to get the investment, she might have been able to pull it off, who knows?

00:18:09.092 --> 00:18:15.032
It was the ultimate fake-it-till-you-make-it con, and she almost did make it.

00:18:16.342 --> 00:18:21.667
Indeed, at her trial, she was asked whether she was sorry for the damage she had caused.

00:18:22.487 --> 00:18:26.997
Normally, defendants say yes, of course, I’m so sorry for everyone

00:18:26.997 --> 00:18:30.867
I hurt, as either they have learned their lesson or they want to

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:34.187
pretend that they’ve learned their lesson so their sentence is reduced.

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:40.937
Anna Delvey, or Anna Sorokin I should say, had an unusual response.

00:18:42.397 --> 00:18:47.707
She said, and I’m quoting directly, “The thing is, I’m not sorry.

00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:52.915
I’d be lying to you and to everyone else and to myself if I said I was sorry for anything.”

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:57.975
As you heard at the start, she was sentenced to four

00:18:58.055 --> 00:19:01.755
to 12 years in prison, and she served three and a half.

00:19:02.815 --> 00:19:08.205
She is now out, a free woman, and has given several interviews about her future.

00:19:09.445 --> 00:19:13.265
Clearly, she is a clever and talented young woman, with

00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:17.585
big plans, grand ambitions, significant hopes and dreams.

00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:25.045
One only has to hope that her methods of realising these dreams will be a little less fraudulent.

00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:33.025
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Anna Delvey, the fake German heiress,

00:19:33.235 --> 00:19:37.935
and with it comes the end of this mini-series on The Great American Con Artist.

00:19:38.465 --> 00:19:44.745
I know, you might say, Anna Delvey wasn’t American, but I think her con was even better than the

00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:50.615
Americans in this mini-series, and it took place in America, so I think it deserves its place.

00:19:51.535 --> 00:19:53.805
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:19:54.075 --> 00:19:56.965
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:19:57.365 --> 00:20:01.035
Of the three con artists we learned about - Billy McFarland, Liver

00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:04.775
King and Anna Delvey, whose crimes do you think are the worst?

00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:06.745
Are they all as bad as each other?

00:20:07.085 --> 00:20:09.605
And what do you think the future holds for them?

00:20:10.195 --> 00:20:13.545
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.640
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.700
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.650
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.159
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.470
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.629
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.939
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.050
talking about the governing body of

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.000
the world’s most popular sport, an

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.230
organisation with more member states

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.320
than the United Nations, making it

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.760
by some standards the world’s biggest

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.410
non-governmental organisation.

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.299
We are talking, of course, about FIFA.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.849
But despite its position atop the world’s

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.240
most popular sport, FIFA is also widely

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.150
regarded as corrupt, described by some

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.939
as being run like a ‘mafia family’.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.159
So, in this episode we will ask

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.989
ourselves, how could that be?

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.139
How could it be that the beautiful

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.089
game, as football is known by

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.809
billions of fans around the world,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.949
is run by such a dirty organisation?

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:11.656
OK then, let’s get into it and talk about

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:14.796
FIFA: the most corrupt name in sport.

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:21.556
In July of 2015, a man named Sepp

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:24.426
Blatter sat at the FIFA headquarters

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:26.036
in Zurich, in Switzerland.

00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:29.646
At the time, Blatter was the most

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.806
senior man in world football, and he was

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:35.000
preparing to give a press conference.

00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:38.424
In his hands were some papers,

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:41.054
and to his left another official.

00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:44.434
Behind him was the FIFA symbol

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:47.064
in white against a blue backdrop.

00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:50.344
As they prepared for the press

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.384
conference, Blatter looked down

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:54.174
and read through his notes.

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:57.894
But then, out of nowhere, a man

00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:00.484
appeared and walked onto the stage.

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:03.084
As he got closer to Blatter, it

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:05.384
became clear that his hands were

00:02:05.404 --> 00:02:08.124
stuffed full of dollar bills.

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:11.904
“North Korea 2026,” the man shouted,

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.624
putting a wedge of money on the desk.

00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:17.304
Blatter and his colleague

00:02:17.454 --> 00:02:19.484
looked up, and then nervously

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:21.134
to their left, off the stage.

00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:23.284
“Security!” Blatter said.

00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:24.774
“Security, come on!

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.024
Where is my security?”

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:29.334
The intruder turned to the crowd

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:31.354
and faced the world’s media.

00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:34.264
“As North Korean football ambassador,”

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:36.614
he said, “I’m delighted… I think

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:38.474
this seals the deal with FIFA and

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:41.004
North Korea for the 2026 World Cup.”

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:44.924
As two security guards quickly made

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:47.004
their way onto the stage, the man

00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:49.654
turned to Blatter and threw another

00:02:49.654 --> 00:02:52.264
handful of cash high into the air.

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.284
As dollar bills rained down, spiralling

00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:58.924
through the air and all over the floor and

00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:01.654
the desk, the man added, “Cheers, Sepp.

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:03.534
It’s all there as discussed.”

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:06.884
The man was escorted, removed

00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:08.564
from the stage, and Blatter

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:11.084
stood up, unsure what to do next.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:14.624
After regaining his composure, he

00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:16.654
walked off the stage briefly and

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:19.264
then reappeared at another podium.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.869
Leaning into a microphone, he explained

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.879
that before the press conference could

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.949
begin, they would need to clean up.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.759
“This,” Blatter said, “has

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.899
nothing to do with football.”

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.109
So, if that truly had nothing to

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.169
do with football, what statement

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.859
was the man trying to make?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.469
What was that all about?

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.029
Well, before we get into the modern

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.129
accusations of corruption, we should

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.259
first consider a bit of history and

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.509
context so we can understand what exactly

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.319
FIFA is and what it’s supposed to do.

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.399
As you will probably know, many

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.689
countries and cultures claim to have

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.339
“invented” football, playing some

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.479
sort of game where a ball-like object

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.569
needs to be kicked towards a target.

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.269
But what we understand to be football

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.959
today, with teams and rules and

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.149
something resembling the modern game,

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:20.499
was created in England in the 1860s.

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:24.009
By the 20th century, it had become

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.409
popular not just as a club sport, that is,

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.629
played between teams in the same country,

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.049
but as an international spectacle.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.389
With a growing fanbase demanding

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.939
more international fixtures,

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.049
in May of 1904, the Federation

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:42.189
Internationale de Football Association,

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.299
or FIFA, was founded in Paris.

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.169
Its purpose was to regulate national

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.309
football associations, organise

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:53.469
international football matches between

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.239
countries, standardise the rules, and

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.229
promote the sport across the world.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:01.019
The football police, if you will.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.479
The founding members were

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.339
France, of course, along with

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.546
Spain, Belgium, Denmark, the

00:05:07.546 --> 00:05:09.659
Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden.

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.989
The Germans joined soon after, the

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.559
English a year later in 1906, and over

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:19.369
the next few years FIFA membership grew.

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.429
The first World Cup was to be held in

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:27.879
Uruguay in 1930, but even back then FIFA’s

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.109
decisions about which country should

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.399
host the tournament were controversial.

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:35.829
Uruguay, a tiny South American

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.839
nation, was given the tournament

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:40.279
because it had won the last two

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.349
football gold medals at the Olympics,

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.429
and because 1930 was the 100 year

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:47.629
anniversary of its first constitution.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.189
Fair enough, you might say,

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:52.139
but not everyone was happy.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.779
Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain,

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.389
and Hungary refused to participate in

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.209
the tournament, claiming the journey

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:02.809
was too long and expensive, and the

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:05.619
final between Argentina and Uruguay was

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.049
marred by death threats against players.

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.259
Not the best start, you might say.

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.799
But despite all that, football, as you

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:16.979
will know, continued to grow throughout

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.899
the rest of the 20th century, and

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.139
it’s now the most popular sport in

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.849
the world by practically every metric.

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:26.489
According to FIFA’s own figures,

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:28.799
football is now played by over

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:31.719
150 million registered players,

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.919
and the number who play and watch

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.209
casually runs into the billions.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.929
And by 2022, FIFA had grown to a

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.449
whopping 211 member states, more than

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.419
the United Nations, which only has 193.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.989
So, FIFA literally has a monopoly

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:52.829
on the world’s most popular sport,

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.359
and is responsible for regulating an

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:57.579
industry worth billions of dollars.

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:00.589
And, as you will know, it has

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:02.639
something of a reputation for

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.969
playing dirty, for corruption.

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.159
To quote the former chairman of the

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.159
English Football Association, Lord

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:12.809
Triesman, the organisation operates

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.459
like a "mafia family”, and has a - I'm

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.929
quoting directly - "decades-long tradition

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:21.809
of bribes, bungs and corruption".

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.379
A ‘bung’, by the way, is a synonym

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.799
for a bribe, or a payment made to

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.409
convince someone to do something,

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.789
often illegal or unethical.

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.609
So, was this just the musings

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:37.599
of a disgruntled Englishman, or

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:39.819
is there any evidence that FIFA

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.589
is as corrupt as he claimed?

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:45.419
Well, as the expression goes, “where

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:47.719
there’s smoke, there’s fire”, meaning

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:49.839
that accusations are rarely made

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:51.969
without some truth behind them.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.999
And as it turns out, there are plenty

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.459
of scandals and accusations that

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:00.329
have been made against football’s

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.849
most powerful organisation.

00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:05.739
And when it comes to these scandals, these

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.259
allegations of bribery and corruption,

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:10.979
they almost always come down to FIFA’s

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:13.339
main responsibility: the choice of which

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:16.539
country gets to host the FIFA World Cup.

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:19.179
It might have been controversial

00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:22.719
back in 1930, but now everything

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:25.229
has been dialled up a notch, it has

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:27.269
become more important due to the

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.379
enormous sums of money involved.

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:32.219
Television and sponsorship deals

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.509
run into the hundreds of millions,

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.839
and for the countries that actually

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.879
host the tournaments, the World

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:40.909
Cup is a massive boost to its

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.959
tourism and hospitality sectors.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:46.168
With billions watching, it is perhaps

00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:49.088
the greatest advertising opportunity any

00:08:49.088 --> 00:08:51.868
country can wish for, right up there if

00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:53.978
not more important than the Olympics.

00:08:54.998 --> 00:08:57.038
It’s hardly surprising then, that

00:08:57.048 --> 00:08:59.248
some countries will do just about

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.098
anything to get a World Cup.

00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:04.748
We’ll look at a few of these scandals in

00:09:04.748 --> 00:09:06.948
a minute, but first of all, let me just

00:09:06.968 --> 00:09:09.848
address the question of how FIFA actually

00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:12.578
chooses what country hosts a World Cup?

00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:16.358
Now it’s a more equal process, with

00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:18.748
every FIFA member state having one

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:21.548
vote, and the voting continues until

00:09:21.558 --> 00:09:24.285
one bid  has a majority of the vote.

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:28.235
But until recently, the decision was

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:31.415
made by a 24-person executive committee,

00:09:31.855 --> 00:09:34.735
and if there was a tie for first place,

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:37.165
the president, which was until recently

00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:39.685
Sepp Blatter, would have a deciding vote.

00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:43.785
Importantly, the votes were anonymous

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:46.648
so it wasn't public which member of

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:48.768
the committee voted for which country.

00:09:50.108 --> 00:09:53.498
Taking a sceptic’s view here, this makes

00:09:53.498 --> 00:09:55.678
it ripe for corruption, as a member

00:09:55.718 --> 00:09:57.668
of the committee could theoretically

00:09:57.708 --> 00:10:00.398
accept a bribe and vote for a proposal

00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:02.638
without it ever being revealed that it

00:10:02.638 --> 00:10:05.098
was them who voted for that proposal.

00:10:06.618 --> 00:10:08.868
But they would never do that, I

00:10:08.868 --> 00:10:10.838
hear you say, these are some of the

00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:13.208
most professional and best-regarded

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.258
footballing executives in the world!

00:10:16.358 --> 00:10:18.478
Well, I said that the committee was

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:21.988
24 people, but even that had to change

00:10:22.148 --> 00:10:24.078
after two members of the committee

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:27.278
were busted, or caught, trying to sell

00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:29.278
their votes to journalists working

00:10:29.308 --> 00:10:31.273
on an undercover story in 2010.

00:10:32.428 --> 00:10:35.038
I should say here, there have been

00:10:35.048 --> 00:10:37.048
allegations about FIFA committee

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:38.593
members taking money for their

00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:41.888
votes since the 1980s, but there was

00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:44.658
never really any concrete evidence.

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:47.735
People suspected that it happened,

00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:49.155
but could never prove it.

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.280
After all, the votes were anonymous,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.900
it was very hard to prove.

00:10:55.037 --> 00:10:58.607
That was until the summer of 2015, when

00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:01.477
an American federal investigation shook

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.887
the football world to its core and

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:07.197
charged 14 FIFA officials with money

00:11:07.207 --> 00:11:09.847
laundering, racketeering, and fraud.

00:11:11.197 --> 00:11:13.287
The defendants, which included

00:11:13.427 --> 00:11:15.623
high-ranking FIFA officials and even

00:11:15.643 --> 00:11:18.463
executive committee members, were involved

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:22.183
in, and I’m quoting directly, "a 24-year

00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:25.133
scheme to enrich themselves through the

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.130
corruption of international soccer”.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.270
And we’re not just talking

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.869
about  a few dollars here.

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:34.199
According to estimates from the

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:36.569
US Justice department, the 14

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:38.989
indicted FIFA members had accepted

00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:43.909
$150m over two and a half decades.

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:47.299
The beautiful game, as many had

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:50.119
feared, was dirty to its very core.

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:53.479
So, how did this all come

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:55.471
out, how was it revealed?

00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.741
It’s all thanks to a man named Chuck

00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.151
Blazer, the former top official

00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:03.171
in American football, who gave

00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:05.411
information to the US investigation.

00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:10.391
He claimed that between 2004 and 2011

00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:13.401
several top FIFA committee members took

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:15.101
bribes in return for choosing South

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.001
Africa as the host of the 2010 World Cup.

00:12:19.191 --> 00:12:21.038
He even claimed that the former

00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.781
Vice-President of FIFA, Jack Warner,

00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.911
took a $10 million bribe from South

00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:28.661
African officials for his vote.

00:12:29.588 --> 00:12:31.328
So, if you were wondering how

00:12:31.328 --> 00:12:34.348
much a vote costs, $10 million is

00:12:34.348 --> 00:12:36.048
your answer in Jack Warner’s case.

00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:40.348
Blazer also claimed that Warner bribed

00:12:40.458 --> 00:12:42.748
other FIFA officials to support the

00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:44.938
South African bid with envelopes of

00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:47.858
cash containing as much as $40,000.

00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:52.593
Incredibly, when one official rejected

00:12:52.633 --> 00:12:54.923
Warner’s envelopes, he is reported to

00:12:54.923 --> 00:12:57.223
have said: "There are some people here

00:12:57.393 --> 00:12:59.323
who think they are more pious than thou.

00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:02.293
If you're pious, open a church, friends.

00:13:02.623 --> 00:13:04.423
Our business is our business.”

00:13:06.063 --> 00:13:07.653
Translating this into plain

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:10.073
English, if you’re in FIFA and

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:12.063
concerned about corruption, you’d

00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:13.843
be better off opening a church.

00:13:15.373 --> 00:13:17.193
The South African government, of course,

00:13:17.473 --> 00:13:19.653
insisted that these were payments to

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:22.373
promote Caribbean football, but Warner

00:13:22.383 --> 00:13:24.983
used the money to rack up credit card

00:13:24.993 --> 00:13:27.903
debts, give himself personal loans, and

00:13:27.903 --> 00:13:30.483
withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:34.321
And by the way, Chuck Blazer, the

00:13:34.535 --> 00:13:36.701
whistleblower who revealed all of this

00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:38.961
information and set the wheels in motion?

00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:40.801
He was no angel.

00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.501
He was forced to inform on his

00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.671
former colleagues after he was found

00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:47.321
to have accepted a million-dollar

00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:48.991
bribe to vote for South Africa,

00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.081
and he pled guilty to racketeering,

00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:54.351
wire fraud, and money laundering.

00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.961
He only cracked and talked

00:13:57.001 --> 00:13:58.501
to the authorities in order

00:13:58.501 --> 00:13:59.881
to reduce his own sentence.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.081
And as more and more evidence was found,

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:07.001
it became clear that South Africa was

00:14:07.011 --> 00:14:09.921
far from the only country to win a World

00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:13.881
Cup “under the table”, partly or entirely

00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:16.021
by bribing FIFA committee members.

00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:19.321
Now, you will remember that the

00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:21.751
last two World Cups were not held

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:24.031
in countries traditionally known for

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:26.081
their footballing history or culture:

00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:29.541
Russia and Qatar, and they were both

00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:32.101
“surprise” winners of the World Cup vote.

00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:35.941
In Russia’s case, it was up against

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:38.611
England, and joint bids from Belgium

00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:40.551
and the Netherlands, and then another

00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:42.441
joint bid from Portugal and Spain.

00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:46.351
And in Qatar’s case, it was up

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:48.671
against Australia, Japan, South

00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:50.361
Korea, and the United States.

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:54.381
So, how did they get the World Cups?

00:14:55.231 --> 00:14:57.151
If you ask the FIFA committee members

00:14:57.151 --> 00:14:58.631
who voted for them, they would

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.401
no doubt tell you that Russia and

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.921
Qatar presented the best proposals,

00:15:03.071 --> 00:15:05.491
and an opportunity to promote and

00:15:05.491 --> 00:15:07.451
develop football in new regions.

00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:10.821
If you ask other people, you might get

00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:13.581
different answers, and they might suggest

00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:15.761
that several members of the voting

00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:18.451
committee took other factors into account.

00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:22.468
Specifically, the main, or perhaps

00:15:22.708 --> 00:15:25.108
only factor, was how much they would

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:26.972
personally be paid for their vote.

00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.752
According to a BBC investigation, three

00:15:31.762 --> 00:15:34.232
senior FIFA officials who voted on the

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:36.712
2018 tournament, which was awarded to

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:39.622
Russia, as well as the 2022 World Cup in

00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:42.912
Qatar, had taken bribes back in the 1990s.

00:15:44.192 --> 00:15:46.262
And we aren’t talking about accepting

00:15:46.262 --> 00:15:48.512
a free holiday or concert tickets.

00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:52.012
We are talking cold, hard cash, bribes

00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:55.332
that allegedly totalled around $100m.

00:15:56.582 --> 00:15:58.452
So, committee members who had been

00:15:58.452 --> 00:16:00.562
taking millions in bribes over the

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:02.742
years were allowed to stay in their

00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:05.272
positions and vote on these World Cups.

00:16:06.142 --> 00:16:09.022
And in the 21st century, the stakes

00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:11.112
were a lot higher, the sums of

00:16:11.112 --> 00:16:12.862
money involved were a lot greater.

00:16:13.562 --> 00:16:16.162
Do you think these allegedly corrupt

00:16:16.162 --> 00:16:18.552
officials would change their ways, and

00:16:18.702 --> 00:16:20.722
their votes would go on merit alone?

00:16:21.802 --> 00:16:23.362
Well, according to U.S.

00:16:23.372 --> 00:16:26.232
prosecutors, at least five members

00:16:26.362 --> 00:16:28.632
of FIFA’s top committee accepted

00:16:28.632 --> 00:16:31.152
bribes ahead of the 2010 vote to

00:16:31.152 --> 00:16:33.232
choose Russia and Qatar as hosts.

00:16:34.652 --> 00:16:37.052
In the case of Qatar, it is alleged

00:16:37.182 --> 00:16:39.122
that a former FIFA executive committee

00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:41.352
member from Qatar, Mohammed bin

00:16:41.352 --> 00:16:43.812
Hammam, paid millions in bribes to

00:16:43.812 --> 00:16:46.172
his former colleagues in order to get

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.112
the tournament for his homeland, a

00:16:48.302 --> 00:16:50.522
tiny desert nation with no footballing

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.302
culture or history to speak of.

00:16:53.172 --> 00:16:55.482
These included three South American

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:58.192
officials, from Argentina, Paraguay

00:16:58.192 --> 00:17:00.842
and Brazil, who allegedly received

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.602
large bribes to vote for Qatar.

00:17:04.152 --> 00:17:06.742
And as for the decision to award the World

00:17:06.742 --> 00:17:09.912
Cup to Russia, prosecutors also believed

00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:13.132
that Jack Warner [yes, him again], that he

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:16.432
was given $5 million to vote for Russia.

00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:20.162
And as for the fifth corrupt official,

00:17:20.412 --> 00:17:21.997
a Guatemalan committee member who

00:17:22.222 --> 00:17:24.232
was found guilty of fraud and money

00:17:24.242 --> 00:17:27.312
laundering in 2016 was also promised

00:17:27.322 --> 00:17:29.602
$1 million to give his vote to

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:31.162
Russia, according to the report.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.902
And to reiterate, these are five that

00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:38.382
have been caught, or at least accused.

00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:40.812
Who knows how many other FIFA

00:17:40.812 --> 00:17:42.732
officials were involved in all of this?

00:17:44.002 --> 00:17:46.442
And to put it another way, since the

00:17:46.442 --> 00:17:48.652
FIFA executive committee voted in

00:17:48.652 --> 00:17:52.562
2010, 16 of the 22 members have been

00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:55.212
investigated or accused of corruption.

00:17:56.682 --> 00:18:00.472
So if this organisation is indeed run

00:18:00.522 --> 00:18:02.782
like a “mafia family”, how was this

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:04.522
all allowed to go on for so long?

00:18:05.482 --> 00:18:08.462
Well, to answer this question, we need to

00:18:08.472 --> 00:18:11.152
look at the head of the family, the man we

00:18:11.152 --> 00:18:13.502
met at the very beginning of this episode.

00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:15.244
Sepp Blatter.

00:18:16.082 --> 00:18:19.192
And Blatter, who spent 17 years as

00:18:19.192 --> 00:18:21.532
the most senior man in FIFA, has

00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:23.582
long been accused of corruption.

00:18:24.622 --> 00:18:26.852
In fact, even Blatter’s election

00:18:26.882 --> 00:18:28.932
as FIFA president all the way back

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.212
in 1998, as well as his subsequent

00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:33.272
reelection campaigns, have been

00:18:33.272 --> 00:18:35.462
linked to corruption and vote rigging.

00:18:36.372 --> 00:18:37.792
The Vice-President of the

00:18:37.792 --> 00:18:39.382
Confederation of African Football

00:18:39.642 --> 00:18:42.702
claimed he had been offered $100,000

00:18:42.702 --> 00:18:44.782
to vote for Blatter in 1998.

00:18:45.642 --> 00:18:47.592
And when it came to his reelection

00:18:47.792 --> 00:18:51.202
in 2011, Blatter’s only opponent was

00:18:51.202 --> 00:18:54.102
Mohamed bin Hammam, the man who allegedly

00:18:54.252 --> 00:18:56.622
bought Qatar the 2022 World Cup.

00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:00.152
Bin Hammam eventually dropped out

00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:02.192
of the election and Blatter was

00:19:02.192 --> 00:19:05.242
elected unopposed, but he only led

00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:07.622
FIFA for another four years before

00:19:07.622 --> 00:19:09.672
he was forced to step down when he

00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:11.622
was put under criminal investigation.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.192
And throughout all the indictments and

00:19:15.292 --> 00:19:17.512
investigations, all the controversy

00:19:17.672 --> 00:19:20.612
over Russia and Qatar, Sepp Blatter has

00:19:20.612 --> 00:19:23.412
reiterated his famous line, as he did

00:19:23.452 --> 00:19:26.272
that day on stage in Switzerland, that

00:19:26.282 --> 00:19:28.752
money has ‘nothing to do with football.’

00:19:30.052 --> 00:19:31.912
All I’ll say is that I’ll leave

00:19:31.912 --> 00:19:34.002
you to be the judge of that.

00:19:36.972 --> 00:19:39.732
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode

00:19:39.772 --> 00:19:42.562
on FIFA, by some people’s standards

00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:44.362
the most corrupt name in sport.

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.102
For the football fans, I’m sure you

00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:49.142
knew quite a lot of this already, and

00:19:49.302 --> 00:19:51.402
if you’re not a football fan, well, I

00:19:51.402 --> 00:19:53.372
hope it was an interesting exploration

00:19:53.612 --> 00:19:55.722
into this organisation that governs

00:19:55.722 --> 00:19:57.172
the world’s most popular sport.

00:19:58.232 --> 00:20:00.142
As always, I would love to know

00:20:00.142 --> 00:20:01.582
what you thought about this episode.

00:20:01.862 --> 00:20:03.362
Do you think FIFA is as

00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:05.162
bad as people claim it is?

00:20:05.522 --> 00:20:07.472
Do you think that the changes to the

00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:09.852
voting system will fix this corruption,

00:20:10.032 --> 00:20:11.895
or simply open it up further?

00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:14.292
I would love to know, so let’s

00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:15.672
get this discussion started.

00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:17.022
You can head right into our

00:20:17.022 --> 00:20:18.842
community forum and get chatting

00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:20.382
away to other curious minds.

00:20:21.452 --> 00:20:23.172
You've been listening to English Learning

00:20:23.172 --> 00:20:25.822
for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:26.232 --> 00:20:28.842
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:20:28.842 --> 00:20:30.882
I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:16.882
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:21.462
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:25.782
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:30.032
about Whaling, the hunting and killing of whales.

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:35.712
It is one of the bloodiest businesses in history, and an example of how

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:41.552
mankind almost eradicated an entire species from the face of the earth.

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:46.592
It’s also a fascinating story, and in a strange way,

00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:50.912
it enabled a lot of the conveniences of modern society.

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:53.322
So I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:54.482 --> 00:01:00.082
Before we get right into that though, let me just quickly remind you that you can listen

00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:05.822
along with the subtitles, an interactive transcript complete with key vocabulary, for this

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:12.662
episode and all of our other 150 or so over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:18.732
The website is also home to our community, where members do meetups and conversation

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:23.832
practice, as well as tonnes of guides on improving your English in a more interesting way.

00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:29.942
So, if you haven't checked that out, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:33.372
OK then, whaling.

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:39.442
It has been called the greatest wildlife exploitation in human history,

00:01:39.772 --> 00:01:45.772
with an estimated 3 million whales killed in the twentieth century alone.

00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:51.222
Several whale species were hunted to the brink of extinction, they

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:56.962
were nearly wiped out completely, and almost no stretch of the ocean

00:01:57.122 --> 00:02:01.642
was spared from the whale hunters’ boats and their deadly harpoons.

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:07.112
While whale hunting peaked in relatively recent history,

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:11.932
the hunting and killing of whales by humans is not new.

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:20.882
Indeed, whaling goes back almost 5,000 years, and there is a long history of coastal communities

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:28.792
all over the world, from Norway to Japan, Korea to the Native North Americans, hunting whales.

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:31.762
This, of course, makes sense.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:38.702
Whales are pretty large animals, they are relatively easy to hunt, because they are quite

00:02:38.702 --> 00:02:44.232
friendly and you can get quite close to them in a boat and they have a very large surface

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:50.952
area, and if you manage to kill one whale, well then that is lunch for quite a long time.

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:55.102
Almost every part of the whale would be used.

00:02:55.462 --> 00:03:03.952
The fat, called ‘blubber’, the meat, the internal organs, it was all an excellent source of protein.

00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:12.652
The bones would often be used to make tools, and the baleen, the sort of nail-like material

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:20.232
in a whale’s mouth, was often used for making baskets or even for making roofs for your house.

00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:26.632
So, killing whales made a huge amount of sense, especially for communities

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:31.952
in places like the north east coast of America, near the Arctic Circle,

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:36.652
where farming animals just wasn’t feasible, you couldn't easily do it.

00:03:37.972 --> 00:03:42.702
Different communities in different countries would hunt the whales in different ways.

00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:48.522
Sometimes the whales would be chased onto the beaches by boats, the

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:53.732
boats would form a line and drive the whales towards the land, onto the

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:57.862
beach, where they would get stuck, and then be killed by the hunters.

00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:04.112
Another early way was by approaching a whale out at sea, sticking

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:08.772
a harpoon into it, which is a sort of knife with a hook on.

00:04:09.602 --> 00:04:14.362
The whale would, understandably, swim away fast when it was attacked,

00:04:14.782 --> 00:04:20.582
but attached to the harpoon would be a long rope, and on the end of

00:04:20.582 --> 00:04:25.622
that rope, would be something that would float and slow the whale down.

00:04:26.522 --> 00:04:29.952
Eventually the whale would tire, it would become

00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:32.992
exhausted, and the hunters would be able to kill it.

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:39.212
Neither of these outcomes were great if you were a whale, but the good news for

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:45.493
the whale population overall was that these activities weren’t done en masse,

00:04:45.642 --> 00:04:50.522
they were done by small coastal communities to provide food for themselves.

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:54.482
But, that wasn’t to continue forever.

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:59.282
During the Middle Ages and Renaissance period in Europe,

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:03.452
the demand for whale products started to increase.

00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:09.552
You could make oil from whale fat, which could be used for candles.

00:05:10.692 --> 00:05:17.772
As people needed to do more things that required light, such as reading, whales started to be

00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:25.652
hunted not just to support small communities by the sea, but also to be sold on for a profit.

00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:33.232
Then as Europeans sailed across The Atlantic to America, they took their love for

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:40.022
whale products with them, and America soon became the world capital for whaling.

00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:45.062
The method for actually capturing the whales hadn’t changed

00:05:45.092 --> 00:05:49.072
a huge amount though - it was still relatively basic.

00:05:49.862 --> 00:05:56.712
One of the main differences was that, instead of just setting off from the shore, there

00:05:56.712 --> 00:06:03.562
would be larger boats that would set off on voyages for months or even years at a time.

00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:08.595
And it was from these larger boats that the smaller

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:12.265
boats would be launched, off to search for their prey.

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:19.135
There’s an account from an early 19th century whale hunt that describes

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:25.115
21 men on one of these small boats, that was only 7.5 metres long.

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:32.535
Now, I should warn you that this will be a little bit graphic, a bit bloody, so skip

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:37.295
forward a couple of minutes if you don’t want to listen to an account of a whale hunt.

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:42.465
The small boat would get as close as possible to the whale.

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:49.515
When it was close enough, a hunter on the boat would throw a harpoon at the whale’s body.

00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:54.705
But this time, instead of the harpoon being attached to an

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:58.925
object that it would drag after it, it was attached to the boat.

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:05.705
When the whale was hit, it would swim away as fast as it could, dragging the boat with it.

00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:12.525
The boat would be pulled along at breakneck speeds, often with men being thrown

00:07:12.525 --> 00:07:18.475
aboard into the ice-cold water as the boat bumped up and down over the waves.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:26.195
Eventually, the whale would tire, the men would be able to approach it and they would cut

00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:34.635
open a main artery, and a huge fountain of blood would pour out, covering the men on the boat.

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:42.885
They would then tow the dead whale back to the main boat, drag it onboard, and proceed

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:50.575
to cut it up into small pieces, and boil them in pots to create the precious whale oil.

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:57.315
After having repeated this 40 or 50 times, with 40 or 50 different

00:07:57.315 --> 00:08:02.785
whales, the ship would return to shore, where they would sell the whale

00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:07.585
oil, and all the other remaining parts of the whale, for a large profit.

00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:14.305
Although some of you might be hearing this and thinking “how disgusting - I can’t believe

00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:21.345
people actually did this”, one can imagine how, to these men who spent their entire lives

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:27.975
hunting, killing, and then cutting whales into small pieces, that whales weren’t majestic

00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:34.635
creatures of the sea, they were considered just products to take from the ocean and process.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:41.055
Indeed, there is a report of a whale hunter describing a whale as

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:47.281
“a self-propelled tub of high-income lard”, lard is a type of fat.

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:55.495
So to these men, a whale was a big lump of swimming money, and it was their

00:08:55.495 --> 00:09:01.185
job to take it from the sea and turn it into products that could be sold.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:09.065
And whale hunting had become an incredibly profitable, big business - indeed

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:16.235
by the year 1850 it had become the fifth largest industry in the United States.

00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:23.005
The industrial revolution had meant that there was a huge increase in demand for

00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:29.735
lighting, and whale oil was one of the most effective products there was to produce light.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:36.005
It was also an excellent lubricant, and so was used for

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:41.025
industrial machinery, as well as for explosives, and even soap.

00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:44.655
It wasn’t just whale oil, though.

00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:51.385
Whale bones were used for corsets, the tightly fitting piece that women would

00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:56.235
wear under their clothes to compress their body and make them look thinner.

00:09:56.985 --> 00:10:02.995
And whale bones were also used for umbrellas and to make pieces for board games.

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:09.855
There’s even a substance called Ambergris that comes from the intestines of a type of

00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:16.065
whale called a sperm whale that is used to make perfume, and is incredibly expensive.

00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:22.575
This heightened demand for whale products led to more and more men

00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:28.415
heading out to sea, and to the untimely end of more and more whales.

00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:36.555
And although the sea might have looked never-ending, the whale population wasn’t infinite.

00:10:37.545 --> 00:10:41.705
As more and more whales were killed, they became harder and harder

00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:46.545
to find, and the hunters had to go further and further afield.

00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:52.775
Whaling boats went all the way up to the Arctic Ocean, and all

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:57.175
the way down to the Antarctic Ocean on the hunt for their prey.

00:10:58.185 --> 00:11:04.655
At the same time, technological advances were making life even more hazardous for the whales.

00:11:05.335 --> 00:11:12.855
The boats were faster, and the harpoons could now be fired from a gun, rather than just by hand.

00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:20.225
As you might imagine, this led to a huge increase in the number of whales killed.

00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:26.795
Scientists estimate that around 300,000 sperm whales

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:32.385
were killed during the 200 years between 1700 and 1900.

00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:39.665
Then it took just another 60 years for whalers to kill the next 300,000.

00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:46.025
The thing that a lot of people don’t realise is that, even though there were

00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:53.895
plenty of other whale-alternative products by the mid 1850s–so using kerosene

00:11:54.065 --> 00:12:00.235
instead of whale oil for lighting, for example–these new technological advances

00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:07.095
had made whale hunting so much easier, and it continued well into the 20th century.

00:12:08.305 --> 00:12:12.965
The whale populations were reducing dramatically, so much so

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:19.145
that in 1927 the League of Nations held a conference on whaling.

00:12:20.255 --> 00:12:26.575
Gradually quotas were introduced, limits on how many whales could be killed commercially,

00:12:27.115 --> 00:12:33.455
and from the 1960s the number of whales killed every year has been decreasing.

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:39.406
Still, whales are hunted by 9 different countries, albeit now

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:44.216
for ‘cultural’ or ‘scientific’ purposes, commercial whaling, the

00:12:44.426 --> 00:12:49.786
hunting of whales to sell for a profit, has been banned since 1986.

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:59.166
And while whales now might not have to be fearful of large, commercial ships coming to launch large

00:12:59.176 --> 00:13:06.256
harpoons into them and turn them into soap, life as a whale isn’t completely without its threats.

00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:12.774
They are often caught in fishing nets, and it’s estimated that, over the course of a

00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:19.874
lifetime, 80% of whales in the North Atlantic Ocean are caught in a fishing net at least once.

00:13:20.684 --> 00:13:28.014
Loud noises, from the sounds of ship engines, to the sounds produced by underwater drills

00:13:28.294 --> 00:13:34.244
are very disconcerting for whales, they confuse them, and they can damage their hearing.

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:41.834
And whales are killed in large numbers every year just by being hit by ships.

00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:49.234
Indeed, the WWF, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature reports that, for

00:13:49.254 --> 00:13:54.924
a particular type of whale called the northern right whale, 90% of the

00:13:54.924 --> 00:13:59.504
ones that are killed by humans are killed after being hit by ships.

00:14:00.534 --> 00:14:03.224
It’s not all bad news for whales though.

00:14:04.014 --> 00:14:09.294
Although it’s hard to measure the population of different types of whales,

00:14:09.694 --> 00:14:14.808
scientists do believe that the numbers are increasing, with the populations

00:14:14.848 --> 00:14:20.560
of some types of whale almost approaching the numbers pre-whaling.

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:28.568
And when it comes to how we view whaling now, it is easy to look back at it with a

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:35.735
combination of amazement and disgust, wondering how we could be so cruel to a creature

00:14:35.945 --> 00:14:41.695
that is now almost universally admired, and we know is actually pretty intelligent.

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:47.399
But, as often seems to be a theme with this show, we can’t evaluate

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:51.318
the past with the same criteria as we evaluate the present.

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:58.499
We are also great beneficiaries, albeit indirectly, of the whaling industry.

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:05.019
The reality is that whaling, and the products that came from the bodies of these millions of

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:12.138
whales, powered much of life in Europe and the United States in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:19.548
Without a cheap source of light, without a cheap way to power industrial machines,

00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:25.808
or a way to produce soap, how would the world we live in today be different?

00:15:26.938 --> 00:15:32.368
While that is an interesting question, perhaps an even more interesting question is,

00:15:32.768 --> 00:15:39.568
in 200 or 300 years, what will people consider to be today’s equivalent of the whale?

00:15:39.993 --> 00:15:44.258
What is something that we do now that is widely accepted, but might be

00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:49.258
considered cruel, destructive and highly unnecessary in 300 years time?

00:15:51.598 --> 00:15:56.728
And on that positive note, that is it for today’s episode on Whaling.

00:15:57.198 --> 00:16:01.678
I hope it’s been an interesting one, that you’ve learned something new, and that you

00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:07.108
now know, if you didn’t already, that we have quite a lot to be thankful to whales for.

00:16:08.148 --> 00:16:14.418
If you are looking for a more upbeat, a more positive episode about whales, then I’d definitely

00:16:14.418 --> 00:16:20.858
recommend listening to episode number 88, which is all about the amazing life that whales lead.

00:16:21.258 --> 00:16:24.408
And they certainly do lead an amazing life indeed.

00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:30.808

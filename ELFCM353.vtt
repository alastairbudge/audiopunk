Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.590
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.719
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.609
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.110
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.230
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.499
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.290
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is a

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:25.280
follow-up episode to the last one,

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.040
where we looked at the strange life

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.990
of Lee Harvey Oswald - his troubled

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.269
upbringing, his time in the Marines,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.650
and his defection to the Soviet Union.

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:36.996
And of course, we looked at the

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:39.276
event that he is synonymous with, the

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.036
assassination of President John F.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.616
Kennedy.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:45.506
So, in this episode we will look

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:47.306
at some of the most popular and

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:49.776
most outlandish of the conspiracy

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:52.096
theories about what really happened.

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:55.566
Was Oswald really a lone gunman?

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.716
Was he sent by the Soviets?

00:00:57.736 --> 00:00:59.526
Or perhaps the CIA?

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:01.706
Was the American mafia involved?

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:05.069
Ultimately, who killed JFK?

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.679
On a quick “admin note”, if you haven’t

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.799
listened to the last episode, the one

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.159
on Lee Harvey Oswald, I would recommend

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.579
you do that first, because we will be

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.632
referring to the events of November

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:20.949
the 22nd of 1963 in quite some detail.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.529
OK, let’s get right into it and

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.669
talk about JFK conspiracy theories.

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:33.587
In 2016, as Donald Trump was campaigning

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:35.127
for the Republican nomination,

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:37.467
he did a phone interview with his

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:40.197
favourite TV channel, Fox News.

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.699
One of Trump’s main rivals in the race

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.159
at that time was a man named Ted Cruz.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.039
During this phone interview Trump

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.829
attacked his rival and began making

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.859
some bizarre claims, to say the least.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.429
But he didn’t attack Cruz on policy or

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.909
campaign funding - he attacked his father.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.139
Here’s Trump, in his own words.

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.079
His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.809
prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot,

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.279
I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.879
What is this?

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:15.119
Right?

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.289
Prior to his being shot?

00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:18.084
And nobody even brings it up.

00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:19.464
I mean, they don't even talk about that.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:20.334
That was reported.

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.164
Uh, and nobody talks about

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.604
it, but I think it's horrible.

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:26.186
Now, I know that wasn’t particularly

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.806
easy to follow, but Trump there was

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:31.246
claiming that Ted Cruz’s father was

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.979
implicated in the murder of JFK.

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:36.969
As you will know, Donald Trump

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.479
has what we might call a selective

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.329
relationship with the truth, and indeed

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.859
Ted Cruz would come back to Trump’s

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.449
accusation saying “this man is a

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.739
pathological liar, he doesn’t know the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.259
difference between truth and lies”.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.149
You may also recall that Ted

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.019
Cruz would go on to become one of

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.399
Trump’s staunchest supporters but

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.639
that is a story for another day.

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.009
What we are asking today is what

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.062
was a potential presidential

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.992
nominee - indeed, the future

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:11.692
president - doing spreading conspiracy

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.122
theories about Lee Harvey Oswald?

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:17.062
He was, of course, trying to

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.342
discredit his political rival,

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:21.952
but perhaps it was more than that.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.460
Perhaps Trump was appealing to a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.580
specific section of the American

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.840
voters - those inclined to believe

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.220
in conspiracy theories and distrust

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.380
the official version of events.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.640
And here he was talking about the most

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.220
popular American conspiracy theory of all

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.970
time, the theory that there was something

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.230
fishy about the assassination of JFK.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.960
Now, in the aftermath of Kennedy’s

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.550
assassination, at the end of November of

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.530
1963, there was an official commission

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.390
set up to investigate what had happened

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.100
and how the former President was killed.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.370
It was called the Warren Commission,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.482
and was led by a man named Earl

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:09.382
Warren, a highly  respected

00:04:09.392 --> 00:04:11.192
US lawyer and politician.

00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:15.857
It concluded that both Oswald and Ruby

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:18.747
were lone gunmen - that is to say,

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:21.347
acting as two independent shooters.

00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:24.157
Oswald killed Kennedy and Ruby

00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:26.407
then killed Oswald without any

00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:29.137
outside help or bigger conspiracy.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.800
Yet as you heard in the previous

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.560
episode, this official verdict

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.660
was not accepted by everyone.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.270
Indeed, one survey now suggests that

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.700
a whopping 81% of Americans don’t

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.460
believe the official version of events.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.060
Even back then, in the immediate

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.320
aftermath of the assassination, there were

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.175
plenty of Americans who were sceptical

00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:59.370
of the official version of events.

00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:01.553
Polling based on data taken from

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:05.373
December of 1963 - so, just weeks

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:08.413
after Kennedy’s death - found that 52

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:11.593
percent of Americans believed more than

00:05:11.593 --> 00:05:14.393
one person was involved, and only 29

00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:17.353
percent believed Oswald acted alone.

00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:20.683
Fast forward  a decade or so to the

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:24.903
mid-1970 and the distrust had grown even

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:27.233
more following the Watergate scandal and

00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:29.603
release of the Pentagon Papers, which

00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:32.163
proved Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon B.

00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:34.503
Johnson, had lied to the American

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:36.043
people about the Vietnam war.

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:38.714
By the way, if you haven’t listened

00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:41.464
to episode number 238, which covers

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:43.034
the Watergate Scandal in detail,

00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:44.894
you can do that after this episode

00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:47.044
to fully understand the collapse of

00:05:47.044 --> 00:05:49.054
public trust in American institutions.

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:51.399
But back to JFK.

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:54.151
After new footage of the shooting was

00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:57.571
released in 1975, which gave a clearer

00:05:57.751 --> 00:05:59.821
but also much bloodier view of the

00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:02.651
event, the government created another

00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:05.221
committee, somewhat ominously called

00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:07.961
the Select Committee on Assassinations.

00:06:09.013 --> 00:06:11.578
This committee was tasked primarily

00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:13.968
with taking another look at JFK’s

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:16.568
assassination, but it also investigated

00:06:16.828 --> 00:06:18.928
another famous assassination,

00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:21.208
that of Martin Luther King Jr,

00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:23.828
who was assassinated in 1968,

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:25.808
just a few years after Kennedy.

00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:29.318
Although the Committee concluded that

00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:31.818
there was no evidence of a Soviet

00:06:31.986 --> 00:06:34.947
or CIA conspiracy, it did state that

00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:37.817
there was, I quote, “probably” a

00:06:37.817 --> 00:06:40.767
second gunman on the “grassy knoll”.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.617
A knoll, by the way, is a slightly

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.887
unusual term for a small hill, and it’s

00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:50.277
so linked to this historical event, in

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:53.147
fact, that if you google “grassy knoll”

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.537
most of the results will be about JFK.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:00.547
As you can probably imagine, this

00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:03.307
conclusion sent conspiracy theorists

00:07:03.477 --> 00:07:06.217
into overdrive and suggested to

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.147
the country that something fishy,

00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:10.777
something suspicious, had happened

00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:13.447
and that the people had not been

00:07:13.447 --> 00:07:16.067
given the full story in 1963.

00:07:17.152 --> 00:07:20.658
Since then, hundreds of JFK conspiracies

00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:23.538
have emerged and it remains, to this day,

00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:26.048
one of the most popular events where the

00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:28.508
public don’t believe the official version.

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:31.439
So, what are some of the most

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.609
interesting and perhaps even

00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:35.889
believable about Oswald and Kennedy?

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:38.679
There are some truly crazy theories

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:40.969
out there, but the vast majority of

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:43.719
JFK conspiracy theories have Oswald

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:45.799
as the shooter - if not the only

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.329
shooter - so in today’s episode

00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:50.529
we’ll be considering some of the more

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.529
plausible, believable and mainstream,

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.069
theories that involve Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:59.619
For our first theory, we’re going

00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:01.709
to look at the theory that Oswald

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.229
was a Soviet hitman sent by the

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:07.099
KGB to kill the American president.

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:10.833
It does seem to make sense to start

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.319
here because Oswald did, as we

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.059
learned in the previous episode,

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:18.099
defect to the Soviet Union in 1959.

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:21.359
You can certainly see why people

00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:22.679
might believe this theory.

00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:25.549
It’s persuasive, and like all

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:27.819
alluring conspiracy theories, it isn’t

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.879
beyond the realms of possibility.

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:33.349
That a trained marksman who defected to

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:35.749
and lived in the Soviet Union during the

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:39.319
Cold War could, in theory, be recruited

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.059
by the KGB to become an assassin.

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:46.599
Now, some believe Oswald was personally

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:48.989
given the task by the Soviet leader

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:51.489
Nikita Khrushchev, and that he didn’t

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:54.099
move back to the United States in 1962

00:08:54.349 --> 00:08:56.750
because he wanted to, but to begin

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.870
getting ready for his mission: the

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.040
assassination of President Kennedy.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.730
The best or most popular evidence for

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.240
this theory comes from Oswald’s trip

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.460
to Mexico City in September of 1963,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.720
shortly before the assassination.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.270
Many people argue that there’s evidence

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.790
that Oswald made contact with a Soviet

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.900
spy in Mexico City, someone known as

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.690
‘comrade Kostin’, who one book claims

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.260
was the head of “the KGB’s Thirteenth

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.390
Department for assassinations abroad.”

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.470
Where this theory gets really interesting,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.170
however, is that there are some writers

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.120
and journalists who claim that the

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.790
Soviets then changed their mind about

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.090
the assassination plot sometime between

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.980
June of 1962 and April of 1963, and

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.260
told Oswald the plan was off, they told

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.360
him that he shouldn't kill Kennedy.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.320
But Oswald, who was keen to

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.170
prove his loyalty to Kruschev

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.840
and the USSR, went ahead with the

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.250
plan and killed Kennedy anyway.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.080
As you probably remember from the previous

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.130
episode, this version of events certainly

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.250
lines up with the type of man Oswald was.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.457
He was an outsider, after all, a man

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:21.197
always searching for his place in society.

00:10:22.327 --> 00:10:24.297
Believing that the emotionally unstable

00:10:24.297 --> 00:10:26.567
Oswald went ahead with the plan anyway

00:10:26.797 --> 00:10:28.407
to prove that he really belonged in the

00:10:28.407 --> 00:10:31.868
USSR is hardly difficult, and you can

00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:34.488
see why some people might believe it.

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:38.933
This leads us to our second theory - that

00:10:38.963 --> 00:10:41.383
Kennedy’s assassination was an ‘inside

00:10:41.393 --> 00:10:44.680
job’, that is to say, a conspiracy not

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.408
by Soviets or other outside forces,

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:50.188
but by American political forces.

00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:52.653
And who are we talking about here?

00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:54.344
The CIA, of course.

00:10:55.314 --> 00:10:58.314
To put it simply, President Kennedy

00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:00.834
did not exactly have the best working

00:11:00.854 --> 00:11:02.834
relationship with CIA leaders.

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.894
Before Kennedy arrived in the White

00:11:05.894 --> 00:11:10.044
House in 1961, the CIA had behaved as

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.464
it liked without much oversight from the

00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:14.794
executive branch, from the president.

00:11:15.644 --> 00:11:17.174
This included all sorts of

00:11:17.464 --> 00:11:19.624
nefarious, criminal, behaviour

00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:21.494
all over the world, including

00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:23.784
working to overthrow governments,

00:11:23.864 --> 00:11:26.041
such as in Guatemala and Iran.

00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:29.651
Kennedy changed all of that, and

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:31.851
preferred to take a more public,

00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.381
diplomatic approach to foreign affairs.

00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:37.681
In fact, it's even been reported that

00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:40.551
Kennedy once said he wished "to splinter

00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:43.401
the CIA into a thousand pieces and

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.481
scatter it to the winds" after the

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:48.131
disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.

00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:51.181
Though there are some who believe that

00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:53.831
Oswald was working directly with the

00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:56.371
CIA, if we consider what we learned

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.891
about him in the previous episode, we

00:11:58.891 --> 00:12:01.631
know that’s probably unlikely - Oswald

00:12:01.671 --> 00:12:04.311
hated American capitalism and the US

00:12:04.311 --> 00:12:07.061
government, after all, and he was a loose

00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:09.288
cannon, he wasn’t particularly reliable.

00:12:10.318 --> 00:12:12.318
So where would the CIA

00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:13.828
fit into all of this?

00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:16.788
Well, first we must remember that

00:12:16.828 --> 00:12:18.838
all this happened at the height

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.938
of the Cold War - a time when the

00:12:20.968 --> 00:12:22.998
threat of nuclear destruction made

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.168
the Americans and Soviets incredibly

00:12:25.188 --> 00:12:27.878
paranoid and suspicious of one another.

00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:32.158
As we know, Oswald was interrogated

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.288
when he returned to the United States

00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:37.798
in 1962, but there are several question

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:40.548
marks over whether the CIA would simply

00:12:40.548 --> 00:12:43.148
have accepted that a former US Marine

00:12:43.318 --> 00:12:45.688
who defected to the Soviet Union had

00:12:45.688 --> 00:12:48.438
returned simply because he missed home?

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:52.232
Several writers believe that the CIA was

00:12:52.232 --> 00:12:55.162
keeping a close eye, meaning carefully

00:12:55.162 --> 00:12:57.892
watching Oswald's movements in the U.S.

00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:00.078
They knew that he was involved

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:02.398
in Cuban political activities and

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:04.428
also that he had been to Mexico.

00:13:05.288 --> 00:13:08.208
So if they knew Lee Harvey Oswald

00:13:08.368 --> 00:13:10.838
was meeting Soviet spies in Mexico

00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:13.578
City, presumably to plan Kennedy’s

00:13:13.578 --> 00:13:16.268
assassination, why wasn’t anything done?

00:13:17.274 --> 00:13:19.694
Perhaps, as some conspiracy

00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:22.834
theorists suggest, the CIA knew

00:13:23.004 --> 00:13:24.474
about the assassination plan

00:13:24.594 --> 00:13:26.124
but did nothing to stop it.

00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:29.204
Perhaps they didn’t warn Washington

00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:32.254
and preferred to have Kennedy out of

00:13:32.254 --> 00:13:34.884
the picture, dead, and return to the

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:37.560
previous non-interventional relationship

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.770
between the White House and the CIA.

00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:43.841
Therefore, the CIA theory is less that

00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:45.481
they were directly involved in the

00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.601
assassination, and more that they knew

00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:49.971
it was coming and did nothing because

00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:52.231
it suited their political objectives.

00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:56.541
Clearly, the CIA has been involved

00:13:56.631 --> 00:13:59.241
in toppling many foreign leaders, so

00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:01.331
is it completely beyond the realms of

00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:03.671
possibility that it would also topple

00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:06.351
its own leader if that person was

00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:07.811
considered to be an inconvenience?

00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:11.681
For our third theory, we need to

00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:15.161
focus on Jack Ruby, the man who killed

00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:16.811
Oswald in the underground car park

00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.611
of the Dallas police department.

00:14:20.061 --> 00:14:22.441
As you may remember, Jack Ruby

00:14:22.531 --> 00:14:24.711
was a nightclub owner from Chicago

00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:27.101
who had settled in Dallas and made

00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:28.531
connections in the underground

00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.361
gambling, drug and prostitution markets,

00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:33.791
connections to the mafia, to the mob.

00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:37.651
But Ruby isn’t the only person

00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:39.881
with mob connections in this story.

00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:43.211
The Kennedy family was more than familiar

00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:45.531
with America’s criminal underworld.

00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:48.401
In fact, many believe that Kennedy’s

00:14:48.411 --> 00:14:51.281
father made his name - and most of

00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:53.901
his money - selling bootlegged alcohol

00:14:54.091 --> 00:14:56.891
during the Prohibition Era, and even that

00:14:56.891 --> 00:14:59.931
the mafia fixed the 1960 presidential

00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:02.421
election to ensure Kennedy’s victory.

00:15:03.481 --> 00:15:05.381
And if you know anything about

00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:07.451
Italian-American organised criminals,

00:15:07.681 --> 00:15:10.171
you’ll know they don’t do anything out of

00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:12.337
the kindness of their hearts, for free.

00:15:12.931 --> 00:15:15.351
They wanted a favour from JFK.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:18.751
And what they got was the opposite.

00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:21.551
The mob had extensive business

00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:24.421
ties in Cuba, which were put on ice

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:26.631
after the island turned socialist.

00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:29.881
The mob hoped that Kennedy would overthrow

00:15:29.881 --> 00:15:32.491
Castro and they could open their hotels

00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:35.381
and casinos again, but what happened?

00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:38.671
Well, the Bay of Pigs invasion in

00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:41.821
1961 was a flop, it was a disaster.

00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.321
Kennedy was blamed for this.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.881
What’s more, Kennedy’s younger brother,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.050
Robert Kennedy, or Bobby Kennedy was

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.110
closely investigating organised crime

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.020
in his role as Attorney General.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.720
So, is it completely inconceivable

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.730
that the American mafia had a

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.760
hand in the assassination of JFK,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.240
as a sign of what happens when

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.920
you don’t pay back your debts?

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:10.394
In fact, it’s not just conspiracy

00:16:10.394 --> 00:16:12.794
theorists who believed this, JFK’s

00:16:12.804 --> 00:16:15.164
brother, Bobby Kennedy, according

00:16:15.164 --> 00:16:17.524
to one biographer, thought that

00:16:17.534 --> 00:16:19.684
the mob killed his older brother.

00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:24.904
So where do Oswald and Ruby fit into this?

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:28.879
Essentially Oswald was the ‘fall guy’,

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:31.489
meaning the scapegoat, or person to

00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:34.039
publicly take the blame, and in true

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:37.089
Mafia style, Ruby would be the one to

00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:39.339
kill him, to   silence him forever.

00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:42.581
Now, why would Ruby do that?

00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:46.121
Well, many believe that Ruby had more than

00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:49.051
mere connections to the mob, but that he

00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:51.561
had fallen deep into debt with Dallas’

00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:53.811
criminal underworld and that killing

00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:56.461
Oswald was how he was asked to pay it off.

00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:00.181
This might sound like the plot of an

00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:02.751
overly dramatic Hollywood movie, but

00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:05.399
when Ruby was interviewed as part of the

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.729
Warren Commission investigation, even

00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.879
though this commission had concluded

00:17:09.879 --> 00:17:12.669
that Ruby acted alone and shot Oswald

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:16.079
as revenge for him killing JFK, Ruby

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.189
told investigators that he was in danger

00:17:19.739 --> 00:17:21.489
and that he wouldn’t tell the truth

00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:24.000
until he was moved to a safe location.

00:17:25.387 --> 00:17:28.187
Ruby died a few years later, in January

00:17:28.357 --> 00:17:32.437
1967, meaning nobody would ever know the

00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:35.017
extent of his murky mafia connections.

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:39.107
Now, all of the conspiracies we’ve heard

00:17:39.107 --> 00:17:42.127
about so far put Oswald at the centre

00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:44.837
of a conspiracy - making him the gunman

00:17:44.977 --> 00:17:47.797
on behalf of someone, or something else.

00:17:48.957 --> 00:17:50.499
Many conspiracies, however,

00:17:50.757 --> 00:17:53.297
including these popular and perhaps

00:17:53.437 --> 00:17:55.997
more plausible ones, also suggest

00:17:56.157 --> 00:17:59.257
that Oswald wasn’t alone and that

00:17:59.257 --> 00:18:00.917
there was more than one gunman.

00:18:02.177 --> 00:18:04.627
This theory comes down to one

00:18:04.627 --> 00:18:07.437
thing: the infamous ‘grassy knoll.’

00:18:08.647 --> 00:18:11.167
As you heard in the previous episode,

00:18:11.387 --> 00:18:14.057
there was a small grassy knoll, a small

00:18:14.077 --> 00:18:16.588
grassy hill, beside the road  where

00:18:16.588 --> 00:18:18.108
Kennedy’s limousine was driving.

00:18:19.338 --> 00:18:21.968
In fact, in the aftermath of the shooting,

00:18:22.328 --> 00:18:25.455
most witnesses said they thought the shots

00:18:25.455 --> 00:18:28.648
had come from the grassy knoll and not the

00:18:28.648 --> 00:18:31.080
direction of the Texas Book Depository.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.440
In 1965, interviews with 121 witnesses

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.660
found that 51 believed the shots came

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.386
from the grassy knoll, 32 from the

00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:45.583
book depository, and 38 could not say.

00:18:46.699 --> 00:18:49.029
As you might remember, the grassy knoll

00:18:49.139 --> 00:18:51.149
was also the first place the police

00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:52.849
on the scene searched, before they

00:18:52.849 --> 00:18:54.909
went up to the depository building.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:58.509
But who would the second shooter be?

00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:01.889
This is where we get into the complicated

00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:04.789
theorising of conspiracies - if there’s

00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:06.809
evidence of shots fired from the grassy

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:08.869
knoll, then it could have been anyone.

00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:12.631
Was it a Soviet spy working with Oswald?

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:14.331
A mafia hitman?

00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:16.721
A rogue CIA agent?

00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:19.801
Almost all the Kennedy assassination

00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:22.471
conspiracies use the grassy knoll as

00:19:22.693 --> 00:19:24.953
evidence to support their theory, but

00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:28.363
most seem to think if there was a second

00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:30.293
shooter it would likely have been part of

00:19:30.293 --> 00:19:33.677
the CIA or organised crime conspiracies,

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:36.517
rather than any kind of Soviet assassin.

00:19:38.007 --> 00:19:40.877
Despite this, no evidence of any shooter

00:19:41.127 --> 00:19:43.487
on the grassy knoll has ever been found.

00:19:44.896 --> 00:19:47.436
Finally, our last theory is a

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:50.046
little stranger: it's that of

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:52.006
the so-called ‘umbrella man’.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.510
On the day Kennedy was killed,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.400
despite it being November, it was

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.980
an unusually warm and dry day.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.540
Certainly not the weather for an umbrella.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.550
Yet photos from the assassination

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.710
revealed a man holding an open umbrella

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.270
in the air as Kennedy was killed.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.340
So, what was he doing there, and

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.650
why was he holding an umbrella?

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.540
Some conspiracy theorists believe that

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.192
this umbrella wasn’t just an umbrella,

00:20:24.777 --> 00:20:27.200
that it was a James Bond-style weapon

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.700
which could fire tranquiliser darts.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.020
The theory goes that this ‘umbrella

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.176
man’ shot a dart from his umbrella to

00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:39.130
disable Kennedy, to stop him from moving,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.260
so that Oswald had an easier shot.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.293
As ridiculous or far-fetched as

00:20:46.293 --> 00:20:49.645
this might perhaps sound, in 1975

00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:52.900
a CIA weapons expert testified at

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.400
the Senate Intelligence Committee

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.350
that the CIA did have these types

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.263
of umbrella weapons back in 1963.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.868
Other people believe that this ‘umbrella

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.960
man’ was signalling to the shooter or

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.540
shooters, but it’s not entirely clear why.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.490
And as entertaining as a poison dart

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.350
shooting umbrella is, it’s one of the

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.406
more fanciful, or unlikely, JFK theories.

00:21:20.914 --> 00:21:25.470
In fact, in 1978 a man named Louie Steven

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.990
Witt claimed he was "umbrella man" and

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.710
that it was all a big misunderstanding.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.000
The reason he had an umbrella that

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.300
day was, he told the Committee

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.576
on Assassinations, because he was

00:21:39.593 --> 00:21:41.910
going to heckle Kennedy, meaning

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.970
to shout at him, taunt or jeer him.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.780
The umbrella, Witt said, was a way

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.400
of mocking JFK's father for his

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.070
support of the British Prime Minister

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.890
Neville Chamberlain, who had made the

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.170
mistake of appeasing Adolf Hitler.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.470
"Someone had mentioned that the

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.540
umbrella was a sore spot with the

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.420
Kennedy family," Witt explained.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.760
"I was just going along

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.352
to do a little heckling.

00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.685
There are countless conspiracies

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.760
about the killing of President John F.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.250
Kennedy, and today we’ve just heard

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.850
about a handful of the more popular ones.

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.270
This happened almost 60 years ago now,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.230
and anyone suspected of being involved

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.100
in some conspiracy is now long dead.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.560
It’s perhaps no surprise that this is the

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.610
mother of all conspiracy theories, the

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.370
most seductive of them all, filled with

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.070
strange clues and unusual happenings.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.800
Perhaps the reason it’s so seductive is

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.040
that it’s a lot more exciting than the

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.530
truth, or at least, the official version.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.480
The official version is that one

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.140
man acted alone, he was simply

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.220
a weirdo who failed to belong.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.930
The unofficial versions, the conspiracies,

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.780
involve everything from the CIA to the

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.820
Soviets, the mafia to poisoned darts.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.797
Perhaps it’s no surprise that we find

00:23:06.807 --> 00:23:08.937
these conspiracy theories so alluring.

00:23:09.777 --> 00:23:12.637
And with nobody to disprove them, to

00:23:12.827 --> 00:23:14.857
tell us otherwise, I think we’ll find

00:23:14.857 --> 00:23:17.020
them alluring for many years to come.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.217
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:23:21.227 --> 00:23:23.950
episode on Who Killed JFK?

00:23:24.397 --> 00:23:26.127
I hope it was an interesting one, and

00:23:26.257 --> 00:23:27.847
whether you knew a lot about Kennedy’s

00:23:27.847 --> 00:23:30.157
death, and Lee Harvey Oswald, and the

00:23:30.287 --> 00:23:32.407
seemingly endless conspiracies theories

00:23:32.447 --> 00:23:34.607
people come up with, or this was the first

00:23:34.617 --> 00:23:36.478
time you’d ever heard anything about it,

00:23:36.668 --> 00:23:38.277
well I hope you learned something new.

00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:40.657
As always, I would love to know

00:23:40.657 --> 00:23:42.067
what you thought about this episode.

00:23:42.427 --> 00:23:43.937
Which of the theories do

00:23:43.937 --> 00:23:44.957
you find most convincing?

00:23:45.797 --> 00:23:46.667
Do you believe the

00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:47.907
official version of events?

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.410
Are there any JFK theories you know

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.105
of that we haven't included and

00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:55.750
that you find particularly alluring?

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.760
I would love to know, so let’s

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.150
get this discussion started.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.550

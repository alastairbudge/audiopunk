Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:16.466
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:20.626
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:27.756
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the quest for eternal life.

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:35.226
Death has been called the one human experience that unites all of us, as every human that

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:40.856
has ever lived, apart from those of us who are lucky enough to be alive today, has died.

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:45.106
And for as long as humans have lived, people have

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:49.026
fantasised about living forever, and of cheating death.

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:51.686
Yet nobody has managed it.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:59.826
But will it always remain a fantasy, or are we on the cusp of finding the answer to eternal life?

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:05.072
In this episode we will talk about the history of the quest for immortality,

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:11.116
talk about what scientists are currently working on to solve the problems both of

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:16.806
prolonging life, and of preventing death, ask ourselves the question of what being

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:23.086
alive actually means, and try to understand some of the implications of solving death.

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:26.396
Let’s get right into it.

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:32.196
Stories of the search for immortality exist in almost

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.786
every culture, and go back to the dawn of time.

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:41.106
Indeed, one of the earliest pieces of literature, the Epic

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:45.386
of Gilgamesh, is all about a man’s quest for eternal life.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:49.076
These stories tend to have a similar theme.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:57.026
There is normally a character with all the earthly riches in the world, a powerful king or rich man.

00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:02.126
They have everything they could possibly want, but then an important

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:06.826
event, often the death of a loved one, leads them to contemplate

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:12.076
their own mortality, and the search for a cure for death begins.

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:17.016
Occasionally, a cure is found, an object, a flower,

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:20.796
a drink, a stone that can supposedly prevent death.

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:27.266
The protagonist takes it, but there is some terrible side effect, and the story ends

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:33.576
in tragedy, normally the death of the protagonist, or certainly a lot of unhappiness.

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:40.036
And literature from the past thousands of years of man’s existence suggests that

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:45.256
the quest for eternal life is futile, it’s pointless, that we should embrace

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:51.136
death just as we embrace life, and that dying is a fundamental part of living.

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:57.486
But in an age when we are pushing the boundaries of what was thought technologically

00:02:57.506 --> 00:03:04.186
possible, a new generation of powerful men and women have started to question this logic.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:09.676
Is death really inevitable, or is it just another problem to be solved?

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:16.666
In a New York Times interview with Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of Paypal and investor

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:23.416
in Facebook, he was asked about why everyone in Silicon Valley is so obsessed with immortality.

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:29.416
Thiel replied 'Why is everyone else so indifferent about their mortality?'

00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:34.466
To technologists like Thiel, the human body is a complex

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:38.826
system, like computer code, that can be analysed and understood.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:44.636
If you can understand how a system works, you can figure out how to control it.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.536
And if you can control it, then you can prevent death.

00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:54.281
Although we are certainly a long way away from a complete understanding of how

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:58.841
the body works, never before in human history have we understood it better.

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:06.121
And as a consequence, we have never before been further ahead on the quest for eternal life.

00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.961
Before discussing the ways in which technologists are working on eternal life,

00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.471
let’s take a look at some of the ways in which they are looking at extending

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:23.261
life, of giving us another 10, 20, 30, or even 50 years extra on this Earth.

00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:29.161
When it comes to extending life, to finding ways to allow people to live for

00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:34.671
longer, humanity has done a pretty good job at that over the past 100 years.

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:39.171
Currently, life expectancy in the developed world has been

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:43.971
increasing at an average rate of 2.5 years every decade.

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:49.231
Globally, current life expectancy is now 73.4 years.

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:54.511
Of course, there is still a large discrepancy between countries, with a woman in Hong

00:04:54.531 --> 00:05:01.151
Kong expected to live to 88, and a man in Lesotho lucky to see his 53rd birthday.

00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:05.291
But humans have never lived as long as we do now.

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:10.184
Indeed, 2020 was the first time in history that there were more

00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:14.761
people on Earth aged over sixty-five than under the age of five.

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:19.941
Now that, in the developed world at least, medical advances have

00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:24.226
allowed us to have the best possible chance of living into our 70s and

00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:29.101
80s, scientists are focussing on age-related illnesses and diseases.

00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:36.061
From cancer to heart disease, as we all know, there are billions of dollars spent every

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:41.791
year on finding a cure for the diseases that are responsible for ending our time on Earth.

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:46.531
But even finding a cure for cancer and heart disease

00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:49.731
might not extend our lives as much as you might think.

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:57.311
From the ages of 45 to 65, cancer is the biggest killer globally, but finding

00:05:57.311 --> 00:06:03.071
a cure for cancer would only add another 3.3 years to an average life.

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:08.021
From 65 and over, heart disease is the biggest killer, but

00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:12.221
finding a cure for heart disease would only add another four.

00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:19.591
So that’s an extra 7 years if we solve the two biggest killers of people aged 45 and over.

00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:26.441
Obviously, this would be a fantastic development and we should definitely still continue to try to

00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:34.391
find cures for these two diseases but when thought about in the context of really extending life

00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:41.987
finding cures for cancer and heart disease would be adding less than 10% to the average lifespan.

00:06:43.137 --> 00:06:46.837
Let’s say that we could do this, though, people would stop dying from cancer and

00:06:47.027 --> 00:06:51.687
heart disease, but would of course continue to die of other age-related diseases.

00:06:52.207 --> 00:06:58.387
Although scientists don’t yet know exactly what “causes” every death, as we age our bodies

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:03.527
are less and less able to deal with common illnesses, and one day they just “give up”.

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:10.137
Indeed, in English the term for this is “natural causes”, the idea being that there is

00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:15.377
something about human nature that means our lives just end and that's a natural thing.

00:07:16.097 --> 00:07:21.587
Because we don’t understand exactly what causes this yet, and often it is a combination

00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:26.217
of different things all happening at the same time, it is very hard to prevent it.

00:07:26.937 --> 00:07:33.137
So far, despite the billions and billions of dollars that have gone into scientific research, there

00:07:33.137 --> 00:07:39.017
are only a few things that we know for sure are likely to help us live longer, healthier lives.

00:07:39.447 --> 00:07:44.877
The good news is that I'm sure you already know them, and they are pretty easy and affordable to do.

00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:48.567
Don’t smoke, take regular exercise, and eat healthily.

00:07:48.937 --> 00:07:53.997
But even doing this, one day our bodies will decide that our time is up.

00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:59.917
A recent study published in a journal called Nature Communications suggested

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:06.397
that the maximum possible age for most people was somewhere between 120 and 150.

00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:13.052
Indeed, the oldest person who has ever lived was a French lady who lived to 122.

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:19.017
But what if this was only the upper limit under natural circumstances?

00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:24.567
What if we were able to understand exactly what caused us to die, so we could

00:08:24.907 --> 00:08:30.957
either modify our behaviour or even modify our bodies in advance, to prevent death?

00:08:31.617 --> 00:08:35.027
We are, to a certain extent, already doing this.

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:40.017
From heart transplants to shoulder replacements, modern medicine has

00:08:40.017 --> 00:08:44.837
advanced to the stage that we can change our bodies and extend our lives.

00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:51.237
The next step, according to so-called “immortalists”, is to stop death altogether.

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:54.977
This could come in various different forms.

00:08:55.307 --> 00:09:00.837
We could figure out what causes ageing, and either slow it down or reverse

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:06.107
it, so that we were forever young, remaining at the age we wanted to be, with

00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:10.657
our bodies continuing to function as normal, and the only thing we’d need to

00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:15.047
be worried about would be being hit by a fire engine or struck by lightning.

00:09:15.907 --> 00:09:21.147
Or we could transplant our mind somewhere else, moving our mind to another body.

00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:24.679
Much of philosophy and world religions already have the

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:29.917
idea of a soul, or a mind being separate from the body.

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:32.927
But this would go one stage further.

00:09:33.637 --> 00:09:40.117
Our brain is just a one and a half kilo lump made of around 60% water, and our

00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:46.057
memory and capacity for reasoned thought is merely a series of electrical signals.

00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:51.877
If we can understand how this code works, if we can understand how the mind works

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:57.437
technically, then it could be moved outside the body, to somewhere completely different.

00:09:58.387 --> 00:10:04.307
Indeed, the entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk, founded a company

00:10:04.307 --> 00:10:10.317
called Neuralink that is working on developing implantable brain-machine interfaces.

00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:14.627
Essentially, machines that link up directly to your brain.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:20.687
The idea is that immortality could be attained by transplanting your brain to

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:26.307
a computer, so that you could continue to think and reason, outside your body.

00:10:27.207 --> 00:10:32.407
Although there are, as we all know, several brain-related diseases that come with ageing,

00:10:33.227 --> 00:10:38.517
it typically isn’t a brain malfunction that causes death, it’s the rest of your body.

00:10:39.357 --> 00:10:45.617
This future is very far off, and it may even be impossible, but if the technology

00:10:45.657 --> 00:10:49.907
can be developed, we will be presented with a whole load of new questions.

00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:53.817
If your body is gone, are you really alive?

00:10:54.327 --> 00:11:01.617
If you are hooked up to a computer, and you have no real physical presence, is it really still you?

00:11:02.607 --> 00:11:06.297
You might think, “of course not”, but we would never say that to someone

00:11:06.297 --> 00:11:10.827
who had a heart bypass, or a knee replacement, we wouldn't say that

00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:15.457
they were not human anymore, we wouldn't say they were not them anymore.

00:11:16.087 --> 00:11:18.267
So, where do we draw the line?

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:21.977
What does it actually mean to be human, or to be alive?

00:11:22.527 --> 00:11:25.357
If there is a copy of your brain stored on a computer,

00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:29.657
that could act exactly as you would act, is that still you?

00:11:30.777 --> 00:11:35.537
And when it comes to the ethics of eternal life, there is a

00:11:35.557 --> 00:11:39.677
very valid point that it might lead to two classes of humans.

00:11:40.287 --> 00:11:43.407
Those who can live forever, and those who can’t.

00:11:44.257 --> 00:11:48.947
Given how expensive it would likely be, it would only be the absolute richest in

00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:53.967
society, the billionaires, who could afford it, while the rest of us contented

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:58.117
ourselves with the fate that has met every other human being on the planet.

00:11:58.907 --> 00:12:04.577
The former President of Facebook, Sean Parker, said in 2017, “Basically I’m

00:12:04.577 --> 00:12:08.417
a billionaire, I’m going to have access to better healthcare so… I’m going to

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:14.217
be, like, 160 and I’m going to be part of this class of immortal overlords.”

00:12:14.877 --> 00:12:21.707
So, his theory is that society will split into two tiers, two levels - those

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:26.757
who can live forever, or at least those who are able to extend their lifespan

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:31.607
significantly past what is currently thought to be possible, and the rest of us.

00:12:32.487 --> 00:12:38.937
This also begs the question, is this actually as attractive as it might sound at first glance?

00:12:39.377 --> 00:12:42.087
Or does it sound terrible, even when you first hear it?

00:12:42.527 --> 00:12:46.927
If you could live until you were 160, 200, or more, but

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:50.377
only other billionaires were able to do it, would you?

00:12:51.367 --> 00:12:57.537
Presumably many of your friends, family, and colleagues would not be able to afford this,

00:12:57.567 --> 00:13:03.517
and, ironically perhaps, your life would be filled with much more death and sadness than the

00:13:03.517 --> 00:13:09.799
rest of us, because you simply live a lot longer and you see your friends and family dying.

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:13.389
We are still a long way away from from this future, but

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:16.459
it is thought to be more achievable than ever before.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:22.059
But before this future arrives, immortalists are doing everything they can to

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:26.959
extend their lives, so that they are still alive when a cure is discovered.

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:32.469
The idea goes that if someone who is 50 can buy themselves an extra

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:36.859
10 years every 10 years, they will survive for long enough for the

00:13:36.869 --> 00:13:41.399
technology to be developed, and the keys to eternal life will be theirs.

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:48.489
There are all manner of weird and unusual things that people are doing at the moment, from taking

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:54.099
vast quantities of supplements every day, to fasting, that’s not eating for an extended period,

00:13:54.469 --> 00:14:00.069
to drinking what’s called Bulletproof coffee, which is coffee with a load of butter mixed into it.

00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:06.259
The reality is that, other than things like not smoking, eating well and doing

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:10.759
exercise, we simply don’t know for certain what causes us to live for longer.

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:15.379
And life is full of anomalies, exceptions to the rule.

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:19.579
There are, unfortunately, plenty of tragic stories of people who

00:14:19.579 --> 00:14:23.999
were incredibly healthy, didn’t drink or smoke, but died of a heart

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:26.039
attack in their 40s.

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:26.549
And

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:31.239
there is the case of the man who was the oldest surviving British veteran of

00:14:31.239 --> 00:14:36.989
the First World War, who lived to 113 years old, and attributed his longevity

00:14:36.989 --> 00:14:42.069
to "Cigarettes, whisky and wild, wild women - and a good sense of humour.”

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:48.509
He was, I’m sure, half-joking, but life, or rather, death, isn’t always

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:52.419
fair when it comes to when our bodies decide that our time is up.

00:14:53.009 --> 00:14:58.299
If we do believe, though, that our bodies are simply an incredibly complex code that we can

00:14:58.299 --> 00:15:04.539
crack, then it isn’t beyond the realms of possibility that we could crack death, we could solve

00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:09.859
the problem, and change the destiny that has faced every person to have ever walked on the Earth.

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:17.209
And if the cost was reduced to the extent that everyone could escape death, what would that mean?

00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:23.889
The Earth’s population is already projected to top 10 billion people by the end of this

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:30.369
century, and that calculation takes into account the 150,000 people who die every single day.

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.238
What if they didn’t?

00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:37.518
Obviously, this would be hugely problematic from the point of view of resources,

00:15:37.628 --> 00:15:42.008
assuming that we still need to eat, sleep, and live a semi-normal life.

00:15:43.138 --> 00:15:48.948
To state the obvious, a cure for death would be the most significant discovery

00:15:49.098 --> 00:15:54.038
in human history, and cause a seismic shift in how we all live our lives.

00:15:54.998 --> 00:15:58.608
Whether this would be the most amazing development, or whether it

00:15:58.608 --> 00:16:02.058
would turn life into a living hell, is certainly up for debate.

00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:09.148
Luckily, or unluckily perhaps, we are still a long way away from any of this becoming a reality.

00:16:10.258 --> 00:16:15.428
We humans might not live as long as the Greenland Shark, the fish that lives in

00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:20.068
the North Atlantic and can live to over five hundred years and doesn’t get cancer.

00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:23.928
But, we have a much better chance than anyone before

00:16:23.948 --> 00:16:27.088
in human history to live a longer, healthier life.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:31.278
And even though it might not be forever, it’s certainly

00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:34.288
something that I think we can all feel pretty happy about.

00:16:36.408 --> 00:16:41.438
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the quest for eternal life.

00:16:41.798 --> 00:16:45.028
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:16:45.768 --> 00:16:49.148
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:52.408
If you had the chance to live forever, would you take it?

00:16:53.008 --> 00:16:53.548
And why?

00:16:54.258 --> 00:16:58.453
And how do you think the world would be different if we could all live forever?

00:16:59.343 --> 00:17:03.923

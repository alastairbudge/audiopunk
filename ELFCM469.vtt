Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:16.035
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:20.165
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:27.265
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of this mini-series on my experience living in Malta.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:32.015
If you haven’t listened to part one yet, I’d recommend you do that before this,

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:36.945
as I shared a bit about Malta more generally, the types of people who study

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:42.255
English there, and a little bit about how the country has changed in recent years.

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:49.945
In this follow-up episode, part two, we are going to go deeper, and talk about corruption, fraud,

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:56.115
identity, and the sort of things that you wouldn’t find on the Maltese Tourist Authority website.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.945
So, let’s get right into it, shall we?

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:07.575
There is a phrase that people like to use about Malta, and that’s “sunny island, shady place”.

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:11.125
Sunny, in the literal sense of the word.

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:17.125
The sun shines a lot, 300 days a year if the Maltese tourist board is to be believed.

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:25.885
And shady in a metaphorical sense, meaning dodgy, untrustworthy, often illegal.

00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:34.755
When I moved to Malta in January of 2017, I soon started following

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:38.485
the work of a brave journalist called Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:42.655
She published articles all the time, often multiple

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:45.895
times a day, on her blog called Running Commentary.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:53.245
Reading the blog, you got a sense that you were inside this lady’s mind, almost

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:57.515
that she would learn about something and then immediately rush to her computer,

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:03.565
start typing and press publish without a fear in the world for the consequences.

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:08.275
And what she was writing was scandalous.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:13.465
You might think that on a small island with fewer than half a million

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:18.785
people there wouldn’t be an awful lot of news, but Daphne could hardly

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:23.605
keep up with the tales of sordid corruption that emerged on a daily basis.

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:28.765
Bribery, fake jobs, offshore bank accounts, money laundering,

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:33.635
involving people at the very highest levels of politics and government.

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:41.885
On October 16th, of 2017, she published an article on her blog about government corruption.

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:46.955
It ended “There are crooks everywhere you look now.

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:49.655
The situation is desperate.”

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:56.115
She pressed publish, grabbed her car keys, and got into her rental car.

00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:03.785
Before she knew it, a bomb under her seat exploded, killing her instantly

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:08.725
and emitting a large boom that could be heard from several kilometres away.

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:17.385
An official enquiry would conclude that the Maltese government bore responsibility for her death.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:23.925
The country’s best known journalist was assassinated, and the fingerprints

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:27.885
for the crime went right up to the sitting Prime Minister’s office.

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:35.595
This was how much of the world was introduced to Malta, a country that hadn’t been the subject

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:42.525
of any major news story for decades was suddenly on the front page for this gruesome execution.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:48.005
Now, the story of this murder, and of the brave work of

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.615
Daphne Caruana Galizia, is not the subject of this episode.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:58.855
We have an entire three-part mini-series on that, episodes 306, 307 and 308,

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:03.505
so I’d recommend listening to that if you haven’t had the chance to do so yet.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:12.465
The point is that this incident shone a light on quite how corrupt Malta is, and how beneath

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:18.465
the surface there is more to this tiny Mediterranean country than a tourist would ever notice.

00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:25.215
Now, as with any small country, Malta has always suffered from clientelism,

00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:30.885
where politicians trade favours with the business community, backs are

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:36.085
scratched, and contracts are handed out based on favours and bribes.

00:04:37.255 --> 00:04:43.355
But, combined with the economic boom in recent years, this has reached new heights.

00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:50.155
The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia might have been the most visible story of Maltese corruption,

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:56.415
but there are almost daily stories of political corruption that are never shared outside Malta.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:02.465
Stories that didn’t make the international press include how the Prime Minister

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:07.565
was given a valuable plot of land at below market prices by an alleged cocaine

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:13.235
trafficker, how this same criminal was awarded a contract to supply transport to the

00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:18.145
Maltese judiciary while awaiting charges of kidnapping, how one member of parliament

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:22.985
would give his constituents fake medical certificates so that they could claim they

00:05:22.985 --> 00:05:29.045
had epilepsy and claim unemployment benefit or how the Minister of Transport would

00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:34.135
personally ensure that his friends’ and associates’ children passed their driving exams.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:41.825
This kind of corruption is just everywhere, and while many people might think, “well, it probably

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:48.105
won’t affect me personally”, if you live in Malta, it will, either directly or indirectly.

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:52.195
Let me give you a few examples from my own time there.

00:05:53.325 --> 00:05:58.595
The first might seem harmless, and in my case, actually had a positive outcome.

00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:03.555
I was attempting to pay a tax bill online, and the

00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:06.225
payment system crashed halfway through the process.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:11.835
Annoying, but especially annoying because the payment was taken from

00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:16.895
my card, for several thousand Euros, but the Maltese tax website

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:21.425
said that it had no record of the payment, and that it was still due.

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:25.775
After dozens of emails, and phone calls, over several months and

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:31.035
multiple trips to try to fix it, nobody had any idea what was going on.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:35.985
I had paid the bill, the money had been taken, but it

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:39.965
was somehow “lost”, and the tax bill was still due.

00:06:40.925 --> 00:06:46.415
Without any idea what to do, I called someone who had helped me with accountancy advice.

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:53.065
Fortunately he had a friend in the tax department who was able to manually adjust

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:58.185
my tax balance, which this person did without question, without asking to see

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:03.615
any documents or proof, he just manually created a payment for me in the system.

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.299
The next example will be one that didn’t make me chuckle quite so much.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.739
Building regulations in Malta are very lax, almost non-existent.

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:20.679
There are constant injuries on construction sites, and even if you know

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:25.109
nothing about building, simply looking at almost any construction site

00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:29.719
in Malta will reveal that the construction industry is poorly regulated.

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:35.529
Anyway, one morning I was walking back from dropping off my son at nursery.

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:40.909
It was a glorious day, the sun was shining, blue skies, life was good.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.399
Then, about a metre in front of me, a huge block of concrete

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:50.719
crashed down from a block of apartments that was being built above.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:55.769
It must have been about half a metre wide, and had I been half a

00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:59.409
second faster crossing the road, you wouldn’t be listening to this now.

00:08:00.836 --> 00:08:03.756
I shouted up to someone, then called the number of

00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:06.246
the property manager, which was on the block of flats.

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:10.256
I told him what had happened, and that I was going to report this.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:17.626
He grew aggressive, and then asked me if I knew who the property developer was, and that

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:23.616
he now had my phone number and if I reported it, life would be very difficult for me.

00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:30.456
I asked a friend about it, and it turned out that the developer was the head of the

00:08:30.456 --> 00:08:35.866
Maltese Property Developers Association, and a close ally of the Maltese labour party.

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:39.736
I was furious, and reported it anyway.

00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:46.026
After calling the agency that was theoretically responsible for safety on building

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:51.536
sites, I was told to submit a report via email, which I did immediately afterwards.

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:58.586
This was on May 26th, of 2022, and I just double checked the exact

00:08:58.596 --> 00:09:04.496
date that they responded, the 6th of June, 2023, over a year later.

00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:10.496
And if you are wondering, their response said that they had just been to visit the site and

00:09:10.786 --> 00:09:15.346
instructed the people working there to make sure that debris didn’t fall on pedestrians below.

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:19.356
And these are just a couple of examples.

00:09:19.886 --> 00:09:24.316
There is a level of lawlessness about Malta that is kind of endearing when you are

00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:28.716
talking about someone in the tax department manually adjusting your balance because

00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:34.936
his friend asked him to or people driving badly but not so funny when you realise

00:09:34.946 --> 00:09:38.816
you were only seconds away from being squashed by a large construction block.

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:44.696
Now, you might be listening to this and thinking “my country isn’t so different”,

00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:49.256
or perhaps you are listening to this and thinking “how is this tolerated?”

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:53.316
For a while I was in that second camp.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:10:00.646
Almost on a daily basis there were stories of politicians from the ruling party abusing their power,

00:10:00.646 --> 00:10:06.526
and enriching themselves, building huge mansions with swimming pools, being found with millions in

00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:12.066
offshore bank accounts, and I used to think “surely the people won’t stand for this much longer”.

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:20.426
But, this party won two elections during the time that I was there, one in 2017

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:26.666
and another in 2022, and it is still the most popular party in opinion polls.

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:32.756
Corruption is always cited as a major concern by Maltese people in surveys,

00:10:33.176 --> 00:10:37.856
but when it comes to putting an X in the ballot box, the same politicians

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:41.996
who have abused their power for over a decade now are voted back in.

00:10:43.316 --> 00:10:47.826
When talking to Maltese friends about this, one thing that has always

00:10:47.976 --> 00:10:52.786
been repeated to me is quite how politicised everything is Malta.

00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:58.016
There are, essentially, only two political parties: the Labour

00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:03.376
party, which has been in power since 2013, and the Nationalist party.

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:10.046
Labour is theoretically more left wing, and the Nationalists more right wing,

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:15.256
but the modern incarnation of the Maltese Labour Party has embraced free market

00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:19.856
economics in a way that might be uncomfortable even for a right wing party.

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:27.916
And towns, villages, and even families, and typically either Labour or Nationalist.

00:11:28.636 --> 00:11:32.636
Now, I appreciate that this is the case in most countries, you have areas

00:11:32.906 --> 00:11:37.436
that are normally more left or right wing, and where political parties tend

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:43.736
to be weaker or stronger, but in Malta it is at a completely different level.

00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:49.856
It is almost like a city with two rival football clubs, Inter vs.

00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:52.366
AC Milan, or Atletico vs.

00:11:52.366 --> 00:11:52.826
Real Madrid.

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:58.206
People are born into families that are either a Labour or a Nationalist

00:11:58.216 --> 00:12:03.126
family, they are intensely passionate, and very unlikely to switch sides.

00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:07.746
They will defend their “team” to the death, no matter what anyone says about them.

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:16.396
After the elections, both in 2017 and 2022, there were huge celebrations where

00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:21.186
buses and tractors drove through all the villages with people dancing and

00:12:21.186 --> 00:12:25.146
drinking on top of them, they had pictures of the politicians on the front, and

00:12:25.436 --> 00:12:30.296
such loud music blaring out that the entire country was practically shaking.

00:12:31.486 --> 00:12:35.696
I said to some Maltese friends, “the politicians these people are celebrating

00:12:36.166 --> 00:12:40.156
are practically convicted fraudsters, there is so much evidence of them

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:44.706
having stolen from the public purse, from the Maltese people…from you.

00:12:45.146 --> 00:12:51.366
But they have put their face on the front of a bus, elevating them to an almost god-like status”.

00:12:52.736 --> 00:12:57.556
What I clearly hadn’t understood was quite the extent of the clientelism that

00:12:57.566 --> 00:13:02.256
still exists in the country, that these politicians would hand out jobs and

00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:06.426
favours to people who had supported them, everyone’s lives were getting better.

00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:11.266
What did it matter if they skimmed off a bit from the state coffers for themselves?

00:13:11.936 --> 00:13:16.836
After all, taking from the public purse is a victimless crime, is it not?

00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:24.346
Now, I am not suggesting that the other party, the Nationalist party, would be any less corrupt

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:30.596
than the Labour party, but the levels of blatant abuse of public funds is mind boggling.

00:13:31.756 --> 00:13:36.636
For example, in the leadup to the election, the Prime Minister announced that

00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:42.766
he would be giving a €100 or €200 “bonus cheque” to all adults on the island.

00:13:44.066 --> 00:13:48.286
This wasn’t out of his own election campaign money, mind you, it was from

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:53.066
public funds, he was handing out public money on the eve of an election.

00:13:54.366 --> 00:14:00.496
And whenever there was some sort of large political scandal, all employees would receive some

00:14:00.496 --> 00:14:07.526
kind of government bonus, 50 Euros here or 100 Euros there, and the scandal would die down.

00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:15.756
Now, Malta has got into a bit of trouble with the EU for this, which leads me on to my next point.

00:14:16.886 --> 00:14:22.146
Malta joined the European Union in 2004, along with Cyprus, the Czech

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:27.306
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:34.936
Although the Maltese people were divided on whether to join the union, it has been the most

00:14:34.966 --> 00:14:41.586
amazing thing for the country, and has resulted in huge amounts of money flowing into Malta.

00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:48.606
To be precise, in the last 10 years Malta has received €1.6 billion

00:14:48.886 --> 00:14:55.336
net from the EU, meaning it received €1.6 billion more than it paid in.

00:14:56.806 --> 00:15:02.076
Of course, the entire idea of the EU is that richer, typically

00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:06.496
northern European, countries pay more to subsidise the growth of less

00:15:06.496 --> 00:15:11.386
developed countries, such as Malta, and the entire union is lifted up.

00:15:12.806 --> 00:15:19.463
But the level of waste of EU funds and straight up fraud in Malta is enormous.

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:25.941
This isn’t simply an opinion; Malta has the highest number of fraud cases per

00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:31.381
capita, the investigations of fraudulent use of EU funds, in the entire EU.

00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:35.921
And you can see this firsthand living in Malta.

00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:43.121
Any project that receives EU funding would have a little sign outside with the percentage

00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:48.801
that came from EU funds and the percentage that came from national or private funds.

00:15:50.221 --> 00:15:56.591
With many of them, like an ancient monument or a new bridge, you might see them and think, good,

00:15:56.711 --> 00:16:02.651
this is exactly the sort of cultural or infrastructural project that EU funds should be going to.

00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:07.481
But in many cases, the value was less clear.

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:13.501
These funds would more often than not go to private business projects owned by

00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:18.271
politicians or their family members, such as building hotels or guesthouses.

00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:23.651
And even with the infrastructure projects, like new

00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:26.751
road building, there was plenty of misuse there as well.

00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:30.291
The country has only a few politically-connected

00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.941
companies that win all of the contracts to build roads.

00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:37.411
Fine, you might think, it’s a small place, and it needs roads.

00:16:38.251 --> 00:16:42.671
But what typically happens is that the roads are built or resurfaced

00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:47.321
so poorly that the work needs to be redone every six months or so.

00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:54.991
I used to live near a major road, and I think it was resurfaced more than 10 times in 7 years.

00:16:55.841 --> 00:17:01.411
I should say that the EU is starting to cotton on to this, starting to realise what is happening.

00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:06.641
And the fact that Malta has developed economically means that it will not be able

00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:12.521
to claim as much EU money as it has historically, but the quantity of EU money that

00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:17.061
has gone into the pockets of Maltese politicians and their families is staggering.

00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:23.381
Now, moving completely away from corruption, one thing that 7 years in

00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:27.501
Malta does to you is gets you thinking about the concept of nationality.

00:17:28.751 --> 00:17:31.301
As you might know, Malta sells passports.

00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:36.821
In 2013, Malta launched its “citizenship by investment” programme.

00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:42.451
It might sound glamorous, but it essentially allowed people from outside the

00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:47.921
EU to get a Maltese passport in exchange for a fee of almost a million Euros.

00:17:48.911 --> 00:17:52.501
The programme has changed slightly now, the requirements have become

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:57.211
stricter as the EU has started to pay closer attention, but in its

00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:01.551
original format it barely required an applicant to set foot on the island.

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:07.191
A wire transfer was good enough, and a few weeks later, ta-da,

00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:10.661
a brand-spanking new Maltese passport would be ready for them.

00:18:11.771 --> 00:18:17.411
Now, this passport scheme didn’t really account for very many people in the grand scheme of things,

00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:24.961
only 1,500 people at the last count, but this brought in a billion and a half Euros to the country.

00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:29.501
This might be a drop in the ocean for a large country,

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.441
but for a tiny country like Malta, it is significant.

00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:38.231
It’s €3,000 for every man, woman and child in Malta.

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:45.531
Now, that’s on one end of the spectrum of people who have become “Maltese”, the people who

00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:51.381
have paid vast amounts of money to obtain Maltese citizenship, but in most cases have no

00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:56.591
genuine desire to live here; they just want the passport and the protections it affords.

00:18:57.661 --> 00:19:01.091
On the other end of the spectrum, there are the tens of

00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:04.441
thousands of foreign workers who now call Malta home.

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:11.351
As you’ve heard already, Malta has become increasingly reliant on foreign labour, people

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:17.051
from outside the EU, typically from places like India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

00:19:18.101 --> 00:19:23.491
These people come to the country to work in Maltese restaurants, on Maltese building

00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:29.681
sites, and in Maltese hotels, working long hours doing hard and low-paid jobs.

00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:35.891
Many will end up calling Malta their permanent home, and raising families here.

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:42.171
They won’t get a passport, not unless they stay for an absolute minimum of 7 years

00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:48.231
and jump through many hoops, but they will pay taxes and contribute to society.

00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:53.381
This raises some interesting questions about the concept

00:19:53.381 --> 00:19:57.341
of nationality, and what it means to be “Maltese”.

00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:03.541
The Russian oligarch who has spent 12 hours in the country has a Maltese

00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:09.161
passport, but the Filipino hospital porter who has been here for 5 years does not.

00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:16.881
And this question of Maltese identity and nationality is becoming increasingly important.

00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:24.521
According to a forecast by the Economy Minister, if the trend of the past 10 years continues,

00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:32.241
the population of Malta will increase to 800,000 by 2040, which would be a 55% increase

00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:38.981
from today, and mean that people born outside Malta would outnumber people born in Malta.

00:20:39.916 --> 00:20:43.566
In other words, there would be more foreigners than Maltese people.

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:51.656
Now, to wrap things up, no city or country is perfect, and Malta has changed

00:20:51.676 --> 00:20:56.896
dramatically over the past 10 years, it has gone from a sleepy Mediterranean

00:20:56.916 --> 00:21:02.456
tourist destination to one awash with cash, often from dubious sources,

00:21:02.766 --> 00:21:07.856
and its population has almost doubled since the turn of the 21st century.

00:21:08.656 --> 00:21:14.606
There is a lot to cope with, and the Maltese government can rightfully be proud to have attracted

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:20.106
significant investment to the country, investing in public services and meaning that, for most

00:21:20.106 --> 00:21:25.936
people, their quality of life is better than that enjoyed by their parents or their grandparents.

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:31.896
Who knows what the next 50 years will bring, but one thing is for sure.

00:21:32.456 --> 00:21:38.316
It will be interesting to see what lies ahead for this lawless but magical little rock.

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:45.106
OK then, that is it for this winding exploration of Malta.

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:48.286
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt a few

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:51.396
new things that you wouldn’t hear from the Maltese tourist board.

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:54.826

Have you been to Malta before?

00:21:57.186 --> 00:21:59.406
Did you recognise any of the things I talked about?

00:21:59.876 --> 00:22:02.696
What do people in your country associate with Malta?

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.550
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.770
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.500
I'm Alastair Budge and today is Part Two of our three-part series on The Space Race.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.930
In Part One we learned about the early years, the background behind the space race, how the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Soviets sent the first satellite into space, the first animal into space, and the first person

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.620
into space, and how the Americans were playing catchup for the first 10 years of the Space Race.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.140
In today’s episode we are going to talk about the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.830
period from 1962 onwards, and the race to the moon.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.030
I think we all know who won that race, but the story is fascinating nonetheless.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.580
Then, in Part Three, the final part, we will be talking

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.280
about the next space race, the quest for Mars and beyond.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.350
If you haven’t listened to Part One of this mini-series then I would definitely recommend listening

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.420
to that first, as we will be referring to quite a few of the events from the early space race.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.940
You can listen to this episode without having listened to Part One,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.050
but unless you have quite a detailed knowledge of the space race, it’ll

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.990
probably make life easier if you’ve listened to Part One beforehand.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.880
Ok then, let’s get cracking, and head to the moon.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.430
To remind you briefly, in September of 1962 John F Kennedy had boldly

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.840
proclaimed that the USA would send a man to the moon by the end of the decade.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.870
Here’s a short clip of JFK explaining exactly what he promises to do.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.910
But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.930
from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.960
this football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.520
capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.290
fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.620
needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival, on an untried

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.800
mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, re-entering

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.620
the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that of

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.560
the temperature of the sun--almost as hot as it is here today--and do all this,and do all

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.409
this and and do it right, and do it first before this decade is out--then we must be bold.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.740
So, in front of the nation, and in front of the world, the president of the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.320
United States of America had said that they would put a man on the moon.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.200
The USA had to manage this.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.490
It had to do it.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.050
They had come second to the Soviets with every major other milestone.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.730
While the Soviets and the Americans were focussing on the big, hairy

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.880
goal of putting a man on the moon, they continued to make progress with

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.020
slightly less ambitious space milestones, and the Soviets kept on winning.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.410
The year after JFK’s declaration, the Americans lost out on another milestone to the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.420
Soviets, when they sent the first woman into space, a woman named Valentina Tereshkova.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.890
Now, it has been said that Tereshkova was sent into space mainly as a propaganda stunt by the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.150
Soviets, so that they could claim another victory, that of also sending the first woman into space.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.130
Tereshkova was an ex-factory worker, and amateur skydiver.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.200
After Yuri Gagarin went to space, in 1961, there were rumours that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.230
the Americans were training female pilots to become astronauts.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.840
The Soviets couldn’t allow the Americans to do that, and so quickly launched a female

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.340
astronaut programme, and Tereshkova was chosen because of her experience skydiving.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.752
So, Tereshkova became the first woman in space in June of 1963.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.390
Interestingly enough, she is still alive today, as of June 2021.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.310
She is 84, and has publicly volunteered to be the first

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.270
person to go to Mars, even if it is a one way trip.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.100
So, she is evidently a formidable woman.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.420
The Soviet winning streak continued.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.190
In 1965 the Soviets managed the first space walk, where a man named Aleksey Leonov was

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.040
the first person to walk in space, to exit the spacecraft and float around in space.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.100
And in February of 1966 the Soviets were the first

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.600
to manage what’s called a “soft landing” on the moon.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.820
A soft landing means that a spaceship lands on the moon safely, that it doesn’t crash into it.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.990
Obviously, if you want to send a person to the moon, the implication is that they manage

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.590
to get back safely, and so this was another important win that went to the Soviets.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.340
But, there was one incredibly important event that happened in early 1966

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.510
that was to hurt the Soviet chances, and some people have argued was the

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.040
real reason that the Americans beat the Soviets to put a man on the moon.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:14.760
In January of 1966 Sergey Korolev, the chief architect of the Soviet space programme, and the man

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.530
who had designed the rockets that had sent Sputnik I, Laika and Yuri Gagarin into space, died.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.230
You might be thinking that a country with almost a quarter of a billion people

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.370
shouldn’t be so badly affected by the death of one scientist, but apparently it was.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.700
Korolev was instrumental in the Soviet space programme, he was the clear leader,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.790
and with him gone there were power struggles and a communication breakdown.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.580
A year later, more tragedy struck, first for the Americans, and then for the Soviets.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.870
In January of 1967 three young American astronauts, Virgil Grissom, Ed

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:04.120
White, and Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire during a routine test.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.660
White had been the first American to walk in space, a couple of months after his Soviet counterpart,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:18.930
but along with his two fellow astronauts he was trapped inside their spaceship and killed in a fire.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:29.140
Then, on April 23rd, 1967, Vladimir Komarov became the first astronaut, or cosmonaut as he is

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:35.410
called in Russian, to be killed on a space mission, when his parachute failed to open properly

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:42.280
when he was returning to Earth, and he crashed into the ground at a speed of 140km per hour.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.260
Until then, space travel had seemed adventurous and fabulous, but the deaths

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.480
of these young astronauts really rammed home the extent of the danger.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.900
Nevertheless, the goal was clear, a man on the moon before the end of the decade.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.080
The American government had ploughed vast amounts of money into the programme, and

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:15.840
between 1961 and 1964 the budget for NASA had been increased by almost 500 percent.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.330
The moon was getting closer though.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.410
On December 24th of 1968 there was the first manned flight around the moon,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.120
when the American astronauts Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders spent

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:38.200
Christmas Eve reading the Book of Genesis, and took the iconic photo “Earthrise”.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.020
Then, I think we all know what comes next.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:48.860
On July 20th, 1969, exactly 52 years before this episode is

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.940
going to be released the first human beings set foot on the moon.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.390
I imagine you might have heard this before, or at least know the translation

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.090
in your own language, but here’s Neil Amstrong landing on the moon:

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:09.369
Armstrong is on the moon, Neil Armstrong, 38 year old American

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:16.989
standing on the surface of the moon on this July 20th, 1,969.

00:09:29.544 --> 00:09:32.574
I think that was Neil's quote, I didn't understand one

00:09:32.574 --> 00:09:35.034
small step for man, but I didn't get the second phrase.

00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:39.794
Don’t worry if you didn’t catch everything he said, evidently

00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:43.144
the people back on mission control didn’t get it either.

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:49.324
He said “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”

00:09:50.484 --> 00:09:55.254
So, the Americans had done it with 164 days to spare.

00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:57.464
They had sent a man to the moon.

00:09:58.524 --> 00:10:01.844
As I’m sure you will know, Neil Armstrong and Buzz

00:10:01.884 --> 00:10:05.574
Aldrin returned safely to Earth as national heroes.

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:11.704
With the moon now conquered, there were very few immediate prizes

00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:16.294
left in The Space Race, and by many people’s standards the moment Neil

00:10:16.294 --> 00:10:20.744
Armstrong set foot on the moon was the start of the end of The Space Race.

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:22.914
So, who won?

00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:29.664
The Soviets certainly scored all the early points, getting the first satellite, first animal, first

00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:35.964
man, and the first woman, but they failed at the last hurdle, getting the first man on the moon.

00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:38.994
Does that mean that the US won?

00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:42.244
That is of course open to interpretation.

00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:48.334
The United States certainly believes it won, and after the Apollo 11 mission to

00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:54.314
the moon, the government started to lose interest in space exploration, or at least

00:10:54.394 --> 00:10:59.674
it became significantly less of a priority than it had been in the early 1960s.

00:11:00.424 --> 00:11:07.024
The end of the space, race coincided with a thawing, a warming up of the Cold War.

00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:12.824
Relations between the US and the Soviets had started to improve, and

00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:17.444
there was a growing sense that working together on space exploration,

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:22.534
rather than in competition, would result in better progress for mankind.

00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:31.914
Indeed, in 1975 history was made when a Soviet spaceship, the Soyuz 19, joined together with the

00:11:31.914 --> 00:11:39.514
American Apollo spacecraft, and the astronauts famously shook hands and exchanged gifts in space.

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:44.194
And although things had cooled down since the moon

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:48.294
landing, this was the final whistle in The Space Race.

00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:56.354
Since then, since 1975, space exploration has largely been collaborative, but

00:11:56.544 --> 00:12:03.274
without any grand symbolic goal to head for, budgets have been slashed, and there is

00:12:03.274 --> 00:12:09.174
simply far less money for space exploration than there was in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:14.344
Ever since the Space Race ended, questions have been asked about what the

00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:20.454
US, the USSR, and the world, actually got out of it, other than the human

00:12:20.454 --> 00:12:24.984
achievement of being able to say “we put humans into space”, or onto the moon.

00:12:25.504 --> 00:12:29.074
The benefits are both measurable and immeasurable.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:34.734
The immeasurable ones, the ones that are not measurable, are relating to things

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:40.234
like boosting the soft power of the US, creating a generation of children who

00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:46.234
were inspired by astronauts and developed a passion for science, and of fostering

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:51.614
a shared goal for Americans, and a shared sense of community and achievements.

00:12:52.504 --> 00:12:55.244
The measurable benefits are easier.

00:12:55.704 --> 00:12:59.264
The space programmes have given us the technology behind the

00:12:59.274 --> 00:13:03.334
satellites that power our GPS and help us predict the weather.

00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:08.574
Microcomputers are believed to have come in a large part from the scientists

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:13.074
needing to develop smaller and smaller computers to fit into spacecraft.

00:13:13.614 --> 00:13:18.264
And the artificial heart pump, which has kept countless people alive

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:22.724
when their own hearts failed, was based on a space shuttle’s fuel pump.

00:13:23.304 --> 00:13:27.114
Even most modern baby formula, most artificial baby

00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:30.564
milk, contains an ingredient that was developed by NASA.

00:13:31.304 --> 00:13:36.184
And this is only a small selection - there are countless other inventions, things

00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:41.274
we rely on now in our daily lives, which we can trace back to The Space Race.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.334
But it was incredibly expensive.

00:13:44.864 --> 00:13:49.724
Adjusted for inflation, it is estimated that NASA, the North American

00:13:49.724 --> 00:13:54.034
Space Agency, spent almost a trillion dollars in today's money.

00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:57.004
Yes, it could have been spent on other things.

00:13:57.204 --> 00:14:01.264
Better hospitals, schools, universities, on doing things

00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:05.084
that improved people’s lives more directly back on Earth.

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:11.184
You can make up your own mind up on whether you think this was a good use of money, but I’ll

00:14:11.274 --> 00:14:17.484
leave you with the reason that JFK, the iconic US president, believed that it was worth it.

00:14:18.204 --> 00:14:19.813
So, over you to, JFK.

00:14:20.844 --> 00:14:25.634
Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was

00:14:25.644 --> 00:14:30.384
to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it.

00:14:31.274 --> 00:14:32.424
He said, "Because it is there."

00:14:33.324 --> 00:14:37.429
Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and

00:14:37.484 --> 00:14:41.294
the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.

00:14:42.004 --> 00:14:47.634
And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous

00:14:48.064 --> 00:14:52.204
and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.

00:14:52.834 --> 00:14:53.154
Thank you.

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:04.673
OK then, that is it for Part Two of The Space Race, the moon landing.

00:15:05.123 --> 00:15:08.933
As a reminder, Part Three is going to be on The Next Space Race,

00:15:08.973 --> 00:15:13.123
the final frontier, where we will ask ourselves “what’s next?”.

00:15:13.573 --> 00:15:16.943
And if you haven’t yet listened to Part One, I’d recommend giving that

00:15:16.973 --> 00:15:21.463
a listen to, as it provides some background to this fascinating story.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.653
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:15:25.983 --> 00:15:29.223
For some of you, you will no doubt remember the moon landing.

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:35.193
It was broadcast to an audience of 723 million people live on TV.

00:15:35.603 --> 00:15:39.173
So, if you were watching this as a kid, what was it like?

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:42.983
I can only imagine that it must have been pretty amazing…

00:15:43.663 --> 00:15:48.493
And whether you watched it or not, I would love to know what you think about The Space Race.

00:15:48.793 --> 00:15:52.403
We do have quite a lot of members from former Soviet countries,

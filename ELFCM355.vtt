Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:09.629
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.719
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.650
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.170
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.409
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.590
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.369
I'm Alastair Budge, and today

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.960
we are going to be talking

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.420
about a man called Thomas Cook.

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.330
Now, the name Thomas Cook might ring a

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.439
bell, it might sound familiar to you.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.640
Perhaps you’ve seen Thomas Cook

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.439
aeroplanes, cruises, or perhaps you’ve

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:39.650
even been on a Thomas Cook holiday.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.050
But we are going to be talking

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.490
about the man behind this travel

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.550
company, a man who, by many people’s

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.230
standards, invented modern tourism.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.850
It’s a fascinating story about a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.280
man with a mission, the industrial

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.040
revolution, and the opening up of the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.190
UK, Europe, and the wider world to an

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.690
entirely new generation of tourists.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.000
We’ve got a lot to get through,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.920
so let’s get right into it.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.169
If you had heard of Thomas Cook, I

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:14.839
wonder what thought first sprung to mind.

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:17.079
Perhaps it’s seeing signs

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:17.850
for Thomas Cook in airports.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.469
If you live in a place where there

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.550
are lots of tourists, like the south

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.930
coast of Spain, for example, perhaps

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.310
it’s seeing Thomas Cook buses, or

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.119
seeing huge groups of British tourists

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.850
who have spent too much time in

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.369
the sun and drunk too many beers.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.210
The name Thomas Cook is now synonymous

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.530
with package holidays, where you can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490
buy a flight, a hotel, and often all

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.829
the food and alcoholic drinks you can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.270
stomach, all for one fixed, low price.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.420
And on the subject of alcohol, as you may

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.300
know, British holidaymakers have somewhat

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.910
of a bad reputation for drinking a lot.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.210
Indeed, Thomas Cook had to issue

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.920
a warning in 2022 to British

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.969
holidaymakers to Spain that their

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.879
supposed “unlimited drinks” were in

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.060
fact going to be limited to six per day.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.519
Now, you might think that six alcoholic

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.630
drinks a day sounds like a serious

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.160
amount, and nobody should ever reach

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.939
that number, but let me tell you that

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.700
this was enough of a surprise to British

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.500
holidaymakers that it made headline news.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.290
And on the subject of surprises, let

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.690
me tell you that Thomas Cook the man,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.820
the original founder of the company,

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.590
would be turning in his grave, he

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.050
would be very upset, if he found

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.649
out that his name was being used to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.399
advertise and promote drinking alcohol.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.960
Why?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.369
Well, because his eponymous, company,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.469
Thomas Cook, was founded as a way to

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.809
encourage people to stop drinking.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.589
He was a man on a mission,

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.510
and that mission was simple:

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.130
stop people getting drunk.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.839
To understand why this was, to understand

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.719
why this mission led him to founding

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.280
this company, we must do three things:

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.389
first, we must spend some time reflecting

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.820
on what life was like in 19th century

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.170
Britain for working people, then

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.320
briefly talk about the technological

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.420
developments of the Industrial Revolution,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.269
and then look at Thomas Cook the man.

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.240
So, what was life like

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.640
in 19th century Britain?

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.409
Well, for the vast majority of

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.449
the population, it was pretty

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.979
grim, it wasn't much fun.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.630
There had been a mass migration of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.829
people from the countryside to the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.680
industrial cities, where people

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.700
lived together in cramped housing,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.430
working 12 hour days and with one

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.169
day off a week if they were lucky.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.190
There simply wasn’t much free time,

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.540
and the free time there was was

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.549
typically spent drinking alcohol.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.670
Work in the factories from dawn

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.730
until dusk, Monday to Saturday,

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.010
then go to the pub on a Saturday

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.630
night to blow your wages, to spend

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.760
your money on beer and whisky.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.650
This was how most people

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.120
working in mid-19th century

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.740
Britain lived their lives.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.190
Now, if you’re thinking, “don’t

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.900
people in Britain still do this?”,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.040
sure, you'd be partly right, but it

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.620
was so much more widespread during

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.560
the Victorian Era than it is today.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.120
Drunkenness was a huge issue, and with

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.640
it violence, which was often directed

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.560
at poor men’s wives as they returned

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.670
home after a heavy night of drinking.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.880
So, that’s our first factor, a working

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.579
population with little to no “free

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.530
time”, and one that used alcohol as its

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.410
primary method of relaxation and leisure.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.470
Secondly, we must talk about

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.970
the technological developments

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.440
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:06.240
And the most important factor

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.310
here was the invention of the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.240
steam train and the railways.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.830
The world’s first railway dates back

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.220
to 1825, when a man called George

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.880
Stephenson connected two towns in

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.629
the northeast of England by railway.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.899
Within 25 years, there was

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:28.209
10,000 kilometres of railway

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.660
throughout the country, and

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.690
most major towns were connected.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.540
Importantly, it was cheap,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.450
it was relatively affordable.

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:38.783
Why was this important?

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:41.893
Well, it meant that, for the first time

00:05:41.903 --> 00:05:44.873
in history, it was comparatively easy,

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:48.213
affordable and fast to travel from one

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:50.933
place to another, and travel, after

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:53.033
all, is what tourism is all about.

00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:56.423
And this brings us to the man we’re

00:05:56.483 --> 00:05:58.593
talking about today, Thomas Cook.

00:05:59.423 --> 00:06:02.423
He was born in 1808 in Melbourne.

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:05.443
No, not Melbourne, Australia;

00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:08.143
Melbourne, Derbyshire, a market

00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:09.773
town in the middle of England.

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:12.993
He grew up towards the end of

00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:14.753
the Industrial Revolution, and

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:17.393
as a consequence he saw its

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:18.893
effect on the people around him.

00:06:20.073 --> 00:06:21.583
And what did he see?

00:06:22.203 --> 00:06:23.443
Well, what we talked

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:24.523
about a few minutes ago.

00:06:25.063 --> 00:06:27.993
Men and women working long hours in

00:06:27.993 --> 00:06:30.723
dangerous and unfulfilling work, and

00:06:30.913 --> 00:06:33.113
using alcohol as a way of escape.

00:06:34.683 --> 00:06:37.803
Cook left school aged only ten years old,

00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:40.063
and he immediately got his first job,

00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:42.913
working as a gardener for a penny a day,

00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:45.211
before becoming an apprentice woodworker,

00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:47.471
someone who made wooden furniture.

00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:51.731
His upbringing was a highly religious one;

00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:55.331
his parents were both devout Baptists,

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.891
and Cook would follow in their footsteps.

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:01.061
He was a preacher in his teenage years,

00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:03.921
and at the age of twenty he became

00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:06.621
a full-on missionary, distributing

00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:08.461
information about the Baptist

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.701
church and trying to convert people.

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:14.701
A couple of years later, in 1830,

00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:17.271
at the age of 22, he discovered

00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:19.661
the Temperance movement, which was

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.700
a social movement that  campaigned

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.900
against alcohol and drunkenness.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.620
He became an advocate of this

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.220
movement, preaching to anyone who would

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.260
listen about the dangers of alcohol.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.690
But clearly, there was a limited

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.870
impact any one man could have.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.890
He might persuade a few people to stop

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.670
drinking, doing the Lord’s work as he

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.600
believed it was, but this was a problem

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.480
that affected the entire country.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.750
So, what could be done about it?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.040
Well, Thomas Cook had an idea.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.650
It all started in 1841, when he needed

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.120
to go to a meeting of Temperance

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.590
campaigners twenty five kilometres away.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.360
His plan was to walk there, but he

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.540
had an idea, and I’m quoting directly:

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.160
“A thought flashed through my brain – what

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.690
a glorious thing it would be if the

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.070
newly developed powers of railways and

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.820
locomotion could be made subservient

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.060
to the promotion of temperance”

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.080
Or to translate this into plain English,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.810
what if we could use trains to encourage

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.430
people to stop drinking alcohol?

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.440
And so his first trip, or tour, was

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.100
taking a group of 500 Temperance

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.040
campaigners on a short railway journey.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.320
Easy enough, you might think.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.650
But Cook sensed the potential.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.580
It was all well and good taking

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.410
people to and from Temperance

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.830
movements, but what if he could

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.440
provide an alternative to drinking?

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.200
What if he could give working people a

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.270
way to experience something new, another

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.740
leisure activity, and most importantly,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.070
one that didn’t require alcohol?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.950
It took several years, and he first

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.240
focussed his efforts on transporting

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.000
groups of people to and from Temperance

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.790
movements across the north of England.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.860
But clearly, the seed was planted,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.335
he had the idea of how to turn

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.870
this into something bigger.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.990
He got to work, and by 1845 he

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.090
had arranged his first package

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.680
tour, taking a group of 350 people

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.880
on a railway tour to Scotland.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.760
Now, this might sound like nothing

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.750
particularly special to you or me, but

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.860
at the time it really was revolutionary.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.290
Tourism as we know it

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.720
now simply didn’t exist.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.560
Sure, this wasn’t the first time

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.340
in history that people travelled

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.670
to experience something new.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.580
Even going back to the ancient Egyptians

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.690
there are records of pharaohs going to

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.140
visit the pyramids or other famous sites.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.740
The Greeks went to consult the Oracle

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.630
or watch sporting events, and even

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.670
moving into the 17th century in

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.610
Britain there was this idea of The

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.220
Grand Tour, which you can hear about

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.420
in episode number 176 by the way.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.120
And, of course, the history of people

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.260
travelling for religious reasons,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.310
for pilgrimage, is as old as time.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.600
But these types of trips would take a

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.780
long time, because you’d have to go by

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.260
carriage, boat, horse, or even by foot,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.320
and in the case of the non-religious

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.660
trips, they were restricted to the

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.200
wealthiest in society, people who

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.480
could afford to simply not work for

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.900
months or years at a time and to

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.030
take these vastly expensive trips.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.280
Cook’s genius, or at least invention,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.590
was to open up the ability of

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.490
experiencing a new place to an entirely

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.760
new section of society: everyone else.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.470
Initially, the trips were within

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.960
the UK, with his most popular route

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.280
being the tours north, to Scotland.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.750
Again, to reiterate, although now you

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.970
can get from Manchester to Glasgow on a

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.010
train in just over three hours, before

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.680
Thomas Cook's first excursions, this

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.870
simply wasn’t something that people did,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.490
nor something they had any reason to do.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.690
As a result, the arrival of Thomas

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.620
Cook’s groups was quite the spectacle.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.180
When the trains first arrived in Glasgow

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.870
station guns were fired, a band was

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.750
waiting to play a celebratory song,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.890
and speeches of praise were read out.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.120
It really was quite something.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.310
Thomas Cook was doing exactly as he had

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.540
hoped - he was providing an alcohol-free

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.780
leisure alternative, he was giving

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.030
people the chance to see the world, or

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.240
at least “the country”, without beer

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.580
goggles, without a drop of alcohol.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.640
And his work was not going unnoticed.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.990
He was asked to help transport

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.000
workers from the north of England

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.440
south, to London, for the 1851 Great

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.670
Exhibition, which you can also learn

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.020
about in episode number 59 by the way.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.740
He accepted, he did it, and it’s

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.360
believed that he successfully

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.150
transported 150,000 people.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.280
No mean feat, especially as nobody had

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.230
ever done anything like this before.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.100
Up until then, he had only arranged

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.680
domestic travel, trips within Britain.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.080
There was the rest of the world

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.610
to see, but one step at a time.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.480
In the summer of 1855 he opened his

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.880
first European route, the so-called

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.400
“grand circular”, where people would

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.980
visit Brussels, Cologne, the Rhine,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.530
Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Strasbourg

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.010
and Paris, where travellers would go

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.720
to the 1855 Paris Great Exhibition,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.460
before returning to Britain.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.480
Again, you can do this all on

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.610
your own relatively easy now,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.210
but imagine 170 years ago?

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.630
Not only do you have greater language

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.890
barriers, but how do you manage

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.850
the different currencies, where

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.850
to stay, where to eat, and so on?

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.120
In fact, Cook had initially planned to

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.020
simply sell the travel ticket, but he

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.700
had so many people asking him to organise

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.990
all of the accommodation and food that

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.790
he agreed, providing everything for five

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.437
pounds, today’s equivalent of around €500.

00:14:01.647 --> 00:14:04.230
This was, perhaps, the first

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.400
“all inclusive package holiday”.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.590
Actually delivering this was

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.090
complicated, because he had to arrange

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.270
deals with hotels, and restaurants,

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.550
manage different currencies and so on.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.020
It was very tricky, but he managed

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.200
it thanks to two innovations.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.990
Firstly, something called the

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.420
hotel coupon, which travellers

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.940
could use to pay for food and

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.100
rooms at various partner hotels.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.280
And then a few years later something

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.600
called the circular note, which was

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.080
a piece of paper that travellers

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.140
could exchange for local currency.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.380
A bit like a traveller’s cheque.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.130
By now, Thomas Cook was the

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.680
biggest tour operator not just in

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.820
Britain or Europe, but the world.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.430
I mean, there wasn’t much competition,

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.380
but this was a man who pioneered

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.890
the entire concept of mass tourism.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.350
And after his European success, the

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.000
next target was indeed, the world.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.850
In 1865 it was America, in 1869 he sold

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.840
a package tour up the River Nile, and

00:15:14.965 --> 00:15:19.510
in 1873 he completed his own world tour,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.220
a 222-day mammoth trip going west from

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.020
London to the United States, across North

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.770
America, across the Pacific to Japan, then

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.980
working his way through China, India, up

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.430
through the Suez Canal and back to London.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.190
And soon enough this was a tour

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.530
he also offered to his customers,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.690
costing 200 guineas, which is

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.760
today’s equivalent of around €20,000.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.660
Sure, not affordable to all, but a

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.800
remarkable achievement that this was

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.860
even something that he was able to offer.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.720
By this time, however, he was growing old,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.860
and the day-to-day running of the business

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.230
was managed by his son, John Cook.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.390
He died in 1892 at the ripe old

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.060
age of 83, which was pretty good

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.280
going as British life expectancy

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.150
at the time was a measly 47 years.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.710
And in terms of the legacy he left, well

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.060
clearly there is the company named after

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.220
him, which has gone through various

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.400
booms and busts, and is now only a travel

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.560
agency, after going bankrupt in 2019.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.300
But what he really left behind is

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.920
something more than the Thomas Cook name.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.440
It’s the invention of mass tourism,

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.480
it’s the idea that there is value

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.920
in visiting new places, having new

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.210
experiences, and seeing something new.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.330
Sure, seeing new places didn’t start

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.420
with Thomas Cook, and the tourism

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.960
industry would have certainly

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.490
boomed without Thomas Cook.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.860
And his motivations for getting started

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.790
might not have been anything to do

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.940
with tourism; they might have been

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.440
religious, in a bid to rid the country

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.430
of the scourge of alcohol abuse, and

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.870
as anyone who has been on a Thomas Cook

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.080
holiday will know, Thomas Cook package

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.790
holidays are certainly not alcohol free.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.170
So he might have failed if judged

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.380
by his own “Temperance” standards.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.770
But in terms of increasing the

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.090
accessibility of tourism, his

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.230
achievements were seismic; he opened

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.880
people’s eyes to the wonder of tourism,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.730
and crucially, made it available and

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.470
accessible to people who had never had

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.450
the opportunity to experience it before.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.760
So next time you go on holiday, perhaps

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.520
you’ll spare a thought for this pioneer,

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.920
the man who can quite rightly be

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.770
called The Father of Modern Tourism.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.640
OK then, that is it for today's

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.250
episode this brief look into the

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.450
life and times of Thomas Cook

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.260
and The Birth of Modern Tourism.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.200
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.850
and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.710
As always, I would love to know

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.140
what you thought about this episode.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.530
Did you know about Thomas Cook before?

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.880
If you’re from a part of the world

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.560
with lots of British tourists,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.730
what are your first thoughts when

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.110
you hear the name “Thomas Cook”?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.600
I imagine they weren’t “promoter

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.220
of an alcohol-free lifestyle”.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.150
And what do you think

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.320
about modern mass tourism?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.450
What do you think Thomas Cook would

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.510
say if he could see the impact

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.200
of the tourism industry today?

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.930
I would love to know, so let’s

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.440
get this discussion started.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.940

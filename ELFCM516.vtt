Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.369
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.879
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:27.060
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going on a journey to the bottom of the ocean.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
Or rather, we aren’t going on a journey, but we will be talking about the fascinating

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.223
history of humans trying to travel underwater and understand what lies beneath the surface.

00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:44.803
It’s an amazing tale of bravery, marvellous inventions, strange creatures,

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:50.283
and as we will discover, it is a story that has barely even got started.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:57.865
OK then, let’s not waste a minute and learn about the history of underwater exploration.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:04.255
For as long as we humans have walked on the land, we have

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:08.965
also built boats, canoes, and rafts to travel on water.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:16.435
People have explored rivers, lakes and seas, crossed oceans to far off lands.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:23.275
The seas and oceans have always been a subject of intrigue and mystery, with

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:29.245
their storms, high waves, and strange creatures that lurk beneath the surface.

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:35.205
In practically every culture with some history of seafaring, there

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:39.525
are stories of mysterious sea monsters, beasts from the deep.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:42.925
After all, it is hardly surprising.

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:47.455
People knew that there were animals down there, because they

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:51.165
could throw nets or hooks into the sea and pull them out.

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:57.695
Fish, octopus, squid, sharks, whales, creatures of all shapes and sizes.

00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:04.545
Clearly, there was an abundance of life beneath the surface, but compared to

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:10.845
the life on earth, the ocean, and its inhabitants, were very poorly understood.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:18.275
For starters, for thousands of years there was not even agreement on whether the deep sea ever

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:25.395
“finished”, whether there was a floor to the ocean, or whether it was an eternal abyss of water.

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:31.735
After all, you couldn’t see the bottom and there was no possibility of going there.

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:36.815
So did the sea continue forever, or not?

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:44.432
In 1521, a man called Ferdinand Magellan did attempt to answer this question.

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:53.323
Now, you might know about Ferdinand Magellan already, or you might remember him from Episode 196.

00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:58.052
Long story short, he was a Portuguese explorer and

00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:01.752
the first person to sail all the way around the world.

00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:06.752
Well, whether it was actually Magellan or someone else is another question that you

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:12.582
can hear about more in that episode, but the point is that he was an explorer who

00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:17.732
was the first or one of the first people to ever sail all the way around the world.

00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:24.282
Anyway, in 1521 he was a couple of years into his expedition,

00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:28.862
and he was in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean.

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:33.790
He attempted to answer the question of the ocean’s depth.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.880
How he did this was by attaching a cannonball to a piece of

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.880
long rope, and then lowering it off the side of the boat.

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:50.516
As the men lowered the cannonball, they measured how much rope had been

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:55.886
used, with the idea that when the rope went slack, when the line was

00:03:56.026 --> 00:04:01.046
no longer tight, this meant that the cannonball had hit the bottom.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:06.435
The men lowered and lowered and lowered it, but after

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:12.298
732 metres it was still just as tight as before.

00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:15.408
And they had run out of rope.

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:20.298
Magellan concluded that, and I’m quoting directly, the

00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:24.738
ocean was “immeasurably deep”, too deep to be measured.

00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:26.711
This

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:32.895
might sound like a relatively basic way of measuring the depth of a body of water, but it

00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:38.305
works very well, and had been the way in which people measured the depth of water for thousands

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:44.940
of years, and it was still the main way people measured depth for much of the 20th century.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.240
Now, of course there is a big difference between knowing how deep a body

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.410
of water is and knowing what is actually going on beneath the surface.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.350
To state the obvious, there is a hard limit of how deep a human can

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.760
dive below the surface on their own, without any kind of assistance.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.940
Just going down 10 metres below the surface doubles the pressure upon the

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.680
body, which is why you feel that discomfort in your ears, and why you need

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.260
to blow, holding your nose to equalise the pressure if you are diving.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.610
So there’s the question of pressure, but there’s also

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.090
the more important question of running out of breath.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.040
Even the most seasoned divers, people from communities where they

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.780
would dive for pearls or sponges, they can typically only get to

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.880
depths of 20 or 30 metres, and hold their breath for around 10 minutes.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.380
Sure, that is very impressive, but it really is only a tiny fraction of the depth of the ocean.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.390
And even going back thousands of years, people knew what they needed

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.290
to explore the deep: some kind of container and a source of air.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.180
One of the first mentions of this kind of contraption dates back to

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.150
Aristotle in the 4th Century BC, but this was just from a theoretical

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.320
perspective, there is no evidence that any such object was ever built.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.680
Yet, the idea captured imaginations for centuries to come.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.050
By the Middle Ages, tales from French and German poetry spoke

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.030
of a hero using a ‘diving bell’ to explore the ocean’s depths.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.810
One of the most famous legends linked this invention to Alexander

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.392
the Great, who supposedly  descended underwater in a glass bell

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:55.082
alongside a few animal companions—a dog, a cat, and even a chicken.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:07:01.772
While there’s no historical proof that Alexander attempted such a dive, the

00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:06.925
story has persisted, blending myth and ambition in the pursuit of the deep.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:13.045
The first use of what we now call a diving bell came much later,

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:18.014
in the 16th century, invented by the Italian Guglielmo de Lorena.

00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:23.557
Together with a colleague, Francesco De Marchi, de Lorena sought

00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:27.137
to go to the bottom of Lake Nemi, just to the south of Rome.

00:07:28.127 --> 00:07:33.697
At the bottom of this lake lay two huge ancient barges that had been built

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:39.307
as floating palaces for the Roman Emperor Caligula in the first century AD.

00:07:40.957 --> 00:07:44.549
They most probably couldn’t be seen from the surface, but

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:47.955
there were plenty of historical records and local stories.

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:54.405
People knew they were there, only 18 metres below the surface, but this was

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:59.215
sufficiently far down that people couldn’t dive and properly explore them.

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:08.038
However, Guglielmo de Lorena invented a device that allowed him to spend hours at a time

00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:14.668
exploring the ships, meaning he could return to the surface with treasures from ancient Rome.

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:23.233
Now, how this device actually worked is still a bit of a mystery, because his diving partner,

00:08:23.573 --> 00:08:29.663
De Marchi, the man who later wrote an account of the adventure, took a vow of secrecy.

00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:34.883
What we know is that it was basically a large wooden

00:08:34.893 --> 00:08:38.683
barrel with a small piece of crystal for a window.

00:08:39.763 --> 00:08:44.993
This would be put on the diver’s head, and there must have been some way of

00:08:45.003 --> 00:08:52.093
getting the exhaled air out of the bell and pumping fresh air into it, but as

00:08:52.093 --> 00:08:56.663
the writer was sworn to secrecy, we don’t know exactly how this was achieved.

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:01.113
But we know that it worked, there is little doubt about this.

00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:07.783
In fact, in his account, De Marchi would write that the limit to how long a

00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:12.303
diver could stay underwater with this invention was nothing to do with how

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:18.163
much air there was left, but rather how long the diver could withstand the cold

00:09:18.163 --> 00:09:23.243
of the water and the fatigue of wearing this heavy contraption on their head.

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:30.123
It was a cunning system indeed, and did allow these men to complete what

00:09:30.133 --> 00:09:35.453
has been described as one of the first instances of underwater archaeology.

00:09:36.393 --> 00:09:38.473
But, it had its limits.

00:09:39.174 --> 00:09:42.123
20 metres, after all, is not very deep.

00:09:43.063 --> 00:09:50.283
Throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, inventors continued to tinker away on new

00:09:50.283 --> 00:09:55.183
versions of this technology, trying to solve the problem of how to get rid of exhaled

00:09:55.203 --> 00:10:01.003
air, have enough capacity for fresh air, and maintain the right pressure at the same time.

00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:07.483
And they weren’t doing this only out of scientific curiosity, or out

00:10:07.503 --> 00:10:11.523
of an innate desire to understand the marine biology of the seas.

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:19.690
The major objective was allowing people to dive down and recover valuables from shipwrecks.

00:10:20.743 --> 00:10:25.823
By this point in time, there were hundreds of known shipwrecks with valuable treasure,

00:10:26.183 --> 00:10:30.943
from ancient Roman shipwrecks through to ships that had only sunk the previous year.

00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:38.273
In some cases they were known to contain today’s equivalent of tens of millions of Euros worth

00:10:38.273 --> 00:10:44.593
of perfectly usable gold, it was just a question of being able to get down there and pick it up.

00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:53.333
And with this very real monetary incentive, diving bell technology did increase dramatically, and

00:10:53.623 --> 00:10:59.943
divers were able to go down to depths of twenty or so metres and stay there for extended periods

00:10:59.943 --> 00:11:07.143
of time, supported either by tubes or sealed buckets of fresh air delivered from the surface.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:14.243
But in 1620, just under 100 years after de Lorena and De Marchi’s trip

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:19.473
to the bottom of Lake Nemi, a Dutch inventor named Cornelis Drebbel would

00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:24.313
design something that would go on to surpass the diving bell: the submarine.

00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:29.683
He was working in London at the time, having been contracted by the

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:34.497
British to work on all sorts of weird and wonderful inventions  that might

00:11:34.537 --> 00:11:39.737
aid the British navy, and the design for a submarine was one of them.

00:11:41.077 --> 00:11:45.487
Now, his submarine was very different from modern submarines.

00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:49.716
It was made of wood and leather, it had oars to propel it,

00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:54.896
and air was supplied by two tubes that went up to the surface.

00:11:55.826 --> 00:11:58.262
But it worked, sort of.

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:04.252
He continually improved the machine, building bigger and better versions of it.

00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:10.512
By the time he had finished, it was able to travel all the way from

00:12:10.512 --> 00:12:16.402
Westminster to Greenwich in London, a distance of more than  10 kilometres.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.420
Underwater, I should add.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:26.920
It travelled at a depth of 4 metres, and he even took King James I of England for a

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.940
spin, giving him the unusual title of being the first ever monarch to travel underwater.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:40.710
Now, unfortunately for Drebbel, the submarine was not considered to have any practical military

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:47.760
value, so the project was scrapped, but it was an important development in underwater technology.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.530
The next important step came a century and a half later, during the American war of

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:00.510
independence, when an American inventor called David Bushnell created the “Turtle”.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.510
This was a sort of large wooden ball, 3 metres long

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.360
and 2 metres wide, which could fit one person inside.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:17.650
Importantly, it was self-powered, so the person inside could pedal

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.870
with their feet, like a bicycle, to move the submarine forwards.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.620
Its objective was a military one.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:32.150
Remember, this was an American invention created during the American War of Independence.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:40.320
The idea was to creep up, undetected, on British ships and plant a bomb on the

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.680
ship’s hull, the side of the ship, and then rush away before the bomb exploded.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:53.450
It was a similar idea to a submarine firing a torpedo, but the main difference

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:59.160
being that it had to pedal up to the ship with the bomb and stick it to the side,

00:13:59.434 --> 00:14:04.501
rather than firing it from a distance of several hundred metres or even kilometres.

00:14:05.656 --> 00:14:10.946
It sounded perfectly good in theory, but in practice it never actually worked.

00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:18.216
The currents were too strong, so it got pushed around too much, and it couldn’t hold enough

00:14:18.246 --> 00:14:24.426
air to stay underwater for long enough, so it never actually completed a successful mission.

00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:31.996
Fast forward to the late 19th century, and submarine technology had improved dramatically.

00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:40.676
And with the invention of the torpedo, the submarine became a viable and deadly military asset.

00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:48.035
But these submarines still weren’t able to go particularly deep, not much more than a couple of

00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:54.075
hundred metres, and what’s more, we are talking about deep-sea exploration, not warfare here.

00:14:55.715 --> 00:15:00.635
At the same time as submarine technology was going through a period of rapid development,

00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:06.945
there was a greater desire to understand the seas and oceans from a scientific perspective.

00:15:08.467 --> 00:15:17.627
Between the years of 1872 and 1876, a British ship called HMS Challenger embarked

00:15:17.647 --> 00:15:27.240
on a huge mission of scientific exploration, travelling a grand total of 127,580

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.867
kilometres, the equivalent of going around the world more than three times.

00:15:34.087 --> 00:15:40.917
The objective was to understand the seas and oceans, and it was tasked with measuring the

00:15:40.917 --> 00:15:47.387
depth of the ocean, which it did 492 times, taking samples from the bottom of the ocean,

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:54.597
which it did 133 times, pulling huge nets through the water to see what lay beneath, which

00:15:54.637 --> 00:16:02.697
it did 151 times, and measuring the temperature of the water, which it did 263 times.

00:16:03.457 --> 00:16:08.647
It was a gargantuan mission, and it was hugely important in

00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:13.357
the growing field of oceanography, the science of the sea.

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:19.187
To those who had thought the deep sea was inhospitable, unable

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:23.037
to sustain life, they were proved to be wholly mistaken.

00:16:24.407 --> 00:16:32.957
In its four year voyage, the Challenger discovered around 4,700 new species of marine life.

00:16:34.037 --> 00:16:40.267
The crew also discovered the deepest place on Earth, or at least, the deepest-known place on Earth.

00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:47.547
While in the Pacific Ocean they conducted one of their 492 depth samples,

00:16:47.887 --> 00:16:52.467
dropping a lead weight to the bottom and continuing to let the rope down

00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:57.837
until it hit the bottom, pretty much like Magellan did 350 years before.

00:16:59.297 --> 00:17:08.517
They continued for 8,184 metres before the rope went slack, indicating that the bottom had been hit.

00:17:09.897 --> 00:17:13.557
What they had found was part of what we now call the

00:17:13.557 --> 00:17:17.407
Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean trench in the world.

00:17:18.967 --> 00:17:23.927
Now, they didn’t actually find the deepest bit of the trench, the deepest

00:17:23.937 --> 00:17:31.047
known part is actually 10,984 metres deep, making it more than 2,000

00:17:31.057 --> 00:17:34.797
metres further from the Earth’s surface than the peak of Mount Everest.

00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:42.767
But it was a pretty good attempt, and the deepest known part of the trench, and the furthest known

00:17:42.767 --> 00:17:49.537
distance from the Earth’s surface is named after this ship and this expedition: Challenger Deep.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:57.835
And just as standing on the top of the world, and summiting Mount Everest has become a goal for

00:17:57.835 --> 00:18:04.235
the world’s most adventurous explorers, so has going to the very depths of the Mariana Trench.

00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:08.515
But compared to getting to the top of Mount Everest,

00:18:08.835 --> 00:18:12.485
getting to the bottom of the Mariana Trench is a lot harder.

00:18:13.765 --> 00:18:18.365
The first people to achieve it were the American, Don Walsh, and his

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:23.516
Swiss oceanographer colleague, Jacques Piccard, who managed it in 1960.

00:18:24.816 --> 00:18:31.436
This iconic descent took place in something called a Bathyscaphe, which looks a little bit like an

00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:39.086
airship, a Zeppelin, and consists of a small round pressure sphere at the bottom, where the two men

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:45.776
would sit, and a large collection of tanks filled with gasoline in order to keep the device buoyant.

00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:51.045
The pressure sphere had to be incredibly strong, so

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:55.345
it was made from reinforced steel 9 centimetres thick.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:19:00.465
At those sorts of depths the pressure is so intense,

00:19:00.595 --> 00:19:03.905
it’s more than 1,000 times what it is at sea level.

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:10.385
Or to put it another way, it’s like there was a 1,250 kilograms

00:19:10.395 --> 00:19:14.445
weight pushing down on every square centimetre of the craft.

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:18.855
There is absolutely no way a human body could withstand that sort of

00:19:18.855 --> 00:19:23.717
pressure; our organs would be instantly crushed, we would be compressed to

00:19:23.717 --> 00:19:28.737
a fraction of our normal size and, to state the obvious, instantly killed.

00:19:29.977 --> 00:19:36.409
But, fortunately, the craft had been forged from incredibly strong steel, and the men

00:19:36.629 --> 00:19:41.609
successfully went to the depths of the Mariana trench and returned alive and well.

00:19:42.663 --> 00:19:47.211
This was more than 60 years ago, but given the difficulty

00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:51.711
and expense of going so far deep, few others have managed it.

00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:59.427
And as of a couple of years ago, there have been only 22 manned descents and 7

00:19:59.471 --> 00:20:04.601
unmanned descents, so compared to the number of people who have climbed Mount Everest

00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:10.022
or even the number of people who have gone to space, it is still a tiny fraction.

00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:17.295
And, really, although we now have the technology to map the ocean floor without having to

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:22.864
drop cannonballs and measure rope, and we can go anywhere in the ocean and have seen weird

00:20:22.894 --> 00:20:28.774
and wonderful deep sea creatures living at depths people once thought far too great to sustain

00:20:28.774 --> 00:20:34.953
life,  the Earth’s seas and oceans are still among the worst-understood parts of the planet.

00:20:36.183 --> 00:20:41.844
The legendary French maritime explorer and filmmaker Jean-Michel Cousteau once

00:20:41.854 --> 00:20:46.674
said that we understand the other side of the moon better than we understand

00:20:46.674 --> 00:20:52.014
our own oceans, so while we know more about it than ever before, the deep

00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:57.634
sea still is a comparative unknown that holds more questions than answers.

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:04.064
OK, that is it for today's episode on exploring the deep.

00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:07.244
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:21:07.654 --> 00:21:12.014
and if you are going to a pub quiz and one of the questions is “which

00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:15.824
monarch was the first to travel underwater”, you will know the answer.

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:17.481
King James I..

00:21:18.227 --> 00:21:22.627
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:23.067 --> 00:21:28.237
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:16.297
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:21.867
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:29.977
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Josep Broz, otherwise known as Tito.

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:39.077
He was the man who ruled Yugoslavia for almost 40 years, survived 21 assassination

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:46.587
attempts, and was one of the few people to stand up to Stalin and live to tell the tale.

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:50.857
It’s a fascinating story, and I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:56.367

The place to go for that is the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:28.224
So, Tito.

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:35.914
Our story starts in 1892, in a small village called Kumrovec,

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:40.702
in what was then Austro-Hungary, but is now part of Croatia.

00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:46.552
Josip Broz was the seventh son of a family of 15 children.

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:51.112
His parents were peasants, although they were by no

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:55.002
means destitute, they weren’t completely impoverished.

00:01:55.742 --> 00:02:00.172
They had a reasonably large farm, and a house of their own.

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:06.772
Much of Josip Broz’s early life is debated, from how many

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:10.722
brothers and sisters he had, to where he was actually born.

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:17.932
We’ll skip over much of this because it isn’t really that important for the purposes of our story.

00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:24.264
When he was about 15 years old, Broz left home, and wandered around a

00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:30.234
series of towns and cities in central Europe, doing odd-jobs, repairing

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:35.704
bicycles, working in restaurants, and generally doing manual jobs.

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:43.459
Everything changed in 1913 when he was forced to join the Austro-Hungarian army.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:50.519
Austro-Hungary still had conscription, as did most European countries, and the

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.059
young Broz became a soldier at the age of 21, a year before World War I broke out.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.379
During the war, he distinguished himself, and it was here that he

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.019
first started displaying his organisational skills and bravery.

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:17.839
He was sent to the Eastern front to fight against Russia, and in 1915 he was almost

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.449
killed by a Russian lancer, a soldier on a horse carrying a large sharp pole.

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.729
Although this incident nearly was the end of the young

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.819
Broz, it proved to be a defining moment in his life.

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.979
Injured, he was captured by the Russians, and sent to a Russian prisoner of war camp.

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.119
It was here that he discovered communism, or at least, became sympathetic

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.099
to the communist organisations that were soon to seize power in Russia.

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:59.319
When he returned ‘home’, he found that the country he had grown up

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.014
in, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was no more, and the country he

00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:10.254
returned to was called the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:20.302
The name of this country was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929, and it included the countries we now

00:04:20.342 --> 00:04:29.732
know as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia.

00:04:30.992 --> 00:04:36.192
Now, we could obviously talk for hours about the difficulties that Yugoslavia

00:04:36.202 --> 00:04:43.242
had, and the difficulties of uniting seven different countries under one ruler,

00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:49.162
but let's stick to the most important things to remember when it comes to Tito.

00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:55.112
Firstly, power in this new country, the Kingdom of the Serbs,

00:04:55.342 --> 00:05:00.222
Croats, and Slovenes was concentrated in the hands of the Serbs.

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:06.052
Secondly, different factions, different groups of people

00:05:06.052 --> 00:05:10.042
within this new kingdom favoured different approaches.

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:16.482
Some favoured centralised control from the capital, Belgrade,

00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:21.672
while others favoured more autonomy for the different regions.

00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:31.392
So when Josep Broz returned ‘home’, he found that the country he had left was no more, and the

00:05:31.392 --> 00:05:39.502
country that had replaced it was a series of different factions, different groups, all with

00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:47.062
their own agenda and a different view of what would be in the best interests of their people.

00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:52.942
He also returned home a communist, and joined the Communist

00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:58.522
Party of Yugoslavia, the CPY, which was formed in 1919.

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:08.722
But despite the CPY’s increasing appeal in Yugoslavia, it was banned, it was outlawed,

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:17.032
in 1921, and Broz and his communist comrades continued to work underground, organising

00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:22.845
gatherings, spreading the communist message, and operating below the surface.

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:30.785
He ended up being arrested in 1928, after allegedly being found

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:36.525
with bomb-making equipment, and was thrown into prison for 5 years.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:44.505
When he was released, in 1933, it was time for a new Josep Broz.

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:51.225
He adopted the name ‘Tito’, which he was known by for the rest of his life.

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:56.995
He quickly rose through the ranks of the CPY, the Communist

00:06:57.005 --> 00:07:00.825
Party of Yugoslavia, which was still illegal at the time.

00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:06.845
His talent was noticed by the Comintern, the Russian organisation

00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:12.175
that promoted communism abroad and supported communist parties outside

00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:17.595
Russia - they saw that Broz could be a useful asset in Yugoslavia.

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:26.905
In August 1937, he became the acting General Secretary of the CPY, making him

00:07:27.065 --> 00:07:32.585
the most important member of the communist party in Yugoslavia, which was still

00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:38.745
illegal, remember, it didn’t become a legal party until after World War Two.

00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:45.885
Tito was given this position after his predecessor, the person who came

00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:53.325
before him, was purged, was killed by Stalin, and it has even been alleged

00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:58.955
that Tito may have had something to do with getting rid of his predecessor.

00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:04.665
Whether that’s true or not, it certainly was very convenient for Tito.

00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:08.525
But then World War Two broke out.

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:15.845
In 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis forces, mainly Germany

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:21.275
and Italy, but also supported by Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.

00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:27.355
With a weak army, and a weak state, Yugoslavia quickly crumbled.

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:36.465
When the Axis forces invaded, Tito went into full underground mode and became a partisan fighter.

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:42.985
There was a strong, partisan movement that was continuing to fight against the invaders.

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:49.355
And the interesting thing about this time was that the different partisan groups

00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:56.565
were using the chaos as a way to try to further their own aims and ambitions.

00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:03.555
Tito, as leader of the CPY, and supported by the Comintern, emerged

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:08.995
as the most successful of all of these Yugoslav partisan groups.

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:18.096
The main rival to Tito, and to the CPY, was something called the Chetniks, who were a Serbian group

00:09:18.386 --> 00:09:25.106
that had actually collaborated with their Nazi invaders, and were supporting the Serbian government.

00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:28.356
Their aim was for a

00:09:28.356 --> 00:09:30.856
return to the throne of the Serbian

00:09:30.906 --> 00:09:32.096
king, King Peter II.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:42.046
However, the Allies saw the superior organisation of Tito and the CPY, and

00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:47.516
said that it should be Tito’s troops who should attack the Axis forces.

00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:55.236
And in 1944, Tito’s army entered Belgrade and fought off the Nazis.

00:09:56.796 --> 00:10:04.746
Long story short, after the end of World War II, the CPY was in a position of power in Yugoslavia.

00:10:05.696 --> 00:10:10.426
It was seen not only to have successfully fought off the Nazis,

00:10:10.806 --> 00:10:15.666
but also to have done it independently, without the help of Moscow.

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:23.806
That put the CPY, and Tito, in a pretty strong bargaining position.

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:30.226
Unlike other communist countries in Europe, they didn’t owe Russia anything.

00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:38.686
Tito was elected prime minister of Yugoslavia in 1945 with an overwhelming majority.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:44.396
He was viewed as the man who had saved the country, and it

00:10:44.396 --> 00:10:48.416
was quite right that he should take his place as its leader.

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:56.443
The king was ousted, he was removed, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was declared.

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:03.803
Back in Moscow, Stalin was a little wary of Tito, and the

00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:07.863
independence that he evidently wanted to have for Yugoslavia.

00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:12.893
And from the end of the Second World War until his death

00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:18.863
in 1953, Stalin became more and more frustrated with Tito.

00:11:20.373 --> 00:11:22.833
Communist Russia was the ‘mothership’.

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:29.663
It supported lots of satellite countries, and was trying to spread communism all over the world.

00:11:30.803 --> 00:11:38.623
But these countries, perhaps with the exception of China, were subservient to Russia, they

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:45.803
followed Moscow’s orders, and when Stalin told them to do something, they generally did it.

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:50.113
Tito, and Yugoslavia, didn’t.

00:11:51.563 --> 00:11:57.333
Moscow wanted Yugoslavia to be integrated into the East European Communist bloc.

00:11:58.203 --> 00:11:58.803
Tito refused.

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:06.743
The Moscow way was for the central government to have complete control over people’s lives.

00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:12.873
In Yugoslavia, although it was still a communist country, Tito relaxed

00:12:12.903 --> 00:12:17.833
quite a lot of central controls, and allowed more regional control.

00:12:19.373 --> 00:12:27.373
Tito pursued independent foreign policy for Yugoslavia, courting Albania and Greece, while Moscow

00:12:27.403 --> 00:12:34.033
wanted to have complete control over all foreign relations conducted by every communist country

00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:39.713
Tito didn’t just annoy Stalin, he became a threat.

00:12:41.003 --> 00:12:48.333
If there was this one communist power that existed largely ignoring Moscow, this

00:12:48.483 --> 00:12:53.933
would be an example to the other communist powers that they could do it as well.

00:12:55.433 --> 00:12:59.043
And Joseph Stalin, as we all know, was not the sort

00:12:59.043 --> 00:13:02.093
of man that you wanted to get on the wrong side of.

00:13:03.203 --> 00:13:10.913
He murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people, and millions died as a result of his decisions.

00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:14.703
You can probably imagine what happened next.

00:13:16.223 --> 00:13:19.483
Stalin tried to get rid of Tito in various ways.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:25.473
He started just by criticising him and trying to purge him,

00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:30.833
hoping that his fellow communists in Yugoslavia would turn on him.

00:13:32.143 --> 00:13:33.173
That didn’t work.

00:13:34.123 --> 00:13:37.983
Tito still held control of the CPY, the Communist

00:13:37.993 --> 00:13:41.773
Party of Yugoslavia, as well as the military police

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:50.489
He then kicked the CPY out of Cominform, the European group of ruling communist parties.

00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:59.029
The idea was that by isolating Yugoslavia, he could push Tito out, and then replace

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:05.129
him with someone who was more friendly, and more willing to be obedient to Moscow.

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:07.999
That didn’t work either.

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:13.879
Tito was a communist, and Yugoslavia was a communist country, but

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:19.939
Tito had cleverly walked the line between Moscow and the West.

00:14:21.489 --> 00:14:27.229
Yugoslavia wasn’t completely cut off from the West, and so even when it was

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:34.029
sidelined and cut off by Moscow, it still had this lifeline to the West.

00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:39.929
Unlike the other European communist countries, Moscow wasn’t its

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:45.329
only hope, which gave it and Tito a lot more bargaining power.

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:51.784
Throughout this time, Stalin wasn't just criticising Tito and hoping the

00:14:51.784 --> 00:14:56.909
problem was going to go away, he was actively trying to assassinate him,

00:14:57.639 --> 00:15:04.499
and there were a reported 21 assassination attempts in total on Tito’s life.

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:09.199
This caused Tito to write in a letter to Stalin:

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:12.039
Stop sending people to kill me.

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:19.009
We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle.

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:26.789
If you don't stop sending killers, I'll send one to Moscow, and I won't have to send a second.

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:32.979
Stalin died in 1953, officially of a heart attack.

00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:38.229
Interestingly enough, there is a theory that it wasn’t a heart attack

00:15:38.469 --> 00:15:43.809
that killed him, and that Tito actually made good on his threat, and

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:49.259
Stalin was poisoned by the President of Yugoslavia, by Tito himself.

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:54.919
It does sound a little implausible, but having Stalin

00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:58.539
out of the way was certainly a relief for Tito.

00:15:59.979 --> 00:16:04.489
After Stalin’s death, there was hope of a reconciliation with Moscow,

00:16:05.169 --> 00:16:09.929
and for a while it did look like this was to be a possibility.

00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:18.779
However, Khrushchev, the man who took over from Stalin, proved to be not too much different

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:27.019
to his predecessor, and relations between Moscow and Yugoslavia never really blossomed again.

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:32.629
Instead of leaning towards Moscow, Tito formed alliances

00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:38.109
with other semi-neutral countries, such as Egypt and India.

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:46.089
The world was in a state of you’re either communist or you’re non-communist, and Tito, despite

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:53.139
being the leader of a communist country, managed to navigate this situation quite successfully.

00:16:54.655 --> 00:17:02.152
Tito was repeatedly re-elected President of Yugoslavia, and in 1963 the constitution

00:17:02.162 --> 00:17:08.672
was changed, and he was elected President for life, so he had an unlimited term.

00:17:10.132 --> 00:17:13.842
Compared to other communist countries in Europe, life

00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:17.332
for normal people in Yugoslavia was actually quite good.

00:17:18.232 --> 00:17:23.982
They enjoyed more freedoms, less fear of persecution and of being packed

00:17:24.022 --> 00:17:30.332
away on a train to a labour camp, and a standard of living that was better

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:34.802
than that of their contemporaries in other countries in the Soviet bloc.

00:17:36.352 --> 00:17:42.112
However, and there is always a however when it comes to a country’s leader who is elected

00:17:42.172 --> 00:17:48.582
President for life and rules for almost 40 years, his reign was not without its victims.

00:17:49.962 --> 00:17:53.462
Tito was most definitely an authoritarian.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:18:01.470
Yugoslavia was not a democracy, he had supreme control, there was a certain cult

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:08.360
of personality about him, and he was ruthless in punishing those who opposed him.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:17.370
Tens of thousands of political prisoners were sent to forced labour camps, the most famous of which

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:24.990
was an island called Goli Otok, or Barren Island, which is off the coast of modern-day Croatia.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.500
If you picture a Croatian island, you might think of beautiful

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.210
beaches, lovely blue sea, and people generally having a good time.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.730
Goli Otok was not like this.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:45.960
It had practically no vegetation, very strong winds, and contained a prison

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:51.460
where Tito would send his rivals, hundreds of whom died working there.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:59.280
So Tito was no angel, but he was considered the least bad of any of the

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.550
communist-era rulers in Europe, and was often courted by Western leaders,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:11.360
meeting everyone from Churchill to Willy Brandt, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:21.860
Tito died in 1980, aged 88, and dignitaries from 122 countries came to his funeral.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.570
When we look back on his legacy, though, it’s an interesting one to properly

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:35.800
evaluate, and historians are divided about what exactly he left behind.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.280
He had managed to keep the country of Yugoslavia alive, and

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.780
united for the duration of his rule, for almost 40 years.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.310
Yet 11 years after he died, the country collapsed, and

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:57.200
12 years after he died, it was plunged into civil war.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.880
Obviously now, Yugoslavia is 7 different countries.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.930
To recap, that’s Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.790
Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:18.110
One argument is that it took a leader like Tito to keep such a

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.750
fragmented nation together, and when he died, there was nobody who was

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.800
capable of picking up the mantle, and of doing what he was able to do.

00:20:29.693 --> 00:20:35.723
The other side is that Tito had almost 40 years to truly unite Yugoslavia,

00:20:36.063 --> 00:20:41.323
to bring its people together and create a true sense of unity in the country.

00:20:42.753 --> 00:20:49.553
He squandered it, he missed his chance, and he spent too long trying to do everything - trying

00:20:49.563 --> 00:20:56.353
to be communist but also friends with western countries, he knew that uniting the Serbs, the

00:20:56.353 --> 00:21:05.083
Croats, and the Slovenes was an impossible task, yet other than cracking down on dissent and

00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:11.823
enforcing his one view of a unified Yugoslavia, he didn’t really do much to fix the problem.

00:21:13.303 --> 00:21:16.763
The legacy of Tito is a complicated one, and not

00:21:16.773 --> 00:21:20.323
least because it is shared by 7 different countries.

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:28.203
It says a lot that in the 10 years after his death, so before the collapse of

00:21:28.233 --> 00:21:35.333
Yugoslavia, his mausoleum, where he is buried, had been visited by 14 million people.

00:21:36.843 --> 00:21:43.193
But on the 15th anniversary of his death, in 1995, the only people coming to

00:21:43.193 --> 00:21:49.253
pay their respects at his grave were a few family members and old communists.

00:21:50.783 --> 00:21:54.213
The name Tito means different things to different people.

00:21:55.183 --> 00:22:01.463
If you are from Serbia, you probably think differently about him than if you are from Croatia.

00:22:03.053 --> 00:22:09.323
What is undeniably true though is that he was a powerful force in post World War II

00:22:09.323 --> 00:22:16.433
Europe, and without him, the world we live in today may have looked quite different.

00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:23.293
OK then, that is it for Josep Broz, aka Tito.

00:22:23.797 --> 00:22:27.613
Whatever you think of him, he had a fascinating life, and a

00:22:27.613 --> 00:22:31.913
huge impact on that area of the world, and Europe more widely.

00:22:33.483 --> 00:22:36.203
As always, I would love to know what you thought of today's episode.

00:22:36.203 --> 00:22:43.213
We have quite a few listeners and members from a few of the countries that formed part

00:22:43.263 --> 00:22:48.733
of Yugoslavia, so I would especially love to know what you thought of today’s episode.

00:22:49.423 --> 00:22:50.903
What do you think of Tito?

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:54.963
How has this changed, if at all, over the years?

00:22:56.033 --> 00:23:00.593
And of course, even if you’re not from around there, I would still love to know what you think.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.080
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.090
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.490
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.590
about the cost of flying and the economics of air travel.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.450
Air travel is something that has gone from being a luxury available only to the richest in society

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.800
to something that, at least in most parts of the developed world, is available to everyone.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.120
This all happened over the space of less than 100 years.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.010
The first commercial flight happened in 1914.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.290
It cost today’s equivalent of thousands of dollars and less than a century

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.200
later it was possible to buy a ticket on an aeroplane for less than 5 euros.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.270
So, how did this all happen, when and why did flying become so cheap, and how

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.630
do airline companies actually make money, and how has this changed over time?

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.330
We have a lot to get through in today’s episode, so let’s get started right away.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.850
On December 17th of 1903, the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, of Dayton,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.530
Ohio, became the first people to ever successfully fly a powered aeroplane.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.340
It wasn’t fast - it only went at around 50km per hour - and it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.300
wasn’t long - it only lasted 12 seconds, but it did make history.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.390
The potential use of the aeroplane was immediately obvious.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.050
It means you can go anywhere without relying on a road or rail network.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.780
You can go over seas, mountains, across rivers.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.660
You can transport people, goods, letters, anything.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.940
Although commercial passenger flight got started in the 1920s, for

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.300
several decades it remained the preserve of only the richest in society.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.880
Put simply, flying was a luxury.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.600
The experience itself was a luxury, but the service on board was also premium.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.430
Passengers would have received equivalent service to what you might

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.680
get in a fancy restaurant, with drinks and food being served to you.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.310
It wouldn’t have been particularly comfortable, given that the planes

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.190
travelled at a much lower altitude and therefore there would have been a lot

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.310
more turbulence, the plane would have moved up and down a lot, but perhaps

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.260
the freely available alcohol would have helped the passengers manage this.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.760
As technology advanced, aeroplanes became larger and more comfortable,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.220
flight distances were increased, and as we get to the 1940s and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.930
1950s it became the real heyday of glamorous commercial flying.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.440
It was the era of Pan Am, the “golden age of flight”.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.980
It was still expensive, and flights were rarely full.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.170
Passengers were a mix of individual and business travellers.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.500
There were only two classes of ticket: tourist class and business class.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.990
Tourist class, as you might expect, was slightly cheaper.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.180
But there was no difference in experience once you were on the plane.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.750
The difference was about how flexible the tickets were.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.120
Tourist class tickets weren’t flexible at all.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.890
They were for a fixed date in the future.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.500
If you’re going on holiday, you normally choose a date, and it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.450
doesn’t tend to change, so tourists don’t really need flexibility.

00:04:10.212 --> 00:04:14.082
Business class tickets, on the other hand, were more flexible.

00:04:14.432 --> 00:04:19.562
You could simply arrive at the airport at the last minute and book a ticket, or

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:24.372
you could book a ticket that could be used on different flights, both of which

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:29.392
were useful for business travellers who might be called to a last-minute meeting.

00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:36.582
Airlines realised that they could charge more for this, and given that it was the company paying,

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:42.832
not the individual, the individual passenger wouldn’t care so much about the price being higher.

00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:49.412
The airline industry was also a highly regulated industry, especially in the

00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:55.502
US, because flight was considered to be a public good, similar to the railways.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:05:01.672
This meant that routes, fares, and schedules were all regulated by the government.

00:05:02.222 --> 00:05:05.852
If an airline wanted to add a new route or change its

00:05:05.962 --> 00:05:09.702
price, it would have to seek official approval to do so.

00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:16.392
This worked fine for the existing airlines, because their profits were virtually

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:22.202
guaranteed–if you wanted to fly on certain routes, you didn’t have many options and

00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:28.622
you just had to pay whatever the price was–but it meant that it was very hard for any

00:05:28.622 --> 00:05:35.742
new routes to be added, new airlines to be created, or for real improvements to happen.

00:05:36.982 --> 00:05:41.922
In the late 1970s this all changed, for a few reasons.

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:48.332
First off, an initiative was led by an economics professor named Alfred E.

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:54.142
Kahn, who would later be given the nickname “The Father of Airline Deregulation”.

00:05:55.052 --> 00:06:01.842
He changed the legislation to do away with, to get rid of most of this regulation

00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:07.302
that he felt was stifling competition, that was getting in the way of competition.

00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:16.262
The result was that all of a sudden airlines could do what they wanted, within reason of course.

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:22.072
They could open up new routes without government approval, they could change their prices,

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:27.822
they could do whatever they wanted in order to attract customers and maximise profits.

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:32.932
It also meant that it was far easier for new airlines to enter

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:37.192
the market, offering new routes, new prices, and new services.

00:06:38.342 --> 00:06:42.392
As any good student of economics knows, when there is an increase

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:47.442
in competition this typically results in lower prices for consumers.

00:06:48.272 --> 00:06:51.612
Deregulation meant that it was possible to find much

00:06:51.622 --> 00:06:55.222
cheaper tickets, especially for international routes.

00:06:55.792 --> 00:07:05.202
For example, a return flight from London to New York in 1970 cost the equivalent of almost €3,000.

00:07:05.742 --> 00:07:11.732
Today you can find tickets for around €300, about 10% of the cost.

00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:17.312
The second development was the arrival of the 747 aeroplane.

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:22.982
It was simply a much bigger plane, taking up to 500 passengers.

00:07:23.882 --> 00:07:28.722
This meant that airlines could experiment with different seating classes,

00:07:28.932 --> 00:07:34.362
and they started adding more expensive seat types with more space, reclining

00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:40.352
seats, the seats that go back, and some even a lounge area with a piano!

00:07:41.702 --> 00:07:46.502
Airlines did invest into differentiating their ticket types, changing

00:07:46.502 --> 00:07:50.702
their aeroplanes to allow for first and business class areas.

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:57.522
Although business and first class were the most profitable category of seats, as we’ll come

00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:03.362
to discuss in a minute, several airline history experts have suggested that the airlines

00:08:03.552 --> 00:08:09.573
didn’t fully commit to turning their new aeroplanes into first and business class paradises

00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:16.362
because they thought something else was coming, a new technological invention: Concorde.

00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:22.882
As a reminder, Concorde was a supersonic plane, a plane that could

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:27.642
travel at over twice the speed of sound, meaning it could travel from

00:08:27.642 --> 00:08:33.642
London to New York in 3.5 hours, half what normal planes would do it in.

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:39.372
The airlines thought that Concorde would become the new version of

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:43.782
first class, that passengers who were currently travelling in First

00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:48.802
Class on a normal plane would soon switch to travelling in a Concorde.

00:08:49.722 --> 00:08:54.992
After all, the cost of a Concorde ticket could be less than the cost of a first class

00:08:54.992 --> 00:09:00.802
ticket on a normal flight, and if money were no object wouldn’t you rather get to your

00:09:00.802 --> 00:09:06.262
destination twice as fast than have a couple of extra glasses of champagne in the air?

00:09:07.202 --> 00:09:08.282
I know I certainly would.

00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:15.522
As we know, Concorde didn’t work out, and this caused these legacy airlines to

00:09:15.732 --> 00:09:20.942
rethink their premium offerings completely, as we’ll come to discuss in a minute.

00:09:21.912 --> 00:09:28.682
Another factor that disrupted the legacy airline carriers was the arrival of private jets.

00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:35.852
In fact, in the US at least private jets had really been in existence since after the

00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:42.362
Second World War, as military pilots and large amounts of fighter planes returned back home.

00:09:43.512 --> 00:09:50.042
Former military pilots would offer to fly these planes privately, and it was an alternative

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:56.692
to travelling on a commercial flight, especially going to and from less popular destinations.

00:09:57.832 --> 00:10:04.202
In the early days, these weren’t particularly comfortable but in the 1960s private

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:10.582
jet companies realised that they could cater for a time-poor and cash-rich traveller.

00:10:11.462 --> 00:10:16.092
If you didn’t want to go through a normal airport, and you wanted to be

00:10:16.102 --> 00:10:21.612
able to go anywhere at any time of day, well, a private jet was an option.

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:26.962
Many large businesses bought their own jets, and companies

00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:30.562
sprung up that would offer seats on private jets.

00:10:31.582 --> 00:10:36.692
The growth of the private jet industry put a limit on how much a

00:10:36.742 --> 00:10:40.972
commercial airline could charge for its business and first class tickets.

00:10:41.562 --> 00:10:45.182
If it was too much then it wouldn’t be competitive

00:10:45.362 --> 00:10:49.692
against the option of hiring or even buying a private jet.

00:10:50.522 --> 00:10:58.452
Now, moving on to a very different type of passenger, the 1970s and 1980s also

00:10:58.452 --> 00:11:04.962
saw the arrival of the so-called “low cost airlines”, starting with SouthWest in

00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:10.762
the United States and followed by companies such as Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:18.502
after EU deregulation in 1992, as well as others such as AirAsia in southeast Asia.

00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:25.942
These companies realised that what people really wanted from a flight was to get from one place

00:11:26.022 --> 00:11:33.212
to another, and the extra cost that came from providing things like free drinks, being able

00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:40.762
to choose your seat, free bags, and so on, the cost of all of this outweighed the value of it.

00:11:41.852 --> 00:11:47.312
In other words, people would rather pay less for their ticket and have a more basic

00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:54.372
experience than pay more and have included baggage, check-in, on-board drinks and so on.

00:11:55.352 --> 00:12:01.112
So, these low-cost carriers looked at all of the costs that went into transporting

00:12:01.122 --> 00:12:06.662
someone from A to B and gradually stopped including them in the cost of the ticket.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:13.452
In terms of things that a customer would see, as I’m sure you know, with Ryanair for

00:12:13.452 --> 00:12:19.942
example you have to pay extra to take luggage, to choose your seat, for any food or drink on

00:12:19.942 --> 00:12:26.352
board, to print your boarding pass, even to get an SMS confirmation of your flight details.

00:12:26.972 --> 00:12:32.072
The CEO of Ryanair has even publicly joked about charging

00:12:32.112 --> 00:12:34.962
passengers to use the toilets onboard the aeroplane.

00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:40.112
And in terms of things that we, customers, don’t see,

00:12:40.372 --> 00:12:44.542
Ryanair’s behind the scenes cost-cutting is extensive.

00:12:45.122 --> 00:12:51.772
It only buys one type of plane, the Boeing 737-800, and it buys this

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:56.232
plane in large quantities, which leads to discounts on the price.

00:12:56.852 --> 00:13:03.592
It means the planes can be customised to be very basic so they rarely need to be repaired,

00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:09.222
and it means staff don’t need to be trained on how to operate different types of plane.

00:13:10.142 --> 00:13:16.382
Ryanair and all of these other budget air carriers, these low cost air carriers also

00:13:16.572 --> 00:13:23.042
negotiate hard with airports for favourable prices to land and take-off, essentially

00:13:23.222 --> 00:13:28.002
telling an airport that they will bring millions of passengers through the doors,

00:13:28.112 --> 00:13:33.072
all of whom will spend money in the airport and create jobs in the local area.

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:39.332
Anyone who has taken a Ryanair flight and arrived at “London” Luton or the

00:13:39.642 --> 00:13:45.082
Paris “Vatry” airport will have found out the hard way that the airline also

00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:50.372
saves money by using airports that are generally further away from the city.

00:13:51.002 --> 00:13:57.222
From Paris Vatry airport it takes a similar time to drive to the centre of Paris

00:13:57.322 --> 00:14:02.692
as it would take you to drive to the Belgian, Luxembourg and even German border!

00:14:03.722 --> 00:14:10.382
There are all sorts of other reasons that low-cost airlines cut costs that we, as consumers,

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:17.702
are often unaware of: they often hire staff on short term contracts, meaning their employment

00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:23.682
costs are lower, they don’t do transit flights, so they don’t need infrastructure on the

00:14:23.682 --> 00:14:29.242
ground, they turn around their planes more quickly, so they aren’t sitting on the tarmac

00:14:29.262 --> 00:14:35.312
doing nothing, they have much fewer staff to every passenger, and they are better at selling

00:14:35.312 --> 00:14:41.212
their tickets directly to consumers, so they don’t have to pay agency fees or commissions.

00:14:42.242 --> 00:14:47.022
Now, that is a very brief summary of how we have got to where we are

00:14:47.022 --> 00:14:52.652
today, but now let’s delve into the actual numbers of how airlines work.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:58.662
The easiest way to think about this is by splitting airlines into two

00:14:58.712 --> 00:15:04.392
categories: the legacy carriers, which are the older, more established airlines,

00:15:04.442 --> 00:15:09.372
which normally offer higher levels of service and more expensive tickets.

00:15:09.932 --> 00:15:17.082
By this I mean carriers such as British Airways, Air France, Iberia, KLM, and so on.

00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:22.852
And the low-cost carriers, companies that offer what’s called “no

00:15:22.892 --> 00:15:27.382
frills”, cheap tickets with nothing extra included in the price.

00:15:28.363 --> 00:15:32.603
Companies like Ryanair, EasyJet, Norwegian Air, and so on.

00:15:33.443 --> 00:15:36.153
So, firstly, the legacy carriers.

00:15:36.743 --> 00:15:42.073
The interesting point to note here is that many of these carriers still offer

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:48.853
the luxury options of the 1950s and 60s, and really it is exactly the same type

00:15:49.103 --> 00:15:53.963
of people who are buying the luxury, premium, tickets as those who travelled

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:59.993
in the “normal”, or tourist or business, class tickets of 50 or 60 years ago.

00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:07.063
The only addition is of an “economy” class, of the type of person like

00:16:07.113 --> 00:16:12.433
me and perhaps like you who is prepared to save money on the cost of

00:16:12.433 --> 00:16:16.343
their flight by opting for a slightly less comfortable experience.

00:16:17.783 --> 00:16:24.163
So, the legacy carriers, companies such as British Airways, are split into sometimes

00:16:24.353 --> 00:16:31.343
up to 4 different classes on a plane: Economy, Premium Economy, Business and First.

00:16:32.453 --> 00:16:35.773
Where it gets really interesting is what this actually

00:16:35.773 --> 00:16:39.433
means in terms of where the airlines make money.

00:16:40.853 --> 00:16:45.753
Despite the majority of passengers on an airline travelling in economy

00:16:45.753 --> 00:16:51.593
class, on the cheapest ticket, these passengers typically represent

00:16:51.633 --> 00:16:57.033
a minority of the revenue, less than 50% of the cost of the tickets.

00:16:58.003 --> 00:17:04.763
Airlines don’t often release the breakdowns of where all of their revenue comes from, but some

00:17:04.803 --> 00:17:12.813
estimates have up to two-thirds of the money a legacy airline makes coming from the premium tickets.

00:17:13.723 --> 00:17:19.723
Tickets for business and first class can be ten times more expensive than economy, and

00:17:19.953 --> 00:17:26.383
in the case of long-haul flights this can be thousands if not tens of thousands of Euros.

00:17:27.003 --> 00:17:34.143
The cost to deliver that premium service might be a few hundred Euros more, so it’s with these

00:17:34.273 --> 00:17:40.703
premium ticket offerings that these legacy carriers can really make their money, make their profits.

00:17:41.463 --> 00:17:44.873
If you’re interested in this, there’s an amazing video

00:17:44.873 --> 00:17:47.973
on YouTube called “The Economics of Airline Class”.

00:17:48.743 --> 00:17:54.763
Now, let’s move onto the low-cost carriers, because the way they operate is very different.

00:17:55.263 --> 00:17:59.106
And just because their tickets might be cheap, it certainly

00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:02.606
doesn’t mean that they aren’t able to be incredibly profitable.

00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:07.656
Ryanair, for example, is one of the most profitable airlines in

00:18:07.656 --> 00:18:11.516
the world, despite selling tickets that are alarmingly cheap.

00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:17.896
Well, as anyone who has flown Ryanair before, they might look alarmingly cheap

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:23.556
before you actually buy them, but if you want to do anything more than travel from

00:18:23.626 --> 00:18:30.856
A to B, such as sit next to your friend or take a bag, the costs start to rack up.

00:18:32.016 --> 00:18:38.616
Indeed, Ryanair makes an average of just under €15 per passenger on these extra charges,

00:18:38.656 --> 00:18:45.376
which is around 7 million Euros a day, and makes up around 35% of its total revenue.

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:52.166
And a lot of this is pure profit - it costs fractions of a penny to

00:18:52.356 --> 00:18:58.326
send a text message, for example, and a passenger pays €3 to receive it.

00:18:59.776 --> 00:19:05.046
Combined with cutting costs on planes, training, and staff, this has meant that

00:19:05.046 --> 00:19:10.826
Ryanair is an incredibly profitable organisation, despite selling cut-price tickets.

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:15.526
Now, let’s take a minute to reflect on the lie of

00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:19.076
the land today, and what we might see in the future.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:24.416
In the one corner there are the legacy carriers which cater to

00:19:24.526 --> 00:19:28.066
both the premium traveller and the cost-conscious traveller.

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:33.436
For a hefty fee, for a lot of money, you can travel in luxury,

00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:37.966
and for a more reasonable price you can simply get from A to B.

00:19:38.816 --> 00:19:43.506
The premium travellers might make up the lion’s share of the profits,

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:48.666
but there is a cap on how much airlines can charge for this, given that

00:19:48.706 --> 00:19:53.544
another option for the wealthiest of travellers is to go by private jet.

00:19:54.546 --> 00:20:00.976
In the other corner there are the low-cost carriers, companies that cater for people who simply want

00:20:00.986 --> 00:20:08.206
to go from A to B and will choose the cheapest option, people for whom flying is simply a commodity.

00:20:09.236 --> 00:20:15.436
These low-cost carriers have opened up flying to the average person, and made international

00:20:15.626 --> 00:20:21.256
and long-distance travel an option that simply was too expensive 50 years ago.

00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:27.886
We’ll touch on some of the problems that have come with this in a minute, but low-cost

00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:34.536
flight has been a great equaliser in terms of who is able to travel - it is no longer

00:20:34.536 --> 00:20:40.466
the preserve of the rich; anyone can fly, at least anyone in the developed world.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:46.766
The one thing that unites the legacy carriers and the low cost carriers is that they

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:52.246
have become incredibly efficient at making as much money from each flight as possible.

00:20:53.016 --> 00:20:56.266
Their approach to this is, of course, vastly different.

00:20:56.746 --> 00:21:01.916
For low-cost carriers like Ryanair, they simply want to get as many people onto

00:21:01.916 --> 00:21:07.846
the plane as possible, which is why you can find tickets for even 5 or 10 Euros.

00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:12.676
It knows exactly how much it can charge on each route at each

00:21:12.676 --> 00:21:17.676
time, so it has become incredibly efficient at filling its planes.

00:21:18.926 --> 00:21:24.791
That’s why, by the way, it can claim to be “environmentally friendly”, because on a per

00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:31.706
person basis Ryanair flights typically burn less fuel than most other airline carriers.

00:21:32.936 --> 00:21:37.366
Now, when it comes to the legacy carriers, they aren’t always so

00:21:37.406 --> 00:21:42.496
concerned about filling every seat, especially the most expensive ones.

00:21:42.956 --> 00:21:48.076
Historically they would sell very few First class tickets, and instead would

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:53.926
upgrade loyal travellers from Business class to First class, thus making them

00:21:53.926 --> 00:21:58.846
more loyal and likely to book again, especially if their company was paying.

00:21:59.816 --> 00:22:05.406
Most airlines have got better at selling their more expensive tickets, knowing what is the

00:22:05.406 --> 00:22:11.456
most that they can charge for a ticket before it becomes uncompetitive, but still keeping them

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:17.738
priced sufficiently high that they are aspirational, and that people want to continue to fly

00:22:17.738 --> 00:22:24.578
with that airline to collect loyalty points and hopefully, one day, be upgraded to first class.

00:22:25.408 --> 00:22:29.378
Of course, both legacy and low-cost carriers alike were

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:34.468
blindsided, they were hit hard by COVID, as flights were grounded.

00:22:34.718 --> 00:22:40.089
People simply couldn’t travel, and airlines had to look to the government for bailouts.

00:22:40.688 --> 00:22:46.808
While analysts suggest that the low-cost operators will recover more quickly, given that

00:22:46.818 --> 00:22:52.578
they have a more healthy cost structure and they are less reliant on business travellers,

00:22:52.768 --> 00:22:58.918
the future isn’t bright for many of the legacy carriers, and many have already gone bankrupt.

00:22:59.738 --> 00:23:04.288
They rely heavily on business travellers, their most profitable customer

00:23:04.298 --> 00:23:09.328
segment, and COVID has shown that a lot of business travel was simply

00:23:09.548 --> 00:23:14.798
unnecessary, or not nearly as necessary as people had believed it to be.

00:23:15.988 --> 00:23:21.308
There are serious question marks about if at all the business travel segment will

00:23:21.438 --> 00:23:27.368
recover to pre-COVID levels, as people have realised that they can save a lot of time

00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:33.053
and money by simply having a virtual meeting rather than jumping on an aeroplane.

00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:38.168
Now, it would be negligent to not mention some of the negative

00:23:38.198 --> 00:23:42.108
consequences that have come from the mass availability of commercial

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:46.898
flight, the greatest of which is of course its impact on global warming.

00:23:47.698 --> 00:23:52.678
Approximately 2.4% of all global emissions come from aeroplanes.

00:23:53.818 --> 00:23:58.248
Although this might sound like a small amount, flying frequently is one

00:23:58.248 --> 00:24:02.748
of the individual largest contributors to someone’s carbon footprint.

00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:11.838
A return flight from London to San Francisco on economy is responsible for 5.5 tonnes of CO2.

00:24:12.348 --> 00:24:16.638
That's more than twice the emissions produced by driving a petrol-powered

00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:21.738
car every year, you would save an equivalent amount of CO2 by recycling

00:24:21.888 --> 00:24:27.348
for 25 years or switching to a meat-free diet for almost 7 years.

00:24:28.588 --> 00:24:34.708
You might be thinking - surely if the emissions are so large, is it really only 2.4%?

00:24:35.468 --> 00:24:39.878
Well, yes it is, and this is because it’s estimated that less

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:44.398
than 20% of the world’s population has ever been on an aeroplane.

00:24:45.803 --> 00:24:51.338
And talking specifically in terms of the cost of flying and the economics of

00:24:51.348 --> 00:24:56.968
air travel, the worrying factor is that the most profitable customers, those

00:24:56.968 --> 00:25:01.868
travelling in First and Business class, are the largest emitters of CO2.

00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:10.618
Because the seats, and often even full beds, in First and Business class can take up to 7 times

00:25:10.638 --> 00:25:16.868
as much space as those in Economy, the carbon footprint of those tickets is seven times more.

00:25:17.858 --> 00:25:23.648
To help you visualise this, with our example of the return flight from London to

00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:29.478
San Francisco, the carbon footprint of that one flight in First Class would be

00:25:29.478 --> 00:25:35.418
the same as what you would save by eating a meat-free diet for almost 50 years!

00:25:36.678 --> 00:25:39.348
So, what’s next for air travel?

00:25:39.568 --> 00:25:44.148
Obviously that is the billion, or probably even trillion dollar question.

00:25:44.788 --> 00:25:50.488
While there have been significant improvements in fuel efficiency, the reality is that

00:25:50.488 --> 00:25:57.038
we power aeroplanes in a similar way to how we always have - with large amounts of fossil

00:25:57.038 --> 00:26:02.018
fuels - and that doesn’t look like it is going to change that much in the near future.

00:26:02.958 --> 00:26:06.308
And the airlines have two main ways of making money.

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:13.498
Either they offer premium service to high-paying customers, meaning the aeroplanes are relatively

00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:20.698
empty, or they fill their aeroplanes with as many people as possible, enticing passengers with

00:26:20.888 --> 00:26:27.358
low ticket prices, so that more and more people decide to take planes as a mode of transportation.

00:26:28.008 --> 00:26:30.578
Neither of which bodes well for the planet.

00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:36.408
There are all sorts of political and economic options that have been proposed,

00:26:36.548 --> 00:26:41.748
such as increased taxes on tickets that would go towards green initiatives,

00:26:41.978 --> 00:26:47.163
but if that happens then the cost of flying will go up, meaning a retreat to

00:26:47.163 --> 00:26:51.853
the days where it was a luxury that only the richest in society could afford.

00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:57.603
Perhaps this is the price that is needed to be paid for a sustainable future,

00:26:57.933 --> 00:27:02.533
but it would cause huge disruption to the travel and tourism industries

00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:06.783
that have grown dependent on flying being something available to all.

00:27:08.053 --> 00:27:12.608
For the time being at least, there seems to be little that will stop the growth

00:27:12.883 --> 00:27:18.633
of air travel, and for as long as tickets are cheap and exotic new destinations

00:27:18.773 --> 00:27:23.443
are only a short trip away, then there is not much that will stop passengers

00:27:23.443 --> 00:27:27.813
from travelling, and the airline companies making a lot of money in the process.

00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:37.163
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the cost of flying and how airlines make their money.

00:27:37.663 --> 00:27:42.583
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and whether you are a

00:27:42.593 --> 00:27:49.153
frequent flier, either on one of the legacy carriers or on a low-cost carrier, or you’ve never been

00:27:49.153 --> 00:27:54.913
on an aeroplane in your life then it’s made you think about air travel in a slightly different way.

00:27:56.253 --> 00:27:59.543
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:27:59.893 --> 00:28:03.203
What do you think the future holds for the airline industry?

00:28:03.773 --> 00:28:09.660
Were you surprised by how much money airline companies make from their first class tickets?

00:28:09.889 --> 00:28:16.343
If you have flown on Ryanair or one of the other low-cost airlines, do you love or loathe them?

00:28:17.123 --> 00:28:20.513
I would love to know, so let’s get the discussion started.

00:28:20.683 --> 00:28:25.893

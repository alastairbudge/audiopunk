Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:17.396
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:22.246
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:27.666
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The

00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:32.306
Age of Enlightenment, otherwise known as just The Enlightenment.

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:38.486
It was the intellectual movement that involved philosophers, mathematicians,

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:44.966
scientists, economists, and thinkers of all kinds, and had a profound impact

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:51.076
on politics, philosophy, business, science and our society as a whole.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.686
You might have thought that a show called English Learning for Curious Minds,

00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:01.556
which has a mission of helping you expand your knowledge, might have chosen

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:07.636
to do an episode on The Enlightenment much earlier than episode number 149.

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:13.726
You might be right, but I think that now is the perfect time, for two reasons.

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:21.606
Firstly, there are many principles of The Enlightenment that are being particularly challenged all

00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:28.716
over the world, and so it’s a useful time to think about where these principles actually came from.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:36.036
And secondly, perhaps more importantly, the next episodes will be a mini series

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:42.526
on The Age of Revolution, where we’ll cover The Industrial, American, and French

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:47.716
Revolutions, all three of which were deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking.

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:54.963
It is a huge subject, and a fascinating one, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:56.823 --> 00:02:00.733
Now, the tricky thing about The Enlightenment is that

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:04.583
there isn’t a specific start and end date for it.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:10.273
No people’s uprising, no war, no one single event.

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:17.293
Some people date the start of The Enlightenment back to 1637, which

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:22.353
was when Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am” philosophy was first

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:27.453
published, while for others it doesn’t start for another 100 years.

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:33.603
And in terms of when it ends, that’s perhaps an even harder question.

00:02:34.393 --> 00:02:41.903
In France, most historians date the end of the Enlightenment to 1789, the start

00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:48.093
of The French Revolution, but others would say it continued into the 19th century.

00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:52.673
For the purposes of today’s episode, it doesn’t really matter.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:58.073
The important thing to underline is that before The Enlightenment,

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:03.563
in Europe the way the world worked was explained through religion.

00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:09.023
God had created the world, kings and queens ruled countries on

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:14.923
his behalf, and society was structured in a very hierarchical way.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:17.943
Access to knowledge was difficult.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:24.993
And that knowledge was often incomplete, or wrong, it wasn’t based on reason.

00:03:25.853 --> 00:03:28.753
The Enlightenment questioned all of this.

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.713
If there’s one word that we should probably associate with The

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:40.793
Enlightenment, it’s not gravity, or humanity, or equality, it’s…..why.

00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:43.243
Yes, the word “why”.

00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:50.803
The Enlightenment was all about questioning the reason why certain things were the way they were.

00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:53.193
Why do things happen?

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:57.903
What would be a better explanation for it, or a better way of

00:03:57.943 --> 00:04:02.503
doing things, a better way of structuring the society we live in?

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:10.023
A great example both of the conventional way of thinking and about how Enlightenment

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:17.933
thought changed this came after a terrible earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1755.

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:23.233
It struck on All Saints Day, an important Christian holiday,

00:04:23.473 --> 00:04:28.313
and is thought to have killed between 30 and 50 thousand people.

00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:36.423
It was a tragedy, and as humans do in these circumstances, people looked for explanations.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:43.243
For some people, it was a sign that God was unhappy, he had sent this disaster

00:04:43.493 --> 00:04:48.553
down to show that people were not behaving in the way he wanted them to.

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:56.383
For others, who had started to be influenced by Enlightenment ideas, they asked “why”?

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:03.063
Why would a God punish an entire city, and surely if this was his idea,

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:07.743
he would have spared, he would have saved, all of the good Christians.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:14.013
As it happened, many churches were destroyed, worshippers killed,

00:05:14.423 --> 00:05:19.433
while some brothels, places where prostitutes work, were saved.

00:05:20.323 --> 00:05:26.043
This didn’t seem to make a huge amount of sense, it didn’t stand up to reason.

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:32.263
And if why is the word that one must first associate with

00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:37.393
The Enlightenment, it has an equally important twin, reason.

00:05:38.513 --> 00:05:42.883
One of the main principles of the Enlightenment was a belief

00:05:42.923 --> 00:05:47.123
that reason is sovereign, it is the most important thing.

00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:53.353
We shouldn’t believe something just because someone else has told us that it is true,

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:59.973
or it is conventional wisdom, we need to see it for ourselves, and to understand it.

00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:04.763
These ideas were developed by two early writers.

00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:09.993
First, René Descartes, the French-born philosopher, known for

00:06:09.993 --> 00:06:15.033
the phrase “Cogito, ergo sum” or “I think, therefore I am”.

00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:21.583
And secondly, the English civil servant and philosopher, Francis Bacon who

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:27.773
is widely credited with introducing a scientific method of enquiry; in other

00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:34.583
words you discover what works best through a meticulous and thorough process of

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:41.613
experimentation – recording evidence and making judgements on the basis of that evidence.

00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:47.653
The fancy and technical term for this movement is Empiricism.

00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:56.243
The other founding father of the Enlightenment for many people is another Englishman, John Locke.

00:06:57.193 --> 00:07:04.203
His main area of interest was in government and the rules by which societies were ruled.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.920
Locke set out the principle that everyone has the right to “life, liberty and property“.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:19.910
All of these three were writing in the late 17th century, either before the Enlightenment began,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.720
or right at the start of the Enlightenment, depending on when exactly you believe it started.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.920
So, the writings and influence of such men as Descartes, Bacon and Locke were

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:40.500
instrumental in causing others to think expansively about almost everything in society.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:49.170
An obvious target for this was the power of monarchs, of kings and queens, and of the Church.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:57.290
If every person had the right to life, liberty, and property, having all-powerful

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:03.860
kings, queens and nobility, while the poor suffered terribly didn’t seem very fair.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.070
It didn't seem very just.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.560
Why should this be the case?

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:16.860
These sorts of ideas were discussed by scientists, writers, philosophers, and engineers

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:23.290
all over Europe, and there was a huge growth in something called learned societies,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:29.510
where these people would come together to share ideas and question the status quo.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:36.050
An interesting way of exploring these ideas is by telling the stories of some of

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.900
the major contributors to the main part of the Enlightenment and focusing on the

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:47.790
four countries I mentioned at the start: Scotland, England, France and Italy.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.420
Although Scotland was only formally joined with England, Wales and Ireland to make the

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:02.130
United Kingdom in 1707, the strength of its own Enlightenment thinkers, based in Edinburgh

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.850
and Glasgow, means that the Scottish Enlightenment deserves to have its own story told.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.110
One of the two most influential people here is a philosopher

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:18.850
called David Hume, who wrote from the 1730s to the 1760s.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.252
He invites me to introduce the central Enlightenment quality - scepticism.

00:09:27.012 --> 00:09:31.620
Scepticism is best defined as an attitude through

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.790
which you doubt whether something is true or useful.

00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:43.198
Now when we say someone is a sceptic, it often has a slightly negative connotation,

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:50.708
but in the case of Hume it was a vitally important characteristic; it meant that you

00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:57.438
actually thought critically about what you read or heard, you didn’t just take it as true.

00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:05.448
Alongside Hume stood the best known of the British Enlightenment thinkers, a Scotsman you will

00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:13.128
probably have heard of and someone who is often described as the Father of Capitalism: Adam Smith.

00:10:14.538 --> 00:10:20.508
Smith‘s lengthy and profoundly influential book, “The Wealth of Nations”,

00:10:20.818 --> 00:10:25.828
challenged the conventional thought of the day, which said that the amount of

00:10:25.828 --> 00:10:32.608
wealth in the world was finite, there was a defined amount of it, and therefore

00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:37.918
encouraged nations to protect their trade and economies from other countries.

00:10:38.618 --> 00:10:44.838
Smith's big idea was that there was an “invisible hand” which operated

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:50.398
and that through what he called enlightened self-interest and trade

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:54.748
within societies and between nations, everyone’s lives could improve.

00:10:55.858 --> 00:10:59.368
Smith writes in a very effective and vivid way.

00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:02.468
Here is perhaps his best known quotation:

00:11:03.438 --> 00:11:08.688
“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker

00:11:09.088 --> 00:11:14.718
that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.”

00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:21.488
So, just to explain that, Smith is saying that the people who provide our food

00:11:21.878 --> 00:11:27.138
do not do so because they are kind, but rather because it is in their advantage.

00:11:28.158 --> 00:11:33.418
And of course, he isn’t talking just about food, but about the economy as a whole.

00:11:34.188 --> 00:11:41.378
And his theory was that if society was structured in this way, then everyone’s lives would improve.

00:11:41.948 --> 00:11:48.968
This is really the heart of modern day capitalism, it’s the society that most of us live in today.

00:11:50.038 --> 00:11:54.998
Now let us leave Scotland and travel south to England, where the

00:11:55.008 --> 00:12:00.228
giant of Enlightenment thinking was the great scientist, Isaac Newton.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:06.538
Legend has it that Newton was sitting under a tree and an apple fell on

00:12:06.538 --> 00:12:10.958
his head, and it was from there that he came up with the idea for gravity.

00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:14.617
This is, of course, a great oversimplification.

00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:21.758
Newton was not only a pioneering scientist who set out the basis for much of today’s

00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:27.898
science but he also showed how you could use scientific techniques to solve problems.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:33.238
He demonstrated how, although Nature may be a puzzle, it can be

00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:38.108
hard to understand, we could, through scientific methods, gradually

00:12:38.398 --> 00:12:42.988
work it out and learn how better to control it for our own benefit.

00:12:44.038 --> 00:12:45.908
So, that was Isaac Newton.

00:12:46.968 --> 00:12:52.898
The third country we will visit on our journey is France where the giants of this

00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:58.898
movement were Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, or as he is called in English, Rousseau.

00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:03.858
Voltaire was arguably the most influential philosopher

00:13:04.098 --> 00:13:07.738
of the 18th century and certainly the most famous.

00:13:08.658 --> 00:13:15.298
Perhaps his most important achievements were to champion freedom of speech, to challenge the

00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:22.628
prevailing power of religion and in particular to support the separation of church and state.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:31.308
His most famous work that sets out a lot of this philosophy is his short book Candide, or Optimism.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:37.678
His ideas were pretty radical at the time, and throughout his life he

00:13:37.678 --> 00:13:43.368
was in conflict with the authorities of France, being imprisoned twice

00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:48.818
and also exiled or banished for two years, when he went to England.

00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:54.838
When he was in England he saw what he considered to be the success

00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:59.938
of a constitutional government, and this was very influential in his

00:13:59.948 --> 00:14:05.588
subsequent criticisms of the absolute power of the French King Louis XV.

00:14:06.808 --> 00:14:11.868
We can see, through a look at the life of Voltaire, how closely linked a lot

00:14:11.898 --> 00:14:16.498
of these Enlightenment thinkers were, and how much they collaborated with each

00:14:16.498 --> 00:14:21.608
other with the shared goal of increasing human knowledge and understanding.

00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:27.308
Voltaire’s great hero was Isaac Newton, and indeed when Voltaire

00:14:27.318 --> 00:14:31.468
was sent to England he was there at Isaac Newton’s funeral.

00:14:32.198 --> 00:14:37.988
Back in France, at his estate on the Swiss border, he entertained other Enlightenment

00:14:37.998 --> 00:14:43.008
thinkers such as Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States,

00:14:43.268 --> 00:14:48.718
and Adam Smith, the Scottish philosopher and economist we heard about a few minutes ago.

00:14:49.518 --> 00:14:53.638
And the other French master of the Enlightenment to mention was Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

00:14:54.834 --> 00:15:00.598
Rousseau likewise challenged the status quo, and put forward the radical

00:15:00.908 --> 00:15:06.708
and dangerous idea – even heretical idea – that human beings are born

00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:12.568
essentially good, but they are corrupted by human society and institutions.

00:15:13.418 --> 00:15:19.568
You may well remember the quote “man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains”,

00:15:19.698 --> 00:15:25.498
which is how he starts his most famous work, Du Contrat Social, or The Social Contract.

00:15:26.298 --> 00:15:28.838
These ideas were, of course, radical.

00:15:29.078 --> 00:15:35.538
If you believe that the institutions of society corrupt innocent people, well then

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:40.288
the institutions of society aren’t going to react particularly well to that idea.

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:46.858
And indeed Rousseau was denounced publicly as the antichrist, and he

00:15:46.858 --> 00:15:50.888
had to flee to Great Britain, where he stayed with his friend David

00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:55.058
Hume, the father of scepticism, who we heard about a few minutes ago.

00:15:56.598 --> 00:16:01.598
Now to our fourth country, Italy – or the area of the world now known

00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:06.628
as Italy – and to the splendidly named Marquis Cesare Di Beccaria.

00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:12.238
His famous work “On Crimes and Punishment” is a short

00:16:12.378 --> 00:16:16.718
but powerful and spine-tingling work to read even now.

00:16:17.558 --> 00:16:25.018
It has the added benefit of having a commentary written by his admirer, the aforementioned Voltaire.

00:16:25.928 --> 00:16:31.398
As I am sure you know, the penal system or system of punishment in

00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:37.539
1764 when Beccaria wrote his ground-breaking work, was utterly brutal.

00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:44.708
For even what we would now consider to be the smallest of crimes you could be tortured,

00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:51.298
cut up into pieces, publicly executed, and suffer the most horrible of punishments.

00:16:52.068 --> 00:16:58.748
Beccaria challenged all of that; in his introduction he questions why it should be

00:16:58.748 --> 00:17:05.048
that in all human societies one part is given “the height of power and happiness“ and

00:17:05.178 --> 00:17:11.208
reduces the other part – the poor and weak – to “the extreme of weakness and misery“.

00:17:12.048 --> 00:17:17.498
His work explains how good laws should work against this tendency

00:17:17.748 --> 00:17:21.898
and so “diffuse their influence universally and equally.”

00:17:22.448 --> 00:17:28.888
This might seem to us to be simple good sense, but in Europe of the

00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:34.138
18th century this was revolutionary and radical, enlightened thinking.

00:17:34.828 --> 00:17:41.228
And because of this, Beccaria can be justly described as the father of criminal law.

00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:46.438
So, these are some of the most famous individual thinkers of The

00:17:46.438 --> 00:17:51.788
Enlightenment, but before we move onto the influence of the Enlightenment,

00:17:51.978 --> 00:17:57.208
it’s worth mentioning a remarkable innovation that came out of this period.

00:17:57.688 --> 00:17:59.748
And that is the Encyclopedia.

00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:06.008
Its founding editor, the Frenchman Denis Diderot stated that its mission

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:10.588
was for people “to be able to inform themselves and to know things.”

00:18:11.578 --> 00:18:19.488
17 volumes were printed over a period of 21 years amounting to 20 million words.

00:18:20.178 --> 00:18:26.558
It was a collaboration, drawing on the best minds of the day and aiming to include

00:18:26.578 --> 00:18:32.388
information across a whole range of subjects and “to change the way people think“.

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:38.568
Now, encyclopedias have obviously gone slightly out of fashion with the creation of

00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:44.578
The Internet, but it’s hard to overestimate quite how important this invention was.

00:18:45.618 --> 00:18:51.018
It wasn’t free, of course, but people could suddenly find information for themselves,

00:18:51.018 --> 00:18:57.108
they could inform themselves and make up their own minds through rational thought.

00:18:58.188 --> 00:19:04.478
Now, as we move on to consider the influence of Enlightenment ideas on the world that came

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:10.508
after them, and of course our modern world, perhaps the stated mission of Diderot and his

00:19:10.508 --> 00:19:16.908
encyclopedia might remind you of an ever present element of our own knowledge universe.

00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:21.718
Google, of course, whose mission is “to organise the world’s

00:19:21.748 --> 00:19:25.358
information making it universally accessible and useful.”

00:19:26.408 --> 00:19:33.708
A cynic, or sceptic even, might say that Diderot’s mission was purely intellectual and for the

00:19:33.728 --> 00:19:39.940
public good, whereas Google is also pretty good at making money, but that is beside the point.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.250
Let’s pause for a moment and take stock – or gather our thoughts.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.260
We have had a quick survey of some of the key contributors to the

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.217
Enlightenment and started to look at the ways in which they, collectively,

00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:59.975
amassed knowledge, collaborated and stimulated each other to think.

00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:06.455
Before moving on to discuss the impact and influence they had on different countries in

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:13.763
the succeeding 50 years, let me illustrate a bit more fully how their ideas spread and in

00:20:13.763 --> 00:20:19.843
doing so say a little bit about the climate of ideas that operated in Europe at this time.

00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:27.423
During the first half of the 18th century there was a particularly rapid growth in all the

00:20:27.423 --> 00:20:33.223
different ways that humans could congregate – that they could meet together – and communicate.

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:38.403
Coffee houses became the centre of talk and political debate.

00:20:39.213 --> 00:20:44.343
Especially in England, newspapers and political pamphlets - or

00:20:44.463 --> 00:20:48.343
short essays – were plentiful, they were all over the place.

00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:56.543
Not only were there the learned societies mentioned before, but also debating societies sprung up.

00:20:57.353 --> 00:21:03.163
New heights of sophistication in entertainment became popular, with London, the

00:21:03.343 --> 00:21:09.903
largest and richest city in Europe, a particularly strong centre for music, attracting

00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:16.043
[albeit only for 15 months] the young Mozart, and – more permanently – Georg Händel.

00:21:17.123 --> 00:21:23.053
Now, moving on to the biggest effects of the Enlightenment– and here I am

00:21:23.063 --> 00:21:27.813
pointing towards the mini series on revolutions - we are talking about three

00:21:27.983 --> 00:21:33.303
very different kinds of revolution: the Industrial, the American and the French.

00:21:34.363 --> 00:21:38.103
Taking each one in turn, I will say a brief word on each

00:21:38.103 --> 00:21:42.233
revolution, but leave the majority for the full episodes.

00:21:42.993 --> 00:21:52.073
So, the Industrial Revolution was the period from approximately 1760 to 1820 when Western Europe

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:59.693
initially and then the USA went through a period of explosive and transformative growth based on

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:06.793
the use of new industrial techniques, such as spinning machines for making cotton and steam engines.

00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:14.113
Although it is difficult to show direct cause and effect, the scientific method and

00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:20.603
Empiricism, pioneered by Enlightenment thinkers, laid the basis for this revolution.

00:22:21.533 --> 00:22:28.353
Both industrialists and Enlightenment thinkers gathered in coffee shops and in learned societies,

00:22:28.843 --> 00:22:35.323
and so there was a great sharing of ideas that helped stimulate the Industrial Revolution.

00:22:36.163 --> 00:22:42.483
And the concept of empiricism, of trial and error, and of experimentation,

00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:49.073
created completely new professions, such as the engineer, and it was these

00:22:49.073 --> 00:22:53.973
people who were some of the key drivers of The Industrial Revolution.

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:58.323
Moving on to The American Revolution, there is no

00:22:58.373 --> 00:23:02.263
doubting the impact that the Enlightenment had on it.

00:23:03.053 --> 00:23:07.523
Of the most important founding fathers of the United States, Benjamin

00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:11.860
Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were particularly influenced by what

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:16.223
they saw and heard when visiting Europe and also what they read.

00:23:17.013 --> 00:23:22.503
Jefferson, the architect of the American Constitution, declared Locke,

00:23:22.843 --> 00:23:27.943
Newton and Bacon as “three of the greatest men that had ever lived.”

00:23:29.063 --> 00:23:33.893
In designing the American Constitution, the influence of the thought

00:23:34.123 --> 00:23:39.483
of Isaac Newton is there in the way in which the different interlocking

00:23:39.483 --> 00:23:43.503
and counterbalancing parts of the Constitution work together.

00:23:44.183 --> 00:23:51.503
As we saw in the final days of President Donald Trump, this robustly and ingeniously

00:23:51.503 --> 00:23:56.703
organised mechanism can withstand great pressure - it’s quite the legacy.

00:23:57.783 --> 00:24:03.163
Whilst the Industrial Revolution brought about a seismic and massive change

00:24:03.173 --> 00:24:09.343
in society and the American Revolution was a war of independence against the

00:24:09.373 --> 00:24:14.313
colonial power, the French Revolution was the overthrowing of an existing

00:24:14.323 --> 00:24:19.083
regime - at that time one of the most famous monarchies in the world.

00:24:20.143 --> 00:24:24.283
As you may well have detected from what you’ve learned about the French

00:24:24.333 --> 00:24:29.063
contributors to the Enlightenment, they often found themselves needing to escape

00:24:29.073 --> 00:24:34.423
from France because they were seen as representing a threat to the status quo.

00:24:34.883 --> 00:24:37.201
Which, history shows us, they were.

00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:43.873
As you will learn about in the episode on The French Revolution, Enlightenment ideas about

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:50.643
the social contract between the rulers and the ruled and in particular about each human

00:24:50.643 --> 00:24:57.083
being‘s rights to liberty and equality were at the heart of its revolutionary ideals.

00:24:58.233 --> 00:25:03.023
And it shows you quite how important some of the Enlightenment thinkers in France

00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:09.073
were that shortly after the French Revolution the bodies of both Voltaire and

00:25:09.073 --> 00:25:14.983
Rousseau were brought to be buried with full honours in the Pantheon in Paris.

00:25:15.843 --> 00:25:22.958
The number of people who lined the streets in Paris to pay their respects to Voltaire was said

00:25:23.213 --> 00:25:29.903
to be around one million, which is more people than the entire population of Paris at the time.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:36.393
So, to the final section and some concluding thoughts on the impact

00:25:36.543 --> 00:25:40.153
and influence of the Enlightenment movement on today‘s world.

00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:45.873
As I have indicated earlier, you can see its workings in the American

00:25:45.903 --> 00:25:50.503
constitution in particular, and you can see it in the current French state, with

00:25:50.613 --> 00:25:55.573
its emphasis on individual freedoms, and the separation of church and state.

00:25:56.373 --> 00:26:02.673
These ideas about what constitutes good government and commonly accepted ideas about

00:26:02.903 --> 00:26:08.863
civil liberties have been enshrined in such concepts as universal human rights.

00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:15.103
Indeed, a lot of these ideas, whether that’s challenging the status quo, or

00:26:15.343 --> 00:26:21.493
the importance of reason, of equality between people, or of the right to access

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:26.763
information, they don’t seem particularly revolutionary at all to us now.

00:26:27.463 --> 00:26:33.373
If anything, for most people living in a Western democracy, they seem normal.

00:26:34.173 --> 00:26:38.833
And that is no doubt the most lasting legacy of The Enlightenment.

00:26:41.627 --> 00:26:48.431
OK then, that is it for today's slightly longer than usual episode on The Age of Enlightenment.

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:52.797
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that

00:26:52.807 --> 00:26:58.147
it will be helpful when it comes to this mini series on the Age of Revolution.

00:26:58.807 --> 00:27:02.167
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:27:02.557 --> 00:27:07.767
Which Enlightenment thinkers, or ideas, do you think had the greatest impact?

00:27:08.107 --> 00:27:12.427
Was it even someone, or an idea, that I didn’t mention in this episode?

00:27:13.047 --> 00:27:14.407
I would love to know.

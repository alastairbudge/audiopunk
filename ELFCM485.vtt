Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.360
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.489
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.910
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part mini-series.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.880
This time we are going to be talking about “British divisions”.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.239
In part one, this episode, we’ll talk about the thousand-year rivalry between Scotland and England.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.990
In part two we are going to get even more granular and talk about the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.760
rivalry and differences between the north and the south of England.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.520
And in part three we are going to talk about a time when English rivalries resulted

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.109
in one of the bloodiest internal conflicts in British history: The Wars Of The Roses.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.169
You can, of course, choose to listen to each episode individually, but I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.940
hope that they will be even more interesting when listened to together.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:11.470
As you probably know already, but as we will talk about in-depth in

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.580
this mini-series Britain is far from one, unified, United Kingdom.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.000
Ok then, let’s get started and talk about the rivalry between Scotland and England.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.919
You can tell a lot about a country by its national anthem.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.320
The French national anthem, La Marseillaise, is about

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.559
revolution, about overthrowing the flag of tyranny.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.250
The English national anthem, God Save The King, is an ode to the king,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.710
its subjects singing about how much they love living in a monarchy.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.059
As to the Scottish national anthem, or I should say the “unofficial” national

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.339
anthem, you might be tricked by its innocent-sounding name: The Flower of Scotland.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.269
Cute, you might think, it’s about flowers and the beautiful

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.289
nature one might find in the Scottish countryside.

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:17.285
Indeed the first few lines of the anthem might suggest it’s about a flower.

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:18.905
It goes:

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:21.035
O flower of Scotland

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:22.665
When will we see

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:24.155
Your like again,

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:25.915
Lovely.

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:31.655
But then you start to realise that it’s not about flowers.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:33.785
The song continues:

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:36.395
That fought and died for

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:42.555
And the rest of the anthem continues to talk about the time Scotland

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:48.795
beat England in battle, and how they can do it again if they want to.

00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:53.855
There are also some unofficial lyrics that you will hear at

00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:57.555
a football or rugby match, being belted out from the crowds.

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:03.675
When the official lyrics are “Proud Edward's Army”, which refers to

00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:08.665
the soldiers of the English king, there are loud shouts of “BASTARDS!”

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:17.955
Now, this song was composed in the late 1960s, and the battle it refers to is the Battle

00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:27.325
of Bannockburn, which was in the year 1314, almost 700 years before the song was composed.

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:34.545
Of course, to say that the average person in Scotland or England for that matter spends much

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:40.575
of their time worrying about a battle from the 14th century would be an exaggeration, but

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:47.165
it is just one example of the extent to which historical rivalries are still felt today.

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:54.355
So, in this episode, we are going to explore the relationship between Scotland and England.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:04:00.675
We will start with the long and complicated history of the relationship, and then talk

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:05.875
more about the political and cultural divisions that still exist to this very day.

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:12.135
Going back a couple of thousands of years, there was no England or Scotland.

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:15.555
There were a series of warring tribes in Britain.

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:22.445
In the north of the country, in modern-day Scotland, there were the Picts and the Scots.

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:28.125
And in the south, in modern-day England and Wales, there were tribes such

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:34.105
as the Iceni, which you might remember from episode number 251 on Boudicca.

00:04:35.332 --> 00:04:39.822
When the Romans arrived, first in 55 BC and then

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:44.392
properly in 43 AD, they landed in the south of Britain.

00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:50.882
This was purely for practical reasons; it was the closest land to Europe.

00:04:52.282 --> 00:04:57.522
The Romans occupied Britain for almost 400 years, mainly subduing the

00:04:57.522 --> 00:05:03.142
local tribes, and importantly, they only occupied the south of the country.

00:05:04.552 --> 00:05:11.232
To the north were murderous, violent tribes, barbarians, and the Romans did what

00:05:11.272 --> 00:05:17.142
all self-respecting powers do to keep unwanted invaders out: they built a wall.

00:05:18.562 --> 00:05:25.772
This wall came to be known as Hadrian’s Wall, and in fact you can still visit its ruins today.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:30.962
It is right at the northern part of England, close to the border with Scotland.

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:37.322
The reason to mention this is that this artificial division of the country by the

00:05:37.322 --> 00:05:45.112
Romans served as the first division between what we know today as England and Scotland.

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:50.762
Fast forward a few hundred years, and by the early 10th

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:55.312
century both Scotland and England were their own kingdoms.

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:59.012
No longer were they a collection of warring small

00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:03.732
tribes, but two countries ruled by their own kings.

00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:09.322
England was the more powerful kingdom in every sense.

00:06:09.672 --> 00:06:14.632
Its population was larger, 3 or 4 million to Scotland’s under a million.

00:06:15.152 --> 00:06:19.512
It had a more developed agricultural system, it was richer, it had

00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:23.942
better access to military technology, a bigger and better-trained army.

00:06:25.392 --> 00:06:31.822
And in the late 13th century the English king, Edward I, did what powerful

00:06:31.822 --> 00:06:37.022
kings do, he invaded his weaker neighbour, marching north into Scotland.

00:06:38.384 --> 00:06:43.712
There had been a complication when the king of Scotland, Alexander, had died without

00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:50.142
leaving a surviving direct male heir, and King Edward of England had seized his opportunity.

00:06:51.652 --> 00:06:55.442
What happened next was the Scottish Wars of Independence.

00:06:55.912 --> 00:07:00.522
It is a long and bloody story, and in fact, you may remember

00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:05.062
part of it from episode number 186, on William Wallace.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:11.242
We’ll have to skip over the juiciest parts for today’s episode, but the point

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:16.992
is that this was a sixty-year period of fighting between Scotland and England.

00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:22.642
There are no reliable figures for the number of people who died–it’s

00:07:22.662 --> 00:07:27.252
most likely in the tens of thousands–but what is undeniable is

00:07:27.252 --> 00:07:32.432
that this formed the basis of the rivalry that still exists today.

00:07:34.032 --> 00:07:39.782
If you remember “Proud Edward’s Army” from the Scottish national anthem, The Flower of Scotland,

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:47.482
this was King Edward II, the son of Edward I, the king who had first marched north into Scotland.

00:07:48.842 --> 00:07:53.732
Now, with the wars of Scottish independence over in the late 14th

00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:58.993
century, Scotland and England existed as two separate kingdoms.

00:08:00.572 --> 00:08:06.122
Like all good European rulers, they made sure that alliances and relationships

00:08:06.122 --> 00:08:11.662
with other countries were reinforced through marriage, so Scottish and

00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:16.962
English princesses would be sent off to marry European princes, and European

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:22.322
princesses would be brought to Britain to marry Scottish and English princes.

00:08:23.472 --> 00:08:30.282
And occasionally English and Scottish royalty would marry, to maintain the peace.

00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:40.212
All well and good, but what happened in the early 17th century, in 1601 to be precise, was

00:08:40.212 --> 00:08:46.452
an event that underlined quite how linked the Scottish and English royal families were.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:55.212
Queen Elizabeth I of England died childless, and her closest relation, the next in line to

00:08:55.212 --> 00:09:03.872
the throne was a man called James, who just so happened to be James VI, King of Scotland.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:09.412
So, the King of Scotland also became the King of England,

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:14.892
King James VI of Scotland also became King James I of England.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:21.332
This was an event that would bring the two countries together like never before.

00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:25.582
The King of England would, of course, not declare war

00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:28.572
on The King of Scotland because he was the same person.

00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:38.172
Importantly, however, this was not a political union, it was called the Union of The Crowns, meaning

00:09:38.192 --> 00:09:44.862
that the two countries would share the same monarch, but have different laws and political systems.

00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:51.162
It wouldn’t be until 1707 that Scotland and England officially became

00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:56.062
one country, Great Britain, ruled by one parliament and one monarch.

00:09:57.352 --> 00:10:02.702
Now, the British history buffs among you will have realised that I’ve missed out on quite a few

00:10:02.712 --> 00:10:08.092
important things along the way, like the English Civil War and the brief period when neither

00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:13.182
England nor Scotland had a king, and when Bonnie Prince Charlie tried to mount a rebellion

00:10:13.182 --> 00:10:19.262
and overthrow the English king, but for the purposes of today’s episode, we must move on.

00:10:20.612 --> 00:10:30.062
Since 1707, Scotland and England have been united, one country, one currency, ruled by one monarch.

00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:37.392
But perhaps surprisingly, not everything was united, not everything was shared.

00:10:38.332 --> 00:10:44.762
Scotland kept its own religious system, its own education system and its own laws.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:50.432
If you have ever spent any time reading the small print of the terms and

00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:55.752
conditions of a UK-registered company, you will often find that it refers

00:10:55.752 --> 00:11:01.022
to “the laws of England and Wales”, not “the laws of the United Kingdom”.

00:11:01.982 --> 00:11:08.312
This is because there is no “UK law”, there are in fact three different legal systems.

00:11:08.912 --> 00:11:14.032
There’s Northern Irish law, and then there is Scottish Law and English law.

00:11:14.972 --> 00:11:20.302
Now, we don’t want to get bogged down in legal jargon, but the point is that England

00:11:20.322 --> 00:11:25.842
and Scotland were united as one country, but there were still important differences.

00:11:26.992 --> 00:11:31.302
And, to state the obvious, just because Scotland and England were now

00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:36.142
united, this didn’t mean that all cultural and regional differences simply

00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:41.642
vanished, and all previous rivalries and memories of past wars were forgotten.

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:43.102
Far from it.

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:49.342
Especially in Scotland, people are far more likely, and increasingly

00:11:49.352 --> 00:11:53.552
more likely, to consider themselves Scottish than British.

00:11:54.992 --> 00:12:01.302
In a survey from 2022, 72% of people in Scotland said that they thought of

00:12:01.302 --> 00:12:07.432
themselves primarily as Scottish, which is up from 57% ten years before.

00:12:08.752 --> 00:12:13.192
In England, it is the opposite, with over half of the population

00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:20.582
identifying as British only and a mere 15% identifying as English.

00:12:21.962 --> 00:12:22.812
Why is this?

00:12:23.222 --> 00:12:27.892
Well, it's not so different really than the reason that someone from

00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:32.902
Barcelona might say that they are Catalan, not Spanish, or even that

00:12:32.912 --> 00:12:37.162
someone from Sicily might tell you that they are Sicilian, not Italian.

00:12:38.032 --> 00:12:43.682
It implies particular pride in where you are from, and that pride is often

00:12:43.682 --> 00:12:48.862
more intense if you are from a smaller part of a larger nation, a part that

00:12:48.862 --> 00:12:53.242
has to fight harder to maintain its own identity, customs and traditions,

00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:58.002
or even a part that believes it should be its own independent country.

00:12:59.672 --> 00:13:06.292
Now, for the past 200 years or so, there has been relative peace between Scotland and England.

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:12.762
Many Scottish people move to England, especially to London, the capital, where

00:13:12.972 --> 00:13:16.902
there are the most economic opportunities, as we’ll talk about in the next episode.

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:22.422
There has also been an increasing trend of English people moving to Scotland,

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:27.502
especially people retiring to Scotland, where house prices are lower, they have

00:13:27.512 --> 00:13:32.222
better access to healthcare and can enjoy the wonderful Scottish countryside.

00:13:33.452 --> 00:13:37.282
Of course, many families are mixed, including mine.

00:13:37.822 --> 00:13:41.772
My mother is English, my father is half Scottish and half Welsh.

00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:47.422
And the rivalry between the two countries, between England and Scotland,

00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:52.992
is now much more one of friendly jokes rather than deep-seated hatred.

00:13:54.382 --> 00:13:59.382
Scottish people love to tell jokes about English people, often playing on the stereotype

00:13:59.622 --> 00:14:05.122
of English people being reserved and gullible, easily tricked by their more intelligent

00:14:05.162 --> 00:14:11.092
northern neighbours, or that Scottish men are stronger and more “real men” than English men.

00:14:12.262 --> 00:14:18.072
And English people do the same, with the stereotypes typically being of Scottish people being

00:14:18.132 --> 00:14:24.642
cheap, not liking to spend money, being less civilised, or talking with an unintelligible accent.

00:14:26.122 --> 00:14:29.412
I’ll leave you with an example of jokes of both, a joke

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:32.912
about English people and then a joke about Scottish people.

00:14:34.262 --> 00:14:35.902
So, here’s the first one.

00:14:36.713 --> 00:14:42.363
An Englishman is hiking in Scotland and he pauses to drink from a stream.

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:49.403
A passing shepherd calls out "Dinnae drink frae that, it's all fulla coo piss an shite!"

00:14:50.733 --> 00:14:55.603
The Englishman says to him in a cut-glass accent "I'm terribly sorry, my

00:14:55.603 --> 00:15:00.003
good fellow, would you very much mind repeating that in the Queen's English?"

00:15:01.513 --> 00:15:05.503
And the shepherd says "I'm terribly sorry sir, I was only asking

00:15:05.623 --> 00:15:08.403
if you would like to borrow this cup and get a proper drink?"

00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:13.434
In case you didn’t understand what the shepherd said in my Scottish

00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:17.724
accent  the Scotsman says that the water is full of cow piss and

00:15:17.724 --> 00:15:22.394
shit, excrement, but the Englishman doesn’t understand what he says.

00:15:23.054 --> 00:15:26.054
And then he offers to lend him a cup to drink from it.

00:15:27.534 --> 00:15:32.651
OK, now in the interests of balance, here's an example of a joke about  Scottish

00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:37.821
people, and remember that one of the stereotypes that English people have about

00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:42.751
Scottish people and often use in jokes is about Scottish alcohol consumption.

00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:47.852
This was something that the Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of Queen

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:52.342
Elizabeth I, was reported to have said to a driving instructor in Scotland.

00:15:53.362 --> 00:15:58.212
He asked them “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?”.

00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:04.402
Now, the relationship between Scotland and England is complex and multi-faceted.

00:16:04.872 --> 00:16:08.112
The two countries have shared a common monarch for over

00:16:08.226 --> 00:16:12.942
400 years, and have been in a political union for 300.

00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:17.532
There is a huge amount of shared cultural heritage, it is probably no

00:16:17.532 --> 00:16:22.292
exaggeration to say that Scottish and English people have more in common

00:16:22.292 --> 00:16:26.892
with each other than with any other nation, English-speaking or otherwise.

00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:32.212
Yet especially on the Scottish side, there is a fierce sense of

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:37.172
nationalism, or pride in being uniquely Scottish, rather than British.

00:16:38.352 --> 00:16:43.242
And as you will hear firsthand if you ever find yourself at a sporting event

00:16:43.432 --> 00:16:49.092
between England and Scotland, and the proud cry of “bastards” rings out at the

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:54.742
mention of a 14th-century English king, some history can never be forgotten.

00:16:56.252 --> 00:17:01.422
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the history of the rivalry between Scotland

00:17:01.432 --> 00:17:06.692
and England, and that’s it for part one of this mini-series on British divisions.

00:17:07.302 --> 00:17:10.502
As a reminder, next up we’ll be talking about the North vs.

00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:15.982
South divide in England, and in part three we will finish off with a time when internal

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:21.632
division and conflict led to a 30-year war, in the form of The Wars Of The Roses.

00:17:22.152 --> 00:17:26.432
Oh, and we have made quite a few episodes about many of the topics we covered in

00:17:26.432 --> 00:17:31.162
passing in this episode, including the lives of Elizabeth I, Bonnie Prince Charlie,

00:17:31.362 --> 00:17:36.302
William Wallace, and Boudicca, as well as a mini-series on the broad theme of Scotland.

00:17:36.872 --> 00:17:42.312
So, if those are of interest, you can find all of those on the website, leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:47.782
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

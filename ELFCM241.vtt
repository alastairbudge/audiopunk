Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.410
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.660
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.910
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Mystery Of Thule.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
It is said to be an island six days north of Britain, where in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.860
the summer there is no night and in the winter there is no light.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.230
To this day, there is no agreement on exactly where Thule is, but there are plenty of theories.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.800
So, in this episode we are going to explore the mystery of Thule, where the story of its

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.920
existence came from, why agreeing on where it is is so problematic, some ideas about where, or

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.550
perhaps even what, Thule could be, and ask ourselves whether this mystery will ever be solved.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.630
OK then, wrap up warm, and let’s get ready to explore the mystery of Thule.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.730
Our story starts, as many great stories do, with the ancient Greeks.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.630
Specifically, a Greek geographer, astronomer and explorer called Pytheas, or Pytheas of Massalia.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.370
Massilia, where Pytheas was based, was a trading port

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.850
in the northern Mediterranean, in modern day France.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.110
If you have guessed the modern name of Massalia, well done.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.940
It’s now the French city of Marseille.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.310
But if we go back 2,300 years, to the fourth century BC, it was part of the Greek empire.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.080
And Pytheas, well, he was a well-respected geographer, astronomer, and philosopher.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.620
We don’t know much about his life, but it seems clear that he had a curious mind.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.050
At some point between 340 and 306 BC - historians are

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.090
divided over exactly when - Pytheas set sail north.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.600
Of course, sailing from Massalia, or Marseille, he couldn’t go directly north, he needed

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.920
to go south-west, through the strait of Gibraltar, and then up the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.390
It’s thought that the voyage Pytheas went on was primarily for trade reasons, to make contact

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.780
with the people in northern France and even further north, and to open up potential trade routes.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.090
But Pytheas probably wasn’t a trader himself, and given that there is no evidence

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.180
that the trip was paid for by the city, it wasn’t an official trade mission.

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:15.490
Pytheus set sail on a quest to understand what existed further north.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, it’s worth pointing out here that the ancient Greeks did believe that the Earth was round,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.920
that it was spherical, and that life existed on Earth thanks to the heat provided by the sun.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.200
The Greeks thought that the Mediterranean was the perfect distance from the sun - it

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.680
wasn’t too hot, and it wasn’t too cold, it was the perfect place to live temperature-wise.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.760
But while thinking that the Mediterranean is the perfect place might now be a matter

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.890
of personal opinion, the ancient Greeks thought that if you went too far south, and

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.290
therefore too close to the sun, it became so hot that human life was literally impossible.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.980
And similarly, if you went too far north it was so cold that human life was literally impossible.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.310
This was the prevailing belief at the time.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.130
So, off Pytheas goes, northwards.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.990
Again, historians are divided over his exact route, but it’s thought that he first

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.380
went to Britain, where he stayed for a couple of years, before heading north again.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.550
And here is where, after six days sailing, he reaches a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.490
place he calls “Thule”, or as we say in English, Thule.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.830
He describes it as an incredibly cold frozen island, where during

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.650
the summer there is no night, and during the winter there is no day.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.550
After discovering this frozen island, he continued north until he found a frozen sea.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.120
He wrote  amazing descriptions of this, which actually gives us a clue about where he got to.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:20.460
He described the sea as “Where neither earth, water, nor air exist separately, but a sort

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.160
of concretion of all these, resembling a sea-lung in which the earth, the sea, and all

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.900
things were suspended, thus forming, as it were, a link to unite the whole together”.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.240
I’ll explain this clue shortly, but remember that the term he used was a “sea-lung”.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.690
Blocked by this icey sea, he could go no further north, and that is where he turned around.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.950
He returned to Massalia, and wrote a full account of his trip,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.150
with all the details that would help someone find the island again.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.950
His book was called “ta peri tou Okeanou”, literally “things about the Ocean”, but

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.290
it’s normally translated in English as “Description of the Ocean” or “On the Ocean”.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:22.950
So, you might be wondering, why all the mystery if Pytheas provided such specific details?

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.540
Well, the book, like many of the great works at the time, is thought to have been

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:36.133
stored in The Great Library of Alexandria, which burned to the ground in 48 BC.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.880
No other copies have been discovered, and our only records of Pytheas’s

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.960
trip come from descriptions of it from other writers, many of whom

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.400
would get their records of the trip from other, secondary records.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.630
People who have written about this famous trip include the Greek geographer Strabo, the

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:08.710
Greek historian Timaeus and probably most famously the Roman historian, Pliny the Elder.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.940
And initially, at least, or by many ancient Greeks, Pytheas was thought to be

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.690
a liar, many people thought that what he described simply couldn’t be true.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.080
Strabo went so far as to say that Pytheas was, and

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.960
I’m quoting directly here, “the worst possible liar”.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:39.070
Remember, the ancient Greeks believed that life as far north as Britain was impossible, it

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:46.070
was far too far from the sun, and would be far too cold for any human beings to survive.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:53.381
And in Pytheas account of the voyage he wrote of perfectly happy, normal-looking

00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:59.651
people living in Britain, even right at the far north, growing crops and living

00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:04.341
off the land in a very similar way to how things worked in the Mediterranean.

00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:11.471
People from France, Italy, Spain and Greece might make fun of British weather,

00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:17.425
and of course it can be quite cold and wet, but it is possible to live there.

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:26.651
However the Greeks were so fixated on this belief that many simply didn’t believe Pytheas.

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:33.721
Historians now agree that Pytheas’s voyage did take place, and that he was not lying.

00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:41.721
The only problem, and this is a pretty big problem, is that we have no original record of his trip.

00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:48.041
The records we have are all secondary or tertiary records, records

00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:53.141
from some people who read the original text, the original “On the

00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:57.801
Ocean”, and from people who have read other people’s writings on it.

00:08:58.431 --> 00:09:05.551
We don’t know the route he took, we don’t know whether he actually ever set foot on Thule, the

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:11.591
full descriptions of what he saw are missing, we only have very small pieces of information.

00:09:12.581 --> 00:09:20.211
And this is the real mystery of Thule, and why it has continued to attract attention ever since.

00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:27.081
Thule started to take on a meaning that was even greater than the island itself.

00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:36.371
The ancient Roman poet, Virgil, coined the term “Ultima Thule”, meaning beyond Thule, and used it

00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:43.531
to describe something so far away that it was completely unattainable, completely out of reach.

00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:50.771
It became this metaphor for a mysterious land, a mysterious island, at

00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:56.711
the edge of the habitable Earth, and indeed a metaphor for cold itself.

00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:04.651
Even as recently as the 17th century there was a belief in Europe that cold had an

00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:11.071
origin point, a point where all cold came from, that was far to the north of Europe.

00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:15.731
And this point was this mysterious island of Thule.

00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:22.581
But if we decide that we do believe Pytheus, that Thule was a real

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:27.541
place, and almost all modern historians do believe that his account

00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:33.151
was accurate, we still have to answer the question, “where is Thule?”

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:38.241
There are, of course, plenty of theories about where Thule is.

00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:45.331
One theory has it as Iceland, and Iceland certainly ticks a lot of the boxes.

00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:52.831
It would have taken the kind of ship Pytheas was in approximately 6 days to reach from Britain.

00:10:53.511 --> 00:10:57.601
It is sufficiently far north that in summer it is never

00:10:57.761 --> 00:11:02.031
fully dark, and in winter it’s never fully daylight.

00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:08.281
And it is sufficiently close to the Arctic Circle that it’s possible that

00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:13.401
Pytheas would have sailed further north from Iceland and soon met a frozen sea.

00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:21.893
If you remember his description of the “frozen sea”, Pytheus uses the term “sea lung”.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:29.523
“Sea lung” was another term in Greek for a jellyfish, and it seems probable

00:11:29.653 --> 00:11:35.853
that Pytheus was describing the phenomenon of what's called “pancake ice”,

00:11:36.123 --> 00:11:40.373
which looks a little bit like the sea is covered with frozen jellyfish.

00:11:41.193 --> 00:11:46.463
And this “pancake ice” is something that can be found to the north of Iceland.

00:11:47.863 --> 00:11:52.743
Another theory has it being an island off the coast of Norway called Smøla.

00:11:53.953 --> 00:11:58.993
Smøla is at a similar latitude to Iceland, and so has a

00:11:59.013 --> 00:12:03.103
similar amount of daylight during the winter and summer months.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:10.923
It’s also close to the Arctic Circle, so the “frozen sea” description could make

00:12:10.923 --> 00:12:16.613
sense, although the frozen sea is further from Norway than it is from Iceland.

00:12:17.713 --> 00:12:23.093
Other theories include that it was Greenland, Ireland, or even the Shetland

00:12:23.393 --> 00:12:27.903
Islands, but most people believe that it’s either Smøla or Iceland.

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:32.173
It is, in many ways, the perfect mystery.

00:12:32.513 --> 00:12:37.933
There’s just enough information for us to have an educated guess about where it

00:12:37.933 --> 00:12:43.893
could be, but not enough so that the mystery is ever likely to be completely solved.

00:12:44.823 --> 00:12:48.843
But this hasn’t stopped some people from claiming victory,

00:12:49.343 --> 00:12:53.953
claiming that they have finally solved the mystery of Thule.

00:12:54.973 --> 00:13:02.893
Indeed, in 2008 a team from the Technical University of Berlin reconstructed the route, and

00:13:02.893 --> 00:13:10.363
calculated that Thule must certainly have been Smøla, the small island off the coast of Norway.

00:13:11.953 --> 00:13:18.663
The German team was so confident in its discovery that the team leader wrote to a journalist

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:26.043
from Smøla saying “As about this old information there cannot be any doubt anymore.

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:30.267
You live on the mystic island of Thule”.

00:13:31.553 --> 00:13:38.453
The residents of Smøla were, as you might imagine, happy to be able to officially claim that

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:45.263
they lived on Thule, because it might mean tourists would be attracted to this mysterious island.

00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:52.173
But, the debate rages on, and given that there are so many different secondary

00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:57.473
accounts of what Pytheas wrote, it’s impossible to know what he actually saw.

00:13:58.803 --> 00:14:06.673
In one account Pytheas reportedly saw Thule rising strikingly out of the water, and if

00:14:06.673 --> 00:14:13.093
this is the case it’s much more likely to have been Iceland than Smøla, because Smøla

00:14:13.093 --> 00:14:20.643
is an island which is only 5km off the mainland and isn’t nearly as imposing as Iceland.

00:14:21.933 --> 00:14:27.793
Certainly the theory that it’s Iceland is favoured by the author of probably the most

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:33.473
authoritative book on the matter, a book called Ultima Thule: further Mysteries of

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:40.463
the Arctic by a man with the fantastically Scandinavian name of Vilhjalmur Stefansson.

00:14:41.483 --> 00:14:46.413
For Stefansson there is little doubt about the matter, but he acknowledges

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:51.633
that the lack of primary information about Pytheas’s trip means it’s

00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:56.103
very unlikely that we will ever actually know what he was referring to.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:04.553
And in many ways, the identity of Thule remaining a secret for eternity is the way it should be.

00:15:05.423 --> 00:15:11.153
What Thule represents is probably more interesting than what it actually is.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:18.123
Thule now represents adventure, it represents mystery, it represents the unknown.

00:15:18.823 --> 00:15:23.353
It also represents human curiosity and the search for the truth.

00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:30.703
And one person who is often overlooked in the debate about Thule, or at least his

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:36.483
achievements are probably underappreciated, is the man who “discovered” it, Pytheus.

00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:44.033
Sure, he isn’t overlooked in terms of not being recognised or named in it, but

00:15:44.273 --> 00:15:49.523
there are very few discussions about Thule that acknowledge quite the scale of

00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:55.063
the adventure he embarked on, and how absolutely incredible it must have been.

00:15:55.943 --> 00:15:59.393
So let’s try and do that just for one minute.

00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:05.643
Let’s imagine a man who had grown up in the Mediterranean, and lived a relatively

00:16:05.743 --> 00:16:11.073
comfortable life in the wealthy trading port of Massalia, modern day Marseille.

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:15.981
One day he sets off on a boat out of Marseille.

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:19.483
It would likely have been the same kind of boat used

00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:22.733
for sailing from one Mediterranean port to another.

00:16:23.593 --> 00:16:29.983
The Mediterranean is, as you may well know, a relatively calm sea most of the time.

00:16:30.933 --> 00:16:37.583
Then, imagine him sailing through the strait of Gibraltar, with the large rock to its right.

00:16:38.903 --> 00:16:42.913
Then up it would have gone, perhaps through the eastern Atlantic

00:16:42.943 --> 00:16:48.013
or North Sea, bodies of water that can get incredibly stormy.

00:16:49.193 --> 00:16:54.083
The temperature would have kept on dropping, then suddenly after

00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:58.273
days of sailing a mysterious island appeared out of nowhere.

00:16:59.603 --> 00:17:06.113
As they continued further north, they met a sea made out of ice, and they could go no further.

00:17:07.095 --> 00:17:13.985
And they were doing all of this, to remind you, with no maps or knowledge of where they were going.

00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:19.375
Their navigational skills would have been excellent, and indeed they

00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:24.195
managed to make it back to Massalia, but they were going where nobody

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:28.655
had ever gone before, or at least no Greek had ever gone before.

00:17:29.955 --> 00:17:36.085
So, it’s easy to get caught up in the mystery of where or what Thule is and

00:17:36.085 --> 00:17:41.485
forget about the actual human beings on a tiny boat sailing up to the Arctic

00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:46.175
Circle and back, but when you think about it it really is quite amazing.

00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:52.265
The wonderful thing about Thule is that it is a mystery to be continually

00:17:52.265 --> 00:17:57.155
explored but never solved, it’s a metaphor for human curiosity.

00:17:58.105 --> 00:18:03.565
Sure, we might all have our own ideas, and it is fascinating to try to

00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:09.825
retrace and imagine this fantastic journey that took place over 2,000 years

00:18:09.825 --> 00:18:15.743
ago, but the reality is that nobody will ever solve the mystery of Thule.

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:23.082
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Mystery Of Thule.

00:18:23.572 --> 00:18:26.472
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that this

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:29.702
has shed a little light on this mysterious island.

00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:34.132
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:34.392 --> 00:18:36.892
Have you heard the story of Thule before?

00:18:37.432 --> 00:18:41.472
What do you think the most likely explanation is for its identity?

00:18:42.252 --> 00:18:45.902
And, more interestingly, what does our obsession with

00:18:45.932 --> 00:18:49.382
finding out its identity tell us about ourselves?

00:18:49.982 --> 00:18:53.812
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.132

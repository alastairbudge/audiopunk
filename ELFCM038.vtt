Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:10.709
English.

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:15.419
Where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the world.

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.549
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:23.039
Today we are talking about a personal hero of mine.

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:31.214
A fantastic writer and someone who we can all learn a lot from when communicating in English.

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:41.124
That person is George Orwell, and today we are going to talk about his six rules for effective

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.384
writing in English.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:50.114
Before we get right into it, though, let me just remind those of you listening on Spotify, Google

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:56.909
Podcasts, iVoox or wherever you get your podcasts that if you want to listen to the podcast with the

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.969
transcript and key vocabulary in front of you, you can get that over on the website, which is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.369
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.249
Especially for those of you that have found that you are at home slightly more than usual and are

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:16.379
looking for a way to improve your English even faster than you would do just by listening.

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:22.099
I'd definitely recommend checking out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:28.699
Membership gives you access to all of the transcripts and key vocabulary for every podcast we've

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:29.419
ever done.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.145
That's over 40 now, including all of the bonus episodes.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.195
It really is a super useful resource for your learning.

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:44.795
And we also have a 30 day no questions asked guarantee if you're not happy, so if you haven't

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.225
checked that out already, I'd recommend having a look.

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:52.347
You can find out more at leonardoenglish.com forward slash subscribe.

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.027
Okay then, George Orwell.

00:01:57.102 --> 00:02:04.662
He is probably most famous for two novels: Animal Farm and 1984.

00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:08.204
I guess you may have heard of those two books.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:14.864
Maybe you've read them in translation or perhaps you've even read them in English.

00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:22.671
We aren't going to talk about them at length today, but it is just worth talking about the world

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.471
when he wrote the books.

00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:37.524
He wrote Animal Farm in 1945, he wrote 1984 in 1948 - the reason that it's called 1984 is that it's

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.444
just 48 backwards.

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:47.299
And what we're going to be talking about today, his six rules on writing, comes from an essay that

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.339
he wrote in 1946.

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.319
So what's important about the time that he wrote these?

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:03.376
Well, they were written in the period just after the Second World War, after the Nazis had shown the

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:08.536
world quite the power of rhetoric and of propaganda.

00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:16.621
Of how politicians can use the media and language to push their own message.

00:03:17.484 --> 00:03:26.074
Orwell had seen how politicians used language to make people believe certain things and how language

00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:34.354
could be twisted and turned in order to advance the aims of a particular political party.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:45.984
So in 1946 he published an essay called Politics and The English Language, and as part of this, he

00:03:45.984 --> 00:03:48.594
set out six rules for writing.

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:56.114
The essay is actually only 5,000 words long, about 10 pages long.

00:03:56.864 --> 00:04:00.524
I'll put a link to it in the episode notes if you're interested.

00:04:01.544 --> 00:04:06.584
He does write pretty clearly, so I definitely recommend at least taking a look at it.

00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:12.753
Today though, we are going to go through his six rules of writing.

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:21.613
They do apply to written English, although I think there is a lot in there that can be applied also

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:26.953
to spoken English and just generally good communication skills.

00:04:29.063 --> 00:04:36.473
Now, depending on what your mother tongue is, these might seem like really strange rules, really

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:45.293
bizarre guidelines, but I promise that if you follow these rules set out by one of the finest

00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:54.443
writers in English, then you will sound more concise, more articulate, and will be a more effective

00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:55.913
communicator in English.

00:04:57.081 --> 00:05:00.080
I'll read out all of the six rules now.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.960
Then we'll go into each one in more detail.

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:11.451
The first rule is "never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech, which you are used to

00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:12.351
seeing in print".

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:20.061
The second rule is "never use a long word where a short one will do".

00:05:21.043 --> 00:05:27.643
Third, it's "if it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out".

00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:35.643
Fourth, we have "never use the passive where you can use the active".

00:05:37.793 --> 00:05:46.223
And fifth, our penultimate rule, is "never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word

00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:50.243
if you can think of an everyday English equivalent".

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:59.913
And the final rule is "break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous".

00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:04.893
So, let's talk about these rules individually.

00:06:06.403 --> 00:06:14.263
So to remind you, our first one is "never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech, which

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:15.853
you are used to seeing in print".

00:06:17.798 --> 00:06:25.598
Just in case you didn't know what a metaphor and simile are, a metaphor is when you use a word to

00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:30.558
describe something as something else, to say something is something else.

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:39.878
And a simile is when you say that something is like something else, for example, saying that "he is

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:46.393
a pig at the table" is a metaphor, but saying "he eats like a pig" is a simile.

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:48.413
Does that make sense?

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:56.963
What Orwell is saying here is that you shouldn't just use a metaphor or simile because you have

00:06:56.963 --> 00:06:58.163
heard it elsewhere.

00:06:58.553 --> 00:07:03.773
You should only use one if it actually helps you get your point across.

00:07:04.973 --> 00:07:13.133
So with the previous example of saying he is a pig at the table, that's okay, actually, because it's

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.083
a live metaphor.

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:23.183
The reader probably knows what it means and it actually helps get the point across that he is a

00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:23.933
messy eater.

00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:32.963
But English is full of dead metaphors, things that people just use because they have heard them

00:07:32.963 --> 00:07:39.998
being used, but the actual words don't help you to visualise what you are trying to describe.

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.288
If that's the case, then you shouldn't use these metaphors.

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:52.038
It would only serve to confuse the reader or listener, and therefore has no purpose.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:00.290
Our second rule is "never use a long word when a short one we'll do".

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:08.710
Now, I guess I don't need to explain what this rule is, but what I will do is explain why it's

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.160
important.

00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:18.703
Lots of people, when speaking any language, try to use longer words when shorter, more common words

00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:20.533
have exactly the same meaning.

00:08:21.893 --> 00:08:23.123
Why do people do this?

00:08:23.983 --> 00:08:33.373
Well, it's partly to show off, to show people how extensive their vocabulary is, but it's also to

00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:39.376
confuse, and to make people more likely to believe what they are saying if they think that the

00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:45.856
person saying it is clever because they are using longer and more complicated words.

00:08:47.536 --> 00:08:55.951
The result of this, according to Orwell, is that arguments aren't evaluated on their merits alone

00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:04.111
and ideas that would otherwise be rubbished, not be considered valuable, they manage to gain

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.341
popularity just because of the way in which they are communicated.

00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:18.896
So an example of a long word where a short one would do, might be using the word "necessitate"

00:09:19.096 --> 00:09:23.476
instead of need or "endeavour" instead of try.

00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:27.412
Our third rule is quite similar.

00:09:28.372 --> 00:09:33.982
It's that "if it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out".

00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:41.292
If you don't need to say or write a word, don't write it, don't say it.

00:09:42.897 --> 00:09:50.607
There are a load of words in English that don't actually need to be used, but people still use them

00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:51.447
in sentences.

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:55.917
For example, saying "the reason why".

00:09:56.827 --> 00:10:03.588
You don't need the word "why" because "the reason" already implies that there is a way.

00:10:04.848 --> 00:10:11.478
So instead of saying "the reason why he listens to the podcast", you should just say "the reason he

00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:12.628
listens to the podcast".

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:23.858
Or "in 10 years time", you don't need the "time" because "in 10 years" already implies the idea of

00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:24.248
time.

00:10:26.437 --> 00:10:34.166
His fourth rule is one that might seem strange to you, and that's never use the passive where you

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.636
can use the active.

00:10:36.596 --> 00:10:44.066
So just to clarify, this is that you should say, "I ate the apple" rather than "the apple was eaten

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:44.486
by me".

00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:52.621
Yes of course it's good to know how to use the passive voice, and this doesn't mean that you should

00:10:52.621 --> 00:11:01.470
never use the passive, but when you are speaking or writing, using the passive voice is often

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:09.060
unnecessarily confusing and you should always use the active voice where it makes sense.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:17.815
For example here, I just said "you should use the active voice" instead of "the active voice should

00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:18.445
be used".

00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:27.415
It's far easier to understand and far easier for the listener to process or for the reader to

00:11:27.415 --> 00:11:28.135
comprehend.

00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:32.185
It's also more forceful, right?

00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:39.265
It actually explains what happens, someone does something actively, that's the thing that happens,

00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:42.205
so that should be the focus of the sentence.

00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:47.558
So whenever possible, use the active, not the passive.

00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:52.778
Say use the active, don't say the active should be used.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:53.978
Got it?

00:11:54.908 --> 00:11:55.238
Good.

00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:05.395
Our fifth, our penultimate rule, is "never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word

00:12:05.665 --> 00:12:09.235
if you can think of an everyday English equivalent".

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.640
So to clarify on that, jargon means a special kind of word only used by a specific group, a word

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.770
that isn't that easy for others to understand.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:31.860
There's often a temptation by people to try to use a word that they think might make them sound more

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:38.153
intelligent because it shows that they are familiar with certain terms or expressions.

00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:46.238
But if this means that the person listening to you or reading what you've written can't understand

00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:47.657
what good is that?

00:12:47.657 --> 00:12:48.787
What was the point?

00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:57.737
I know that this is one probably more appropriate for native speakers, but it's also just worth

00:12:57.737 --> 00:13:05.027
pointing out, even for non native speakers, so you can recognise when a native speaker is using

00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:13.742
vocabulary that is unnecessarily complicated and then you can understand that complicated doesn't

00:13:13.952 --> 00:13:15.422
necessarily mean good.

00:13:17.161 --> 00:13:25.348
And our final rule, which I guess is actually quite a fun one, is "break any of these rules sooner

00:13:25.378 --> 00:13:28.228
than say anything outright barbarous".

00:13:29.028 --> 00:13:36.132
That is to say that you should consider these rules as guidelines and if following them means that

00:13:36.132 --> 00:13:40.302
you end up saying something ridiculous, then of course, break the rule.

00:13:41.807 --> 00:13:51.392
Okay, so let's just recap on our six rules Firstly, we have "never use a metaphor, simile or other

00:13:51.422 --> 00:13:54.842
figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print".

00:13:56.012 --> 00:14:01.082
Secondly, it was "never use a long word where a short one will do".

00:14:02.612 --> 00:14:08.402
Thirdly, it's "if it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out".

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:15.032
Forth, it's "never use the passive where you can use the active".

00:14:16.532 --> 00:14:25.052
Fifth, we have "never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of

00:14:25.082 --> 00:14:26.942
an everyday English equivalent".

00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:34.822
And sixth, it's "break any of those rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous".

00:14:37.322 --> 00:14:45.122
These are certainly things that I try to keep in mind when I'm speaking or writing, and it's not

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:45.872
always easy.

00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:51.587
Communicating clearly is hard enough when you are a native speaker.

00:14:52.037 --> 00:15:00.527
But you could also say that as a non-native speaker, you are starting from scratch, or at least you

00:15:00.527 --> 00:15:05.747
are starting without the same bad habits that many native speakers already have.

00:15:06.857 --> 00:15:11.027
So on one level, you may find it easier to stick to these rules.

00:15:11.717 --> 00:15:18.917
And if you do, well, not only will George Orwell be smiling down on you, but you'll also find

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:22.367
yourself communicating in a far more effective way.

00:15:24.537 --> 00:15:31.317
Okay, I hope that this has been an interesting little look at these tips on six rules for writing.

00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:40.707
Quite often when you see a blog or podcast episode that has 10 rules for X or Y, you aren't really

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:47.627
sure whether to trust it, as it could have been written by anyone, but at least on this one, these

00:15:47.627 --> 00:15:53.237
rules come straight from the pen of one of the finest writers in English of all time.

00:15:53.627 --> 00:15:56.387
So they are definitely worth paying attention to.

00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:59.537
And of course, trying to stick to, if you can.

00:16:00.983 --> 00:16:06.894

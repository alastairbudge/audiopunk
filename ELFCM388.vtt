Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:16.133
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:20.153
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:24.783
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:30.233
fierce footballing rivalry, a rivalry that was fought not on the pitch

00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:35.133
but on social media, and then the High Courts of Justice in London.

00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:41.263
It’s an amazing story that brings together football, Instagram, celebrities,

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:47.043
trademarks, the law, and the most unexpected but brilliant piece of detective work.

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:50.603
OK then, Vardy vs.

00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:53.603
Rooney | The Battle Of The Footballers’ Wives

00:00:54.843 --> 00:01:02.173
On the 29th of July, 2022, almost exactly a year before this episode will be released,

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:08.773
two women stood in The High Courts of London, awaiting to hear the decision of the court.

00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:13.533
The case was not criminal, neither stood accused of

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:17.173
theft, murder, drug dealing, or anything like that.

00:01:18.113 --> 00:01:22.853
The case was one of libel, the crime of damaging someone’s

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:26.243
reputation by writing something untrue about them.

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:31.573
And the two women were not just any random members of the public.

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:36.468
They were Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:41.493
If you don’t recognise their names, perhaps you might recognise the names of their

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:48.683
husbands: Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy, two of England’s best known football players.

00:01:50.223 --> 00:01:55.183
This battle was the culmination of an almost three year feud,

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:59.173
and the story of everything that happened is quite amazing.

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:07.753
So, as a bit of background, you probably need no reminder that football in Britain is very popular.

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:12.383
Premier League footballers are paid hundreds of thousands of Euros a week,

00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:17.443
the best footballers are treated as serious celebrities, with paparazzi

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:22.103
hiding outside their homes, trying to catch a glimpse of their private lives.

00:02:23.563 --> 00:02:28.703
For a long time, the celebrity was restricted to the pitch itself,

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:33.003
with limited public interest in footballers' private lives.

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:40.293
But starting in the mid 2000s, the British press turned its attention off the

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:45.173
pitch, to the wives and girlfriends of the country’s top football players.

00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:50.247
There is actually a term for the wives and girlfriends of football

00:02:50.247 --> 00:02:55.157
players, a popular acronym that came to prominence during the 2006 World

00:02:55.157 --> 00:03:01.037
Cup, and that’s “WAG”, - W, A, G - short for “wives and girlfriends”.

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:08.577
Soon enough gossip magazines reported not just on what clothes the WAGs

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:12.357
were wearing or who looked like they had had a bit too much to drink at a

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:17.947
post-match party, but on rivalries between the WAGs, on the individuals.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:25.553
This original “WAG” class contained plenty of women who were famous in their own right,

00:03:25.983 --> 00:03:30.913
they had successful careers of their own, irrespective of their husbands or boyfriends.

00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:36.283
Victoria Beckham, the wife of David Beckham, was a pop star, she

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:40.553
was one of the five Spice Girls, the biggest girl band of the 1990s.

00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:47.813
Then there was Cheryl Cole, who was a pop singer in a band called Girls Aloud and is now

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:53.753
probably more famous than her footballer husband, Ashley, now ex-husband I should add.

00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:59.669
And there were, of course, plenty of wives and girlfriends of famous

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.513
footballers who had no claim to fame themselves, they were just

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:08.123
normal non-celebrity members of the public, you know, like you and me.

00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:14.243
But clearly, when you marry a Premier League footballer, and the lens of the

00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:19.313
paparazzi is on you, you become something of a celebrity in your own right.

00:04:20.742 --> 00:04:25.622
Magazines want to print pictures of you going shopping or out for a coffee.

00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:30.712
Suddenly you are someone, just because of the person you are with.

00:04:32.092 --> 00:04:36.702
Two such ladies were Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.

00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:42.072
Coleen Rooney was in fact a member of this original “WAG” group.

00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:46.502
She had met a boy called Wayne when they were both 12 years

00:04:46.502 --> 00:04:50.022
old, and they had been teenage girlfriend and boyfriend.

00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:56.322
This boy, Wayne, would grow up and become the youngest ever player to

00:04:56.322 --> 00:05:01.582
play for England when he was 17, then sign for Manchester United at 18.

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:07.622
He is now retired from the sport as a player, but he enjoyed a long and

00:05:07.622 --> 00:05:13.314
successful career, starting in 2002 and continuing for almost 20 years.

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:18.262
Rebekah Vardy joined the world of football a little later.

00:05:19.182 --> 00:05:23.932
She worked as a nightclub promoter, she met an already successful footballer

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:29.022
called Jamie Vardy, the pair got married a couple of years later, in 2016.

00:05:30.412 --> 00:05:35.532
Importantly for our story, Jamie Vardy and Wayne Rooney were

00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:41.251
England teammates, they played together from 2015 to 2018.

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:46.652
But, that’s the last we’ll hear, pretty much, about Wayne Rooney and

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:51.562
Jamie Vardy, as they are very much minor characters in this story.

00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:56.332
Today, it’s all about their wives, Coleen and Rebekah.

00:05:57.512 --> 00:06:02.662
The two women were reportedly close friends, but they were very different,

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:07.372
and had differing ideas about how they wanted to be seen by the press.

00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:12.182
Coleen Rooney had been in the public eye since she was a teenager.

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:15.965
As soon as Wayne Rooney, her then boyfriend, became

00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:19.475
famous, the press turned its attention also to her.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:26.505
She was relatively publicity shy, not courting attention, not looking to be

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:31.125
written about or photographed, but she could not escape the photographer’s lens.

00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:37.073
And, given that she spent practically her entire life as a semi-celebrity,

00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:40.903
there has been plenty of media interest in her as an individual.

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.759
Rebekah Vardy, on the other hand, was not so used to being

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:50.119
in the public eye, she was playing catch-up, you could say.

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:56.746
She was 32 when she met Jame Vardy, she had already been married twice before.

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:02.956
Jamie Vardy wasn’t actually the first footballer she had been in a relationship with.

00:07:03.586 --> 00:07:07.656
She dated another football player from a club called Oxford United.

00:07:08.716 --> 00:07:13.406
Oxford United, in case you weren’t aware, isn’t a particularly good team,

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:17.946
and her ex-boyfriend would later claim that she was always jealous of the

00:07:17.946 --> 00:07:22.566
wives and girlfriends of Premier League players - people like Coleen Rooney.

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:29.276
Now, I don’t want to get too much into gossip and rumour, although it is hard when

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:33.926
talking about this particular subject, I just wanted to give you some of the background

00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:38.846
information, so that you can get a measure of the characters of our two protagonists.

00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:42.236
So, what actually happened?

00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:46.986
Well, for several months, Coleen Rooney had been claiming that someone

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:51.716
had been leaking private details about her life to the British press.

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:58.956
Someone, one of her trusted inner circle, must have spilled the beans, as there were stories

00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:05.586
published that revealed secrets about her life that she had only told to a select few close friends.

00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:13.316
And on October the 9th, of 2019, there was the bombshell, the big announcment.

00:08:14.596 --> 00:08:18.696
It was a tweet, and I may as well read you all of it, as

00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:22.116
you’ll see that Coleen Rooney has quite the knack for drama.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.886
OK, so here we go.

00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:26.396
The tweet went:

00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:33.126
For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account

00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:39.166
has been consistently  informing The SUN newspaper of my private posts and stories.

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:43.706
There has been so much information given to them about me, my

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:47.956
friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:56.076
After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.

00:08:57.066 --> 00:09:00.116
To try and prove this, I came up with an idea.

00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:06.396
I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account.

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:10.896
In brackets: [Those on my private account must have been wondering

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:14.176
why I haven't had stories on there for a while.] Close brackets.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.546
Over the past five months I have posted a series of false

00:09:19.546 --> 00:09:23.116
stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:25.796
And you know what, they did!

00:09:26.976 --> 00:09:30.646
The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to

00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:35.156
TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:39.647
It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at

00:09:39.647 --> 00:09:44.286
all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:50.486
Now I know for certain which account or individual it's come from.

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:54.716
I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:58.936
which clearly show just one person has viewed them.

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:05.296
It's ........Rebekah Vardy's account.

00:10:05.831 --> 00:10:07.516
[sharp intake of breath]

00:10:08.446 --> 00:10:10.356
It was a scandalous accusation.

00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:16.066
Rebekah Vardy, her supposed great friend, stood accused of

00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:21.076
selling secrets about Coleen’s private life to the Sun newspaper.

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:25.926
Rebekah Vardy immediately took to social media to deny

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:30.396
this, asking why would she sell secrets on her friends.

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:33.876
Her husband earned a hundred and fifty thousand Euros a week

00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:37.186
as a striker for Leicester City, she didn’t need the money.

00:10:38.726 --> 00:10:44.106
As you might expect, this story was lapped up by the newspapers

00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:49.386
and gossip magazines, it was the ultimate celebrity spat, a public

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:53.876
argument between two people who were no stranger to the gossip pages

00:10:55.202 --> 00:11:00.692
Coleen Rooney was even dubbed “Wagatha Christie” by one journalist, so a

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:05.762
combination of WAG and Agatha Christie, the famous murder mystery novelist.

00:11:07.153 --> 00:11:13.313
This term stuck, “Wagatha Christie”, and the British press hung on every new

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:19.053
accusation or denial in this feud, which was fought in public on social media.

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:27.085
The feud only intensified as Rebekah Vardy not only continued to deny any involvement in

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:33.725
it, but in June the following year she revealed that she was going to take Coleen Rooney

00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:40.555
to court for libel, for accusing her of something in public that damaged her reputation.

00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:48.762
She wanted £1 million in compensation, so that's something like €1.2 million.

00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:57.072
It went to court, and in November of that year a judge ruled in Rebekah Vardy’s favour, saying that

00:11:57.122 --> 00:12:02.922
an ordinary reader, a normal member of the public, would have understood that Coleen Rooney was

00:12:02.932 --> 00:12:09.442
accusing Rebekah Vardy personally of having leaked the story, and having besmirched her good name.

00:12:10.932 --> 00:12:15.222
Rooney was ordered to pay just under €30,000 in compensation

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:19.612
to Vardy, but this was only the first stage of the process.

00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:25.452
The next stage of the case required Coleen Rooney to prove beyond

00:12:25.452 --> 00:12:30.312
reasonable doubt that Rebekah Vardy had personally shared this insider

00:12:30.342 --> 00:12:34.142
information, not just that it came from Rebekah Vardy’s Instagram account.

00:12:35.528 --> 00:12:42.142
To explain the difference, Vardy had claimed that maybe someone had accessed her Instagram

00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:47.122
account and sold the stories, she couldn’t be sure, but it was definitely not her.

00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:52.522
So, to chapter two of the story, and here is where

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.922
it becomes as dramatic as any Agatha Christie novel.

00:12:57.382 --> 00:13:02.372
As the trial dragged into 2021, it took a nasty turn as

00:13:02.422 --> 00:13:05.922
private messages sent by Rebekah Vardy were read out.

00:13:07.022 --> 00:13:11.112
In these messages, which were sent before Rooney had publicly accused

00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:18.462
Vardy, Vardy referred to Rooney as a quote “nasty bitch”, telling her

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:22.412
agent that she would love to leak stories about her to the newspapers.

00:13:23.022 --> 00:13:26.202
So she was calling her these names behind her back

00:13:26.442 --> 00:13:29.182
while still publicly claiming to be her good friend.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:35.152
Vardy’s agent would also be dragged into the case, as a

00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:38.312
WhatsApp message she sent to Vardy was shown to the court.

00:13:39.512 --> 00:13:42.792
This was a WhatsApp message from early 2019.

00:13:43.658 --> 00:13:49.322
Vardy’s agent had shared a picture of a tweet from Rooney saying that someone was betraying her,

00:13:49.922 --> 00:13:56.812
and sent it to Vardy with a laughing face emoji and the text “It wasn’t someone she trusted.

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:57.602
It was me.”

00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:01.392
Bad news for Rebekah Vardy.

00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:04.062
But it wasn’t definitive proof.

00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:09.132
To win the case, Coleen Rooney needed to prove that it was Vardy

00:14:09.132 --> 00:14:13.692
herself that shared the story with The Sun, and this message only

00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:17.902
showed that the agent had sold the story and that Vardy knew about it.

00:14:19.222 --> 00:14:25.432
Rooney needed more proof, and that proof surely could be found on the agent’s phone.

00:14:26.222 --> 00:14:31.132
This agent, after all, was clearly not very good at covering her tracks.

00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:38.252
But, in a terrible plot twist reminiscent of an Agatha Christie story, as the agent

00:14:38.352 --> 00:14:44.032
was on a boat in the North Sea, she mysteriously dropped her phone into the icy

00:14:44.032 --> 00:14:49.302
waters of the North Sea, with it plunging to the bottom, never to be found again.

00:14:50.452 --> 00:14:54.382
But how about the messages on Rebekah Vardy’s phone, I hear you ask?

00:14:55.182 --> 00:14:55.832
Good question.

00:14:56.912 --> 00:15:01.912
Rebekah Vardy told the court that she had employed an IT expert to help her

00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:07.622
export all of her conversations from her phone, but in the process all of

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:12.642
the messages had been deleted from the phone, and the IT expert couldn’t

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:16.332
remember the password for the encrypted device he had backed them up on.

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:19.842
They too were lost forever.

00:15:21.122 --> 00:15:23.992
What a series of unfortunate events.

00:15:24.612 --> 00:15:29.112
First the agent’s phone fell into the icy North Sea, then

00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:33.007
Rebekah Vardy’s IT expert permanently forgot the password.

00:15:33.878 --> 00:15:38.208
Both accidents, of course, but they meant that there was no way to

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:41.958
retrieve the messages that Coleen Rooney thought would prove conclusive.

00:15:43.158 --> 00:15:46.521
Still, the tide was turning for Rebekah Vardy.

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:53.028
She had first claimed she had no idea about any of this, then she had been forced to

00:15:53.028 --> 00:15:57.638
admit that her agent might have been selling stories about Rooney, but without Vardy’s

00:15:57.668 --> 00:16:02.515
permission, and then she had to admit that her agent might have been accessing her

00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:08.158
Instagram account and selling stories, but still without her permission, or so she claimed.

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:15.048
And the agent dropping the phone into the sea and Rebekah Vardy’s IT expert forgetting

00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:20.268
the password, well it was almost as if Rebekah Vardy was trying to hide something.

00:16:21.833 --> 00:16:26.948
Rooney’s lawyers pounced, and took the opportunity to present

00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:31.938
Vardy as an unreliable witness who had lied under oath.

00:16:32.848 --> 00:16:36.938
This was technically true, she had, but Rebekah Vardy

00:16:36.938 --> 00:16:40.228
wasn’t the sort of person to stand in court and be insulted.

00:16:41.148 --> 00:16:44.738
On the final day of the trial she stormed out of the court.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:52.348
And on July the 29th, 2022, almost three years after the first explosive

00:16:52.348 --> 00:16:57.188
accusation came from Coleen Rooney, the judge announced the court’s decision.

00:16:58.688 --> 00:17:03.338
The court ruled that it believed, beyond reasonable doubt, that it

00:17:03.338 --> 00:17:08.638
was indeed Rebekah Vardy who had sold the stories; she lost the case.

00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:15.268
Because it was only a libel case, not a criminal one, and it was Vardy

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:19.228
who brought the case against Rooney, Rebekah Vardy didn’t have to pay

00:17:19.228 --> 00:17:24.318
any damages, she was only ordered to pay 90% of Rooney’s legal fees.

00:17:25.198 --> 00:17:29.568
Still, it had been a lengthy process, and Rooney’s fees

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:34.700
were an estimated £1.5 million, so almost €2 million.

00:17:35.738 --> 00:17:41.278
And of course, Vardy had to pay her own fees, which are probably similar to Rooney’s,

00:17:41.618 --> 00:17:46.444
so the entire case will have cost her somewhere in the region of €4 million.

00:17:47.488 --> 00:17:53.758
Plus, her reputation is in tatters, as one article put it, “she will also

00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:58.658
have paid millions of pounds for the privilege of being publicly humiliated.”

00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:04.878
Fortunately, her husband is a highly paid footballer, and she also now

00:18:04.878 --> 00:18:09.748
has a series of licensing and reality TV deals, so it’s not like this

00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:14.488
will bankrupt Rebekkah and Jamie Vardy, but clearly it's a lot of money.

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:18.948
However, she does seem to have found a cunning way,

00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:22.498
potentially, of making some money out of the whole affair.

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:30.648
Yes, there are the TV appearances, the inevitable book deals and so forth, but it emerged

00:18:30.728 --> 00:18:36.158
earlier this year that Rebekkah Vardy had trademarked the term “Wagatha Christie”.

00:18:37.598 --> 00:18:42.958
Perhaps this is in an attempt to stop journalists writing about it using that catchy term,

00:18:43.503 --> 00:18:49.138
perhaps it’s to try to make some money out of merchandise or the film rights to the case, or

00:18:49.308 --> 00:18:55.328
perhaps it’s to try to sue people who have already used it, and get money out of them who knows?

00:18:56.628 --> 00:18:58.398
One thing is for sure, though.

00:18:59.108 --> 00:19:06.368
In the ongoing battle of the footballer’s wives, the score in this match was 1-0 to Coleen Rooney.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:15.078
OK then, that is it for today's episode on this unusual case of the warring footballer’s wives..

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.698
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:19.168 --> 00:19:21.418
Have there been any similar cases in your country?

00:19:21.998 --> 00:19:25.718
Why do you think we are so obsessed with the partners of celebrities?

00:19:26.148 --> 00:19:32.408
And what is it about footballers in particular that tabloids and gossip magazines love so much?

00:19:33.028 --> 00:19:36.168
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

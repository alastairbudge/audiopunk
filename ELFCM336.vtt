Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.060
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.569
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.080
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.650
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are
going to be talking about a lesser-known,

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.050
much darker side of British culture.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.000
One that has plagued Britain for
decades, and earned a reputation

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.169
abroad as the ‘British disease’.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.380
It’s the ugly side of the beautiful
game, football hooliganism,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.180
the British phenomenon of
fighting at football matches.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.680
Okay then, let’s get into it and talk
about the history of football hooliganism.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.220
On the far side of the stadium, the
crowd writhes around in the distance.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.569
The air is filled with panicked
screams and shouts, the smell of

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.360
beer, urine, and tobacco smoke.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.660
A plastic chair flies over your
head, followed by bottles and bricks.

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:18.697
Slowly, supporters from the far side
of the stadium close in, and you watch

00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:21.217
as they fight with police on the pitch.

00:01:21.757 --> 00:01:27.697
The police strike back with batons,
and the approaching fans throw bottles

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:33.087
and coins, punching and kicking
anything, and anyone, in their way.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:38.327
There are screams of fear and rage,
and chaos as people climb over

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:40.467
one another to try and escape.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:46.977
Some are knocked unconscious, face
down on the pitch, someone grabs you by

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:49.477
the arm, telling you it’s time to go.

00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:52.649
It is 1985.

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:56.697
You’re at a football stadium in
England, and you are watching

00:01:56.697 --> 00:01:58.497
the ‘British disease’ in action.

00:01:59.487 --> 00:02:03.577
So, how did this bizarre
British subculture develop?

00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:09.377
How could such an ugly tradition stem
from what billions of people the world

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:11.467
over know as the ‘beautiful game’?

00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:15.697
As always, we need to delve
into a bit of history.

00:02:16.287 --> 00:02:21.677
But don’t worry, for the non-football fans
among us, we won’t be going back and doing

00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:26.957
a blow-by-blow history of football, and
the next 20 minutes should be interesting,

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:31.097
whether you are a die-hard football fan
or you've never watched a game before.

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:37.497
Football fan or not, as I’m sure you'll
know, in many parts of the world - and

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:41.957
almost every single city, town and
village in Britain - football clubs

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.737
have a religious, cult-like following.

00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:50.207
They are often much more than a
sporting club, they are pillars of

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:54.537
the community that reflect local
history, politics, and religion.

00:02:55.397 --> 00:02:59.107
For some, this is an
attachment worth fighting for.

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:03.127
So, how did football hooliganism start?

00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:05.787
When were the first punches thrown?

00:03:06.847 --> 00:03:12.287
Well, as you may know, from the Chinese
to the Aztecs to the Ancient Greeks,

00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:17.407
many countries and civilisations
claim to have “invented” football.

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:23.237
The British claim comes from the
12th century, and even from the

00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:25.317
start it was a violent sport.

00:03:26.177 --> 00:03:31.007
It wasn’t an organised game with
rules and positions, and matches

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:32.447
weren’t played in stadiums.

00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:39.167
Instead, “football” was played between
two different villages, and played not

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.757
with a ball but a stuffed pig’s bladder.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:48.407
And the aim of the game wasn’t to kick
the ball, or rather, the pig’s bladder,

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:54.917
in the opposing team’s goal, but to kick
it across a heath - or field - in the

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:57.677
direction of the other village’s church.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:03.857
Unlike the pampered football stars
of today, 12th century football was

00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:06.817
an incredibly violent, lawless game.

00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:12.367
There were no referees, and people
would do anything they could to

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:16.017
stop the ball, the pig’s bladder,
from heading in the wrong direction.

00:04:16.537 --> 00:04:19.337
People were even killed during matches.

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:27.257
It was so violent that in 1349,
King Edward III banned football

00:04:27.407 --> 00:04:31.957
due to the violent rivalries and
mob mentality it was creating.

00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:37.307
The King also felt that football
had developed a cult-like following

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:42.057
that distracted people from their
civic and military responsibilities.

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:48.227
As the sport developed over the next
few centuries and rules were added,

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:53.827
clubs and leagues formed, and matches
started to be played on pitches.

00:04:54.997 --> 00:05:01.964
But one thing remained a part of the game
both on  and off the pitch: violence.

00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:08.314
Football historians believe that the
first recorded case of hooliganism in

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:15.644
modern football was at an 1885 match
between Preston North End and Aston

00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:18.424
Villa - two of England’s oldest clubs.

00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:24.474
On that day the supporters, who were
described in newspapers at the time as

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:30.744
‘howling roughs’, decided to do something
known in British dialect as ‘kick off’.

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:37.554
And this is an interesting example of an
expression that’s a noun and a phrasal

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.684
verb with two very different meanings.

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:46.424
“Kick off” as a noun is the start of a
football match, but if you use it as a

00:05:46.424 --> 00:05:52.804
verb, “to kick off”, it can mean to kick
off a match, to start a match, but it can

00:05:52.844 --> 00:05:56.254
also mean to erupt in violent behaviour.

00:05:56.921 --> 00:06:01.451
And it is this type of kicking
off that happened in 1885.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.534
After Preston North End went 5-0 up
against Aston Villa, the fans went mad,

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:13.504
attacking the players from both teams,
spitting on them, punching and kicking

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:19.264
them, and attacking them with sticks
and stones, so much so that one of the

00:06:19.264 --> 00:06:22.144
Preston players was knocked unconscious.

00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:29.324
And then the next year, in 1886, the
Preston North End fans would become the

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:34.034
first to do something that would go on
to become a common hooligan tactic in

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:36.814
later years - fighting in a train station.

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:42.664
It was around this time, in the
1890s, that historians believe that

00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:48.784
the term ‘hooligan’ was coined, or
first used, after a man named Patrick

00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:50.864
Hooligan killed a London policeman.

00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:54.424
Anyway, back to the hooligans themselves.

00:06:55.054 --> 00:07:00.504
And it’s back to the Preston North End
supporters again, when in 1905 a group

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:06.044
of supporters were tried in court for the
crime of being a hooligan when they kicked

00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:08.504
off after a match with Blackburn Rovers.

00:07:09.394 --> 00:07:13.924
Interestingly enough, the reports of
this group of hooligans included a

00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:17.164
"drunk and disorderly" 70-year-old woman.

00:07:18.384 --> 00:07:23.414
As you will probably know, most football
hooligans aren’t 70-year-old women,

00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:29.644
football hooliganism is an overwhelmingly
- almost entirely - young, male thing to do.

00:07:30.564 --> 00:07:34.224
In fact, the demographics
are even narrower than that.

00:07:35.014 --> 00:07:40.144
Football hooliganism is very much a
white, male, working-class subculture

00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:45.574
And it’s clearly a young man’s activity
too, with one report finding that the

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:51.894
vast majority of football hooligans in
the UK are between 25 to 44 years old.

00:07:52.614 --> 00:07:55.334
So, why are these football fans fighting?

00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:59.784
Well, sometimes the rivalries
go a lot deeper than simply

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.224
not liking another team.

00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:05.224
For one example of this
we can go to Scotland.

00:08:05.614 --> 00:08:08.794
Specifically, to Glasgow in 1909.

00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:14.584
If you’re a football fan, you’ll
know that there are two main football

00:08:14.584 --> 00:08:17.744
teams in Glasgow: Rangers, and Celtic.

00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:22.754
The match between the two clubs
is called the “Old Firm” derby,

00:08:23.104 --> 00:08:27.814
and it’s one of world football’s
fiercest and most violent rivalries.

00:08:28.804 --> 00:08:33.394
And the ‘Old Firm’, the match
between Rangers and Celtics, is

00:08:33.544 --> 00:08:35.504
about much more than football.

00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:41.714
It represents religious, political and
transnational divisions at the core of

00:08:41.724 --> 00:08:44.734
British - and Irish - society and history.

00:08:46.174 --> 00:08:51.344
As you might know, Celtic fans are
traditionally Catholics, of Irish

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:56.984
descent, and sympathetic to Irish
republicanism, whereas Rangers fans are

00:08:57.144 --> 00:09:01.624
Protestant, and, at least traditionally,
supportive of the United Kingdom.

00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:08.264
Celtic fans wave Irish flags at
matches, sing pro-Irish republican and

00:09:08.484 --> 00:09:14.444
anti-British songs, and the Rangers fans
fly British flags and sing provocative

00:09:14.644 --> 00:09:16.978
anti-Irish and anti-Catholic songs.

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:24.314
These derbies are always violent
events, but back in 1909 the ‘Old Firm’

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:29.994
derby ended in a mass riot that lasted
for two hours and resulted in the

00:09:29.994 --> 00:09:32.534
serious injury of over 50 policemen.

00:09:33.904 --> 00:09:38.774
So, as you can see, at the turn
of the 20th century, football

00:09:38.774 --> 00:09:40.574
matches were violent places.

00:09:41.034 --> 00:09:46.024
And this violence showed no signs
of abating, of slowing down.

00:09:47.314 --> 00:09:51.824
The First and Second World Wars, however,
and the years between them, provided

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:54.634
a bit of respite, a bit of peace.

00:09:55.514 --> 00:10:00.464
Not only did the country have more
pressing matters to deal with, but young

00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:05.264
men presumably realised that people from
other towns and cities weren’t so bad.

00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:09.064
So, violence at matches
started to decrease.

00:10:10.014 --> 00:10:14.374
But then the Second World War ended
and British society was flooded

00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:19.484
with former soldiers - many of them
unemployed, many of them traumatised

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:23.984
with what would today be called Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder - and football

00:10:23.984 --> 00:10:26.524
hooliganism had a bit of revival.

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:34.054
In the 1955-56 season, fans from another
of the British game’s biggest local

00:10:34.054 --> 00:10:39.034
rivalries, Liverpool and  Everton, were
involved in a number of ‘train-wrecking

00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:43.534
incidents’ where fans vandalised
and destroyed train carriages.

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:49.484
In fact, the post-war expansion of
Britain’s transport networks - both the

00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:53.724
rebuilding of its railways but also the
increasing number of national motorways

00:10:54.064 --> 00:10:59.454
and cars - allowed football hooligans
to travel more easily on ‘away days’.

00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:05.614
In case you weren’t aware, like in pretty
much every football league, in the British

00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:10.464
football leagues, teams play at their home
stadium, but they also travel to other

00:11:10.464 --> 00:11:12.664
towns and cities to play other clubs.

00:11:13.934 --> 00:11:19.614
By the time the 1960s came around
there were an average of 25 serious

00:11:19.684 --> 00:11:24.414
hooligan incidents a year, and football
hooliganism was beginning to embed

00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:26.644
itself into British sporting life.

00:11:27.674 --> 00:11:33.674
Whereas in the past football violence
had been more sporadic, or random, in the

00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:40.164
1960s, and in the 1970s, football violence
became more organised and habitual.

00:11:41.254 --> 00:11:44.764
It was around this time that
hooligans began to organise

00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:50.114
themselves into gangs known as
‘firms’ with hierarchies and members.

00:11:51.074 --> 00:11:55.754
And unlike in the United States, where
the sheer size of the country and

00:11:55.944 --> 00:12:00.634
its franchise system means it’s rare
for fans to travel to support their

00:12:00.634 --> 00:12:03.774
teams, in Britain this became the norm.

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:09.644
Each weekend, thousands of fans
would travel the length and breadth

00:12:09.794 --> 00:12:14.884
of the country on Britain’s railways
to support, to cheer on, their club.

00:12:16.114 --> 00:12:20.634
For many, they travelled not only
to support their club, but to fight.

00:12:21.483 --> 00:12:24.303
For some, that was the
only reason they went.

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:30.463
It almost goes without saying, but
alcohol - and often cocaine - played a

00:12:30.473 --> 00:12:33.443
huge role in fuelling football violence.

00:12:34.313 --> 00:12:39.331
Often on matchdays, supporters would
begin drinking in the early morning as

00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:41.381
they set off on their long journeys.

00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:47.343
In fact, special train services - known
as ‘Football specials’ - were put on

00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:49.683
to transport fans across the country.

00:12:50.653 --> 00:12:56.003
These journeys, known as ‘away days’,
became a huge part of hooligan culture.

00:12:56.963 --> 00:13:03.483
And from the 1970s onwards, firms began
to give themselves their own names.

00:13:04.413 --> 00:13:09.383
Some of the most famous football firms
emerged around this time, including the

00:13:09.543 --> 00:13:16.113
Leeds United ‘Service Crew’, Chelsea
‘Headhunters’, West Ham’s ‘Intercity

00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:20.103
Firm’ - which was named after the
train line they travelled on - as well

00:13:20.103 --> 00:13:25.153
as the Millwall ‘Bushwhackers’ and
Birmingham City’s ‘Zulu Warriors.’

00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:30.217
And when I say these firms were
becoming more organised, I don’t

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:31.957
just mean among themselves.

00:13:32.637 --> 00:13:37.937
A key part of football hooligan culture
is the cooperation between rival

00:13:37.937 --> 00:13:41.407
firms to set up and organise fights.

00:13:42.183 --> 00:13:47.423
So, in preparation for an ‘away day’,
one of the more senior members of

00:13:47.423 --> 00:13:52.153
the firm - often known as the ‘top
boy’ - will set up the fight with the

00:13:52.153 --> 00:13:54.463
leader of another team’s firm by phone.

00:13:55.063 --> 00:14:01.033
They arrange a time and place, sometimes
at the stadium but often further afield to

00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:06.113
avoid the eyes of the police, who by the
1970s were beginning to take the problem

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.073
of football violence more seriously.

00:14:09.273 --> 00:14:13.053
And it was around this time
that the very ‘British disease’

00:14:13.243 --> 00:14:14.863
began to spread across Europe.

00:14:15.643 --> 00:14:19.243
Hooligan groups started forming
in other European countries.

00:14:19.713 --> 00:14:24.003
And though there were clear similarities
with the hooligans of British

00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:28.913
football, each club and country
developed its own style and identity.

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:35.153
Hooliganism became particularly popular
in Italy, where its ‘ultra’ fans were

00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:40.353
aligned to fascist politics, but also
in Germany, Holland, and further afield

00:14:40.353 --> 00:14:42.313
in places like Turkey and Russia.

00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:48.593
And not only did the disease of
hooliganism cross borders, but the

00:14:48.593 --> 00:14:54.253
hooligans and firms themselves too, as
fans began travelling internationally and

00:14:54.453 --> 00:14:56.983
crossing borders for European matches.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:03.253
On their European travels in the
late-1970s, many British hooligans

00:15:03.463 --> 00:15:08.553
picked up on continental sportswear
and began incorporating it into their

00:15:08.763 --> 00:15:13.613
own fashion sense - a style that
became known as ‘football casual’.

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.783
This served two purposes.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:22.853
Firstly, to show off their expensive
designer European brands to their rivals.

00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:25.753
But it was also camouflage.

00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:30.583
It was “casual” in the sense that
firms stopped wearing traditional team

00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:36.943
colours because it was easier to blend
in, to avoid the police, and infiltrate

00:15:37.053 --> 00:15:39.553
rival club’s stadiums and pubs.

00:15:40.783 --> 00:15:45.953
It was during this period, in the
1970s moving into the 1980s, that

00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:51.363
was the high point [or perhaps, low
point] of football hooligan activity.

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:57.783
In a 1985 FA cup fixture between
Luton and Millwall, for example,

00:15:58.307 --> 00:16:02.893
31 fans were arrested after
violence left 81 people injured.

00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:08.193
Fans rioted, ripped out stadium
seats and attacked policemen.

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:12.963
A knife was thrown at a player,
and a “Football Special” train

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.923
had its ceiling ripped off.

00:16:15.923 --> 00:16:21.083
After the riot, a British Rail spokesman
said that "it was like a bomb had

00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:23.293
exploded inside some of the carriages."

00:16:24.589 --> 00:16:29.537
Unfortunately during this period,
political instability in British society

00:16:29.617 --> 00:16:33.687
meant that far-right politics began
intermingling with football violence.

00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:39.447
Fascist groups such as the National
Front began infiltrating and

00:16:39.627 --> 00:16:43.957
appealing to hooligan firms, and
there was a huge amount of racist

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:45.767
abuse towards black players.

00:16:46.697 --> 00:16:51.877
Fascist political literature was sold
outside stadiums, racism at football

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:56.797
matches became rampant, and although
the number of active National Front

00:16:56.827 --> 00:17:01.607
members involved in organised football
violence is perhaps overstated, it wasn’t

00:17:01.627 --> 00:17:06.207
as large as people said it was, they
were certainly a very loud and visible

00:17:06.237 --> 00:17:08.247
element of football casual culture.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.659
The 1980s also saw some of the
deadliest episodes of football

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:17.549
violence that would have far-reaching
consequences on hooligan culture.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:25.399
The Heysel Stadium disaster, in Belgium,
on the 29th of May, 1985, was one of them.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:31.019
It happened at the European Cup
Final between Liverpool and Juventus,

00:17:31.239 --> 00:17:36.749
and was a tragedy that killed
39 people and left 400 injured.

00:17:38.088 --> 00:17:42.778
After being attacked at a match in
Rome the previous year, Liverpool

00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:47.668
hooligans saw Heysel as an opportunity
for revenge against the Italians

00:17:47.888 --> 00:17:51.718
and they managed to break into the
Juventus’ section of the stadium.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:58.594
As the Juventus fans fled, a
wall collapsed and crushed 39

00:17:58.604 --> 00:18:01.494
people - mostly Italians - to death.

00:18:02.864 --> 00:18:08.754
As a result of the tragedy, all English
football clubs were banned indefinitely

00:18:08.894 --> 00:18:14.024
from playing in European competition, and
fourteen Liverpool fans were found guilty

00:18:14.024 --> 00:18:16.774
of manslaughter, of accidental murder.

00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:22.644
This ‘British disease’ had spread
to Europe with deadly consequences.

00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:28.854
Then, a few years later, another incident
synonymous with football hooliganism

00:18:29.104 --> 00:18:34.084
- but unjustly so, as I will explain in
a minute - happened in Sheffield, which

00:18:34.084 --> 00:18:36.064
is a city in the north of England.

00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:44.074
In 1989, 96 Liverpool fans were crushed
to death at Hillsborough Stadium during

00:18:44.074 --> 00:18:48.294
an FA Cup semi-final fixture between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

00:18:49.114 --> 00:18:53.974
It was the deadliest event in British
sporting history, and the police

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:58.444
and British media [and much of the
general public, it must be said] were

00:18:58.474 --> 00:19:00.734
quick to blame the Liverpool fans.

00:19:01.384 --> 00:19:06.454
With memories of Heysel still fresh in
people’s minds, the Liverpool fans were

00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:09.664
painted as violent hooligans and drunks.

00:19:10.544 --> 00:19:15.404
For years the British police,
public, and press all cited the

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:19.884
Hillsborough disaster as yet another
example of the deadly consequences

00:19:19.884 --> 00:19:21.514
of Britain's hooligan culture.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.974
But in reality, it wasn’t
actually that simple.

00:19:26.894 --> 00:19:31.874
After years of investigations and
inquiries, it was revealed that poor

00:19:31.874 --> 00:19:36.994
policing, particularly crowd management,
caused the crush, and that hooliganism

00:19:37.234 --> 00:19:39.834
had not been a factor in the tragedy.

00:19:41.204 --> 00:19:45.684
The Hillsborough disaster, however,
did indirectly contribute to a

00:19:45.714 --> 00:19:47.314
decrease in football hooliganism.

00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:52.734
After the disaster, a number of safety
improvements were made in English

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:56.964
football stadiums, most notably
the replacement of fenced standing

00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:59.184
terraces with fully seated-stadiums.

00:19:59.794 --> 00:20:02.414
Essentially, there was a
seat for every spectator.

00:20:03.294 --> 00:20:08.024
This not only made football stadiums
safer, but also made it easier to

00:20:08.194 --> 00:20:12.814
separate rival fans, which is clearly
a good thing if you want to stop

00:20:12.824 --> 00:20:14.174
people from fighting each other.

00:20:15.404 --> 00:20:19.834
Unsurprisingly, after the disasters
at Heysel and Hillsborough, and

00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:23.654
the growing football violence
during the 1980s more widely, there

00:20:23.654 --> 00:20:26.004
was a crackdown on hooliganism.

00:20:26.784 --> 00:20:31.624
There was an increased police presence
at matches, and longer prison sentences

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:34.014
given for those convicted of hooliganism.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:40.314
By this point, fewer football clubs,
and fewer fans, were suffering

00:20:40.314 --> 00:20:44.674
from this “British Disease”,
and in the 1990s violence at

00:20:44.674 --> 00:20:46.514
football matches started to drop.

00:20:47.094 --> 00:20:53.384
Not only was there more CCTV, and harsher
punishments if you were caught, but

00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:59.314
the generation of hooligans from the
‘heyday’ of the 1980s was growing older.

00:21:00.324 --> 00:21:05.644
What’s more, this crackdown also came as
the sport was becoming professionalised

00:21:05.654 --> 00:21:10.004
and commercialised - as Britain’s
Premier League was established and

00:21:10.154 --> 00:21:14.424
became an international television
product, the game was cleaned up.

00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:19.654
At last, football matches were
becoming less violent places.

00:21:20.524 --> 00:21:25.534
And if you go to a British football
game today, you probably won’t see any

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.554
signs of the hooligans of the past.

00:21:28.414 --> 00:21:32.524
But at least you’ll know, if you
didn’t before, that football in

00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:34.914
Britain has a violent history.

00:21:35.774 --> 00:21:40.134
Whether it be the brutal clashes
between villages in the 12th century,

00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:45.114
the emergence of hooliganism in the
late-19th century, sectarian riots

00:21:45.114 --> 00:21:49.814
in Glasgow; or the highly-organised,
ultra-violent hooliganism of the

00:21:49.814 --> 00:21:55.724
1970s and 1980s, British football
was often more like war than sport.

00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:57.294
The firms.

00:21:57.494 --> 00:21:58.224
The clothes.

00:21:58.254 --> 00:21:58.669
The chants.

00:21:58.954 --> 00:21:59.704
The alcohol.

00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:00.504
The danger.

00:22:00.524 --> 00:22:01.734
The away days.

00:22:01.934 --> 00:22:02.714
The violence.

00:22:02.824 --> 00:22:04.564
And sometimes, the death.

00:22:05.544 --> 00:22:09.424
There was a very good reason it
was called “The British Disease”.

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:17.134
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode
on football hooliganism in Britain,

00:22:17.204 --> 00:22:19.524
the ugly side of the beautiful game.

00:22:20.194 --> 00:22:24.074
I hope it was an interesting one, and
whether you knew a lot about football

00:22:24.074 --> 00:22:28.164
hooliganism before, or this was the
first time you’d heard anything about it,

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:30.014
well I hope you learned something new.

00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:34.134
As always, I would love to know
what you thought about this episode.

00:22:34.484 --> 00:22:37.674
Did you know much about British
football hooliganism before today?

00:22:38.194 --> 00:22:40.344
Are there football
hooligans in your country?

00:22:40.744 --> 00:22:45.134
Is going to a football match considered
a safe or dangerous thing in your city?

00:22:45.624 --> 00:22:49.024
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.149
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.799
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:28.419
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The English of Boris Johnson.

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:35.436
The episode a few weeks ago on The English of Donald Trump proved to be one of the most

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:41.486
popular ones we’ve done so far, so, by popular demand, today we are going to be talking

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:47.166
about Trump’s British counterpart, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson.

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:54.556
Before we get right into that though, let me remind you that you can get all of the bonus episodes,

00:00:54.566 --> 00:01:01.576
plus subtitles, transcripts, and key vocabulary, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:05.969
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:12.099
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.559
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:21.999
So if that sounds good to you, and I certainly hope it

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.079
does, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.019
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.769
You probably know a bit about Boris Johnson, and today’s episode isn’t going to be a

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:41.129
history lesson about the man, and his rise to power, although we will touch on that.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:50.159
We are instead going to focus on how he talks, the language he uses, why he talks this way, why

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.059
this appeals to British people, and we’ll also talk about how different this is to Donald Trump.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:05.457
But we do need a little background before we get right into his language, because it’s

00:02:05.557 --> 00:02:11.407
first important to understand exactly who Boris Johnson actually is, where he comes

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:17.497
from, and to try to get into the mind of the man, before we talk about his language.

00:02:18.787 --> 00:02:25.907
So, the first thing that we need to clarify is that his first name isn’t actually Boris.

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:27.507
It’s Alexander.

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:34.357
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in 1964, in New York.

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:40.317
His family, reportedly, still calls him ‘Al’, short for Alexander.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:48.547
He started using the name ‘Boris’ when he began Eton, the most exclusive boarding school

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:53.857
in the United Kingdom, and where countless previous prime ministers had gone to school.

00:02:54.877 --> 00:03:00.517
Alexander is a relatively common name in the United Kingdom, but Alexander

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:05.167
Boris de Pfeffel Johnson wanted to be anything other than common.

00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:11.207
Boris, on the other hand, is not a common name, and so evidently

00:03:11.497 --> 00:03:16.267
this suited the 13-year old Boris Johnson much better than Alexander.

00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:23.977
So we can clearly see, from a young age that Boris knew the importance of public

00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:30.087
image - your name matters, and if you want to stand out, you need to be different.

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:37.747
Johnson continued his very privileged upbringing, going from Eton to Oxford, being the

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:44.557
president of something called the Oxford Union, the debating society that is a sort of stepping

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:52.147
stone to British politics, and then had a series of jobs as a journalist before becoming

00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:59.257
an MP, a member of Parliament, then Mayor of London, an MP again and now Prime Minister.

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:06.787
We have evidently sped through his career, we've gone very fast through it, but, the thing to

00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:14.715
remember is that he had an incredibly good education and seemed to just cruise through life from

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:20.625
exclusive school to exclusive university through to his current position as the Prime Minister.

00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:28.105
While it’s easy to put this down to wealth and privilege, Johnson won a scholarship

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:33.825
to Eton and Oxford, which you can’t do unless you are very academically talented.

00:04:34.555 --> 00:04:42.045
Clearly, he was smart, but he was also lazy, and reportedly would wait until the last minute to

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:48.595
actually do any work, which seems quite believable if you have seen how his government operates.

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:55.365
In any case, from a young age, Johnson had a keen interest in language.

00:04:56.205 --> 00:05:01.955
He studied Classics at Oxford, Latin and Greek, which to those of you outside

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:08.828
the UK might not seem like the route to financial success and power, however it

00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:14.878
was for a long time considered the only respectable course for the British ruling

00:05:14.878 --> 00:05:20.950
class - a gentleman should know how to use Latin and Greek, and shouldn’t be bothered

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.520
with more practical studies, of mathematics or business, or anything like that.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.630
His classical education is still very visible when you hear him speak, and he often uses

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.450
probably some of the most complicated, archaic vocabulary of any English-speaking world leader,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.210
the kind of words that even most English speakers would have to look up in a dictionary.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.000
Just have a listen to this clip and see if you can understand what he’s saying.

00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:54.823
Front row by the way.

00:05:56.853 --> 00:05:59.853
And why is he, why is Achilles so cheesed off?

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:05.223
Because somebody has taken away his prize, his gerass, a girl by the

00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:09.873
name of Briseis of the lovely cheeks and who has done this to him?

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:12.923
A man who cannot run as fast as Achilles.

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:17.043
A man who is not as good at fighting as Achilles, who's less clever, less charismatic.

00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:24.148
And yet who is able to expropriate his girlfriend or slave girl war booty to be exact because

00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:33.378
he, that man, is set in obscure and supposedly God-given authority because he is a King.

00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:39.678
And in the wrath of Achilles, we find not just the bruised ego of a proud man.

00:06:39.978 --> 00:06:42.858
In that first line of Greek literature we find

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.380
if you got that, congratulations.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.610
This is Boris Johnson taking part in a debate of ancient Rome versus ancient Greece.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.460
With Boris Johnson, there is almost always a reason for everything.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.950
He has cultivated this image as a scruffy, lazy, normal person

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.760
with the same vices, the same problems as everyone else.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.670
But this is highly cultivated.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:18.300
His hair is always messy, but he messes it up before he goes in front of a TV camera.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.310
He makes sure that the photographers are taking pictures of him when he goes out running

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.470
dressed in ridiculous clothes, and it is all part of a carefully maintained image.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:38.110
As one of his first bosses said, “He is a sly fox, disguised as a teddy bear.”

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.020
So, coming back to the language he uses, we have to think that there

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.260
is a reason for using this kind of complicated, archaic language.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.840
On one level, it’s strange, as Johnson knows the power of communicating clearly.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.090
Here’s him explaining exactly that.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.190
I think one thing that is.

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:03.375
Incredibly important is to try to speak.

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:04.985
I fail totally in this.

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:08.075
I catch myself endlessly on the radio.

00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:13.215
You're waffling and blurbing and using all sorts of endless Latinate words in

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:18.365
exactly that way and that what people listen to are short Anglo Saxon words

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:23.165
that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify.

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:23.945
So.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:30.925
In other words, talk, talk, simply use plain English and talk about stuff in the real world.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:35.097
But Johnson can’t resist using this complicated language.

00:08:35.407 --> 00:08:39.337
He knows that, although it shows his privilege and his

00:08:39.377 --> 00:08:43.827
elite education, this actually helps him seem more genuine.

00:08:45.027 --> 00:08:50.787
In Britain, and perhaps this comes from the historically highly class-based

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:58.177
society, there is this strange tradition of having a educated, upper-class person

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:04.027
in a position of power, and everyone just automatically trusting them it seems.

00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:11.947
Boris’s language screams elite education, as does his accent, and so exactly

00:09:12.047 --> 00:09:16.657
where he comes from is very clear from the words that come out of his mouth.

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:23.327
But while other politicians who might have had a similarly privileged upbringing,

00:09:23.677 --> 00:09:28.427
or indeed Prince William or Prince Harry, they would shy away, they would

00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:34.197
hide from their elite education by softening their accents, or trying to

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:39.617
talk in a more ‘man on the street’ way, Johnson does completely the opposite.

00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:45.987
He makes no apologies for his education, and he makes no apologies for his wealth.

00:09:46.707 --> 00:09:52.457
Indeed, when he was Mayor of London he also wrote a weekly newspaper

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:58.657
column for the Daily Telegraph, for which he was paid £250,000 a year.

00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:04.767
When he was questioned about having this very well-paying second

00:10:04.777 --> 00:10:09.827
job, he dismissed the money as ‘chicken-feed’ - food for chicken.

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:17.877
This was in 2009, right after the financial crisis hit, but it didn’t really matter as his

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:24.407
persona that he had created, and the language he used, had already positioned him in people’s

00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:31.327
minds as this intellectual man who had a god-given right to be rich, so what did it matter

00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:37.427
if he thought that a second job that paid more than 8 times the national average was nothing?

00:10:37.947 --> 00:10:38.967
He was Boris.

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:46.377
So, Boris Johnson uses complicated language to impress, to position himself in

00:10:46.377 --> 00:10:51.867
people’s minds as a member of the intellectual elite, born to lead the country.

00:10:53.077 --> 00:10:59.717
But the rest of his persona, from the messy clothes to the multitude of affairs

00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:04.977
he has had - he still, interestingly enough, refuses to say exactly how many

00:11:04.987 --> 00:11:11.377
children he has - all of this ‘unpolitically correct’ behaviour has helped

00:11:11.427 --> 00:11:18.277
create this strange image of a man who is both elite but also completely normal.

00:11:19.207 --> 00:11:26.327
He has human flaws that people can relate to, and this humanises someone who has

00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:33.407
otherwise lived a life so completely different to 99.99% of people in the UK.

00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:40.297
So, coming back to language again, whatever anyone’s political views on Boris

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:45.867
Johnson are, it’s hard to contest the fact that he does have an excellent range of

00:11:45.877 --> 00:11:52.757
vocabulary, and has the ability to use language to create very memorable images.

00:11:54.027 --> 00:12:00.067
Now, this can be both positive and negative, but in both cases it’s very powerful.

00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:08.187
In 2004, for example, when asked about the fact that the prime minister Tony Blair wasn’t appearing

00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:15.977
for press interviews, Johnson compared Blair to “a mixture of Harry Houdini and a greased piglet”.

00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:22.207
Harry Houdini was the famous escape artist, a piglet is a baby

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:26.737
pig, and greased means covered in grease, so it’s very slippery.

00:12:28.107 --> 00:12:35.237
When one of Johnson’s speeches was criticised by Arnold Schwarzenegger, he said "It was

00:12:35.237 --> 00:12:42.147
a low moment to have my rhetorical skills denounced by a monosyllabic Austrian cyborg.”

00:12:43.227 --> 00:12:47.477
Monosyllabic, in case you didn’t know that word, means only speaking in monosyllables,

00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:55.777
short words only consisting of one syllable, and cyborg is a sort of part human, part robot.

00:12:56.817 --> 00:13:00.817
And when he was asked about whether he wanted to become Prime Minister of

00:13:00.817 --> 00:13:06.297
the UK, he said that he stood as much chance of being prime minister as

00:13:06.297 --> 00:13:12.307
he did of “being reincarnated as an olive”, of being reborn as an olive.

00:13:13.437 --> 00:13:20.727
These are, for the most part, quite funny, very visual and memorable, and not deeply offensive.

00:13:21.677 --> 00:13:25.767
But he has used the same linguistic style to conjure

00:13:25.797 --> 00:13:29.897
up images that certainly are divisive and offensive.

00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:34.327
He wrote a column in the Daily Telegraph that compared Muslim

00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:38.677
women who wear the burqa to "bank robbers and "letter boxes".

00:13:39.657 --> 00:13:44.447
He said that if gay marriage was OK, then he saw no reason in

00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:49.297
principle why three men shouldn’t get married, or two men and a dog.

00:13:50.727 --> 00:13:55.617
And referring to the EU, he said that "Napoleon, Hitler,

00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:59.297
various people tried this out, and it ends tragically.

00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:03.417
The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods."

00:14:04.357 --> 00:14:10.787
Part of the reason that this language is so effective is that it is memorable, it’s the complete

00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:17.687
opposite of the kind of avoiding, non-committal language that British politicians used before him.

00:14:18.777 --> 00:14:23.527
Like politicians in many countries, British politicians would often

00:14:23.757 --> 00:14:28.957
avoid actually saying what was going on, instead preferring to just

00:14:29.197 --> 00:14:32.807
repeat a point that their communications team had told them to say.

00:14:33.867 --> 00:14:39.677
In some cases this was almost comic - just have a listen to this clip

00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:44.167
of the previous leader of the Labour party, a man called Ed Miliband.

00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:48.327
Listen to him repeating the same thing over and over.

00:14:50.267 --> 00:14:53.717
These strikes are wrong at a time when negotiations are still going

00:14:53.717 --> 00:14:57.487
on, but parents and the public have been let down by both sides

00:14:57.757 --> 00:15:00.697
because the government has acted in a reckless and provocative manner.

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:05.372
After today's disruption, I urge both sides to put aside the rhetoric,

00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:08.612
get around the negotiating table and stop it happening again.

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:12.082
Um, I listened to your speech in Wrexham, you talked about the

00:15:12.082 --> 00:15:14.512
Labour party being a movement, a lot of people in that movement.

00:15:14.992 --> 00:15:17.872
Uh, are people on strike today and they'll be looking at you and

00:15:17.872 --> 00:15:20.792
thinking, well, you're describing these strikes as wrong while aren't

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:23.232
you giving us more leadership as a leader of the labour movement.

00:15:23.692 --> 00:15:28.222
At a time when negotiations are still going on, I do believe these strikes are wrong.

00:15:28.642 --> 00:15:33.242
And that's why I say both sides should after today's disruption get around

00:15:33.242 --> 00:15:37.412
the negotiating table, put aside the rhetoric and solve the problem out.

00:15:37.532 --> 00:15:40.292
Because the public and parents have been let down by both sides.

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.902
The government's acted in a reckless and provocative manner.

00:15:44.525 --> 00:15:45.625
Ridiculous, right?

00:15:46.915 --> 00:15:49.045
Johnson was a breath of fresh air.

00:15:49.655 --> 00:15:56.445
He didn’t seem to have a filter, he made offensive statements, and didn’t abide by the status quo.

00:15:57.405 --> 00:16:01.345
It’s probably about now that you are thinking I’m going to make a comparison

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:06.855
between another world leader with a strange, blond hairdo and Boris Johnson.

00:16:07.525 --> 00:16:09.425
Don’t worry, that’s coming in a minute.

00:16:10.945 --> 00:16:15.203
First though, there’s a final point about Boris Johnson that actually

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:19.968
puts him in exactly the same category as previous politicians that avoid

00:16:20.278 --> 00:16:24.358
answering tough questions, like our earlier example of Ed Miliband.

00:16:25.398 --> 00:16:32.608
Instead of avoiding the question or just repeating a previous point, Johnson would use humour

00:16:32.798 --> 00:16:39.168
to not answer the question or change the subject, often using archaic, complicated language.

00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:44.328
For example, he was asked about rumours that he was having

00:16:44.328 --> 00:16:48.638
an affair and had got a woman pregnant, he replied with:

00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:51.418
“I have not had an affair with Petronella.

00:16:51.968 --> 00:16:53.698
It is complete balderdash.

00:16:53.968 --> 00:16:56.483
It is an inverted pyramid of piffle.”

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:02.748
Now, the ‘I have not had an affair with Petronella’ part you probably understand.

00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:05.028
The next part might be harder.

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:11.268
Balderdash is an old, uncommon word meaning something that’s completely made up.

00:17:11.918 --> 00:17:15.488
An inverted pyramid means a pyramid that is upside

00:17:15.488 --> 00:17:20.288
down, and piffle is a word meaning nonsense, not true.

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:23.808
Don’t worry if you didn’t understand it, that isn’t

00:17:23.818 --> 00:17:26.788
language that you would find many native speakers using.

00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:30.932
The rumours, by the way, turned out to be completely true.

00:17:31.952 --> 00:17:36.812
It’s time now to make a few comparisons between the current residents of

00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:42.302
10 Downing Street and The White House, and to think a little bit about how

00:17:42.322 --> 00:17:46.632
the language of Boris Johnson compares to the language of Donald Trump.

00:17:47.672 --> 00:17:50.782
On one level, they are polar opposites.

00:17:51.322 --> 00:17:56.392
Johnson uses complicated, intellectual language, thinks of himself

00:17:56.432 --> 00:18:01.882
as a scholar, writes history books, and wants to be seen as a public

00:18:01.892 --> 00:18:07.072
intellectual and member of the ruling class, someone who is destined to rule.

00:18:08.102 --> 00:18:14.365
Trump, on the other hand, has no interest in history, a very basic language, positions

00:18:14.365 --> 00:18:20.342
himself as an outsider, and believes that your bank balance is a sign of how smart you are.

00:18:21.362 --> 00:18:27.982
Yet here they both are, riding populist waves, certainly both ‘elite’ in terms of

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:33.162
how rich they are, yet positioning themselves as the saviours of the working class.

00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:38.782
You can think of this as an example of the difference between the UK and the US.

00:18:39.682 --> 00:18:46.032
In the UK a man who demonstrates his privilege through every word that comes out of his mouth

00:18:46.472 --> 00:18:52.412
can appeal to the poorest in society, partly because of this idea I mentioned earlier where

00:18:52.772 --> 00:18:59.742
there’s this culture, this tradition, of intellectual upper-class normally men just being

00:18:59.762 --> 00:19:05.712
accepted as leaders, regardless of any other qualifications they might or rather might not have.

00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:11.592
In the US, on the other hand, Trump’s appeal is through this image he

00:19:11.662 --> 00:19:16.662
has created of a master businessman, so it almost doesn’t matter what

00:19:16.662 --> 00:19:20.892
kind of language he uses or whether he is thought to be a keen historian.

00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:27.452
No doubt a Boris Johnson type figure in the US, who used classical, complicated

00:19:27.452 --> 00:19:31.882
language and positioned himself as an intellectual would never work.

00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:38.552
Certainly it was one of the common criticisms of Obama, that he was too

00:19:38.832 --> 00:19:45.072
academic, too aloof, and unapproachable, too unlike the man on the street.

00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:51.802
And a Donald Trump-type figure, a brash businessman who bragged about how much money

00:19:51.802 --> 00:19:57.782
he had and spoke in short, basic sentences, would never have any success in the UK.

00:19:58.842 --> 00:20:03.132
Brits have this strange relationship with class, education

00:20:03.162 --> 00:20:07.262
and privilege, and Boris Johnson is the epitome of it.

00:20:08.222 --> 00:20:12.742
One final interesting point on Boris Johnson and language is something

00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:18.152
that he has been accused of trying to do, and that is manipulate Google

00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:22.232
search results for particular word combinations that he has used.

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:28.352
As you know, if you search for something on Google, it will show you the most popular result

00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:33.692
for what you type in, it will show you results for what Google thinks you are looking for.

00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:39.382
If you can control what Google thinks is popular, then you can push a

00:20:39.382 --> 00:20:43.652
result further down the search results, and mean it’s harder to find.

00:20:44.552 --> 00:20:51.072
For example if you remember the Brexit campaign, Boris Johnson had made a series of claims

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:58.132
about how much the UK pays to the EU, and he had toured the country in a big red bus.

00:20:58.862 --> 00:21:05.172
A few years after this campaign, in 2019, Boris Johnson gave a really strange

00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:11.942
interview where he was asked what he did to relax, and he said he painted model buses.

00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:18.832
Now, this, in the UK at least, would be a really unorthodox hobby.

00:21:20.122 --> 00:21:25.702
Nobody had ever heard of Johnson saying it, so it was a really strange thing to say.

00:21:27.372 --> 00:21:32.472
The theory goes that he was actually trying to manipulate the search results.

00:21:33.202 --> 00:21:37.592
Before, if you typed in 'Boris Johnson bus’, then you’d see

00:21:37.592 --> 00:21:40.722
things about him going around the country in the Brexit bus.

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:47.812
But after this interview, if you typed in 'Boris Johnson bus' then you would see articles

00:21:48.002 --> 00:21:54.072
about this weird interview, pushing the articles about the Brexit bus down the search results.

00:21:55.242 --> 00:22:01.222
Similarly, there were rumours of him having an affair with a model, and he then used the

00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:08.142
term 'model of restraint' in parliament, so if you searched for 'Boris Johnson model',

00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:13.642
you would see links about this quote as opposed to articles about him having an affair.

00:22:14.692 --> 00:22:18.302
Evidently, there is no way of proving this, and it’s not so

00:22:18.362 --> 00:22:22.002
easy to fool Google, but it certainly does seem very strange.

00:22:23.152 --> 00:22:26.322
So, that is the English of Boris Johnson.

00:22:26.742 --> 00:22:32.792
It’s a strange combination of unfiltered, classical, complicated,

00:22:32.872 --> 00:22:38.502
upper class, funny, offensive, but most definitely unique.

00:22:41.092 --> 00:22:44.682
OK then, that is it for today’s episode.

00:22:44.952 --> 00:22:47.352

00:22:47.372 --> 00:22:51.072

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:16.254
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:20.604
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.504
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:27.854
talking about something called Operation Underworld.

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:31.974
It’s an unbelievable story of collaboration between the US

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:37.144
government and an unlikely ally…the Italian-American mafia.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:43.814
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into the story of Operation Underworld.

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:54.824
On Sunday, December 7, 1941, at 7:48 a.m Hawaiian time, 353 Japanese

00:00:54.834 --> 00:01:00.074
bombers launched a surprise attack on the American base at Pearl Harbour.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:07.794
The result was, as you will know, the United States declaring war on Japan, with it, its

00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:13.904
Axis ally, Germany, and the balance of power starting to shift in the Second World War.

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:19.664
With the main field of battle in Europe, the Americans needed to send

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:24.162
supplies, military equipment and of course soldiers across the  Atlantic.

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:27.462
But there was a problem.

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:33.412
To get to Europe, ships needed to cross the Atlantic, weaving their

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:38.862
way past German submarines and bombers that roamed the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.442
Many didn’t make it through.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:46.932
Indeed, in the three months after Pearl Harbor, the

00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:52.072
United States lost 120 ships, more than one a day.

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:57.622
Of course, some losses were inevitable, they were to be expected.

00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:02.892
But many people suspected that these numbers were higher than they

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:07.912
should have been, and that spies were passing information to the enemy.

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:13.212
Vital information about these ships, and the details of where they

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:18.152
would be going and when was being shared with the Nazis, meaning that

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:21.802
the ships would be sunk before they reached their final destination.

00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:26.402
Some never even made it out of the American port.

00:02:27.472 --> 00:02:33.592
Most famously, on February the 9th, of 1942, so almost exactly three months

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:38.292
after Pearl Harbour, there was a boat docked in the New York shipyard.

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:45.622
It was originally a luxury French ocean liner called Normandie, and she was

00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:50.762
the fastest ocean liner in the world when she first entered service in 1935.

00:02:51.712 --> 00:02:55.598
She had carried passengers such as Ernest Hemingway and Walt Disney,

00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:00.458
and even the entire von Trapp family of singers from the Sound of Music.

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:09.448
But in 1942, there was little need for luxury liners; her talents could be better used elsewhere.

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:15.928
She had been in New York since the start of the war, and in 1942 the

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:21.238
decision was taken to turn her into a troop ship, to ready her for battle.

00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:26.668
But on February the 9th, 1942, she caught fire.

00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:33.028
As the great vessel burned, smoke filled the Manhattan skyline.

00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:41.098
The blaze was eventually put out, but the ship was effectively destroyed, she was made unusable.

00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:46.673
The US authorities said that the fire was an unfortunate

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:50.954
accident, but there was widespread scepticism about this.

00:03:51.432 --> 00:03:53.392
Fingers were soon pointed.

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:58.922
Was it Axis saboteurs, Nazi spies who had purposefully

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:02.162
destroyed this ship before she was able to set sail for Europe?

00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:08.022
Soon enough, someone even came forward to claim responsibility,

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:13.682
but that person was not German, not Japanese, and not Italian.

00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:20.572
Well, he was sort of Italian; he was an Italian-American gangster called Albert Anastasia.

00:04:21.902 --> 00:04:25.232
So, why did he do it, if indeed he did do it?

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:31.752
Well, it wasn’t because he was an Axis spy, or because he was anti-America.

00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:37.162
It was, to quote Don Corleone in the Godfather, “strictly business”.

00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:43.542
The main theory about why he did it, or claimed to do it, is because he

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:48.752
wanted to force the US government to pay for mafia protection in the ports.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:55.652
Many American ports, especially on the east side of the country, had been effectively

00:04:56.022 --> 00:05:02.512
controlled by organised criminals, and this was Anastasia’s way of saying, hey, US

00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:08.422
government, this ship was in my territory, and if you don’t pay me, this is what happens.

00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:14.622
Another theory is actually a little more cunning, a little more clever.

00:05:15.776 --> 00:05:21.202
Yes, he wanted to create disruption in the docks so that the US government would seek

00:05:21.202 --> 00:05:27.178
the help of the mafia,  but his objective wasn’t financial gain, it wasn’t to be paid.

00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:33.748
It was so that it would eventually lead the US authorities to seek the help of the one

00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:40.808
man who ultimately controlled the docks: Anastasia’s boss, Charles “Lucky” Luciano.

00:05:42.038 --> 00:05:47.188
“Lucky” Luciano, who you may remember from our episodes on the Five Families of New

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:53.448
York, was a major mob boss, he was one of the most powerful figures in organised crime.

00:05:54.468 --> 00:05:56.088
But there was a problem.

00:05:57.568 --> 00:06:03.428
Luciano was in prison at the time, serving a 30 to 50 year sentence.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:09.418
If Anastasia could show the US authorities that collaborating with

00:06:09.418 --> 00:06:14.048
the mafia was in their interest, this might be good news for Luciano.

00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:17.688
It would give him an opportunity to help the US government,

00:06:18.088 --> 00:06:22.518
and leverage when it came to asking for a reduced sentence.

00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:31.238
This might sound like an unlikely theory, but it is precisely what happened eventually,

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:36.808
the unlikely partnership between the US government and the Italian-American mafia.

00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:42.668
And this was no “unofficial”, or at least low level partnership;

00:06:43.238 --> 00:06:47.328
a high-ranking US officer called Commander Charles R.

00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:50.998
Haffenden was put in charge of the operation to seek collaboration

00:06:50.998 --> 00:06:54.488
with criminals to protect the ports and sniff out spies.

00:06:55.928 --> 00:07:02.038
The first person he sought the help of was a man called Joseph “Socks” Lanza, who

00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:06.728
was a mafia boss who controlled the fish market and the Seafood Workers Union..

00:07:07.988 --> 00:07:14.048
You might think that “socks” is an unusual name for a gangster, but here’s an unusual

00:07:14.048 --> 00:07:20.658
piece of English for you; to “sock” someone is slang for hitting someone very hard.

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:28.208
And Socks earned his nickname, apparently, for his ability to knock a man out with one blow.

00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:34.668
This meeting between "Socks" and Haffendan was the first step of a

00:07:34.678 --> 00:07:39.252
highly secretive campaign that would be codenamed “Operation Underworld”.

00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:47.400
The proposal went something like this: “Socks” would provide information on anyone suspected

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:53.820
of having sympathies for Mussolini, the Italian leader, and therefore of being a potential spy.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.730
He would let the government know of any planned sabotage

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.450
attacks, or of anyone who was known to be spying for the enemy.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.420
And what would “Socks” get in return?

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.560
He wasn’t offered any kind of immunity from prosecution

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.520
from criminal activity, or any kind of cash payment.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.710
So what was in it for him?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:23.860
Well, perhaps there was some kind of masterplan from Anastasia, that these criminals would agree

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.780
to help because it all served to ultimately lead the US government to their boss, “Lucky” Luciano.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.240
The real reason however might be a little more practical: “Socks” had recently been charged

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.500
with racketeering, and if he was caught taking part in any more criminal activity, it

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.370
was very likely that he would be sent to prison, and the mob did not want this to happen.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.830
Essentially, this collaboration with the government was a way for “Socks” firstly

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.260
to stay out of trouble and secondly to get in the authorities’ good books.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.250
He was more useful to the mafia outside of prison,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.180
controlling the fish market, than he would be behind bars.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:14.580
A week after the initial contact, “Socks” met Commander Charles  Haffenden and agreed to cooperate,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.770
saying “You let me know where you want the contacts made, or what you want, and I’ll carry on.”

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.320
From that moment on, “Socks” became a key partner to the US government.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.570
Firstly, he gave union cards to U.S government agents, allowing them to go undercover in the

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:40.840
Seafood Workers’ Union and try to identify potential spies amongst the majority Italian workforce.

00:09:42.234 --> 00:09:46.530
“Socks” also used trusted drivers and dock workers to report

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.720
back to him with any suspicious activity in the ports.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.980
He kept the US authorities informed about any possible spies

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.390
in the piers, or suspicious materials coming in, or going out.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.651
He was, so it appears, a good partner to the government, but he advised Commander

00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:10.781
Haffenden that if he wanted to get the total loyalty of the Italian dockworkers,

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:17.071
he would need to go up one level, and start speaking with his boss, Lucky Luciano.

00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:22.981
Afterall, Luciano was the crime figure for whom “Socks” oversaw

00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:26.471
Fulton Fish Market, and he was a much more powerful man.

00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:34.991
As a quick reminder of who this man was, by 1942, Lucky Luciano was still one of the

00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:40.881
most powerful men in organised crime, despite having been behind bars since 1936.

00:10:42.438 --> 00:10:48.231
“Socks” explained to the authorities that although Luciano was in prison, he

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:52.609
still had the ultimate control of the docks, and would be a powerful partner.

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:59.399
He got word through to Luciano, who agreed to assist the war effort, communicating

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:04.599
with the authorities through his trusted associate and mob accountant, Meyer Lansky.

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:10.619
As a quick side note, if you’d like to listen to an episode just on the unusual

00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:16.069
life of mob accountant Meyer Lansky, episode number 264 is the one for you.

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:22.239
Now, as to the question of why Luciano agreed to help the government,

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:27.399
well, he had been sentenced to up to 50 years in prison and he was prepared

00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:31.889
to do whatever he could to reduce his sentence and get out of jail.

00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:38.769
After agreeing to help, Luciano started sending instructions to his associates.

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:43.915
Via Lansky, he demanded that his associates be on the lookout

00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:48.055
for potential spies or suspicious activity along the shores.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:55.525
And…perhaps unsurprisingly, it worked, or at least it seemed like it worked.

00:11:56.595 --> 00:12:02.525
Soon after Luciano got involved, there was less theft of war supplies, and Union

00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:07.985
strikes, which were common and disrupted wartime operations, became less frequent.

00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:16.180
Now, while Luciano’s influence in stopping disruption will never be fully clear, there is some

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.790
correlation between him starting to cooperate with the authorities, and the disruption reducing.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.610
It certainly seemed that he thought he had done enough to start calling

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.590
in favours, and he decided it was time to start asking for his reward.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.190
Clearly, his bargaining power was limited.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.310
He was in prison for 30 to 50 years after all.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.360
So, what did he want?

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.290
Well, for starters, he wanted to be moved to a nicer prison.

00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:52.725
This seemed reasonable enough to the authorities, and soon

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:55.925
enough, he was transferred to a more comfortable prison.

00:12:57.445 --> 00:13:03.475
The deal was working, and from his new cell, Luciano would go on to help with

00:13:03.475 --> 00:13:08.765
something even more important, the US invasion of Sicily the following year.

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:15.715
As a quick reminder of what was happening in Europe at the time, in 1942 the

00:13:15.715 --> 00:13:21.085
majority of the continent was under Axis control, it was controlled by the Germans.

00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:27.375
There were numerous entry points that were considered as potential places to launch an Allied

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:33.625
attack on the continent, one of which was Sicily, the island at the south of the Italian peninsula.

00:13:35.185 --> 00:13:41.015
The idea was to land in Sicily and use that as a springboard to launch a

00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:46.305
campaign to invade mainland Italy, overthrow the Fascist Italian and Nazi

00:13:46.315 --> 00:13:50.845
German troops stationed across the country, and then move up through Europe.

00:13:52.335 --> 00:13:59.155
This would be codenamed “Operation Husky”, and, to cut a long story short, it worked.

00:14:00.435 --> 00:14:05.445
Now, where does our friend Charles “Lucky” Luciano come into all of this?

00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:08.035
Well, Luciano was Sicilian.

00:14:08.975 --> 00:14:12.735
Although his family had moved to the US when he was eight

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:16.518
years old, he had extensive  criminal contacts on the island.

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:24.398
Luciano pulled some strings, and his mafia colleagues in Sicily were a great help to the

00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:30.458
Allied forces both in the planning for the invasion and when they arrived on the island.

00:14:31.908 --> 00:14:36.588
Now, you might be rightfully asking…why would they help the Americans?

00:14:37.408 --> 00:14:42.068
Yes, Luciano asked them to, but let’s remember that the Americans

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:47.178
were fighting against their countrymen, the US was at war with Italy.

00:14:48.698 --> 00:14:53.508
Again, there is no one simple answer here, but it’s fair to say that

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:58.728
the mafia and Mussolini, the Italian dictator, did not see eye to eye.

00:15:00.258 --> 00:15:06.878
Firstly the entire philosophy of fascism is that of the supreme control of the state.

00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:13.308
And if a non-state entity, especially a criminal entity, is in

00:15:13.338 --> 00:15:17.428
control, well that is problematic in a fascist dictatorship.

00:15:19.008 --> 00:15:23.258
Secondly, there are reasons to believe that there was also personal

00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:27.378
animosity between Mussolini and Sicilian organised criminals.

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:34.768
All this began with an unsuccessful political visit to Sicily in May of 1924.

00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:41.638
Mussolini had become Prime Minister two years prior, and he visited Sicily to

00:15:41.638 --> 00:15:46.538
make a public address in an attempt to improve his popularity in the region.

00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:53.048
He arrived with a large military security team, including battleships,

00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:58.468
aeroplanes and submarines, clear signs of the power of the state.

00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:04.728
When he arrived, he was met by a man called Don Francesco Cuccia,

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:09.743
a mayor of a small town outside Palermo called Piana dei Greci.

00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:19.098
Cuccia was a politician, but he also happened to be an influential member of the Sicilian mafia.

00:16:20.248 --> 00:16:25.238
He was unimpressed with Mussolini’s perceived need to bring his own protection,

00:16:25.738 --> 00:16:30.988
and he told the Prime Minister “You are with me; you are under my protection.”

00:16:32.028 --> 00:16:36.958
Essentially, he told Mussolini that his ships and aeroplanes weren’t needed.

00:16:38.178 --> 00:16:45.688
Mussolini was furious; he was the leader of Italy, he didn’t accept favours from some local crook.

00:16:46.858 --> 00:16:50.268
He refused Cuccia’s offer, keeping his troops with him.

00:16:51.658 --> 00:16:54.978
And if you know anything about the mafia, you’ll

00:16:54.998 --> 00:16:58.118
know that it’s not always a good idea to reject them.

00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:06.048
In response to Mussolini’s refusal, Cuccia ordered his townspeople to boycott Mussolini’s

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:12.058
speech, meaning that the Prime Minister ended up addressing a practically empty town square.

00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:17.998
It was deeply embarrassing, and Mussolini was livid.

00:17:18.858 --> 00:17:26.018
He cut short his Sicilian tour, and from that day onwards was determined to crush the mafia.

00:17:27.328 --> 00:17:32.068
By the time 1943 came along, Mussolini had spent the best part of

00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:36.850
twenty years trying to destroy the mafia, so when the opportunity arose

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.960
to help the Allies get rid of Mussolini, you can see the attraction.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.290
So, what did everyone get out of this?

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.630
Well, the United States was given a helping hand with the invasion of Sicily, which

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.980
resulted in the overthrowing of Mussolini and the capture of the entire Italian peninsula.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.650
Could this have happened without the help of the mafia, and without Lucky Luciano?

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.170
Most probably, but it certainly didn’t hurt.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:11.880
Indeed, the US forces only suffered very minor casualties when they attacked

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.920
Sicily from the western side of the island, while the British forces suffered

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.030
much higher casualties after attacking from the southern side of the island.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:28.340
Was this coincidence, other factors, or the handiwork of Lucky Luciano?

00:18:29.664 --> 00:18:34.970
Luciano certainly thought that he had been a huge help, and he wasted no

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:40.610
time in calling in a big favour in return for facilitating this assistance.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.490
Not long after the war ended, Luciano filed an appeal for clemency.

00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:54.552
On January the 3rd, 1946, he received a pardon, he went free, after

00:18:54.552 --> 00:18:59.602
serving 9½ years of what should have been up to 50 years in prison.

00:19:01.102 --> 00:19:04.372
Somewhat poignantly, it was the man who had sentenced

00:19:04.372 --> 00:19:07.682
Luciano ten years beforehand, Governor Thomas E.

00:19:07.692 --> 00:19:09.216
Dewey, who pardoned him.

00:19:10.736 --> 00:19:14.320
The one condition of his pardon was that he was to be

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.972
deported to Italy, which duly happened in February of 1946.

00:19:20.132 --> 00:19:24.022
And, as you may know, Lucky Luciano didn’t exactly

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:27.082
put his feet up and leave his life of crime behind.

00:19:27.715 --> 00:19:32.505
If anything, it intensified, and his criminal ways continued right

00:19:32.545 --> 00:19:37.023
up until his death from a heart attack at Naples Airport in 1962.

00:19:38.285 --> 00:19:45.285
And, as to the impact and legacy of Operation Underworld, it is still a hotly debated subject.

00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:49.625
It seems like there’s no question of it hurting the war effort,

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:54.225
but the extent to which it had any positive impact is debated.

00:19:55.145 --> 00:20:00.995
Indeed, to this very day the full extent of Operation Underworld has never truly been

00:20:00.995 --> 00:20:08.245
acknowledged by the U.S government, but one thing is for sure: it certainly is an unusual story.

00:20:10.295 --> 00:20:15.195
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Operation Underworld,

00:20:15.325 --> 00:20:18.605
the unusual deal between the United States and the mafia.

00:20:19.215 --> 00:20:22.325
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:22.735 --> 00:20:25.285
How much of an impact do you think this really had?

00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:29.025
Do you think that governments should ever enter into agreements

00:20:29.045 --> 00:20:32.725
with criminals, if there can be some kind of positive outcome?

00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:36.755
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

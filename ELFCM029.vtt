Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:11.965
by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:20.455
Today, we are going to talk about a company that you probably have never heard of, but that you may

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:24.790
be, through your taxes at least, quite a large customer of.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.635
That company is called Palantir, and there are people who say it is the scariest company in the

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:33.055
world.

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:39.306
Before we get right into the podcast though, let me just take 30 seconds to remind those of you

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:46.836
listening to this podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, iVoox, or wherever you're listening to it on

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:53.196
that you can access the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:54.556
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:55.401 --> 00:01:01.851
In case you hadn't seen this yet, we now have a super cool feature where the transcript animates

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:07.191
across the screen as you're listening to the podcast, a little bit like subtitles.

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:13.131
So now it's super easy to follow every single word and not miss one thing.

00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:17.151
So check that out, that's over at leonardoenglish.com

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:23.871
Right, Palantir the most important company you've never heard of.

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:31.956
In case you hadn't realised by now, this isn't a business podcast, and we don't just talk about

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:37.926
companies because they've done something interesting in the news, or we want to hear the story about

00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:39.696
how they got started.

00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:48.403
This podcast tries to tell stories about the way the world works and Palantir well, it certainly has

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:50.173
a pretty big global impact.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:59.373
There are some big fans of the company saying that it protects us and makes our lives safer, that it

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:04.383
stops terrorists, violent criminals, and makes the world a better place.

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:12.973
But there are also those that say that the company poses a dangerous risk to our safety and personal

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:16.843
freedoms, and it needs to be stopped before it's too late.

00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:27.499
Today we are going to talk about what it is exactly that Palantir does and then you can decide

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.409
whether you think this is a good thing for the world.

00:02:31.676 --> 00:02:36.319
So my first question would be, have you ever heard of Palantir?

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.669
I imagine that for most of you, the answer would be no.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:49.019
It's a very secretive company it's not like they have a shop, an app or anything like that.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:58.949
But it is worth over $20 billion and it counts many of the world's governments as its clients.

00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:07.498
It was founded by the secretive libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, who was one of the early

00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:09.118
founders of PayPal.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:16.065
He was also an early investor in Facebook and is now a big Donald Trump supporter.

00:03:16.742 --> 00:03:24.913
He founded the company in 2004 shortly after the September the 11th terrorist attacks, with a view

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:30.973
to creating a company that would stop these kinds of things happening in the future.

00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:34.983
So what does it actually do?

00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:44.643
If you look at Palantir's website under what do we do, it says "we make products for human driven

00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:46.563
analysis of real world data".

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:51.350
This is obviously a kind of corporate doublespeak.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.800
It doesn't really mean anything, so let's try to translate this into plain English.

00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:05.869
In short, Palantir is a software company that finds connections between data.

00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:14.519
While this might sound simple, the levels at which Palantir operates are anything but.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:24.727
What Palantir does is connect the dots between huge sets of data, billions of different data points,

00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:30.067
and provides information that can be useful to solving a problem.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:38.825
This might be connecting purchases of bus tickets with things that are bought in a shop and CC TV

00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:47.945
footage to stop a terrorist attack or to find patterns in millions of different internal emails to

00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:51.425
discover insider trading at a large company.

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:55.158
I'm sure you've heard of the phrase big data.

00:04:56.073 --> 00:05:05.553
Big data is obviously a bit of a buzzword, but it is a fact that there is just a huge, a gargantuan

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:14.793
amount of information and data in existence, and vast amounts are created every millisecond about

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:18.993
every single thing we do, everything that happens in the world.

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:30.228
You can think of Palantir as the company that is able to process this kind of data and actually draw

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:31.398
conclusions from it.

00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:39.530
If you imagine a detective movie with someone working through the night, trying to piece together

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:48.357
clues, plane tickets, pictures, phone records, all that kind of stuff, and sticking them all on a

00:05:48.357 --> 00:05:54.792
wall, and scratching their head, trying to find the connection and then drawing lines from one to

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:55.302
another.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:06:02.403
And finally, after working through the night, they finally crack the pattern and understand the

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.803
connections between the dots.

00:06:05.403 --> 00:06:13.923
This is basically what Palantir does, but infinitely faster and on an infinitely larger scale.

00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:22.611
Palantir might piece together data from millions of different sources that can tell us that someone

00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:31.281
has missed days from work recently, has visited a hardware store and bought unusual things, has

00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:37.581
bought a plane ticket to somewhere where they don't have connections and has visited certain

00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:46.431
websites, and this means, for example, that there is a high probability of a attack being committed.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.769
While I don't think that anyone would argue that fewer terrorist attacks is a good thing, the danger

00:06:54.769 --> 00:07:01.969
comes when we think about our own personal freedoms and weigh up the advantages of solutions that

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:10.999
help prevent things that would harm us against the disadvantages of an erosion of personal liberty.

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:19.332
If we aren't free to go to a shop, to book a plane ticket or send an email without thinking that

00:07:19.632 --> 00:07:29.202
some all-seeing company or indeed government can see what we are doing and is able to comb through

00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:36.612
all of our digital footprints, what is the impact of this on our own sense of personal freedom?

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:43.561
And what would happen if this technology wasn't used for good purposes?

00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:54.166
Indeed, the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, has spoken out about Palantir and described what

00:07:54.166 --> 00:08:02.585
would happen if the software got into the wrong hands as a true totalitarian nightmare, monitoring

00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:06.455
the activities of innocent Americans on a mass scale."

00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:15.502
The fact is that to monitor the bad guys, in inverted commas, you have to at least have the ability

00:08:15.592 --> 00:08:17.032
to monitor everyone.

00:08:18.552 --> 00:08:24.882
And are we prepared to give up all of our personal freedoms in order for us to be a little bit

00:08:24.882 --> 00:08:25.452
safer?

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:34.869
If you've seen the film Minority Report, Palantir may seem eerily, strangely, familiar.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:44.319
Minority Report, if you haven't seen the film or if you need a reminder, it's based in the year 2054

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:51.669
and the police use a tool that allows them to stop crimes before they're committed.

00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:59.404
Palantir actually makes a version of this possible, or at least they tried to make a version of this

00:08:59.404 --> 00:08:59.854
possible.

00:09:00.461 --> 00:09:09.795
They created a tool that predicted when a crime would be likely to take place, and so agents, police

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:13.575
men and women would be sent to that particular area.

00:09:14.646 --> 00:09:23.511
How this worked was that the technology relied on an algorithm that absorbed data on locations,

00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:33.351
times and dates of previously committed crimes, and then gave hotspots, gave areas, to police

00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:34.851
officers to patrol.

00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:36.801
Creepy, right?

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:42.171
Well, not just creepy, but also full of bias.

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:51.111
There was a study done in 2016 which showed that this algorithm heavily weighted towards people of

00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:58.281
colour, and previous crimes weren't actually the best indicator of future crimes.

00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:02.121
Essentially the algorithm was racist.

00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:09.781
And even some Palantir employees are upset at some of the ways in which the software has been used.

00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:18.324
Palantir has a big contract with ICE, the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement department in the US

00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:27.324
and the software is used to track down and then deport suspected illegal immigrants.

00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:35.349
And while some software engineers might have signed up to the mission of a company that aims to help

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:43.059
stop terrorist attacks, catch child sex offenders and violent criminals, they had soon discovered

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:51.099
that the software that they were creating could also be used to carry out policies that they might

00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:51.879
not agree with.

00:10:53.665 --> 00:11:02.230
But despite the pleas and protests from employees, the company didn't back down, and it actually

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.750
just renewed a huge $42 million contract with ICE.

00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:16.629
The view of Palantir is that it's not the job of a technology company to decide US government policy

00:11:17.049 --> 00:11:22.119
and that it would be treasonous to not provide services to the US government.

00:11:23.506 --> 00:11:29.926
However, cynics might say that these contracts are just too lucrative to turn down, they pay too

00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:30.316
well.

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:41.176
Indeed, Palantir can charge $3,000 per day per engineer, and one of its largest US army contracts is

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:43.636
worth $800 million.

00:11:44.494 --> 00:11:48.584
Palantir as a company has evidently done a lot of good.

00:11:49.644 --> 00:11:56.424
It's said that it has helped prevent a massive global web of cyber intrusion by the Chinese

00:11:56.424 --> 00:12:03.294
government, it has predicted the locations of bombs in Afghanistan before they could go off and it

00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:06.564
helped convict the fraudster Bernie Madoff.

00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:16.614
However, the question mark remains over how deep Palantir can see into our lives and what we are

00:12:16.614 --> 00:12:20.874
prepared to give up in order to live in a slightly safer world.

00:12:22.214 --> 00:12:28.484
The company's name certainly suggests that it wants to see everything, to be omnipotent.

00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:39.815
If you remember Lord Of The Rings, a Palantir is a seeing stone, the dark orb, the crystal ball used

00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:45.995
by the evil wizard Sarumon, to be able to see in darkness or blinding lights.

00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:51.205
That's certainly how Palantir seems to think of itself.

00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:59.106
Well, you could say that things didn't end that well for Sarumon, or you could say that the idea of

00:12:59.106 --> 00:13:04.491
a Palantir in the hands of the government is almost as scary as it gets.

00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:13.791
Okay then, I hope that this has been an interesting look into this secretive, mysterious, but

00:13:13.791 --> 00:13:15.351
incredibly important company.

00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:20.061
It's pretty fascinating, but terrifying at the same time.

00:13:21.606 --> 00:13:27.546
As always, if you have thoughts, feedback, questions on the podcast, I'd love to hear from you.

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:35.346
You can get in touch at hi - HI - @leonardoenglish.com or over on Facebook or Instagram.

00:13:35.976 --> 00:13:42.216
And again, if you haven't yet checked out our new animating transcripts, then do go and check those

00:13:42.216 --> 00:13:42.576
out.

00:13:42.816 --> 00:13:46.056
You can head to leonardoenglish.com and have a look.

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:54.456
Using the animated transcripts means that the words flash across the screen as you hear them, so you

00:13:54.456 --> 00:13:58.086
should be able to follow every single word and not miss one thing.

00:13:59.766 --> 00:14:04.476
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

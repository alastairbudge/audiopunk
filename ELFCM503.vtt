Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.510
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.710
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.870
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the last part of our

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.206
three-part mini-series on controversial sportspeople.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.780
In case you missed them, in part one we talked about the phenomenally

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.450
talented but self-destructive football player, George Best.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.900
In part two, we talked about the skating wars between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.269
And in today’s episode, we are going to talk about

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.790
the seven-time Tour de France winner, Lance Armstrong.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.949
For years, his story was a fairytale, an inspirational story

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.450
of talent, endurance, and success against all the odds.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.640
But, then came the most spectacular fall from grace.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.149
So let’s not waste a minute, and talk about the controversial life and career of Lance Armstrong.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.479
In 1902, the biggest sporting newspaper in France was called Le Vélo, the bicycle.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.539
But there was an upstart newspaper, another sporting publication, called L’Auto, the car.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.009
As a trick to boost the circulation of the young newspaper, a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.509
journalist suggested creating and sponsoring a cycling race.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.160
But this would be a race unlike any other.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.450
Instead of a race around a track, or a long race from one town to another, the journalist

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.880
suggested a race that would consist of multiple long races, spread over several days.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.635
The editors approved the idea, and in 1903, from July

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:05.009
1st to July 19th, the first-ever Tour de France was held.

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:11.790
It started and finished in Paris, or to get technical just outside Paris,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.150
and went in a big circle through five of the largest cities in France: Lyon,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.499
Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Nantes, before finishing back in Paris.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:34.220
It was long, at 2,428 km in total, and the winner finished in just under 100 hours.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.520
Fast forward to today, and the Tour de France is the most popular cycling

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.500
race in the world, and one of the most watched sporting events globally.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.820
It has evolved significantly.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.170
The route changes every year, but is typically around

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.780
3,500 km, almost 50% longer than the original version.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.500
What’s more, if the distance wasn’t enough, the race now includes serious uphill climbs

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.830
through both the Alps and the Pyrenees, the two main mountainous areas of France.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.230
Competitors now have to climb anywhere between 45,000 and 50,000

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.660
metres, which is like climbing Mount Everest more than five times.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:33.489
It takes place over 23 days and there are only two rest days.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.000
It is an insane race, and just managing to complete it requires extreme

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.200
levels of fitness, endurance, and both physical and mental strength.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.609
You have to be at the absolute top of your game.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.630
And in 1999, it had a surprise winner.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.950
His name was Lance Armstrong, and he was the second American to win the Tour de France.

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:11.750
He had grown up in Texas, and had first been a triathlete before switching to focus only on cycling.

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:19.538
He had competed in the Tour de France before, in 1993 and 1995, but had only

00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:25.218
ever won two stages in total, and the highest position he managed was 36th

00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:30.948
Of course, a remarkable achievement, but he was nowhere near the top.

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:38.798
Not only this, but fewer than three years before he had been diagnosed with advanced cancer

00:04:39.318 --> 00:04:45.398
that had started in his testicles but had spread to his lymph nodes, lungs and brain.

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:52.728
His body was riddled with cancer, and the doctors gave him a 50:50 chance of survival.

00:04:54.248 --> 00:04:59.438
This was a young man who had just been given the most horrendous of diagnoses,

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:05.708
had been staring death in the face, but had beaten cancer and then decided to

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:10.008
compete in the most physically demanding sporting competition in the world.

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:12.818
And…he won.

00:05:13.908 --> 00:05:18.158
Not only that, but he went on to win it every single

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:24.208
year until 2005, a total of 7 consecutive victories.

00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:30.808
It was the most incredible achievement; nobody has ever come close to doing what he did.

00:05:31.818 --> 00:05:36.928
To go from cancer patient to superstar professional endurance athlete was

00:05:36.928 --> 00:05:42.428
a fairytale story, a story that nothing was impossible, an inspiration to

00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:47.198
anyone that they too can achieve their dreams if they set their mind to it.

00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:52.718
He was a megastar, he launched a charitable foundation, he

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:57.058
dated the singer Cheryl Crow, he seemingly could do no wrong.

00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:04.108
Journalists wrote gushing articles on this miracle comeback and this remarkable sportsman.

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:07.658
Most, but not all journalists.

00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:10.408
There were some who weren’t buying it.

00:06:11.118 --> 00:06:13.868
Something wasn’t right about Lance Armstrong.

00:06:14.468 --> 00:06:19.578
He was too good, there was no way that a human being could push their body to

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:25.428
its physical limit for as long as Lance Armstrong did without a little…help.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:30.908
And by help, of course, they meant performance-enhancing drugs.

00:06:32.178 --> 00:06:36.637
Now, we must go back briefly to talk about the Tour de France once more.

00:06:37.358 --> 00:06:43.918
You know it is an intense race, but let’s talk in some detail about what it does to the body.

00:06:45.408 --> 00:06:49.798
When you breathe in, you bring oxygen into your lungs.

00:06:50.288 --> 00:06:54.928
The oxygen then enters your blood, where red blood cells pick it up.

00:06:55.798 --> 00:07:00.708
These red blood cells carry the oxygen all around your body, delivering

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:04.748
it to your muscles and other parts that need it to work properly.

00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:10.508
After dropping off the oxygen, the red blood cells pick up

00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:14.958
carbon dioxide, which is a waste product made by your muscles.

00:07:16.008 --> 00:07:21.108
The red blood cells take this carbon dioxide back to your lungs, where you breathe it out.

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:25.918
Then, the whole process starts again.

00:07:27.268 --> 00:07:31.628
When you’re sitting or walking, like you might be doing now, your

00:07:31.648 --> 00:07:36.408
muscles don’t need much oxygen, so your body can easily keep up.

00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:41.308
It produces and moves enough red blood cells to meet your needs.

00:07:42.158 --> 00:07:47.438
But when you start running or doing exercise, your muscles need more oxygen.

00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:52.688
That’s why you breathe faster and your heart beats quicker—to

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:55.938
move more oxygen-carrying red blood cells to your muscles.

00:07:57.378 --> 00:08:03.038
When your muscles begin to run low on oxygen, your body also makes some changes.

00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:10.688
One important change is that your kidneys produce more of a hormone called erythropoietin,

00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:15.828
which is a difficult word to say, which is why people use its acronym, EPO.

00:08:17.238 --> 00:08:24.388
EPO tells your body to make more red blood cells, which helps deliver more oxygen to your muscles.

00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:29.778
If you’re doing something really intense, like a stage in

00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:33.378
the Tour de France, your body needs to work extra hard.

00:08:34.108 --> 00:08:39.118
Your muscles might not get enough oxygen, so your body increases

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:43.668
EPO to make more red blood cells and keep up the oxygen supply.

00:08:44.848 --> 00:08:46.848
However, there’s a limit.

00:08:47.558 --> 00:08:53.668
Your body can only make about 50% more red blood cells during really intense activity.

00:08:54.108 --> 00:08:55.398
It can’t go beyond that.

00:08:57.198 --> 00:09:01.988
And during the Tour de France, riders are constantly fighting this.

00:09:02.678 --> 00:09:07.558
Their bodies cannot produce enough red blood cells to replace the ones

00:09:07.568 --> 00:09:13.258
being used up, so because of this deficit their bodies get extremely

00:09:13.258 --> 00:09:19.168
tired, lactic acid builds up and they can feel like they hit a wall.

00:09:20.738 --> 00:09:25.258
But Lance Armstrong didn’t seem to be affected in the same way.

00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:29.968
He could push through, he seemed to have inexhaustible stamina.

00:09:31.378 --> 00:09:35.438
To these sceptical journalists, this comeback champion,

00:09:35.448 --> 00:09:38.898
this cancer survivor, must be taking something.

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:46.538
A few journalists started to do some digging, and found some suspicious evidence.

00:09:47.728 --> 00:09:51.458
Lance Armstrong was found to have visited on multiple occasions

00:09:51.838 --> 00:09:56.158
a town in Italy where a notorious Italian doctor was based.

00:09:57.448 --> 00:10:01.908
The doctor’s name was Michele Ferrari, and he was strongly

00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:06.728
suspected of supplying cyclists with performance-enhancing drugs.

00:10:07.888 --> 00:10:15.798
In particular, injections of EPO, the hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells.

00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:21.528
In other words, this drug had the effect of allowing the body to produce

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:26.448
more red blood cells than it would under normal circumstances, allowing

00:10:26.448 --> 00:10:30.418
people who took it to push their bodies to the limit for longer.

00:10:31.648 --> 00:10:38.538
Ferrari had famously said that EPO was as safe as drinking orange juice, and had no

00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:43.888
hesitation in prescribing it to his clients, despite it being a banned substance.

00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:49.418
When confronted about this, Armstrong admitted that he had been working with

00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:55.228
Ferrari, but said that on no occasion had he taken performance-enhancing drugs.

00:10:56.288 --> 00:11:00.418
The rumours continued to circulate, but the cyclist

00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:03.528
was particularly aggressive in shutting them down.

00:11:04.068 --> 00:11:09.388
He constantly denied taking drugs, he would remind journalists that he was the most

00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:16.158
tested athlete in history and that on no occasion had any test ever been positive.

00:11:16.858 --> 00:11:23.368
He was the golden boy, the protagonist of the most remarkable comeback story in sporting history.

00:11:24.508 --> 00:11:30.288
Not only was he a very highly paid cyclist, but he was flooded with endorsements,

00:11:30.598 --> 00:11:35.708
most famously from Nike, which paid him a reported $10 million a year.

00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:42.608
He was also incredibly litigious, meaning that whenever there was some story or

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:48.498
article that even hinted at him taking performance-enhancing drugs, his lawyers

00:11:48.538 --> 00:11:54.658
would aggressively shut the story down, threatening to sue for millions of dollars.

00:11:56.138 --> 00:12:01.568
Even as the rumours began to grow, and people started to come forward with

00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:06.498
anecdotal evidence that he'd been taking drugs, there was this knowledge that any

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:12.678
published article would result in the threat of serious and expensive litigation.

00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:14.728
Was it worth it?

00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:19.758
Many editors, understandably, didn’t want to take the risk.

00:12:21.098 --> 00:12:23.353
There was one book, L.A.

00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:28.608
Confidentiel: Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong - The Secrets of Lance Armstrong,

00:12:29.178 --> 00:12:33.508
which was published in 2004, while Armstrong was at the peak of his career.

00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:40.958
It was a collaboration between a French and an Irish journalist and alleged

00:12:41.138 --> 00:12:45.818
that Armstrong had been taking performance-enhancing drugs since 1995.

00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:51.138
It was only published in French and in France because Armstrong’s

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:55.448
lawyers had threatened serious litigation if it was published in English

00:12:55.508 --> 00:13:00.698
and sold in the UK or in America, so its global impact was limited.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:08.088
The Irish journalist, David Walsh, did publish parts of the book in the British

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:13.858
newspaper The Sunday Times, but this resulted in the newspaper being sued by Armstrong,

00:13:14.238 --> 00:13:19.358
having to pay a million-pound settlement and print a retraction of its claims.

00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:24.208
The message was clear: do not mess with Lance Armstrong.

00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:30.038
In March of the following year, 2005, shortly before the Tour de

00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:34.288
France, he announced that he would retire from professional cycling.

00:13:35.608 --> 00:13:39.848
After all, he had won six Tour de France by that point, and

00:13:39.988 --> 00:13:44.275
would win his seventh and final one in the summer of 2005.

00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:49.748
He was 33 years old, he had recovered from cancer, and

00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:53.558
he had fought off all of the allegations of foul play.

00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:57.188
He would go out on a high, and he did.

00:13:58.598 --> 00:14:02.838
But a few years later he announced that he was coming back.

00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:04.308
He couldn’t resist.

00:14:04.588 --> 00:14:07.468
He would come back to race the biggest race in cycling,

00:14:07.738 --> 00:14:11.478
The Tour de France, and his sights were on first place.

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:16.036
This time it would be for a different team, Astana.

00:14:17.618 --> 00:14:20.908
The team he had previously ridden for was called the U.S.

00:14:20.938 --> 00:14:21.798
Postal Service.

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:27.828
And importantly he made a big thing of the fact that this new team was going to

00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:33.568
be completely transparent and squeaky clean; he would post his blood test results

00:14:33.578 --> 00:14:38.918
online, the team would only consist of spotless cyclists, there was absolutely

00:14:38.918 --> 00:14:44.518
no possibility for anyone on the team to be accused of doping or of foul play.

00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.238
Although it’s clear why he did this, because he wanted to quash

00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:54.438
these rumours once and for all, it would prove to be his downfall.

00:14:55.968 --> 00:14:57.088
His former U.S.

00:14:57.108 --> 00:15:03.668
Postal Service teammate, Floyd Landis, wanted a place on Armstrong’s new team, on Astana.

00:15:04.518 --> 00:15:10.498
The pair had ridden together from 2002 to 2005, and Landis

00:15:10.658 --> 00:15:14.608
had been instrumental in helping Armstrong secure first place.

00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:17.628
But Armstrong said no.

00:15:18.478 --> 00:15:22.748
Landis had been embroiled in a doping scandal, he had admitted

00:15:22.748 --> 00:15:27.798
taking drugs, and Armstrong needed his team to be 100% clean.

00:15:28.818 --> 00:15:32.068
After being rejected, Landis was not happy.

00:15:32.428 --> 00:15:35.558
He was brooding, contemplating his next move.

00:15:37.008 --> 00:15:41.678
It was later revealed that he had emailed a bunch of newspapers alleging that

00:15:41.738 --> 00:15:46.158
Armstrong had taken performance-enhancing drugs during the Tour de France.

00:15:47.018 --> 00:15:51.688
Not only this, but he said that Armstrong had not only encouraged him

00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:56.398
and others to take drugs but had taught them how to beat the system.

00:15:57.718 --> 00:16:03.398
This was the first time that someone so high profile had gone on record and testified.

00:16:04.258 --> 00:16:06.308
The walls were closing in.

00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:11.208
And Armstrong’s comeback had not gone as he had hoped.

00:16:12.168 --> 00:16:15.693
He finished in third place in the 2009 Tour de France

00:16:15.993 --> 00:16:21.453
and on his last tour, in 2010, he finished in 23rd place.

00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:24.903
He had announced his retirement shortly afterwards

00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:29.463
but was facing growing calls for full investigations.

00:16:30.703 --> 00:16:36.163
There was a federal investigation in 2010, but that came to nothing.

00:16:36.573 --> 00:16:39.023
The case was dropped, without explanation.

00:16:40.503 --> 00:16:45.433
And then in June of 2012 came the bombshell.

00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:51.643
The United States Anti-Doping Agency, the organisation in charge of stopping

00:16:51.653 --> 00:16:57.313
and catching athletes who take drugs, accused Armstrong not just of doping, but

00:16:57.603 --> 00:17:03.403
of being, and I’m quoting directly, the ringleader of "the most sophisticated,

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:09.053
professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen".

00:17:10.493 --> 00:17:16.243
Now, this wasn’t the statement of a disgruntled competitor or a journalist with a grudge;

00:17:16.783 --> 00:17:21.793
they were the words of the official government agency in charge of stopping doping.

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:30.683
Shortly after, he was stripped of all of his world titles after 1998, so if you look

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:36.803
at the list of Tour de France winners from 1999 to 2005, you will see “no winner”.

00:17:38.153 --> 00:17:44.413
He had retired from professional cycling, but nevertheless, he received a lifetime ban.

00:17:45.783 --> 00:17:49.353
He kept quiet initially, not responding to the allegations.

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:56.833
But in January of the following year, he went on the Oprah Winfrey show and admitted it all.

00:17:57.853 --> 00:18:04.283
He had taken drugs, he had faked drug tests, he had done everything he had been accused of.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:11.033
And having previously made millions from endorsements due to his heroic image

00:18:11.253 --> 00:18:15.963
as a record-shattering cancer survivor, he was almost immediately dropped

00:18:16.123 --> 00:18:20.303
by all of the brands that had paid him handsomely to be associated with him.

00:18:21.483 --> 00:18:28.613
According to one interview, he lost $75 million dollars worth of endorsements in a single day.

00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:34.963
But worth perhaps even more than this was the complete destruction,

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:39.783
or at least the huge damage, done to his reputation and legacy.

00:18:40.963 --> 00:18:45.493
He had been an inspiration to people all over the world; not just to people

00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:50.873
battling cancer, not just to aspiring athletes, but to anyone with a dream.

00:18:51.473 --> 00:18:56.873
He was living proof that people could do unthinkable things, and that what

00:18:56.873 --> 00:19:02.013
might seem impossible can be achieved with the right mindset and effort.

00:19:03.383 --> 00:19:08.433
To the fans who had believed in him, and who had ridiculed his detractors for

00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:12.743
claiming that his records weren’t “real”, it was clearly a huge disappointment.

00:19:13.643 --> 00:19:17.233
Armstrong had repeatedly denied using performance-enhancing drugs,

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:21.133
he had accused and harassed anyone who had said that he was using

00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:25.613
drugs, accusing them of being jealous and not believing in him.

00:19:26.693 --> 00:19:28.743
But, he was lying all along.

00:19:29.903 --> 00:19:33.383
In his own words, it wasn’t a series of lies, it

00:19:33.383 --> 00:19:36.973
wasn’t hundreds or thousands or even millions of lies.

00:19:37.313 --> 00:19:38.793
It was one big lie.

00:19:39.233 --> 00:19:43.193
His entire career, his success, was based on cheating.

00:19:44.613 --> 00:19:49.473
This admission was over 10 years ago now, and now that the dust has

00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:53.703
settled, there are differing views on the legacy of Lance Armstrong.

00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:57.573
Clearly, he inspired millions of people.

00:19:58.053 --> 00:20:05.323
He did recover from cancer in record-breaking time, he was a phenomenal athlete and cyclist, and he

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:11.443
raised not only awareness but hundreds of millions of dollars for his cancer charity, Livestrong.

00:20:12.563 --> 00:20:14.063
But he cheated.

00:20:14.553 --> 00:20:15.103
He lied.

00:20:15.933 --> 00:20:21.873
And he behaved terribly against people who suggested that he had been doping, people he knew were

00:20:21.873 --> 00:20:28.573
telling the truth, but who he sued and accused of lying in order to keep his secret under wraps.

00:20:29.143 --> 00:20:34.083
He was the most phenomenal liar, and it is perhaps just as much of an

00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:37.783
achievement that he managed to keep his secret for as long as he did.

00:20:38.973 --> 00:20:44.223
And, had he not come back from retirement, had he not annoyed Floyd Landis and

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:49.553
pushed him into testifying against him, he most probably would have got away with it.

00:20:50.173 --> 00:20:54.433
His legacy would be intact, he would still be making tens of millions of

00:20:54.433 --> 00:20:59.353
dollars a year from endorsements and all of those journalists who accused

00:20:59.353 --> 00:21:03.573
him might have thought that, actually, it was they that were wrong.

00:21:04.713 --> 00:21:08.333
But, like so many other people who were at the top of their game

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:12.523
and had the chance to end on a high, hubris got the better of him.

00:21:13.413 --> 00:21:18.503
And so he will always be remembered as the biggest cheat in cycling history.

00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:25.063
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Lance Armstrong, and with that

00:21:25.063 --> 00:21:28.920
comes the end of this three-part mini-series on controversial sportspeople.

00:21:29.278 --> 00:21:34.793
I hope it's been an interesting one, and even if you knew about Lance Armstrong’s story, and that

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:39.473
of George Best and Tonya Harding for that matter, well I hope that you've learnt something new.

00:21:40.213 --> 00:21:42.913
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:45.260
Do you like these ones on sportspeople?

00:21:45.723 --> 00:21:47.583
If so, what other ones should we make?

00:21:48.113 --> 00:21:53.593
And for the cycling fans in the house, what are your thoughts and memories about Lance Armstrong?

00:21:54.183 --> 00:21:57.973
Misguided hero, villain, or somewhere in between?

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:01.583
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

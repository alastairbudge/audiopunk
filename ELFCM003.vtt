Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.531
English.

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:16.002
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about prison escapes, and looking at some of

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.282
the most amazing prison escapes in history.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.594
Prison is evidently not the kind of place where most people want to stay, and so it goes without

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:32.791
saying, for as long as prisons have existed, well, people have tried to escape from them.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:39.355
Some of our, I should probably not say heroes, but let's say protagonists, so some of our

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:48.063
protagonists in today's episode used all sorts of ingenious tricks, including wooden pistols,

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:53.043
dummies, yoga, and even hockey sticks to escape from prison.

00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:56.974
And I'll reveal exactly how they did it shortly.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:04.910
Before we get right into it though, I want to remind those of you listening on Apple Podcasts,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.280
Spotify or wherever you might get your podcasts that you can get the transcript and key vocabulary

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.562
for this podcast on the website, so that's leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:20.992
There's also a load of information on how to use podcasts to learn English over on the blog.

00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:24.032
So that's well worth a look if you haven't done so already.

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:26.702
Okay.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:33.002
Without further ado, let's take a look at five of the most amazing prison escapes in history.

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:39.193
Firstly, John Herbert Dillinger Junior, born in 1903.

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:47.247
If that name is ringing a bell for you, well, you may remember him from the 2009 film Public Enemies

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:47.997
with Johnny Depp.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.370
Dillinger was a notorious bank robber in the Great Depression era.

00:01:54.274 --> 00:02:02.550
When he was caught in 1934, after having robbed a bank, naturally, he was held at the Lake County

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.730
jail in Indiana.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:10.359
Local police was so proud of this jail that they declared it to be escape proof.

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:15.199
Well, it didn't prove to be quite as escape proof as they had hoped.

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:23.631
Shortly after being put in jail, he carved a fake pistol out of a shelf that was in his cell and

00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:26.621
then proceeded to take 17 hostages.

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:32.892
He lured the guards back to his cell block, and then he locked them in his own cell.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:37.034
Only then was he able to force his way out.

00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:43.674
But if you remember the film, this freedom wasn't to last for long for Dillinger and he was killed

00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:45.334
later on that year in a shootout.

00:02:47.108 --> 00:02:52.948
Our second escape comes from Korea, from a prisoner called Choi Gap Bok.

00:02:54.181 --> 00:03:01.361
Now one way you can get out of a prison cell is through brute force, so forcing open the bars and

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:01.991
breaking free.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.951
Choi Gap Bok had another idea, which was to make himself so flexible that he could wriggle out.

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:18.313
He was an expert in yoga and spent countless hours making his body as flexible as possible.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.170
His aim was to squeeze himself out of the tiny hole at the bottom of the door that was used to give

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.900
prisoners food.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.530
If you can imagine what this looks like, it's one of those really small holes at the bottom of the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.140
door where they pass the food through.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.390
Tiny, right?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.230
This hole was only 15 centimetres tall and 45 centimetres wide.

00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:49.131
While the guards were sleeping, he managed to wriggle out and the entire escape took only 34 seconds

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.591
and he was finally free.

00:03:51.854 --> 00:03:57.784
It wasn't to last though, as he was arrested just six days later, and it goes without saying that

00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:01.814
the next cell he was put in had a much smaller food hole.

00:04:04.232 --> 00:04:09.830
Our third story of escape, I should point out, is still debated and we don't know whether the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.606
prisoners actually managed to escape and are now living in some far corner of the world with new

00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:19.236
identities or whether they perished in the Bay of San Francisco.

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:25.624
If you haven't guessed it, I'm talking about the escape from the maximum security prison two

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:28.684
kilometres offshore from San Francisco, Alcatraz.

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.481
If you've seen the cult film, The Rock, you'll know what I'm talking about.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:43.451
It's a maximum security prison on a rock in ice-cold, shark-infested waters with very fast tides, so

00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:45.941
certainly no easy feat to escape from.

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:54.702
In any case, in June, 1962 three prisoners escaped and then mysteriously went missing.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.100
These prisoners, Frank Morris, John Anglin, and his brother Clarence spent two years digging a

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.920
tunnel through the walls and building a raft made out of raincoats to sail to freedom.

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:16.368
On the night of the escape, they placed dummies, so fake bodies, fake copies of themselves they

00:05:16.368 --> 00:05:19.678
placed them in their bed to trick the guards and it worked.

00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:24.928
It wasn't until the next morning that the guards realised that they had gone.

00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:32.834
Later on, parts of the raft, as well as some of the men's personal belongings were found in the Bay

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:38.164
of San Francisco leading investigators to conclude that the men had drowned in the escape.

00:05:38.782 --> 00:05:44.504
However, their bodies have never been found, and there are those that still believe that the men

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.650
made it out alive and are now in hiding.

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:52.846
I don't really know what happened, and it's certainly more intriguing to think that they did manage

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:59.036
to get away and are now sipping margaritas on a beach somewhere rather than in a cold watery grave.

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:06.449
Any list of great prison escapes wouldn't be complete without, well, The Great Escape.

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:14.623
Forever immortalized in the 1963 film, The Great Escape, the escape from Stalag Luft III during

00:06:14.623 --> 00:06:19.603
World War II must go down as one of history's most amazing prison escapes.

00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:27.381
In 1943 after having been captured by the Germans, Royal Air Force squadron leader, Roger Bushel

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:33.326
thought up a plan for a mass escape from the prison where he was being held with other British and

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:36.886
Commonwealth airmen, men who were fighting in the allied air force.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.530
It's a remarkable escape for many reasons, but mainly for the sheer amount of people involved.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.098
More than 600 prisoners were involved in the preparation, and 76 managed to escape.

00:06:50.863 --> 00:06:58.873
Now, the prisoners dug three long tunnels from their huts under the camp, past two sets of barbed

00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:00.833
wire and out to the treeline.

00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:08.035
The idea behind having three tunnels was that if one of them was discovered, well, there would be

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:12.805
another two and the prison guards would hardly guess that the prisoners were working on more than

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:13.385
one tunnel.

00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:19.039
These tunnels were very deep down, around nine metres below the surface.

00:07:19.997 --> 00:07:26.222
They were supported with wood from the prisoners' beds with over half of all the wood from the beds

00:07:26.252 --> 00:07:26.982
being removed.

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.521
It's a miracle that the guards didn't discover this.

00:07:33.207 --> 00:07:38.007
These tunnels were over a hundred metres long, but only 60 centimetres wide.

00:07:38.388 --> 00:07:44.016
This meant that they had to create air pumps, which were built out of random items such as hockey

00:07:44.016 --> 00:07:45.546
sticks and food tins.

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:52.303
It was an ingenious plan, and despite numerous problems that they encountered along the way, 76 men

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:56.273
were able to escape on the night of the 24th of March, 1944.

00:07:57.203 --> 00:08:04.673
Even though it was an incredibly brave escape, it wasn't to last for long, and 73 of the 76 men who

00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:09.143
escaped were captured and 50 were then executed by the Gestapo.

00:08:09.828 --> 00:08:13.186
If you haven't seen it, The Great Escape is a fantastic film.

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:14.006
Well worth a watch.

00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:19.546
Watch it with English subtitles, of course, and you'll probably see that the accents are a little

00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:21.816
different to the kind of accents that you might hear today.

00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:29.997
Last, but not least, we have a more recent escape from none other than Mexican drug lord Joaquin El

00:08:29.997 --> 00:08:30.557
Chapo Guzman.

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:37.470
Now, El Chapo could probably appear in this list more than once as he has quite a record when it

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.810
comes to prison escapes.

00:08:39.846 --> 00:08:46.624
In 2001, while in the maximum security prison Puente Grande, he managed to escape in a laundry

00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:49.084
basket pushed by a prison worker.

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:56.723
After this first escape, a total of 78 people have been implicated in helping him, including the

00:08:56.723 --> 00:08:57.773
director of the prison.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.430
But escaping doesn't come cheap.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.660
It's estimated that this prison escape cost El Chapo around two and a half million dollars.

00:09:06.684 --> 00:09:10.079
However, it is the second escape that I think is more impressive.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:16.557
While at Federal Social Readaptation center number one, another maximum security prison, El Chapo

00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:19.707
managed to evade the authorities and again, break out.

00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:21.935
How did he do it?

00:09:22.275 --> 00:09:27.674
Well, his associates had dug a tunnel from inside a construction site about one and a half

00:09:27.674 --> 00:09:33.374
kilometres away, ten metres underground, all the way up to the prison and into Guzman's cell.

00:09:34.518 --> 00:09:39.858
The tunnel appeared in Guzman's shower area, which was the only part of the cell that the security

00:09:39.858 --> 00:09:41.278
cameras couldn't see.

00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:46.425
He was last seen at eight minutes to nine going into the shower area.

00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:52.483
When he didn't reappear for 25 minutes, the guards decided to go and look for him, and only then

00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:55.927
they found the entrance to the tunnel, but it was too late.

00:09:56.239 --> 00:10:00.909
They found a motorbike in the tunnel with which they expect he used to escape.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.630
So where is El Chapo now?

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.490
Well, if you weren't aware, he's back in prison and it looks like this time it might be for good.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:17.530
He was extradited to the United States in January of 2017 and is currently at ADX Florence, the most

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.966
secure supermax prison in America.

00:10:20.813 --> 00:10:26.943
Despite the fact that he seems to be a bit of an expert at escaping from prison, well, I wouldn't

00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:28.333
fancy his chances right now.

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:30.429
Okay.

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:34.139
That's a quick look at the most amazing prison escapes in history.

00:10:34.584 --> 00:10:39.814
We've learnt that you can get out of prison with a fake pistol, if you're really good at yoga, if

00:10:39.814 --> 00:10:45.684
you make some dummies of yourself, if you have 600 men and can dig a large tunnel, and if you have

00:10:45.754 --> 00:10:48.364
two and a half million dollars to spare to bribe the guards.

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:54.840
But escaping from prison is certainly not easy, and if our examples are anything to go by, you don't

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.795
manage to stay out for long, even if you do manage to escape.

00:10:58.453 --> 00:11:04.599
As always, if you have thoughts, questions, suggestions, or things you didn't quite understand, then

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:05.309
do let us know.

00:11:05.775 --> 00:11:10.814
You can send us a message on the website that's leonardoenglish.com or on Facebook or Instagram.

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:17.465
If you've enjoyed the podcast, then do tell a friend, colleague, family member or random person in

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:17.885
the street.

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:22.875
The more people know about the podcast, the more listeners we'll have and the better it'll get.

00:11:23.655 --> 00:11:28.605
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English with me, Alastair

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:29.015
Budge.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.095
I'll catch you in the next episode.

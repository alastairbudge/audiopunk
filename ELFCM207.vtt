Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:17.217
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:21.547
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:28.417
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The True Cost of Parking.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:34.857
Now, it might sound like the most boring subject in the world, and parking isn’t

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:40.847
something normally found in lists of most people’s favourite topics, but how we

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:47.377
deal with parking, what it really costs and who actually pays for it is fascinating.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:53.397
So, in this episode we will learn a bit about the history of how cities have

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:59.417
adapted to accommodate private cars, how this has changed over the years, why

00:00:59.437 --> 00:01:05.437
parking is never actually free, why it is almost always too cheap, despite

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:10.567
people thinking it is expensive, and what the future of parking might look like.

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:15.857
We have a lot to cover in today’s episode, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:22.717
Now, for many of the episodes we make, I don’t know a huge amount about the subjects

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:28.087
before researching them, and it is a fascinating process of discovery also for me.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:34.457
However for today’s episode I would claim to be somewhat of an expert, as I

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:39.747
actually spent quite a few years working for a parking technology startup in London.

00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:43.377
So, it is an area I’m pretty familiar with.

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:49.987
One person even more familiar with parking than me, though, is a man called Donald Shoup,

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:57.577
a Professor in the Department of Urban Planning at UCLA, the University of California, Los

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:05.927
Angeles, and the author of a famous book from 2005 called The High Cost of Free Parking.

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:11.727
Many of the ideas in today’s episode come directly from Professor Shoup’s

00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:16.497
famous book, and if you decide that this is an interesting subject you

00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:20.867
would like to explore further, then this is most certainly the book for you.

00:02:22.087 --> 00:02:28.397
There is a terrible statistic that the average car spends 95% of its life

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:34.967
stationary, parked still, doing nothing, and most importantly, taking up space.

00:02:35.797 --> 00:02:39.887
Most people don’t think that this really costs anything.

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:45.477
Indeed, if you see a parked car, whether that’s on the street or in

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:50.587
a garage, your first reaction probably isn’t “wow, that’s expensive”.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:56.197
Perhaps if you are the owner of the car you might be paying to park your car

00:02:56.287 --> 00:03:02.237
there, but the point that Professor Shoup would make is that in almost every case

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:08.057
you won’t be paying enough for parking, and the true cost is hidden from view.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:14.427
Now, to get into exactly why this is, and how this has changed,

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:18.817
we need to take a trip back to the start of the 20th century.

00:03:19.547 --> 00:03:23.417
Before the mass adoption of private cars, people would

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:27.267
simply walk or travel by horse and cart to their destination.

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:34.667
Cities tended to be much smaller in terms of land area, people worked closer to where

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:40.827
they lived, and it just wasn’t a requirement for most people to travel long distances.

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:47.637
If you were rich enough to afford your own horse and cart, you would travel to your

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:53.407
destination and the horse and cart might wait there for you to finish your business.

00:03:54.157 --> 00:04:00.737
As the horses were replaced by cars, and cars outnumbered horses, urban planners

00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:07.087
needed to find a way to accommodate these new cars while they weren’t in use.

00:04:07.987 --> 00:04:13.047
Roads were widened, and on the edges designated parking

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:17.177
spaces were created, what we would call on-street parking.

00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:20.947
They were, in almost all cases, free.

00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:26.207
There was no payment required, and anyone could stay as long as they liked.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:33.107
Horses and carriages never needed to pay, so why should the automobiles that replaced them?

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:40.287
The parking meter, the first paid parking space, was invented in 1935,

00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:46.437
but by then people had got so accustomed to parking being free that

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:52.257
there was an outcry when they first started appearing on US streets.

00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:58.337
They didn’t appear on British streets until 1958, and there was a

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:04.617
similar backlash when motorists were suddenly forced to pay to park their

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:08.917
cars on the streets, something that they were used to doing for free.

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:14.747
Alongside paid on-street parking, many city governments started

00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:20.067
requiring property developers to create off-street parking spaces with

00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:25.017
every new building, in order to reduce pressure on on-street parking.

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:30.807
These laws varied greatly from city to city, country to country.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:36.997
In the US, for example, the number of parking spaces required might

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:41.117
be based on the size of an office building, it might be based on

00:05:41.117 --> 00:05:46.897
the number of beds in a hospital or number of seats in a restaurant.

00:05:47.707 --> 00:05:52.767
The result of many of these laws was that property developers were legally

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:58.637
required to build a set number of parking spaces based on the type of building.

00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:01.107
Fair enough, you might be thinking.

00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:08.047
People need to be able to get to these places, and for many people public transportation

00:06:08.157 --> 00:06:13.377
isn’t an option, so it’s a good thing to make sure that parking spaces are available.

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:18.997
Hold on to that thought, as we’ll get to some of the alternatives in a minute.

00:06:20.287 --> 00:06:24.147
The result of these policies, in the cities and countries in

00:06:24.147 --> 00:06:29.197
which they existed, is simply a vast number of parking spaces.

00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:34.497
Now, we’ll mainly be talking about the United States here, but you may

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:39.497
recognise that a lot of what we’ll say also applies in your own country.

00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:45.887
In the US it is estimated that there are eight parking spaces

00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:51.517
for every single car, so that’s over two billion parking spaces.

00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:58.687
A parking space itself is about 17 square metres, but when you consider that you need

00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:06.087
to leave room for a car to go in and out, and roads into and out of a parking lot, one

00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:13.477
parking space takes up around 37 metres squared, the size of a small studio apartment.

00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:18.637
And then you need to multiply that by 2 billion, because

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.241
there are two billions parking spaces  in the US.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:26.181
In many cases, city planning laws actually required

00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:30.181
more space for parking than for the actual building.

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:38.281
And the requirements were often quite arbitrary, and far greater than what was really required.

00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:45.381
The result of this was that, in many cities especially across the US, parking

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:51.151
was so easy to find at your destination that it would be foolish not to drive.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:57.951
Petrol, or as Americans would say, “gas” was cheap, public transportation

00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:03.661
was often poor, and parking was free, so of course you were going to drive.

00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:09.821
This caused more cars on the road, which meant more parking spaces needed to be built, and the

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:16.191
result was the situation that exists still today in many cities across the world, where driving

00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:23.151
is still the most convenient option, primarily because it was easy to park wherever you wanted.

00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:26.161
And most importantly, it was free.

00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:28.111
Or was it?

00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:32.421
There’s a saying in English that “there’s no such thing

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:36.241
as a free lunch”, which means “nothing in life is free”.

00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:42.161
And when parking is concerned, the saying rings true, it is certainly correct.

00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:48.571
There are a multitude of hidden costs to parking that most people

00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:53.811
don’t consider, and that we all pay, even if we don’t have a car.

00:08:54.681 --> 00:09:01.401
Let’s first talk about what it costs to create parking spaces, and then discuss how we pay for it.

00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:08.171
Firstly, you have to physically build a parking space, they aren’t made from nothing.

00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:13.931
For an on-street parking space in the US it is estimated to cost around

00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:21.661
$1,750 to build it, and then another $400 to maintain every year.

00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:29.921
Off-street parking spaces are even more expensive, as you have to either dig underground or

00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:35.991
create entire buildings for them, and the sky's the limit for how expensive they can get.

00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:44.871
It cost $130 million to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and then another

00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:53.091
$110 million to build the parking lot, which was paid for by the Los Angeles local government.

00:09:53.661 --> 00:10:00.911
There are 2,500 spaces there, so it’s a cost of $44,000 per parking space.

00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:05.041
Secondly, there’s the cost of the land itself.

00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:11.641
If a developer wants to build a restaurant and they are required to have 20 parking spaces,

00:10:11.781 --> 00:10:17.561
they might need to buy a plot of land that is 2 or 3 times as big as the restaurant.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:22.941
Similarly, if there’s a building with a garage built underneath

00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:26.551
it, this space doesn’t magically appear from nowhere.

00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:29.551
It is taking up the space that could be used for

00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:33.761
something else - storage, offices, or even more housing.

00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:40.191
Thirdly there’s the cost of leaving that piece of land open, unavailable for

00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:46.561
development for something more profitable or useful than being a place to store a car.

00:10:47.441 --> 00:10:56.561
House prices can be up to €25,000 per square metre in central London, so by leaving up to 30 square

00:10:56.561 --> 00:11:02.951
metres available for every parking space, the city is leaving vast amounts of money on the table.

00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:06.681
So, who pays for it, and how?

00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:09.991
Well, all of us, indirectly.

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:15.641
With the example of the restaurant, the prices are higher than they

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:19.221
would be if there was no parking, because the cost of building the

00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:23.741
parking and the land for the parking have to be recouped somewhere.

00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:27.211
With the example of the building, people who live in the

00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:31.511
building are paying more, because the housing supply is reduced.

00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:38.331
And overall in a city, the more space that is given up for parking the less space there is

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:45.361
available for housing, therefore the price that we all pay, whether we buy or rent, is increased.

00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:51.761
And this is before we have even considered some of the “quality of life”

00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:56.831
costs that we all pay by encouraging cars to drive into city centres.

00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:03.081
It’s estimated that up to 30% of congestion in congested downtown

00:12:03.091 --> 00:12:07.921
areas is caused by cars circling looking for a parking space.

00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:14.761
This applies in city centres, where people are looking for on-street parking, and has become

00:12:14.841 --> 00:12:20.441
even more of a problem as cities have started to reduce the amount of on-street parking.

00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:26.811
And what price do we put on having walkable cities, what price do we put on having

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:32.471
cities with cleaner air, what price do we put on having greener cities where

00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:38.021
parking spaces have been turned into spaces for humans and nature, not cars.

00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:43.951
The price we pay for it differs, and depends on the value that each

00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:48.961
one of us places on it personally, but again, it certainly isn’t free.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.061
So, what can be done?

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:58.611
Well, let’s talk about some of the ideas that urban planners, in particular Professor Shoup,

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:04.741
have suggested, before talking about how this problem can be solved in the medium term.

00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:10.331
The main point that Professor Shoup makes is that parking is simply far

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:16.451
too cheap, and if drivers were made to pay the real cost for it, people

00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:20.501
would drive less and look for alternative modes of transportation.

00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:27.221
At the moment the cost is subsidised by everyone, meaning we all pay more

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:32.241
for almost everything so that people can park conveniently and cheaply.

00:13:33.051 --> 00:13:39.991
Shoup says that there shouldn’t be a fixed number for what the price of parking actually is, there

00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:46.961
isn’t a dollar or Euro amount for what the “right” cost of parking should be, but that cities

00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:54.391
should dynamically adjust the cost so that there are always a few on-street parking spots available.

00:13:55.241 --> 00:14:01.591
It should be expensive enough that it is a deterrent, that it discourages people from

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:07.381
using their cars to drive into city centres, but should still be available to some drivers.

00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:12.471
Secondly, Shoup says that urban planners should abolish all

00:14:12.471 --> 00:14:16.861
laws around parking requirements, and the market should decide.

00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:22.011
If a restaurant wants to have a bigger dining space and

00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:26.091
fewer parking spaces then that should be its decision.

00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:31.081
This, Shoup proposes, would be a more efficient way of

00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:34.021
finding the right amount of parking spaces per building.

00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:41.081
Shoup’s seminal work was published in 2005, and since then much has changed.

00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:45.981
Indeed, we are closer to a future with autonomous vehicles

00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:51.571
now, in 2021, than we are to when Shoup’s work was published.

00:14:51.911 --> 00:14:56.011
It was published 16 years ago, and most estimates have

00:14:56.221 --> 00:14:59.641
full autonomy arriving in less than 16 years’ time.

00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:05.831
In a world of autonomous vehicles, where you could be dropped off at your destination,

00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:12.471
the need for parking at your destination is greatly reduced, if not completely eliminated.

00:15:13.411 --> 00:15:19.981
Whether you believe in a future of shared autonomous vehicles, a sort of self-driving taxi

00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:26.711
situation, or a situation where you can drive yourself to a destination and then you go and

00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:33.571
tell your car to drive itself to an out of town parking lot to wait for you, the end result is

00:15:33.581 --> 00:15:40.351
similar: cities no longer need to give up their valuable inner city space to parking spaces.

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:45.491
It’s hard to find many people, apart from those people making their livelihoods

00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:50.711
from parking, who would shed too many tears about a world that looked like this.

00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:57.451
When people were angry about being forced to pay for parking, or angry about no

00:15:57.451 --> 00:16:03.411
longer being able to park conveniently on the street, the frustration wasn’t directly

00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:08.471
about the parking spaces, it was about an increased inconvenience in their journey.

00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:15.181
If a future of autonomous vehicles allows people to get to where they want with

00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:20.181
all of the convenience of a personal car that turns up right at their final

00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:26.761
destination, but with none of the inconvenience or cost–direct or indirect–of

00:16:26.771 --> 00:16:31.711
finding a parking space, then this must surely be a commendable development.

00:16:32.221 --> 00:16:34.661
And what would this look like for cities?

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:41.921
Well, as some cities discovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there were fewer people driving

00:16:42.031 --> 00:16:49.081
into the centres and less parking required, cities with fewer parked cars can be a beautiful thing.

00:16:50.161 --> 00:16:55.171
For many of us, we were so used to seeing lines of parked cars on

00:16:55.171 --> 00:17:00.151
the street that we were blind to how a road would look without cars.

00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:07.181
And suddenly, when a city has the opportunity to test out removing the parking spaces

00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:13.051
from a street, such as Amsterdam in the Netherlands and even Nottingham in the UK,

00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:18.171
residents have discovered that their cities suddenly become a lot more pleasant

00:17:18.241 --> 00:17:24.311
to walk around, there are more cyclists, and the spaces that had previously been

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:30.121
reserved for cars for the past century are reclaimed by the people of the city.

00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:38.831
Unfortunately, these cases of parking spaces being reclaimed are still few and far between, and

00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:45.961
especially populist governments love handing out free parking as a way to please constituents.

00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:51.936
In Valletta, the capital of the small Mediterranean island of Malta and

00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:57.401
a city that has been a UNESCO world heritage site since 1980, the city

00:17:57.401 --> 00:18:03.371
government has actually got rid of pavements to make way for parking spaces.

00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:11.571
It might seem mad, but instead of getting rid of parking spaces to make room for pedestrians, the

00:18:11.571 --> 00:18:19.161
exact opposite is happening, and only to please the local car-driving residents and win votes.

00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:26.931
Even in cities like London, which have ambitious emissions targets and some forward-thinking

00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:34.381
policies about car use it’s still possible to park your car on-street completely for free if

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:40.391
you are a resident and you have an electric car, and even if you have the most polluting car

00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:49.611
imaginable it only costs £158 a year for the most expensive area of London, so that’s around

00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:57.421
€185 to store your car on a piece of land that could be worth three quarters of a million Euros.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:05.791
It is a huge subsidy for anyone who drives a car, but a subsidy that certainly isn’t free.

00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:08.121
So who pays for it?

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:09.421
All of us.

00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:14.941
Residents, tourists, homeowners, renters, absolutely everyone.

00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:19.541
Professor Shoup, in his seminal work, asks a question

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:23.361
that is as relevant now as it was back in 2005.

00:19:24.191 --> 00:19:27.211
He asks, “Who pays for free parking?

00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:29.791
Everyone but the motorist.”

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:37.921
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The True Cost of Parking.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:42.371
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:47.611
whether you are a passionate driver who goes everywhere by car or someone

00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:51.811
who doesn’t even have a driving licence, I hope it has made you think about

00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:56.491
parking, and the way in which cities are planned, in a slightly different way.

00:19:57.201 --> 00:20:01.211
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:04.401
What is the parking situation like in your city?

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:07.001
How has it changed over the years?

00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:11.501
Do you think parking is too expensive, too cheap, or just right?

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:15.661
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:21.091
The place for that is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:24.831
You can even ask me how I ended up going from working in

00:20:24.831 --> 00:20:27.161
a parking technology company to making this podcast...

00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:33.481
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:38.511
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

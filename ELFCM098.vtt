Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.230
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.900
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.750
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about GDP,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.060
Gross Domestic Product, and thinking about how we measure growth.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.900
You are probably familiar with GDP as a broad measure of ‘how well things are going’.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.300
In the news we’re bombarded with statistics about GDP going up or down,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.590
with political leaders using it as a way to show how well they are doing.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.920
But what actually is GDP, what does it tell us about how our lives

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.000
are improving, why do people think we should abandon it as a measure

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.890
of growth, and what would a world without measuring GDP look like?

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.163
That is all to come in today’s episode.

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:16.873
Before we get right into that though, let me just quickly remind you that you can get

00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:23.023
all of the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, the transcript, and the key vocabulary for

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:28.553
this episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:33.233
This is also where you can also check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:38.583
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:43.953
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:44.723 --> 00:01:47.643
So if that's of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:51.533
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:56.263
OK then, GDP and measuring growth.

00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:02.543
For millennia, for thousands of years, most societies didn’t

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:06.983
really have a formal way of measuring how well they were doing.

00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:14.303
There might be how much money a king or queen took in through taxes, or how many years

00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:20.123
a country had gone without a war, or how much corn was produced by its people that year,

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:26.253
but there was no universal measurement that answered the question ‘how are we doing?’

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:33.283
On an individual level, people might do better or worse as the years go by.

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:41.763
With agrarian societies, farming societies, naturally a lot of this was based on the weather - the

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:48.583
right mix of sun and rain might lead to a bumper harvest, and a drought might lead to famine.

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:54.283
This wasn’t really within their control, so why bother obsessing

00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:58.803
over whether one year was better or worse than the previous one?

00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:08.443
So how did we arrive at this system of GDP growth being ‘the’ measure of how well we are doing,

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:15.203
of being the measure that is considered the ultimate mark of how things are going in a country?

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:21.493
It all goes back to the start of the 20th century, almost 100 years ago.

00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:29.943
An economist called Simon Kuznets was trying to understand the impact of the Great Depression

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:36.513
in the United States, and came up with a metric that took everything that was produced

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:42.283
in a country, apart from money that was spent by the government, and added it all up.

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:49.113
The idea behind doing this was to see how bad the Great Depression really was.

00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:53.693
If you can’t measure it, it’s hard to properly understand it.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:59.063
This idea was then developed by the famous economist John Maynard Keynes

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:04.863
during World War Two, who changed it slightly to include government spending.

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:10.213
Maynard Keynes saw that the government was spending a lot of money on the war

00:04:10.223 --> 00:04:16.333
effort, and this was economic activity, so it should be counted towards this number.

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:21.063
So, GDP is a number, it’s what you get when you add

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:24.253
everything together in an economy that you can measure.

00:04:24.853 --> 00:04:30.673
To calculate it you have to add up consumption, so what people buy, whether that’s

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:36.873
goods, like a sandwich, or services, like a haircut or a membership of Leonardo English.

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:42.213
Then you add into that government spending, investment that’s made by

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:47.813
companies and individuals, and the final part is net exports, so that’s

00:04:47.813 --> 00:04:52.823
the difference between how much a country exports and how much it imports.

00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:59.243
Importantly, if a country imports more stuff than it exports,

00:04:59.563 --> 00:05:04.463
this means this number is negative, so reduces the GDP total.

00:05:05.453 --> 00:05:09.293
In a country like the US, consumption is the largest

00:05:09.323 --> 00:05:13.813
part of GDP, normally about two thirds of all GDP.

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:17.913
So when people stop spending, GDP drops.

00:05:18.993 --> 00:05:22.308
There are a few different ways of calculating GDP, but

00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:26.453
they should all, theoretically, lead to the same number.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:34.313
And politicians, policymakers, and economists all want this number to go up every year, and

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:41.793
the GDP of the world has gone up every single year since 1961, with one exception, 2009.

00:05:42.563 --> 00:05:46.223
The next exception will probably be 2020, of course.

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:53.603
In any case, this number has been going up and up overall, and we have become obsessed with it.

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:58.123
Its main advantage is that it’s quite easy to measure.

00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:02.613
You do your calculations, and you get a number in the end, and

00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:06.153
you can compare that to other countries and to previous years.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:11.353
It’s easy, or at least it’s easier than some of the alternatives.

00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:18.323
But there are quite a few problems with using it as a way to measure the ‘growth of a

00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:24.993
society’, there are some negative implications of focussing on growth as an end goal for

00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:30.443
the world, and there are some interesting ideas proposed about what we can do about this.

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:33.743
So, problems with GDP.

00:06:35.173 --> 00:06:41.323
To start with, GDP was never intended to be a measure of ‘how well we’re doing’.

00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:48.593
Even when it was created, its creator, Kuznets warned against using it as a

00:06:48.603 --> 00:06:53.493
measure of welfare, of using it as a measure of how well people are doing.

00:06:54.833 --> 00:07:01.303
He warned that it counts how much stuff is being bought and sold, but not how happy we are.

00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:04.743
This was back in 1934, remember.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:11.753
In the post-war years, as being able to buy more stuff and rising incomes

00:07:11.993 --> 00:07:16.983
generally meant higher standards of living in many countries, better healthcare,

00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:21.853
better schooling, improved technology, which did make people’s lives better,

00:07:22.273 --> 00:07:27.363
GDP was a pretty ok metric for answering the question ‘how are we doing?’

00:07:28.883 --> 00:07:33.873
If you were able to buy more things like dishwashers, cars, and

00:07:33.883 --> 00:07:37.693
medicine to help you live longer, your life probably was getting better.

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:45.443
But in recent years, as GDP growth hasn’t translated into better standards of living

00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:51.503
for lots of the developed world, there have been renewed criticisms of its usefulness.

00:07:52.603 --> 00:07:56.253
The first one is about how it’s actually calculated.

00:07:57.503 --> 00:08:00.983
It adds everything that’s bought and sold, everything

00:08:00.983 --> 00:08:04.393
that’s measurable, no matter what that thing is.

00:08:05.373 --> 00:08:09.723
If something is ‘free’, then it isn’t included in GDP.

00:08:10.733 --> 00:08:17.133
If I read a fantastic book, then I give that book to my friend and she reads it and also

00:08:17.203 --> 00:08:23.683
thinks it’s fantastic, then only me buying the book will be counted in the GDP calculations.

00:08:24.763 --> 00:08:29.853
But if I read this fantastic book, refuse to give it to my friend after

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:34.433
I finished and say no, you go and buy it yourself, and she does buy it,

00:08:34.823 --> 00:08:38.993
then this would be counted as twice as good from a GDP point of view.

00:08:39.973 --> 00:08:46.043
Or to make this example even more ridiculous, if I read a fantastic book, refuse

00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:50.733
to give it to my friend so she has to buy it, but then I take the book,I light it

00:08:50.753 --> 00:08:56.413
on fire and throw it into her apartment so her apartment burns down, she has to buy

00:08:56.413 --> 00:09:01.553
a load of new stuff for her apartment, and I get taken to prison, then all of that

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:06.973
would count as excellent economic activity and would be great for the GDP numbers.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.190
Which of those three situations would make everyone happier?

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.860
Now, that’s obviously a bit of a silly and unrealistic

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.390
scenario, but it helps illustrate the limitations of GDP.

00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:28.671
If a company gets the permission to build a coal power station in a natural park and hires

00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:35.551
1,000 people but they all have horrible jobs, and the power station sends black smoke all

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:40.921
over the park, spoiling it for all the visitors, and of course putting millions of tonnes of

00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:46.711
carbon into the atmosphere, the only thing that’s counted there from a GDP point of view is

00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:52.011
the amount of money that those employees spend and the amount of money invested by the company.

00:09:53.037 --> 00:10:00.647
If you contrast that with, let’s say, a company that is tasked with planting trees and regenerating

00:10:00.827 --> 00:10:07.687
a natural park, invests the same amount of money, hires the same 1,000 people on the same salaries,

00:10:07.897 --> 00:10:13.597
they all love their jobs, and it makes the natural park way more attractive for guests, and actually

00:10:13.637 --> 00:10:20.567
takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, then this would have the same GDP impact as our first scenario.

00:10:21.627 --> 00:10:26.617
I’m sure you’d agree that they don’t have the same impact on everyone’s quality of life.

00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:32.667
Another criticism of GDP is that it doesn’t factor in anything that

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:38.447
is unpaid, such as housework, childcare, or time spent not working.

00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:44.497
One factor that contributes to the US having a higher GDP per capita,

00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:49.577
a higher GDP per person than a country like Germany is that the Germans

00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:53.817
take a lot more time off, a lot more holiday than their US counterparts.

00:10:55.247 --> 00:11:00.597
If you aren’t working, you aren’t producing, and so you don’t appear in the GDP calculations.

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:06.277
If you are buying stuff, sure, you have an impact, but if you have the most

00:11:06.517 --> 00:11:11.707
fantastic hike in the mountains, a football game with your friends, or just an

00:11:11.717 --> 00:11:17.041
afternoon playing with your kids, that isn't going to factor in the total GDP.

00:11:18.074 --> 00:11:22.824
The other main complaint that is waged at GDP is that it doesn’t

00:11:22.854 --> 00:11:27.824
always reflect how well the average person is doing in a society.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:34.224
To get GDP per capita you divide GDP by the number of people in a country.

00:11:34.774 --> 00:11:41.174
If GDP per capita goes up, this suggests that everyone is doing better,

00:11:41.824 --> 00:11:48.404
but GDP per capita can go up even if the lives of most people don’t get any

00:11:48.404 --> 00:11:53.684
better, or it can do even if the average person’s life is getting worse.

00:11:55.014 --> 00:12:01.814
This isn’t just theoretical, it's exactly what happens in countries with high levels of inequality.

00:12:02.864 --> 00:12:10.057
In the US the incomes of the richest 1% have more than tripled since the 1970s , while

00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:15.967
real wage growth for ordinary people has remained stagnant, it hasn't really moved.

00:12:16.947 --> 00:12:23.537
But for almost every year since 1970, GDP per capita in the US has risen.

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:31.777
So GDP can give the illusion that everyone is better off, even if this isn’t the case.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.587
It doesn’t reflect inequality at all.

00:12:36.217 --> 00:12:41.697
And finally, from an environmental point of view, GDP assumes that everything

00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:47.057
has the same value, as our earlier example of the coal power plant demonstrated.

00:12:48.397 --> 00:12:54.287
Evidently, lots of economic activities have a negative environmental cost to them, a cost

00:12:54.287 --> 00:13:00.827
which will be paid by future generations, and this isn’t accounted for anywhere in GDP.

00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:08.057
The relentless focus on increasing GDP is also considered to be one of the main

00:13:08.057 --> 00:13:12.547
reasons that we are struggling to meet the carbon emissions reduction targets.

00:13:13.537 --> 00:13:19.937
A focus on GDP as a measure of how society is getting better does nothing to discourage

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:26.197
environmentally-unfriendly activities, and our society has actually been structured

00:13:26.437 --> 00:13:32.877
to incentivise more, not less consumption, which comes at an environmental cost.

00:13:33.737 --> 00:13:39.887
From clothes to washing machines, everything we buy has an environmental cost

00:13:39.897 --> 00:13:47.127
to produce, transport, and sell, and if we could only consume less of it, so the

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:52.697
argument goes, that would be a very simple way of reducing our carbon footprint.

00:13:53.727 --> 00:14:00.637
But the focus on GDP means any reduction in consumption is considered ‘bad’, and should be avoided.

00:14:01.667 --> 00:14:07.707
A government could, for example, create legislation that required things like fridges,

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:14.337
washing machines, or consumer electronics to last longer, or to have longer guarantees,

00:14:14.877 --> 00:14:20.747
but doing so would mean people would buy less of them, which would lower GDP.

00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:28.887
So you can see why using GDP as a measure of ‘how well we’re doing’ is quite problematic.

00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:35.757
Not all countries have settled for GDP as a measure of success though, and there

00:14:35.757 --> 00:14:40.537
are some really interesting ideas about how to better measure ‘how we’re doing’.

00:14:42.077 --> 00:14:46.677
You may have heard of how this is being done in Bhutan, the Buddhist country

00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:51.577
in the Himalayas, between the economic powerhouses of India and China.

00:14:52.647 --> 00:14:59.917
Since 2008 Bhutan has been measuring something called GNH, Gross National Happiness,

00:15:00.447 --> 00:15:07.157
as an alternative to GDP, but the idea has been popular in the country since the 1970s.

00:15:08.587 --> 00:15:15.177
The idea is that the country should be able to measure the overall happiness of its population.

00:15:16.487 --> 00:15:19.667
If people are getting happier, then that’s a good thing.

00:15:20.257 --> 00:15:23.732
If people are not getting happier, then it needs to figure

00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:27.625
out why that’s not happening and do something about it.

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:36.147
GNH, the Gross National Happiness,  is then calculated based on 9 different things: well-being,

00:15:36.717 --> 00:15:44.746
health, how that person uses their time, their education, cultural diversity and resilience,

00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:53.140
good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.710
The end result is a number for that individual, which is then

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.720
averaged out and they get a score for ‘how happy they are’.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:09.340
In this example someone who worked 100 hours a week in a high-paying corporate job

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:15.490
but had chronic back pain and never saw their family would get a lower score than

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.710
someone who worked 30 hours a week but saw their friends and family every day.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.890
Of course, if you were measuring this by GDP, our high-powered

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.960
but sad and pained corporate worker would score a lot higher.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.830
Now, there are plenty of criticisms about how this happiness index is

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.230
actually implemented in Bhutan, but the principle is quite appealing.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:47.530
If we, as humans, want to be happy, then surely measuring our happiness and trying

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:52.980
to help everyone in society be as happy as they possibly can be must be a good thing?

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.400
This, of course, isn’t the only approach though.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.140
You may be familiar with the OECD’s Human Development Index, which takes

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:09.010
into account GDP per capita, but also life expectancy and education.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.310
The idea being that the amount of money you have and the economic activity you

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:21.620
produce matter, but also how long you live and what kind of an education you get.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.060
Can you guess the countries that come out highest here?

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:33.030
In 2019, Norway was number one, Switzerland number two, and Ireland was number three.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.930
However, the Human Development Index has come under criticism because it just

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:46.400
focuses on inputs, not outputs, it focuses on what goes in, not what comes out.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:52.050
With education, for example, it takes into account how long a

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.400
child goes to school, not the quality of the education they get.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:04.910
So in 2018 the World Bank released a new metric, something called the Human Capital

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:10.480
Index, which measures things like the percentage of children that survive past

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:16.370
the age of 5, but also how healthily they grow, and how well they are educated.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.900
Can you guess the countries that come out highest in this one?

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.250
They’re actually all in East Asia - Singapore is

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.450
number one, South Korea is second, and Japan is third.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:36.750
Qatar, the country that occasionally comes out top in the GDP per capita charts, because

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:43.430
of its large oil reserves, is number 60 in this index, between Montenegro and Georgia.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.030
There is another really interesting idea called the Genuine Progress Index, the GPI.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:58.730
The idea behind this is to measure ‘growth’ like you might do in a business, you add up all of the

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:05.360
good things, the income you receive, and you subtract from that the negative things, the costs.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.820
So like with GDP, you add up things that are bought and sold, but you take

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.440
away from this the costs, so things like inequality, pollution, and so on.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:24.360
The theory is that this will give you a real, fair, and long-term view of how

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:30.410
well a country is doing, and how healthy its growth is both for the people living

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:36.060
there now, and for the people living there in 10, 20, or 100 years from now.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:42.460
So, there are plenty of alternatives for GDP, and for measuring how we grow.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.070
And there are those that say we should ditch, we should

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.640
get rid of this constant pursuit of growth forever.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.210
So what would that actually look like?

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.020
The good news is that for developed countries, once most people’s basic needs

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.550
are met, growth doesn’t seem to lead to better outcomes and happier people.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:13.510
The United States is the classic example here of a relentless pursuit of economic growth.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.230
Despite having one of the highest GDP per capitas, and being one of the richest

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:25.483
countries in the world, there are plenty of countries with much lower GDP per capitas

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:31.150
that have much better life expectancies, better schooling, and better healthcare.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.410
Indeed, South Korea and Japan, both countries that have a GDP per capita

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:43.540
of almost one third less than the US have much higher life expectancies

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.050
and, as we’ve heard, rank much higher on the human capital index.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.040
This all seems to be evidence to suggest that abandoning GDP

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.150
growth as an idea wouldn’t actually be so terrible at all.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.600
It would evidently take a huge shift in mindset, and a new way of thinking

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.380
about our lives and what we want to achieve, but if the example of

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:14.640
the past 20 years or so is anything to go by, not all growth is equal.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.870
And GDP as a measure is a pretty poor way of measuring how well we’re doing.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:28.620
As Robert Kennedy, the American politician, and brother of JFK said in his presidential campaign

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:37.270
of 1968 about GDP, “it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.400
OK then, that is it for today's episode on GDP and measuring growth.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.070
It’s a fascinating topic, and I do wonder how many countries

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:54.830
will move away from GDP as their north star in the coming years.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:01.610
And if, perhaps, someone is listening to this in 50 years time, firstly, hello, greetings

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:08.930
from 2020, and secondly, I wonder whether this focus on GDP will all seem very weird to you.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.500
But for those of you listening in 2020, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

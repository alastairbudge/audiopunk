Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.550
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.690
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.150
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about an unusual robbery.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.870
It’s a story that involves agriculture, an organisation labelled a mafia, free-market vs planned

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.180
economics, a bunch of canny criminals and $18 million worth of prize Canadian Maple Syrup.

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:46.915
OK then, let’s get started and learn about The Great Canadian Maple Syrup Robbery.

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:54.155
There is a saying in English of “money doesn’t grow on trees”.

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:58.545
It’s the kind of thing you might say to someone who is spending too

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:03.225
much money or asking for something that costs a lot, to remind them

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:07.525
that money doesn’t just magically appear, it doesn’t grow on trees.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:12.425
A parent, for example, might tell a child who is asking for an

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:16.949
expensive birthday present that “money doesn’t grow on trees, you know?”

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.769
But in one corner of the world, money does grow on trees.

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:30.569
Or at least some trees produce a resource so valuable that it has the nickname of “liquid gold”.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:36.479
The tree is the maple tree and the liquid gold is “maple

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:40.439
syrup”, a liquid twenty times more valuable than oil.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.969
Now, in case you don’t know what maple syrup is, or you have never had

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.669
the joy of tasting it, it is a sugary brown viscous liquid that is often

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:56.629
enjoyed with pancakes or waffles or toast, particularly in North America.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.659
There are maple trees all over the world, there are around 132 different species of maple trees.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:11.219
But only three can produce this liquid gold, only three produce maple syrup.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.929
And if you think that getting this glorious liquid from the tree is as

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.579
simple as going up to a maple tree and squeezing the leaves or drilling

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.183
a hole inside and filling up a bucket, you would be much mistaken.

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:31.763
Not only are there only three types of maple tree that can produce maple syrup,

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.563
but the weather conditions have to be just right to get the liquid out of the tree.

00:02:38.213 --> 00:02:42.863
It has to be very cold at night, below freezing, and then above

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:47.603
freezing during the day, ideally between 4 and 7 degrees Centigrade.

00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:54.183
These temperature changes cause the gases in the liquid to expand and contract,

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:59.033
resulting in pressure changes inside the tree which make the liquid move up

00:02:59.153 --> 00:03:03.173
and down the tree: down the tree at night, and then up again during the day.

00:03:04.373 --> 00:03:09.313
These conditions are only found in a small patch of North America in the late

00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:15.383
winter period, from February or so, and only for a period of around 6 weeks.

00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:21.173
Practically all the maple syrup in the world is collected in this short timeframe.

00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:29.143
Now, the way that the liquid is extracted is by making a hole in the tree, adding a tap

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:35.743
which interrupts the flow of the liquid, and syphoning it off into a pipe or a barrel.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:41.081
And when you have this liquid, it requires serious processing.

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:47.711
It needs to be boiled at high temperatures for extended periods of time, and you need

00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:54.511
around 50 litres of it to produce one litre of what is eventually sold as maple syrup.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:04.091
The result is this 100% pure, sticky and–importantly for our story–expensive syrup.

00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:08.331
And the world centre for maple syrup is Canada.

00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:14.221
Not just Canada, but Quebec, the French-speaking province in the north east of the country.

00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:22.091
Quebec is responsible for around 70% of the world’s production of maple syrup, so if you have

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:27.621
ever enjoyed some maple syrup on your pancakes, there is a good chance that it came from Quebec.

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:35.291
And if you live nowhere near Quebec and you have ever tasted maple syrup, this is probably in no

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:41.656
small part thanks to the marketing efforts of an organisation called FPAQ, the “Fédération des

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:49.051
producteurs acéricoles du Québec” in French, or the Federation of Maple Syrup Producers in English.

00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:56.120
It actually changed its name in 2018 but in the interests of simplicity I’ll use the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.950
old name, FPAQ, because the events we will be talking about took place before 2018.

00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:10.427
Now, FPAQ is essentially a governmental organisation that is responsible for regulating

00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:16.377
the supply, distribution and marketing of maple syrup in the province of Quebec.

00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:22.417
And given how much of a stronghold Quebec maple syrup has on the global maple

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:27.947
syrup market, you could say that FPAQ is a semi-global regulator of maple

00:05:27.947 --> 00:05:33.467
syrup, a sort of sugary OPEC, the organisation that does the same thing for oil.

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:38.039
This maple syrup regulatory organisation was founded

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:43.689
in 1966, and has grown in size and power ever since.

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.579
One of its jobs is to promote the interests of maple syrup producers

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.819
worldwide, so it does stuff like create marketing campaigns to

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.729
advertise maple syrup to people around the world, and create demand.

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:01.879
So, that’s why you might have heard of maple syrup, or why maple

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.339
syrup might be able to be bought at a supermarket near you.

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:11.159
Domestically, it has another, more important and certainly more

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.979
controversial role: that of regulating the supply and sales of maple syrup.

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:26.117
It assigns quotas to each producer, and all maple syrup sales have to go through FPAQ.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:32.129
The rationale behind this is to stabilise the price, ensuring that the market

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.619
isn’t flooded with too much maple syrup, thereby driving the price down.

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:39.729
Now, why is this important?

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.359
Well, because of the way that maple syrup is collected, by tapping trees and

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.269
collecting whatever comes out, it is quite hard for producers to know how

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:54.823
much they will collect at any given year  - it’s not like farming corn or

00:06:54.973 --> 00:06:59.103
sheep or pigs, where you have a pretty good idea of what you’ll get each year.

00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:04.563
The maple syrup harvest is much more variable, the amount produced

00:07:04.573 --> 00:07:09.253
each year can fluctuate by 50% or so from one year to the next.

00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:15.933
In a completely unregulated market, this can lead to years where large

00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:20.833
amounts are produced, and producers are forced to accept much lower prices.

00:07:21.793 --> 00:07:26.993
So, this is the idea behind FPAQ and its quotas, to ensure that this doesn't happen.

00:07:28.043 --> 00:07:33.653
If a maple syrup producer produces more than their quota, they need to hand over

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:39.293
the excess to FPAQ, which stores it in a strategic reserve, a huge warehouse.

00:07:40.403 --> 00:07:46.253
The logic behind this is that during years of lower production, these strategic reserves can

00:07:46.253 --> 00:07:51.613
be released, sold onto the market, so there is a constant amount of maple syrup available.

00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:56.683
The nice thing about maple syrup is that, like oil, it

00:07:56.683 --> 00:07:59.993
can be stored for a long period of time without going bad.

00:08:00.323 --> 00:08:04.813
It has such a high sugar content that it can be kept for several years.

00:08:06.213 --> 00:08:11.703
The kicker though, the bad thing for the maple syrup producers, is that they don’t get

00:08:11.773 --> 00:08:17.463
paid for this excess maple syrup until it's sold, and this can be several years later.

00:08:18.773 --> 00:08:25.223
So they have a boom year, a great year in terms of the amount of maple syrup they produce, but they

00:08:25.223 --> 00:08:31.513
won’t see any extra money from this because they have to hand it over to the FPAQ strategic reserve.

00:08:32.343 --> 00:08:36.913
Now, as you might expect, not all Quebec maple syrup producers were

00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:42.453
happy about this, and from the early 2000s, when this quota and strategic

00:08:42.453 --> 00:08:47.693
reserve system was introduced, a thriving black market started to emerge.

00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:54.043
After all, like oil, maple syrup looks and tastes pretty

00:08:54.043 --> 00:08:57.983
similar, you can mix it together and it is impossible to trace.

00:08:58.293 --> 00:09:03.613
There’s no way of telling what is “legal” and “illegal” maple syrup - it’s all the same stuff.

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:09.533
FPAQ cracked down heavily whenever it discovered producers selling on the

00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:14.143
black market, and heavy fines would be issued by the Canadian judicial system.

00:09:14.943 --> 00:09:19.413
After all, it was a government-enforced organisation, you couldn’t opt out,

00:09:19.603 --> 00:09:24.883
it was the law, all sales needed to go through FPAQ and if you exceeded

00:09:24.883 --> 00:09:28.893
your quota, you needed to hand over the rest to the strategic reserve.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.473
But, because of the ease of selling maple syrup, and due to the fact that it

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:39.143
was designed to be eaten and customers would literally eat the evidence, it

00:09:39.143 --> 00:09:43.243
was somewhat of an impossibility to completely shut down the black market.

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:51.893
Now, to get into the main course of the episode, in 2011, after a particularly strong season of

00:09:51.893 --> 00:09:58.683
maple syrup production, FPAQ realised that it didn’t have enough room in its main strategic reserve.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:05.403
The maple syrup was stored in large barrels, each containing over 200 litres of maple syrup.

00:10:06.243 --> 00:10:10.713
They were piled high up, one upon the other, in a giant warehouse.

00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:18.531
But the warehouse was quickly filling up, and FPAQ scrambled to find another suitable location.

00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:25.561
They ended up choosing a warehouse in a small town just outside Montreal and rented

00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:31.111
out a large section of the warehouse to act as an extension of the strategic reserve.

00:10:32.621 --> 00:10:36.332
The owner of this warehouse was a man called Avik Caron.

00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:43.461
It seems that FPAQ didn’t do much of a background check on him, because if they had done they

00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:48.571
would have discovered that he was a convicted fraudster, with allegations of mafia connections.

00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:52.081
Probably not the sort of person you’d want to trust

00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:54.791
with tens of millions of dollars worth of anything.

00:10:56.261 --> 00:11:01.181
And when he was approached by FPAQ, and learned of its precious treasure

00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:05.541
it was planning to store at his warehouse, he had a dastardly idea.

00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:10.241
He knew that security at the warehouse was lax at

00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:13.551
best, it really wasn’t a particularly secure location.

00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:18.191
There was a security guard and a few cameras, but it was a shared

00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:22.421
warehouse; anyone could rent space and come and go as they pleased.

00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:28.246
And FPAQ was planning to leave thousands of barrels of maple syrup, literally

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.180
tens of millions of dollars worth of the stuff, just lying around there?

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.400
His plan was simple.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.930
Steal it.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.110
But of course, he wasn’t able to do it on his own.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.310
He had a criminal past, but he had no maple syrup connections, and no

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.130
understanding of the industry other than there was a lot of money in it.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.090
He needed partners in crime, people who would be

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.800
able to help him transport and sell the maple syrup.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.810
He first contacted a lorry driver, a man named Sébastien Jutras.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.190
He would manage the logistics and transport, but he also

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.963
linked Caron up with a man called Richard Vallières.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.090
Now, Richard Vallières was the maple syrup connection, he

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.820
was a man for whom maple syrup almost ran in his blood.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.420
His father, Raymond Vallières, was a maple syrup producer, but

00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:32.020
Richard operated more on the fringes, as a so-called “barrel roller”.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:38.350
What this meant was that he was a sort of trader, a broker, who would put

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.770
together buyers and sellers of maple syrup, under the table of course.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.000
In other words, he was a black market guy, he was the sort of

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.340
person who could move large quantities of unauthorised maple syrup.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.640
He had the contacts, he knew what he was doing, and he

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.750
knew how to do it without attracting the attention of FPAQ

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.370
Avik Caron needed a few more people though.

00:13:05.775 --> 00:13:11.069
He needed a place to temporarily store the stolen maple syrup, a sort of headquarters,

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:16.499
and Richard Vallières was happy to recommend his father’s maple syrup farm.

00:13:17.809 --> 00:13:22.699
And finally, they needed someone to get the syrup out of Quebec, to

00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:28.019
export it not only to other provinces of Canada, but outside the country.

00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:35.749
For this, they contacted a man called Étienne St-Pierre, who was based in New Brunswick.

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:42.359
Importantly, this was outside of Quebec, so he wasn’t under the

00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:47.439
jurisdiction of FPAQ; he could buy and sell whatever he wanted.

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:51.589
So, with this, the gang was complete.

00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:56.329
Avik Caron had the warehouse in which the maple syrup was being stored.

00:13:56.809 --> 00:14:01.709
Richard Vallières was the barrel roller and would organise the sales.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:07.749
His father, Raymond Vallières, provided the headquarters and temporary storage.

00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:12.969
Sébastien Jutras was the driver and Étienne St-Pierre would

00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:17.039
sell the stolen maple syrup to importers all over the world.

00:14:17.812 --> 00:14:23.612
But if you are thinking that the next chapter of the story is going to be some daring robbery

00:14:23.622 --> 00:14:28.572
in the middle of the night with guns, flashlights, and followed by a police chase with

00:14:28.582 --> 00:14:34.942
helicopters and mad pursuits through Canadian forests, I’m sorry but I must disappoint you.

00:14:35.882 --> 00:14:39.242
The theft took place over the course of nearly one

00:14:39.242 --> 00:14:44.232
year, from July of 2011 to July of the following year.

00:14:45.272 --> 00:14:46.292
And it went like this.

00:14:46.902 --> 00:14:52.782
The criminals had rented space in the warehouse, as seemingly legitimate paying customers.

00:14:54.042 --> 00:14:59.542
This meant that they had access badges, and could come and go as they liked.

00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:05.982
When they understood the times of day that the warehouse was likely to be empty, which

00:15:06.112 --> 00:15:10.882
was typically in the early hours of the morning, they would enter the warehouse, not

00:15:10.892 --> 00:15:17.102
go to the section that they had rented but continue to FPAQ’s area, which was filled

00:15:17.262 --> 00:15:24.549
with row upon row of stacked white barrels, all neatly numbered, stamped and labelled.

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:27.349
Then they would…take them.

00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:33.969
They would load them onto a truck, drive them to Raymond Vallières’ maple syrup farm, pour

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:40.259
out the maple syrup into smaller containers, then refill the barrels with water from a nearby

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:46.449
stream, and drive them back to the warehouse, putting them back in their original location.

00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:52.579
They knew that the maple syrup was checked, tested when it first arrived

00:15:52.579 --> 00:15:57.609
at the facility, but after that, the only thing that was monitored was

00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:01.739
the weight, hence why the men refilled the barrels with water each time.

00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:04.629
And, it worked.

00:16:05.169 --> 00:16:06.189
Nobody noticed.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:08.249
It seemed too easy.

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:14.499
Each barrel had something like $1,300 worth of maple syrup in it, so

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:18.479
they could steal hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in an evening.

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:23.639
They went back and back, taking more and more until the strategic maple

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:27.849
syrup reserves became more like the strategic river water reserves.

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:30.279
But nobody knew.

00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:36.109
After all, the barrels were still there, nobody was going to check that the maple syrup was still

00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:41.789
inside, FPAQ had seemingly not even considered the possibility that someone would steal them.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.493
But the theft was taking too long.

00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:49.963
It was an intensive process, especially the filling up of the barrels

00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:53.153
afterwards and driving them back to the warehouse to replace them.

00:16:54.153 --> 00:16:57.513
Every time they did it, it was a chance that they’d get caught.

00:16:58.663 --> 00:17:03.533
So, the thieves made a decision that probably seemed clever at the time.

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:08.923
Instead of taking the barrels away from the warehouse, refilling them

00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:13.203
with water, and then driving them back, the men just took the maple

00:17:13.203 --> 00:17:17.753
syrup out of the barrels directly in the warehouse, leaving them empty.

00:17:19.113 --> 00:17:25.543
This was a big time saver, but what it meant was that there was a load of empty barrels.

00:17:26.103 --> 00:17:30.443
If they were weighed, well the theft would be discovered immediately.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:37.580
Moving into the spring of 2012, the speed of the theft went up a notch.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.400
The men knew that the annual inspection of the strategic reserves

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.180
took place in July, and understandably, they were nervous.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.980
It was crunch time.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:54.650
By this point, they had stolen more than 60% of the total maple syrup in the

00:17:54.650 --> 00:18:00.370
warehouse, so if an inspector opened up a barrel, there was a strong chance

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.870
that they would be met not by golden sticky syrup but by stagnant river water.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.930
Or by an empty barrel.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.400
They did what they could, trying to dim the warehouse lights so it was harder

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.800
to see and spraying dust around to hide any marks or signs of interference.

00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:22.257
They could make it harder for their crime to be uncovered,

00:18:22.707 --> 00:18:26.097
but there was nothing they could do to stop the inspection.

00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:32.707
On July 30th, of 2012, a man called Michel Gauvreau

00:18:32.727 --> 00:18:35.597
was in the warehouse, conducting the annual inspection.

00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:41.167
Barrels were piled up high, six levels up, and he

00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:43.897
had climbed up to the top to reach the highest level.

00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:50.907
As he was doing that, though, he felt one wobble and start to give way beneath him.

00:18:51.872 --> 00:18:57.142
Presumably, thoughts flashed through his mind that he was about to topple to the ground

00:18:57.352 --> 00:19:03.322
from a height of more than 5 metres or be crushed by hundreds of barrels of maple syrup.

00:19:04.327 --> 00:19:07.947
It would have been a strange way to go, and would presumably

00:19:08.127 --> 00:19:11.467
have made for a good start to a murder mystery story.

00:19:12.347 --> 00:19:14.567
But it didn’t work out that way.

00:19:15.557 --> 00:19:20.267
Instead of crashing to his death, he managed to regain his balance.

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:24.677
When he had done that, he wiggled a few of the maple syrup

00:19:24.687 --> 00:19:28.967
barrels, he moved them to see why they were dislodged so easily.

00:19:30.297 --> 00:19:35.847
As he did, it became clear that they were empty; there was no maple syrup inside.

00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:41.527
He alerted FPAQ, and more inspectors descended on the facility.

00:19:42.957 --> 00:19:48.517
It took a long time for them to ascertain the true extent of the theft, but by the

00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:55.837
time they'd done this, they concluded that the thieves had drained 9,571 barrels

00:19:56.107 --> 00:20:04.093
and stolen a total of 3,000 tonnes of maple syrup, worth an estimated $18 million.

00:20:04.897 --> 00:20:10.117
There was a large police investigation, but it was not an easy case to crack.

00:20:11.037 --> 00:20:17.887
The maple syrup had gone, that much was clear, but they didn’t know how, when or where.

00:20:19.027 --> 00:20:22.087
The police looked at the other occupants of the warehouse,

00:20:22.297 --> 00:20:25.437
after concluding that it must have been an inside job.

00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:30.907
They also saw unusual marks on the barrels, indicating that

00:20:30.907 --> 00:20:34.627
they had been moved by a particular type of forklift truck.

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:41.057
They called around all of the heavy machinery rental shops, and found one that had been

00:20:41.057 --> 00:20:46.397
rented by Sébastien Jutras, the driver, who was on their list of potential suspects.

00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:53.437
He was arrested by the police, questioned, and he soon cracked, revealing the

00:20:53.437 --> 00:20:58.247
identities of all of the participants in the crime, and testifying against them.

00:20:59.747 --> 00:21:04.967
Richard Vallières was determined to be the ringleader of the group, and given

00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:10.177
the heftiest sentence, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison and ordered

00:21:10.177 --> 00:21:15.837
to repay $9 million of the supposed $10 million he earned from the crime.

00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:21.607
Jutras, the driver, got off most lightly, given his cooperation with

00:21:21.617 --> 00:21:25.757
the authorities, but he was still sentenced to eight months in prison.

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:32.587
As to the question of why they did it, well the simple answer is “the money”,

00:21:32.937 --> 00:21:37.617
but it seems that there were deeper-rooted reasons, at least for some of them.

00:21:39.127 --> 00:21:45.967
The Vallières father-son pair had a deep-seated hatred of FPAQ, and this seemed

00:21:45.997 --> 00:21:50.357
like one way that they could fight back at the organisation that they considered

00:21:50.357 --> 00:21:56.177
to exert a mafia-like grip over small-scale, honest maple syrup producers.

00:21:57.424 --> 00:22:04.582
And this case, and the media coverage of it, raised discussion over the legitimacy and efficacy

00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:10.662
of FPAQ, and the extent to which it benefited or harmed the maple syrup industry in Quebec.

00:22:11.862 --> 00:22:16.962
Its greatest proponents say it has finally allowed maple syrup farmers to

00:22:16.962 --> 00:22:22.652
earn a decent living, while its critics took this robbery as an example of the

00:22:22.652 --> 00:22:27.394
lengths to which people will go to protest against this regulatory oversight.

00:22:28.219 --> 00:22:32.882
Now, to end this episode I will answer one question that you might be wondering.

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:35.922
Where did all of this stolen maple syrup go?

00:22:36.342 --> 00:22:41.622
Where did this almost $20 million worth of sugary goodness disappear to?

00:22:42.782 --> 00:22:47.412
The answer is that almost all of it was sold on the open market.

00:22:48.082 --> 00:22:55.282
It was exported to the United States, to Europe and to Japan, so if you ate maple syrup

00:22:55.572 --> 00:23:02.962
between 2011 to 2013, let’s say, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that you

00:23:03.022 --> 00:23:07.842
had a hand in destroying the evidence in the greatest robbery in Canadian history.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:14.400
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the great Canadian maple syrup robbery.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.660
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that whether

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.400
you are a maple syrup fan or you have yet to try it, the next time you pour some of

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.170
that sticky golden goodness over your pancakes, well, you’ll think of this amazing tale.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.510
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.910

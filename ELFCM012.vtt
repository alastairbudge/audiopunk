Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast.

00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:10.102
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:17.906
Today we are going to be talking about a sea that quite literally shrunk to a fraction of its

00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:18.866
original size.

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:26.343
The Aral Sea used to be the fourth largest lake in the world, but there's probably a good chance

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.173
that you have never heard of it.

00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:34.368
Before we get right into the podcast, I just wanted to give you a quick reminder that you can grab a

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:40.458
copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the website, which is

00:00:40.528 --> 00:00:45.991
Leonardoenglish.com there's also a load of material on there about how to learn English with

00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:49.861
podcasts, so it's well worth a look if you haven't done so already.

00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:55.554
If you're listening to the podcast on the website with the key vocabulary and transcript in front of

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:59.604
you, then congratulations, you are one step ahead of the game.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.515
Okay then.

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.454
The Aral Sea, have you ever heard of it?

00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:09.714
Well done if you have and extra bonus points, if you know exactly where it is.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.832
The Aral Sea is located in central Asia, with its northern part in Kazakhstan and the southern part

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:18.872
in Uzbekistan.

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:28.260
Crucially until 1991 this was all part of the Soviet Union and therefore fell under Soviet central

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.710
planning.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:36.423
Even though it's called a sea, it's actually a freshwater lake and has no roots to the sea at all.

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:41.499
Anyway, it's name is the Aral Sea, so we'll continue to call it that.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:48.139
Up until 1960 the Aral Sea was still the fourth largest lake in the world.

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:54.532
Its water came from two large rivers called the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya.

00:01:55.972 --> 00:02:05.470
By 1995 the sea had lost three quarters of its water volume, and by 2014 the eastern part of the sea

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.623
had completely dried up for the first time in 600 years.

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:14.613
It's now split into several parts.

00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:20.585
The northern Aral Sea, which is in Kazakhstan and the southern part, which is in Uzbekistan.

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:29.393
As large parts of the seabed are now completely dry, you can see shipwrecks, abandoned cars and

00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:36.863
buses, and a plethora of Soviet era junk that is just left abandoned on the ground.

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:44.262
On the Western part of the sea you can drive along what used to be the bank of the sea and look over

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:51.522
what is a cliff to see the carcasses of old vehicles that had fallen into the sea when it was, well,

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:52.422
still a sea.

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:57.503
I'll put some photos up on the Instagram account of these carcasses of ships.

00:02:57.593 --> 00:02:58.973
It's really quite amazing.

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:04.418
The drying up of the sea has caused a huge shift in the local environment.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.417
Thriving fishing communities have had to leave, and entire villages have been turned into ghost

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:12.017
towns.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:20.636
Evidently, this has caused huge pain for the local inhabitants who have either had to up sticks and

00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:24.250
leave or adapt to a completely new situation.

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.255
But how is this even possible?

00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:29.595
Seas don't just disappear.

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:31.425
Where did all the water go?

00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:38.030
Well, we had a little clue at the start of this podcast about what might have caused the fate of the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.747
Aral Sea: Soviet central planning.

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:46.510
As part of the old Soviet Union, the Aral Sea fell under Soviet central planning.

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:54.988
What this means is that policy, from political right through to agricultural, came from Moscow.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:02.895
In plain English, this means that everything was decided centrally from Moscow, even decisions that

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:05.355
would affect places thousands of miles away.

00:04:06.557 --> 00:04:14.227
In the late 1950s Moscow decided that the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan

00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:17.267
were to become a hub for cotton farms.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:24.226
You can perhaps imagine the central planners looking at a map of the vast Soviet Union, trying to

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:28.186
decide which areas should focus on which particular crops.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:35.937
I imagine it like a group of people playing Risk, pushing armies and settlements over borders in a

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:37.767
bit of a haphazard way.

00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:42.923
The central Asian basin is huge.

00:04:42.953 --> 00:04:50.911
It's mainly a desert and the idea of turning it all into a massive centre for supplying cotton to

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:55.392
the rest of the country, I imagine it could have looked interesting on paper.

00:04:55.943 --> 00:05:03.646
The plan was for it to create more than 10 million acres of land that could be used for crops, but

00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:06.766
it turns out there were a few problems with this idea.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.420
Firstly, cotton is a pretty thirsty plant.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.770
It requires a lot of water to grow.

00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:20.374
Specifically, it requires 7.8 megalitres per hectare to grow.

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:26.336
Now, that might not mean a huge amount to you, it didn't mean a huge amount to me, but if we bring

00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:27.866
it down to the level of a tee shirt.

00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:37.576
There's research from Oxfam that suggests even now it can take up to 2,700 litres of water to make a

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:40.996
single cotton t-shirt like the one that you might be wearing at the moment.

00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:49.123
So trying to start a hub for cotton production in a desert, well, you're going to need a lot of

00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:53.422
water and deserts are not famous for having a lot of water.

00:05:54.266 --> 00:06:00.926
So the Soviet central planners decided to irrigate these new farms, to provide water for them,

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:08.084
diverting almost all the water from the two large rivers that fed the Aral Sea, by building these

00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:16.313
canals away from the Aral Sea and taking the water towards these new thirsty cotton plants, they

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:25.613
built a vast irrigation network of more than 45 dams, 80 reservoirs, and a total of 20,000 miles of

00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:26.063
canals.

00:06:27.514 --> 00:06:33.181
On top of this, these canals were pretty inefficient, they didn't work very well.

00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:40.330
They lost somewhere between a quarter and three quarters of the water to the desert, so it never

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.000
reached the cotton plants in the first place.

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:47.883
All of this fresh water was cut off from reaching the Aral Sea.

00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:55.063
The water that was there continued to evaporate, and as the water evaporated, the salinity of the

00:06:55.063 --> 00:07:01.979
water, that means the amount of salt that there is in it, continued to rise going from about 10

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.679
grammes of salts per litre to a hundred grammes.

00:07:06.938 --> 00:07:13.898
This has had a huge effect on the entire ecosystem, as you might imagine, you can't just 10 times

00:07:13.898 --> 00:07:17.678
the saltiness of the water and expect nothing to happen.

00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:19.316
And what happened?

00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:21.806
Well, it wasn't good news.

00:07:22.154 --> 00:07:30.055
Fish and marine life died in their masses, and commercial fishing catches, so that's the, um, the

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:36.375
amount of fish that were caught commercially, not personally, commercial fishing catches fell from

00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:40.065
43,000 tonnes in 1960.

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:43.905
So 43,000 to zero in 1980.

00:07:45.285 --> 00:07:54.014
Imagine that a sea that used to supply one sixth of the Soviet Union's entire fish catch, 20 years

00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:59.624
later, all the fish had died and commercial fishing was no longer even possible.

00:08:00.488 --> 00:08:02.618
It wasn't just the fish that died out though.

00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:10.726
The salty bed of the dry sea blew onto the farmland nearby and as the bed was contaminated with

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:18.136
fertilizer and pesticides, it wasn't just a public health hazard, it also settled onto agricultural

00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:20.986
fields, damaging the soil and plants.

00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:31.456
The result of this was that between the years of 1960 and 2018 the sea has reduced in size by 90%

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:33.556
and split in two.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:42.676
Indeed, one interesting thing you can do yourself is to Google the Aral Sea, have a look at the view

00:08:42.676 --> 00:08:46.126
on Google Maps, and then look on to the satellite view.

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:47.416
It's pretty amazing.

00:08:48.112 --> 00:08:55.683
You can see that the Aral Sea is now practically two seas, both of them continuing to dry up year

00:08:55.683 --> 00:08:56.253
after year.

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:59.562
So is there any end to this?

00:08:59.562 --> 00:09:00.462
What's happening now?

00:09:01.062 --> 00:09:05.362
Well, there are some attempts to halt the disappearance of the Aral Sea.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:13.730
The World Bank funded a project to build a dam in Kazakhstan in 2005 which should help improve the

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:19.652
health of the Syr Daria, which is one of the two rivers that provides water for the Aral Sea, as

00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:22.792
well as help fill up the northern Aral Sea.

00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:30.132
There is some evidence to suggest this is working, with water levels in the north Aral Sea having

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:36.587
risen three metres since 2005, and three metres, that's quite a lot in terms of rising sea level.

00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:42.197
What this means - again, you can have a look at Google maps if you're interested - is that

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:50.279
Kazakhstan, which is to the north of the sea, has in effect dammed the northern part of the Aral Sea

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:56.439
so that the Syr Darya river, which is one of the two main sources of water to the sea, will only

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:58.809
supply water to the northern part.

00:09:59.469 --> 00:10:06.009
So the southern part won't get any water from this main river that used to provide all of its water.

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:13.115
Understandably, the Uzbeks are not happy with this as it's cutting off the southern part of the sea

00:10:13.115 --> 00:10:15.405
completely from this source of water.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.222
Unfortunately, there isn't much light at the end of this tunnel for the southern Aral Sea, for the

00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:23.002
Uzbek part.

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:30.525
For a rejuvenation of the Aral Sea, a mass project would be required to divert water away from the

00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:32.985
cotton fields and back towards the sea.

00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:35.505
I mean, the water is still going to the cotton fields.

00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:36.555
Things haven't really changed.

00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:43.935
Uzbekistan is still the fifth largest cotton producing country in the world and the Uzbek government

00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:48.825
is reluctant to do anything that would jeopardise the livelihood of its farmers.

00:10:49.668 --> 00:10:56.937
It is a unfortunate but not unfamiliar story of countries putting economic development above

00:10:57.177 --> 00:10:58.587
environmental restoration.

00:10:58.986 --> 00:11:06.327
The reality is that the fate of the Aral Sea is inexorably linked to cotton the flourishing of one

00:11:06.717 --> 00:11:09.327
can't happen without the demise of the other.

00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:15.431
If you are waiting for the good news part at the end of the podcast, well, I'm afraid there really

00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:21.254
isn't one, at least for the Uzbekistan part What I will say though, is that if you ever have the

00:11:21.254 --> 00:11:24.464
chance to visit Uzbekistan, just do it.

00:11:25.094 --> 00:11:28.654
I was there in 2012 and it is a fascinating place.

00:11:29.444 --> 00:11:33.354
Of course, if you do manage to go there, make sure you visit the Aral Sea.

00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:40.499
It is one of the most amazing places in the world and seeing these ships that are upside down, just

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:46.194
there in the middle of the desert, well, it is very impressive in the most literal sense of the word

00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:46.644
impressive.

00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:54.318
As always, if you have enjoyed the show, please do tell colleagues, friends, family members, or

00:11:54.618 --> 00:11:55.908
anyone who might listen.

00:11:56.238 --> 00:12:01.638
And if you want to tell future internet friends and making a new friend in me, then you could always

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:02.238
leave a review.

00:12:02.698 --> 00:12:08.068
If you are on Apple Podcasts, I think you can probably do it in under 15 seconds and it'll put a big

00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:09.318
smile on my face.

00:12:10.108 --> 00:12:15.148
You have been listening to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:19.558
I'm Alastair Budge and I will catch you in the next episode.

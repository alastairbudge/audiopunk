Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:16.224
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.424
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:26.784
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Apollo 13.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.194
It was meant to be the third manned space mission to the Moon, a routine

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:37.854
scientific journey, and for the first two days pretty much everything went to plan.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.390
But, 56 hours after lift-off and 330,000km from Earth, a defective oxygen tank exploded onboard,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.960
destroying Apollo 13's main life support and propulsion systems and leaving it stranded in space.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.900
It would become an epic story that captivated the nation, a story of

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.030
heroism and bravery, of quick thinking, and hope against all odds.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.470
You may know something already about Apollo 13, you may even have

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.760
seen the film, but today we are going to tell this epic tale.

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:18.427
OK then, Apollo 13.

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:23.256
In 1961, the US President John F.

00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:29.045
Kennedy set the American nation an ambitious goal: to land the first humans

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:33.975
on the Moon and bring them safely back to Earth, before the end of the decade.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:39.336
This resulted in the Apollo Program, which achieved its

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:43.646
goal of landing humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 in 1969.

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:51.086
Although Kennedy’s challenge was fulfilled when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took “one small

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:58.716
step for man, one giant leap for mankind”, NASA hoped to use the remaining “spare” rockets

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:05.236
that had been contracted for the program to make a grand total of 10 manned Moon landings.

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:11.586
Apollo 13 was meant to take advantage of the newly developed precision

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:17.746
landing techniques used by Apollo 12 to land on and explore parts of the Moon.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:23.406
Tasks were to include taking photographs of potential future landing sites

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:28.946
as well as surveying work, deploying a lunar experiment package to gather

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:34.086
samples and improving astronauts' capacity to work on the surface of the Moon.

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:41.086
It was purely a fact-finding mission, a mission to go and collect information about the Moon.

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:49.366
In fact, Apollo 13’s motto, Ex Luna, scientia means from the Moon, knowledge.

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:55.716
The men chosen to go on this mission were three, experienced astronauts.

00:02:56.356 --> 00:03:02.786
The Mission Commander, the captain if you like, was the highly experienced James A, Lovell.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:12.256
He was the oldest of the group, 42 at the time, and had already clocked up over 572 hours in space.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:18.846
Lovell had previously flown other NASA missions including Apollo 8 in 1968.

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:24.906
Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit, to fly around the Moon.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:32.176
Lovell’s experience and cool head would prove crucial, essential, later on in the mission.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:39.380
There were two other astronauts on the crew, both responsible for different parts of the spacecraft.

00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:44.166
The Command Module Pilot of Apollo 13, with the role

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:48.369
of navigator, was the 28-year-old John L Swigert.

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:55.276
Swigert was originally only part of the backup crew, he was only chosen for Apollo

00:03:55.276 --> 00:04:01.266
13 after another member of the crew was exposed to Rubella, an infectious disease.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:07.836
The Command Module, by the way, was the part of the spacecraft which housed the crew, the

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:13.596
equipment for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere and the operation systems for the spacecraft.

00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:18.376
You can think of it as a sort of “headquarters”, or HQ, of the spacecraft.

00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:24.406
Behind the Command Module, at one end of the spacecraft, was something

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:28.386
called The Service Module, which was a bit like a store room.

00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:36.316
It was unpressurised and contained things like the fuel cells, oxygen, hydrogen and life

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:42.046
support supplies, pretty much all of the supplies that were needed for Apollo 13 to function.

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:46.906
At the other end of the spacecraft was The Lunar Module, the

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:50.476
bit that was designed for landing on the surface of the Moon.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.346
In charge of this part of the spacecraft was the

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:58.816
youngest member of the crew, the 26-year-old Fred W.

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.056
Haise, who had the role of Lunar Module Pilot.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:09.236
When the Apollo spacecraft reached the Moon, the Lunar Module would detach and take

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:15.226
two astronauts down to land with its own dedicated power, water and oxygen supplies,

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:20.265
while the third crew member would remain in orbit around the Moon in the Command Module.

00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:25.906
Let’s not forget that the spacecraft crew were assisted

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:28.896
by a large and dedicated team back on the ground.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:34.396
NASA’s Mission Control, at the Manned Spacecraft Centre in Houston, would

00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:39.476
constantly monitor the spacecraft’s every move and tell the astronauts what to do.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:44.296
In essence, ground control was the “fourth” team member of the mission.

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:51.796
So, now we have a better idea of the background to the mission, who the crew were and a rough

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:56.840
idea of the actual spacecraft, let’s take a look at what actually happened to Apollo 13.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.346
After a slight glitch at lift-off, when one of the rocket’s engines shut down early, everything

00:06:04.346 --> 00:06:10.806
seemed to be going to plan and Apollo 13 left Earth’s orbit on target to fulfil its mission.

00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:16.726
A glitch, by the way, is another word for a sudden fault or a temporary malfunction.

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:23.936
But other than this small glitch, the first 56 hours or so were pretty uneventful.

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:29.676
So uneventful in fact that when the crew filmed themselves onboard

00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:34.366
the spacecraft for TV back on Earth, no channels decided to show it.

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:40.306
After Neil Armstrong and Apollo 11 had landed on the Moon, lunar missions

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:44.236
simply weren’t that interesting anymore, they had lost their novelty.

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:48.046
Soon enough, the entire country would be watching.

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:56.166
At approximately 56 hours into the flight, when the spacecraft was nearing the moon, Swigert, the

00:06:56.336 --> 00:07:02.486
Command Module Pilot, was asked to perform a routine piece of maintenance on the oxygen tanks.

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:07.316
Mission Control believed that one of the oxygen tank’s pressure

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:10.686
reading sensors was malfunctioning, it wasn't working properly.

00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:18.611
Swigert flipped the switch to run the tank fans, when suddenly there was a loud bang.

00:07:19.711 --> 00:07:24.721
It later came to light that one of the oxygen tanks had been damaged before lift-off.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:31.541
When the switch was activated, the tank began to dangerously overheat, causing it to explode.

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:36.821
Alarmed but as of yet unaware of the seriousness of what

00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.141
had happened, the crew uttered those immortal words.

00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:42.591
“Houston, we’ve had a problem.”

00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:48.491
The Apollo 13 film, if you remember it, used a little artistic

00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:53.031
licence here, changing “we’ve had a problem” to “we have a problem”.

00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:58.411
On a language level, using the “present” tense makes it sound more

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:03.661
dramatic, whereas what he really said was “we’ve had a problem”, he

00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:07.881
was being simply practical and direct, explaining what had happened.

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:12.491
In the moments that followed, the crew and the team at Mission

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:16.551
Control got to work trying to establish what exactly had happened,

00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:21.211
running checks and consulting the ground team’s backroom specialists.

00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:27.861
Power to the propulsion system began to drop considerably and two out of

00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:32.931
the spacecraft’s three fuel cells read as being completely out of power.

00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:39.781
Apollo 13’s fuel cells needed oxygen to power the spacecraft and oxygen tank

00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:44.881
number two was reading empty, while tank number one seemed to be losing pressure.

00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:52.291
At this point the team was hoping that there were just sensor issues but the severity of their

00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:57.681
problems was just beginning to dawn on them, they were starting to realise that they were hundreds

00:08:57.701 --> 00:09:02.931
of thousands of kilometres away from Earth without any good options about how to get back.

00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:09.421
Lovell reported seeing gas pouring out from the spacecraft as he looked out of the window.

00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:13.861
It was now very clear that this was much more than just a sensor problem.

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:18.901
As tank one lost more and more oxygen, it became apparent

00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:22.651
that very soon the last working fuel cell would cut out too.

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:28.971
At approximately 330,000 km from the Earth, Apollo 13

00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.741
was about to lose all of its life systems and power.

00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:36.291
It was clear that they wouldn't be able to make it to the Moon.

00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:40.821
Their only focus was on getting back home, getting back to Earth, alive.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:45.491
Quick thinking was needed as the mission abruptly

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:49.231
changed from a lunar landing mission to a rescue mission.

00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:55.011
Soon the Command Module would be unable to keep the crew alive in

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:59.541
Space, it would very shortly run completely out of power and oxygen.

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:06.521
But the Command Module was the only way the crew could re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:11.321
It had a thick heat shield, radios, parachutes and

00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:14.361
everything else that was required to get back to Earth.

00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:19.111
They couldn’t re-enter Earth in the Lunar or Service Modules, the

00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:23.581
Command Module was the only way they could get back home, but it was

00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:27.801
about to run out of all of its life supplies unless something was done.

00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:33.731
The crew managed to isolate the Command Module’s spare oxygen tank

00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:38.131
and its batteries so that they could conserve power and oxygen.

00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:43.391
As they were still uncertain as to what had actually happened, Houston,

00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:47.681
Mission Control back on Earth, did not want to risk trying to use the last

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:52.011
bit of remaining power to abort the mission and turn straight back to Earth.

00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:56.761
There were worries that the Service Module’s main engine could be

00:10:56.771 --> 00:11:00.561
damaged or that there simply wouldn't be enough fuel to get back.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:08.651
The plan was to move the astronauts into the Lunar module, while they essentially switched off

00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:14.601
everything in the Command module to conserve as much oxygen and energy to get back to Earth.

00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:18.951
The spacecraft would then do something called a free-return

00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:22.861
trajectory and loop around the Moon, back towards Earth.

00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:27.381
Once the crew reached Earth, they could then return to the

00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:31.379
Command Module and start re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:36.731
Just to reiterate that, at the time of the explosion the

00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:40.221
spacecraft was heading towards the moon, away from the Earth.

00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:45.101
Instead of turning back towards Earth, which would have used more

00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:50.081
energy, they decided to continue all the way looping around the Moon,

00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:54.721
using the gravitational pull of Earth to bring the spacecraft back home.

00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.731
It was a bold plan.

00:11:58.471 --> 00:12:03.081
Remember, the Lunar Module, where the astronauts were now squeezed into,

00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:07.691
had only been built to carry two members from the Moon’s orbit to the Moon’s

00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:12.121
surface and back to the Command Module, a distance of less than 100km.

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:19.251
It wasn’t meant for any sizable space travel, any space travel of any serious length.

00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:27.611
Frantically, NASA’s team on the ground got to work crunching figures and trajectories, while trying

00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:34.021
to come up with ways of how they could make the limited power and water supply last until re-entry.

00:12:35.361 --> 00:12:39.871
While the Lunar Module had just enough oxygen to keep the crew alive,

00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:44.171
with the Command Module in hibernation, they risked running out of water.

00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:51.451
Water was not only required for drinking, it was also essential for cooling the equipment onboard.

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:55.991
Normally the Command Module would produce water as

00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:59.631
a byproduct of its hydrogen and oxygen fuel cells.

00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:01.531
The Lunar Module did not.

00:13:02.721 --> 00:13:10.091
Water was therefore rationed to 200 millilitres per person per day and power consumption

00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:15.591
was cut to a minimum, even requiring them to turn off their guidance computer.

00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:21.411
The three men were floating in a tiny container with barely anything

00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:25.111
to drink while the temperature was just above freezing point.

00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:31.571
While they had enough oxygen, they soon began to have a problem with carbon dioxide build up.

00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:39.441
Normally, carbon dioxide would be removed from the cabin air by canisters of special pellets

00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:46.071
but as the Lunar Module was only designed for short-term use, they were soon all used up.

00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:53.691
After a day and a half in the cramped Lunar Module, the CO2 levels had become life threatening.

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:58.781
The Command Module had a supply of extra canisters but they were

00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.031
a different shape and size to those used in the Lunar Module.

00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:07.541
Frantically, the ground support team got to work on creating a workaround

00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:11.921
using the same materials that the astronauts had access to on board.

00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:19.271
NASA came up with a fix using manual covers, tape and cardboard, amongst other

00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:24.261
things, and then talked the crew through building the adapter step-by-step.

00:14:24.991 --> 00:14:30.631
Imagine the frustration and difficulty of calling up the IKEA helpline asking

00:14:30.631 --> 00:14:35.971
how to assemble a cupboard, but the difference being that here you don’t have

00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:42.632
the right parts, you are calling on a very bad telephone line from 300,000

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:45.408
kilometres away in Space and it is literally a matter of life and death.

00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:50.948
Thankfully it worked and the CO2 levels started to drop as

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:54.068
soon as they installed the completed improvised canister.

00:14:55.438 --> 00:14:58.318
With most of the module’s systems switched off,

00:14:58.808 --> 00:15:02.328
temperatures had plummeted to just 3 degrees celsius.

00:15:02.728 --> 00:15:07.408
The crew were uncomfortable, cold and cramped, but they were alive and

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:11.588
headed home, or at least they were now headed in the direction of Earth.

00:15:12.898 --> 00:15:18.058
But actually getting to Earth, getting home safely, would be no mean feat.

00:15:19.148 --> 00:15:24.728
At 133 hours into the spaceflight, Houston asked the crew to fully power up

00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:29.358
the Lunar Module in preparation for bringing the Command Module back online.

00:15:30.268 --> 00:15:33.278
The team wanted to make sure that they had enough time

00:15:33.428 --> 00:15:36.588
to work through rebooting, restarting, the system.

00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:42.318
An Apollo Command Module had never been shut down and restarted in Space before.

00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:46.878
Plus the power was limited and the team on the ground would

00:15:46.878 --> 00:15:50.153
need to figure out the best way for the quickest restart.

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:55.543
Thankfully the crew were able to implement the new procedures and

00:15:55.703 --> 00:15:59.223
restart the Command Module’s systems without too much difficulty.

00:15:59.873 --> 00:16:04.633
Not only did this raise the cabin temperature making it more hospitable for

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:09.153
the crew, but it also meant that the guidance computer was back up and running.

00:16:10.213 --> 00:16:15.673
As Apollo neared the Earth two more minor adjustments were needed to correct its course.

00:16:16.423 --> 00:16:22.243
Around 200 hours into the mission the crew jettisoned, they cast off, the Service Module.

00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:27.657
They could have done this earlier in theory, but the Service Module covered the Command

00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:34.495
Module’s heat shield and NASA was uncertain of the consequences of leaving it exposed in Space.

00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:38.895
And remember, it was in this part of the spacecraft, in

00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:42.145
the Service Module, that the oxygen tank had exploded.

00:16:43.265 --> 00:16:49.155
As the crew jettisoned the Service Module, they got their first chance to look at the damage.

00:16:49.665 --> 00:16:54.932
They discovered that an entire panel of the module’s exterior had been blown off.

00:16:55.882 --> 00:17:01.472
If it hadn’t been sufficiently clear before, the crew had been, and still were, in

00:17:01.472 --> 00:17:07.362
extreme danger and surviving even this far they had already beaten all of the odds.

00:17:08.442 --> 00:17:13.422
Approaching re-entry, as the crew moved back to the Command Module, the last

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:18.732
major problem that needed a quick solution was how to get rid of the Lunar Module.

00:17:19.802 --> 00:17:24.432
On normal missions, the Lunar Module would be jettisoned over the Moon

00:17:24.602 --> 00:17:28.662
when the Command and Service Module was in lunar orbit and the astronauts

00:17:28.662 --> 00:17:32.742
had safely returned to the Command Module spacecraft after their Moonwalk.

00:17:33.462 --> 00:17:38.482
But this was no “normal” mission, and the crew had been using this

00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:42.712
Lunar Module as a temporary storage, it was their lifeboat home.

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:48.122
Once the ground teams had figured out how to best release the Lunar Module,

00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:52.582
the crew jettisoned it to land deep in a trench in the Pacific Ocean.

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:58.022
Re-entry had begun and the crew hurtled down through the Earth’s

00:17:58.162 --> 00:18:01.692
atmosphere for the final nail-biting moments of their mission.

00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:07.642
As Apollo 13 entered the final minutes of its spaceflight, millions

00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:11.352
of people around the World were following it live on TV and radio.

00:18:11.912 --> 00:18:16.592
The entire United States was gripped by the astronauts’ ordeal, with

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:21.082
men, women and children hoping and praying that they would survive the

00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:26.302
re-entry process after having made it so far in such impossible conditions.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:34.052
As with all re-entry procedures, contact was lost with the crew as they began their descent.

00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:40.542
Unknown to the crew, Apollo 13’s trajectory, its direction, had been slightly

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:45.102
adjusted by the Lunar Module’s cooling system on the way back from the Moon.

00:18:46.322 --> 00:18:52.992
This meant that when Apollo 13 re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere, its angle of descent caused it

00:18:53.002 --> 00:18:58.912
to spend more time than expected at higher atmospheric levels where slowing down takes longer.

00:19:00.162 --> 00:19:04.262
Instead of the usual four minutes of radio blackout,

00:19:04.582 --> 00:19:08.532
there was no contact with the crew for six whole minutes.

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:13.942
This was an extremely tense moment on the ground - some people

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:17.572
even thought that the Command Module's heat shield had failed.

00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:23.532
The crew eventually splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, near

00:19:23.712 --> 00:19:28.022
American Samoa, where they were recovered by American military ships.

00:19:28.692 --> 00:19:33.262
All three crew members were alive and well, although Haise was suffering

00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:37.722
from a urinary tract infection, probably due to the lack of water.

00:19:38.752 --> 00:19:44.142
After a night on the recovery ship, they then flew to Hawaii where they were awarded the

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:49.272
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour, by President Richard Nixon.

00:19:50.352 --> 00:19:55.752
Little known to the Apollo 13 crew, the entire country, and really much of the

00:19:55.752 --> 00:20:00.582
world, had been following their progress and praying for their safe return.

00:20:01.152 --> 00:20:07.402
In America alone, over 40 million people watched the Apollo 13 splashdown on TV.

00:20:08.202 --> 00:20:12.282
The crew and their perilous journey made headlines around the world.

00:20:12.862 --> 00:20:17.562
Lovell went on to call the Apollo 13 mission a “successful failure”.

00:20:18.242 --> 00:20:22.002
While there were evident failures, the crew were saved by the

00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:26.122
unprecedented cooperation between the ground team and the astronauts.

00:20:26.682 --> 00:20:30.952
Not to mention the crew’s nerves of steel and professional training

00:20:31.152 --> 00:20:35.842
that allowed them to continuously focus and work even under the extreme

00:20:35.852 --> 00:20:41.092
pressure of being in a protracted, an extended, life-or-death situation.

00:20:42.302 --> 00:20:47.242
The Apollo 13 rescue mission highlighted the risks of manned space travel

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:51.922
and combined with decreasing public interest in the space programme and

00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:58.402
huge budget cuts, the Apollo Program was cut short, ending with Apollo 17 in

00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:04.272
December 1972, when Eugene Cernan became the last human to walk on the Moon.

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:10.812
The story of Apollo 13 might be a lesson to us all about the dangers of putting

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:17.442
humans in space, but it is also one of hope and inspiration, of perseverance, of

00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:22.372
resourcefulness, of teamwork, of the importance of staying calm under pressure,

00:21:22.832 --> 00:21:28.522
and it’s no surprise that it is often referred to as NASA’s “finest hour”.

00:21:31.052 --> 00:21:36.342
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Apollo 13.

00:21:36.342 --> 00:21:40.722
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned a bit about what actually happened

00:21:40.942 --> 00:21:45.872
during the ill-fated space flight and the story behind the crew’s miraculous survival.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:49.785
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:53.765
Do you think we will see humans on the Moon again in your lifetime?

00:21:54.185 --> 00:21:59.963
What about colonising Mars, is this just a dream, or will you live to see humans on Mars?

00:22:00.393 --> 00:22:05.943
And if you could take a trip to space, if money was no object, would you do it?

00:22:06.503 --> 00:22:09.793
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

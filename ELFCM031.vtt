Hello, hello, hello, and welcome

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:09.572
to episode 31 of English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.522
Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.122
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.942
talking about how Google works.

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:22.202
Is the biggest search engine in the world with

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:24.932
80,000 searches per second.

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:29.642
And for most humans, it's how we find information.

00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:35.207
But have you ever actually wondered how it works?

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:38.777
What happens when you press search?

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:44.487
And how is it such a money making machine, valued

00:00:44.487 --> 00:00:46.587
at almost a trillion dollars?

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.857
That's what we'll be talking about in today's

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:50.457
podcast.

00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:55.057
Before we get right into it, though, I have two

00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:56.947
little public service announcements.

00:00:57.277 --> 00:01:00.512
Firstly, thank you to everyone who wrote in with

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:01.832
feedback on the podcast.

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:04.892
I want to build this into the best, most

00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:07.922
interesting way for you to improve your English

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:10.232
while learning fascinating things about the world

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:13.202
and the feedback has been really, really

00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:13.802
interesting.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.429
I'm always on the hunt for more feedback, so if

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.799
there are things that you like, things you don't

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.589
like, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.759
Just email hi 'hi' at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.419
Secondly, for those of you listening to this

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.409
podcast on Spotify, iVoox Apple Podcasts or

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.109
wherever you might be listening, you can get a

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.019
copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for the

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:43.389
podcast over on the website, which is

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:44.639
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.069
We also just launched two new ways to become a

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.639
member, so you can now choose to join by week, by

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.259
month or even by year.

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:54.849
So check that out.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.439
That's over at leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.169
Okay then, Google.

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:05.949
Now this isn't going to be some very technical

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:10.119
analysis or some marketing type-podcast where I

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.459
tell you how you can be number one in the search

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.059
rankings.

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.959
Instead, today we are going to talk about what

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.929
actually happens when you make a Google search.

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.029
What happens in the background.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.719
Why Google decides to show you certain things

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.809
instead of others, and we'll talk about the

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:32.619
money-making machine that is Google Ads.

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:37.180
As you may know, the name of the parent company,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.360
the company that owns Google, is actually

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.260
Alphabet.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.160
It does everything from self-driving cars to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.070
smart-home sensors to health.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.240
That's far too much to cover in detail in today's

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.810
podcast, so we'll be focusing on Google Search,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.960
the search engine, that classic, original Google.

00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:04.036
So I think Google probably needs no introduction.

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:07.876
It's the biggest search engine in the world, the

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.876
most popular website in the world, and it was

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:14.676
visited 62 billion times last year.

00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:19.281
And I don't need to tell you that it's obviously a

00:03:19.281 --> 00:03:21.081
very effective search engine.

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.321
It does one thing incredibly well.

00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:28.071
It organises all the information on the internet

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:31.371
and makes that information easy for people to

00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:31.701
find.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.257
And again, this won't be news for you, when you

00:03:36.527 --> 00:03:39.077
search Google, when you ask Google for something,

00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:41.612
the results are normally pretty good.

00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:44.042
You get the information you're looking for,

00:03:44.582 --> 00:03:48.152
whether that was 'hotel in Madrid' or 'how old is

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.642
the queen' or 'how to learn English with

00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:51.302
podcasts'.

00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:55.502
Google gives you a selection of results that

00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:58.892
answer your question and all in a matter of

00:03:58.892 --> 00:03:59.912
seconds, right?

00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:03.932
All of this information is available at the tip of

00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:04.592
your fingertips.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.307
But if we take a step back, it's quite interesting

00:04:09.307 --> 00:04:12.787
to think about how Google actually does this.

00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:17.287
You could say, well, it's all on the internet and

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:19.657
Google just searches the internet and shows you

00:04:19.657 --> 00:04:20.017
stuff.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.577
At a very basic level, there is some truth to

00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:27.697
that, but it's a lot more complicated.

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.634
Firstly, let's take the term 'the internet'.

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:36.794
There are over a billion unique websites, and it's

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:40.514
estimated that there could be 60 trillion pages.

00:04:41.628 --> 00:04:44.118
Obviously a load of these are junk, they're

00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:48.468
rubbish, but a lot of them do, of course, contain

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:51.948
useful information, the kind of information that

00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:53.238
someone might want.

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:57.646
But there's no central system that organises

00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:00.786
everything, there's not an organisation or a

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:03.006
central database for the internet.

00:05:03.757 --> 00:05:07.133
Google can't just query the internet every time

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:07.883
you make a search.

00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:13.343
So what Google does is it makes its own copy of

00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:16.133
the internet, of webpages on the internet.

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:20.476
It does this by sending what it calls crawlers all

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:24.346
over the internet, and they gather information

00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:27.346
about websites, about webpages, and they bring it

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:28.276
back to Google.

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:32.386
This is sometimes known as Google Spider.

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:35.636
And obviously it's not a real spider, that would

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:36.566
be ridiculous.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:40.586
It is a computer program, an algorithm or series

00:05:40.586 --> 00:05:43.226
of algorithms that are constantly scanning

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:46.946
websites and adding information to Google's copy

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:47.546
of the internet.

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:51.600
But how does it actually know where to look for

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.260
information?

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.340
As we now know, there isn't a central database of

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.060
websites, and of course, new web pages and

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.210
websites are being created every millisecond.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.468
So what Google does is it follows the links on

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:10.188
websites.

00:06:10.368 --> 00:06:13.428
It basically goes from one link to another,

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.308
following links from page to page to page, going

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:20.298
on this huge internet journey, discovering new

00:06:20.298 --> 00:06:23.268
websites, discovering new web pages, discovering

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:27.423
dead or broken links and adding these all to

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:32.043
Google's gigantic copy of the internet, its index

00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:32.673
of the internet.

00:06:33.738 --> 00:06:36.753
Okay, so far so good, perhaps.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.968
But now that Google has this copy of the internet,

00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:44.328
how does it decide what to show you as a search

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:44.748
result?

00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:48.768
Why might you and I see completely different

00:06:48.768 --> 00:06:52.053
things, even if we type in exactly the same thing.

00:06:52.772 --> 00:06:55.980
And how does Google decide what order things are

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.370
shown?

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.090
Again, it's complicated, but Google's aim is to

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.390
answer your question, answer your query in the

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.760
quickest, most efficient way possible.

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:11.345
How does it actually do this?

00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:17.065
Well, the way that Google thinks about this can be

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:19.675
summarised with three things, really.

00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:24.175
Firstly, something called relevance.

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.655
It tries to show you relevant results to the

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.705
question you've asked.

00:07:29.965 --> 00:07:33.535
If you search for 'adopt a dog', you don't want to

00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:37.615
see websites about dog food or about adopting a

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:37.945
cat.

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:41.095
You want to see information about adopting a dog.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.550
Obvious you might think, but it's actually quite

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.630
difficult to get right.

00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:50.736
The adopt a dog example is a bit more

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.676
straightforward, but let's take a slightly more

00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:54.546
complicated one.

00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:59.138
Let's say you search for the phrase "London

00:07:59.138 --> 00:07:59.768
Paris".

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:04.838
Are you looking for train tickets or flights?

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.618
Are you looking for the hotel called 'London' in

00:08:08.618 --> 00:08:09.068
Paris?

00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:13.163
Or maybe you're looking for an obscure artist

00:08:13.163 --> 00:08:14.543
called London Paris.

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:19.865
You could mean a lot of different things and the

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:24.005
results you see depend on who you are, where you

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:27.695
are when you're searching, and a load of different

00:08:27.785 --> 00:08:29.285
other factors.

00:08:30.232 --> 00:08:33.525
The more Google knows about you, the better it can

00:08:33.525 --> 00:08:36.880
try and guess what you might really be searching

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.630
for, and therefore the better or more relevant

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.310
search results it can show you.

00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:46.189
This is why Google wants to collect as much data

00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:50.119
as possible about you in order to show you more

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:53.299
targeted search results, and of course, more

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.229
targeted adverts.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.520
And the relevance of a search result also depends

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.775
on the content of the webpage, the words on the

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:03.225
website.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:07.415
The closer the words on the website are to the

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:10.515
words that you're searching, in general, the more

00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:13.245
relevant Google will think that page is for you.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.560
Back when Google started, over 20 years ago now,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:23.020
people use to fill websites up with supposedly

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.740
relevant words just to trick Google into putting

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.270
them higher up in the search rankings.

00:09:29.441 --> 00:09:32.824
But now at least Google has got a lot smarter and

00:09:32.824 --> 00:09:35.344
lots of these tricks don't work anymore.

00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:39.241
Our second factor that Google takes into

00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:43.681
consideration when deciding what results to show

00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:47.011
you is something that Google calls quality.

00:09:48.207 --> 00:09:50.401
Now, what does this actually mean?

00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:55.441
Well, we know that quality is a scale of how good

00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.131
something is.

00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:59.861
But what does good mean in this context?

00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:06.082
Well, by good quality, Google means webpages,

00:10:06.082 --> 00:10:09.382
websites that are trustworthy, ones that will

00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:11.242
provide accurate information.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:15.752
And going back to our example of searching for

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:19.360
'London Paris Google will show you results from

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.730
websites like eurostar.com or tripadvisor.com,

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.550
websites that you probably know and trust.

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:28.595
All good so far.

00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:32.675
But Google isn't a person, how does it know if a

00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:34.595
website is good quality or not?

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:38.856
Again, this is simplifying it, but the main way in

00:10:38.856 --> 00:10:42.336
which it does this is through the other websites

00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:43.596
that link to it.

00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:49.051
If a website has links from other websites that

00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:51.781
are also considered good quality or good

00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.171
authority, then Google will be more likely to

00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:58.381
consider that website to be a good quality one.

00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:04.021
Likewise, if a website doesn't have any links from

00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:08.071
good quality websites or it has lots of links from

00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:11.761
websites that Google considers spam or low

00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:15.961
quality, well then Google is going to decide that

00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.241
this website isn't very high quality.

00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:23.142
And the final factor of are three important

00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:25.992
factors is user experience.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.430
By this we mean is the website easy for people to

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.910
use and do people seem to like using it?

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.490
Does it load quickly?

00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:41.355
Does it not have those annoying popups that ask

00:11:41.355 --> 00:11:43.695
you to put in your email address or to send you

00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:44.685
notifications?

00:11:45.363 --> 00:11:48.740
Do people tend to continue to stay on it when they

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.200
arrive or do they immediately leave?

00:11:52.518 --> 00:11:55.098
Our friend, the Google Spider, can help with this

00:11:55.398 --> 00:11:58.878
as not only does it make copies of every website

00:11:58.878 --> 00:12:01.938
out there, but it also tries to figure out how

00:12:01.998 --> 00:12:03.828
easy a website is to use.

00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:09.678
So we have these three factors, relevance,

00:12:09.948 --> 00:12:11.988
quality, and user experience.

00:12:13.308 --> 00:12:16.278
With every single search term, Google takes these

00:12:16.278 --> 00:12:19.878
things along with about 200 others into

00:12:19.878 --> 00:12:23.748
consideration and shows you relevant search terms

00:12:23.778 --> 00:12:25.188
in milliseconds.

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.048
Pretty cool, huh?

00:12:27.843 --> 00:12:29.433
And all for free, right?

00:12:29.703 --> 00:12:32.613
You don't pay Google anything for this service.

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:36.903
But note the use of the pronoun you.

00:12:37.953 --> 00:12:39.843
You don't pay Google anything.

00:12:40.773 --> 00:12:45.033
Advertisers, of course, do, and they pay Google

00:12:45.123 --> 00:12:46.773
huge amounts of money.

00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:51.573
Google is just incredibly good at making money.

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:56.302
In fact, in the last quarter of 2019, the last

00:12:56.332 --> 00:13:02.182
three months of 2019, it made almost $6,000 every

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:02.842
second.

00:13:04.342 --> 00:13:07.102
So if we're about 10 minutes into the podcast,

00:13:07.372 --> 00:13:11.062
let's say, Google has probably made about $4

00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:13.612
million in the time that you've been listening.

00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:17.912
And one big thing that we haven't talked about yet

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:22.254
in any detail is ads, adverts.

00:13:23.574 --> 00:13:26.419
Again, another pretty complicated subject, but

00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:28.459
let's try and keep it as simple as possible.

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:33.969
Google is a huge corporation and its objective is

00:13:33.969 --> 00:13:35.589
to make as much money as possible.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:40.929
It does this through showing adverts and like any

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:44.589
advert-supported media platform, it has the

00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:48.539
tradeoff, the consideration, of wanting as many

00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:52.259
people as possible to click on their ads without

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:55.289
people getting too annoyed about there being too

00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:56.099
many ads.

00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:00.269
Obviously it would be super annoying if it was

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:04.049
just ads, but if there were no ads at all, Google

00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:04.919
wouldn't make any money.

00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:10.379
So it's a delicate balance to get right, and as

00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:13.499
you probably have noticed over the past 10 years

00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:17.474
or so, Google has gradually been showing more ads

00:14:17.834 --> 00:14:21.014
and the ads that it has been showing have become

00:14:21.014 --> 00:14:23.894
less and less distinctive from the normal search

00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:24.494
results.

00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:28.105
You don't have to be a genius to figure out what's

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:28.855
going on here.

00:14:29.215 --> 00:14:31.855
Google is obviously hoping that the changes it's

00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:34.585
made will mean that more people click on ads.

00:14:35.444 --> 00:14:38.414
Google Ads is obviously a huge business, and

00:14:38.954 --> 00:14:41.864
agencies that help other companies with Google Ads

00:14:41.894 --> 00:14:44.684
is also a multibillion dollar industry.

00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:47.744
So I'm going to simplify things a little bit with

00:14:47.744 --> 00:14:49.154
the explanation of how it works.

00:14:50.284 --> 00:14:53.644
But the principles are pretty simple and similar

00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:57.574
in some respects to how Google chooses to order,

00:14:57.634 --> 00:15:00.154
to rank, its normal search results.

00:15:01.144 --> 00:15:03.754
So how does Google Ads work?

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:08.164
Advertisers decide that they want their adverts to

00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:12.364
be shown for certain searches, then every time

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:16.954
that there is a search, Google shows adverts based

00:15:16.954 --> 00:15:20.104
on things like how relevant that ad is for the

00:15:20.104 --> 00:15:25.114
search, what is the experience on the website that

00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:28.294
the advertiser has, but also, and here's where it

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:31.624
gets interesting, how much money that advertiser

00:15:31.684 --> 00:15:32.704
is willing to pay.

00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:37.166
And as it's an auction, the more an advertiser

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:40.646
offers to pay, the more another advertiser needs

00:15:40.646 --> 00:15:42.776
to offer to pay to compete with them.

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:47.806
For some searches, because the amount of money

00:15:47.806 --> 00:15:50.926
that the advertiser is likely to make from someone

00:15:50.926 --> 00:15:53.596
clicking on their advert is quite small, they

00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:56.566
would bid, they would offer, a relatively small

00:15:56.566 --> 00:15:57.256
amount of money.

00:15:58.742 --> 00:16:02.192
For example, someone searching for 'cheap bread',

00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:06.032
an advertiser isn't likely to make much money from

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:06.512
that sale.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.607
And for some searches there aren't any ads at all,

00:16:10.697 --> 00:16:14.537
no adverts at all, because those searches are from

00:16:14.627 --> 00:16:16.457
people looking for information.

00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:20.987
For example, someone's searching, how old is the

00:16:20.987 --> 00:16:21.437
queen?

00:16:22.127 --> 00:16:24.167
That's obviously a search for information, it

00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:26.957
doesn't indicate that that person wants to buy

00:16:26.957 --> 00:16:27.377
something.

00:16:28.457 --> 00:16:29.897
The answer is 93 by the way.

00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:35.177
But if someone searches for "buy expensive diamond

00:16:35.177 --> 00:16:38.687
ring now", well, companies that sell expensive

00:16:38.687 --> 00:16:41.687
diamond rings would probably be interested in

00:16:41.687 --> 00:16:45.107
showing adverts to that person and would probably

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:47.837
offer to pay lots of money to appear in that

00:16:47.837 --> 00:16:48.437
search.

00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:54.107
So that person would see adverts from advertisers

00:16:54.107 --> 00:16:57.587
selling diamond rings, and if that person clicks

00:16:57.587 --> 00:17:01.127
on one of the adverts, then the advertiser would

00:17:01.127 --> 00:17:02.117
have to pay Google.

00:17:04.087 --> 00:17:06.997
In fact, the cost that advertisers pay for each

00:17:06.997 --> 00:17:09.217
click can be very large.

00:17:09.757 --> 00:17:13.687
The most expensive search term last year was "best

00:17:13.807 --> 00:17:17.497
mesothelioma lawyer" for which the average amount

00:17:17.497 --> 00:17:25.117
paid for each click was $935, $935 just for a

00:17:25.117 --> 00:17:25.507
click.

00:17:27.197 --> 00:17:30.257
I guess you probably don't know what mesothelioma

00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:30.767
is.

00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:33.407
I didn't either, and I'm sure I'm pronouncing it

00:17:33.407 --> 00:17:34.217
in a terrible way.

00:17:34.877 --> 00:17:38.177
It's a kind of disease caused by exposure to

00:17:38.177 --> 00:17:38.927
asbestos.

00:17:39.887 --> 00:17:42.737
So the advertisers who are bidding on this

00:17:42.737 --> 00:17:46.487
particular search are law firms who are hoping

00:17:46.487 --> 00:17:49.937
that each click is going to bring them more than a

00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:52.757
thousand dollars in new business on average.

00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:54.737
Mad, right?

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:59.162
And so if you are wondering how Google manages to

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:02.252
make quite so much money, well that's how.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.512
There are a load of things that we haven't covered

00:18:06.512 --> 00:18:09.422
in here that I know are pretty interesting, such

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:13.202
as how Google uses our data, the implications of

00:18:13.202 --> 00:18:16.412
this and all of the other stuff that Google does.

00:18:17.402 --> 00:18:19.982
So I hope you'll excuse me for not covering that.

00:18:21.672 --> 00:18:24.402
I just want to share with you a few more strange

00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:27.180
facts about Google that I guess you probably

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.810
didn't know.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.830
Firstly, about 20% of queries of searches that are

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.010
asked every day have never been asked before.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.580
So Google is constantly having to figure out

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.050
answers to new questions.

00:18:44.142 --> 00:18:49.037
Secondly, every search has to travel on average

00:18:49.187 --> 00:18:54.857
1,500 miles to a data centre and back to return

00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:56.927
the answer to the person who searched for it.

00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:00.737
So that question you've just asked, it has

00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:04.482
traveled 3000 miles, it's done a round trip of

00:19:04.482 --> 00:19:07.932
3000 miles and returned to you in under a second.

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:13.238
And finally, a single Google search uses a

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:18.008
thousand computers in 0.2 seconds to find an

00:19:18.008 --> 00:19:18.368
answer.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.680
Okay, I hope that this has been an interesting

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.320
introduction to how Google works.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.640
It's a fascinating company and we have only just

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.020
scratched the surface today.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.140

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.230
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.420
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.940
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Alexander The Great.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.860
To some, he was a cruel warlord, a tyrant, a megalomaniac, and a man whose power went to his head.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.500
But to others he was a wise, benevolent ruler, and the greatest military leader of all time.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.730
So, let’s get right into it and explore the undeniably impressive life of Alexander The Great.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.670
In early June of the year 323 BC, almost 2,500 years ago, there was a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.630
large party in Babylon, an ancient city of Mesopotamia, in modern day Iraq.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.470
The host was Alexander III of Macedon, and he was entertaining his officers.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.950
Wine and drink flowed freely.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.420
These men had been away from home, on a military campaign for 13

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.490
years, and these boozy evenings were always a welcome distraction.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.130
Alexander was not one to abstain from such festivities.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.280
He had developed quite a reputation as a heavy drinker.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.970
It must have been one way to escape his reality, but there was also a more practical reason: he was

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.570
constantly travelling from place to place, finding fresh safe drinkable water was not always easy.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.320
But what he did have in large quantities was wine: safe, tastier than

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.610
water, and its alcoholic properties helped you forget the events of the day.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.830
He went to his room, staggering down the corridor one imagines, and collapsed onto his bed.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.000
When he awoke the following morning, he was probably expecting a bit of a sore head.

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:19.582
It would have been nothing out of the ordinary for the 32-year-old general,  but it would be

00:02:19.582 --> 00:02:25.618
nothing that some fresh air,   olives, and perhaps even another glass of wine would not get rid of.

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:30.738
But when he woke up he was struck by a sickening pain.

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:33.588
This was no ordinary hangover.

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:39.368
He grew weaker and weaker, eventually losing even the ability to speak.

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:43.298
It became clear that the young man was dying.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:48.378
His subjects came to visit him, to pay their last respects.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:53.458
No doubt his thoughts turned to the events of his brief life.

00:02:54.378 --> 00:03:00.888
He was only a month short of his 33rd birthday, but in this time he had managed to conquer

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:06.268
huge swathes of the middle east and Asia, encompassing large parts of modern day Greece,

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:14.348
Turkey, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Uzbekistan, India, and more.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.879
Although this empire would be surpassed by the Roman Empire, and then the Mongol and British

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.159
empires, when Alexander took his last breath he was the most successful military leader of all time.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.089
Nobody had managed to achieve what he had achieved.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:43.059
On either the 10th or 11th of June, 323 BC, he did take his final breath, dying at the

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.229
age of 32, leaving behind a vast legacy that spanned borders, cultures and religions.

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:55.839
So, how did he get there, how did he manage to achieve what he did?

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:03.669
He was born in 356 BC, the son of King Phillip of Macedonia, or Macedon.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.729
Now, King Phillip isn’t particularly well-known, as he is overshadowed

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.499
by his son, but he was a strong leader, and put in place many of the

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:19.079
political and military components that would allow his son to succeed.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.509
Ancient Macedonia was an area of northern Greece.

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:30.479
It was considered a bit of a backwater of Greece, less civilised, too

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:35.639
far from Athens, a sort of incompetent and uncivilised little brother.

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.989
But King Phillip changed this.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:44.759
Through a combination of political alliances, smart marriage matches and the

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.619
training up of the Macedonian army, in the space of only 25 years he managed

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:55.249
to turn the Kingdom of Macedon into the dominant power in Ancient Greece.

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.229
He had big plans too, plans that involved pushing out beyond the

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.969
borders of Ancient Greece, to fight the mighty Persian Empire.

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.139
But his plan was thwarted, cut short, when he was assassinated by his bodyguard.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.879
To this day historians have differing interpretations as to why he was killed, with

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.569
some even suggesting that his son, Alexander, was involved in his father’s murder.

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:31.539
But the important point for the purposes of today’s story is that it meant

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:36.969
that power passed down to his oldest son, the then 20-year-old Alexander.

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:42.559
Alexander by this point had received the best education and

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.633
training that a young Greek king in waiting could hope for.

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:48.889
He was personally tutored by the great philosopher

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.729
Aristotle, learning about logic, reason, and mathematics.

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:55.899
He would have received detailed military training,

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.069
both from a strategic and a practical point of view.

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.609
Not only did he learn how to command an army, but he

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:06.279
would have learned how to fight from an early age.

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:12.019
He was also, by all accounts, a talented and special boy.

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.669
In one famous account, when Alexander was only 10 years old, a horse trader

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:23.329
had brought a large black horse that he intended to sell to King Phillip.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.969
The horse was magnificent, but it was unrideable.

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.119
Whenever anyone tried to approach, it would kick up its legs in the air, it

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:39.109
seemed truly wild, too proud to be tamed by even the most capable of trainers.

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:45.449
King Phillip was disappointed, but ordered for the horse to be sent away.

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:49.429
It was too wild, it could never be controlled.

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:57.949
But the young Alexander said “wait”, and insisted that he be given the chance to tame the beast.

00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:01.919
He had seen what nobody else had seen.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:08.559
The horse was not wild or untamable; it was afraid of its own shadow.

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:14.229
Alexander approached the horse, whispered into its ears to calm it

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:19.229
down, and turned it towards the sun, so that it couldn’t see its shadow.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:25.449
He then jumped onto the back of the horse and rode away to rounds of applause.

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:32.059
Now, this tale might be apocryphal, made up or exaggerated for

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:36.909
effect, but it gives you an idea of the legend of Alexander The Great.

00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:45.949
So, we are in 336 BC, King Phillip has just been assassinated, and his eldest son, the

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:51.979
20-year-old Alexander has just taken over as the King of Macedon, or King of Macedonia.

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:59.389
After eliminating potential rivals to his power, Alexander wasted no time in taking up

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:05.029
where his father had left off, in terms of preparing to head east and invade Persia.

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:08.939
Now, why Persia, you might be asking yourself?

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:13.359
The Persians had invaded Greece a hundred years before,

00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:17.929
and there was a desire to get even, to avenge this attack.

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:23.649
There was also the simple fact that the Persian empire was the richest in the

00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:29.389
world, and even though Greece was not exactly cash-strapped, literally all

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:34.319
the riches of Persia awaited anyone who was able to topple the Persian ruler.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.619
And then there is the factor that is perhaps harder to verify, that

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:45.659
Alexander had some deep-rooted desire for personal glory and conquest.

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:51.979
Clearly, there was some element of this, otherwise he wouldn’t have gone on a more than

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:58.489
decade-long military campaign, but historians are divided over the extent to which this was some

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:05.519
grand masterplan from the outset or whether it was more a case of “I’ve started, so I’ll go on”.

00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:12.539
In any case, he started, and he did go on, for 13 years, to be precise.

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:21.489
The Persian ruler at this time was Darius III, an impressive ruler who commanded a huge army.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:28.691
The two armies first met at the Battle of Issus, in November of 333 BC.

00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:32.671
The Persian forces greatly outnumbered The Macedonians.

00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:40.401
Some ancient sources have the Persian army numbering as many as 600,000 to Alexander’s

00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:47.461
just under 40,000, although most modern estimates have the Persian forces at 60,000 or so.

00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:54.071
In any case, the odds were not in Alexander’s favour from a headcount perspective.

00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:58.431
But Alexander had several other advantages.

00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.471
Firstly, he had inherited his father’s excellently trained army.

00:10:04.001 --> 00:10:10.491
The Macedonians were fierce warriors, skilled and practised in the business of warfare.

00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:15.921
They also had highly sophisticated weapons: the army included foot

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:21.741
soldiers with huge spears 6 metres long, who formed large impenetrable

00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:25.491
squares, because of these long sharp spears that pointed out.

00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:33.371
If you imagine a sort of square porcupine with deadly sharp metal spikes, that gives you some idea.

00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:39.951
There were also heavily armoured cavalry, soldiers on horses, who could charge at an enemy and

00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:46.471
inflict serious damage, as well as skilled archers, people firing arrows high into the sky.

00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:54.041
Alexander had been given leadership roles in battles while his father was still alive, so he

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:58.971
had learned the most effective strategies and techniques of using these different types of

00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:04.581
soldiers and weapons against his enemies, and how to best position them on the battlefield.

00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:12.921
What’s more his soldiers were incredibly well drilled and disciplined, they were professionals.

00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:17.891
And Alexander knew the importance of keeping morale high,

00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:22.081
of making his soldiers believe in him and in themselves.

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:29.131
He did this through rousing speeches, but perhaps the most obvious and important

00:11:29.141 --> 00:11:34.111
way in which he achieved this was through fighting on the frontlines himself.

00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:39.621
He was not the sort of person to stand on his horse on a high piece of ground far

00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:45.341
away from the action; he was there fighting side by side with his men, slaying

00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:50.881
Persians left right and centre and coming inches from death on multiple occasions.

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:58.131
And at Issus, the first major battle against the full might of the Persian

00:11:58.131 --> 00:12:03.501
army, this all came together and the Macedonians emerged victorious.

00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:10.422
Darius was not killed nor was his army crushed, but enough of a defeat was

00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:15.532
inflicted that he tried to strike a bargain with Alexander, a peace deal.

00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:22.112
He would give Alexander half of the Persian empire in exchange for peace.

00:12:24.002 --> 00:12:30.322
This was only two years into Alexander's campaign, and to think, he had already achieved an

00:12:30.322 --> 00:12:36.322
offer of receiving half of the richest and most powerful empire in the world at that time.

00:12:37.522 --> 00:12:42.112
His generals urged him to accept it, but Alexander would not listen.

00:12:42.702 --> 00:12:47.562
He rejected the offer, effectively declaring to the Persian king that he would

00:12:47.562 --> 00:12:52.622
stop at nothing; he would pursue him to take the entirety of his kingdom.

00:12:53.882 --> 00:12:56.982
It would take a couple of years, but after conquering

00:12:57.032 --> 00:13:00.612
Egypt, Alexander turned his attention back eastwards.

00:13:01.592 --> 00:13:07.482
On October 1st, 331 BC, his forces met those of the

00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:11.722
Persian Empire at Gaugamela, in modern-day northern Iraq.

00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:17.782
After the defeat a couple of years prior, Darius III had wasted

00:13:17.782 --> 00:13:21.952
no time in building up his army in preparation for the inevitable.

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:29.932
His forces were formidable, war elephants, chariots with scythes, sharp

00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:35.352
knives, coming out of their wheels, an estimated 10,000 highly-skilled Greek

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:41.532
mercenaries and a similar number of Persian “immortals”, elite foot soldiers.

00:13:42.832 --> 00:13:48.102
All in all, the Persian army is thought to have numbered around 100,000,

00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:52.172
although some ancient sources have put it as high as one million.

00:13:53.112 --> 00:13:57.642
Alexander’s forces, on the other hand, were a mere 47,000.

00:13:59.222 --> 00:14:03.352
They had been fighting almost non-stop for 5 years by this point.

00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:08.842
This would surely have made them tired, fatigued by five years of war.

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:14.852
But it also made them incredibly well-drilled, effective, and acutely

00:14:14.852 --> 00:14:19.372
aware that if they were defeated, death or slavery awaited them.

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:27.332
Against all the odds, they proved victorious, crushing the Persian army and forcing Darius to flee.

00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:33.802
This time he did not escape, and was killed by one of his own governors.

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:40.362
Alexander was not best pleased that his rival had been murdered, because this was

00:14:40.362 --> 00:14:45.552
an unfair and dishonourable end for someone who was, at the end of the day, a great

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:52.382
king, but this did mean that Alexander was now de facto ruler of the whole of Persia.

00:14:53.902 --> 00:14:57.842
He was only 25 years old at the time, and he had become

00:14:57.852 --> 00:15:01.192
without question the most powerful man in the world.

00:15:02.232 --> 00:15:06.482
Still, he continued eastwards, marching through large parts of modern

00:15:06.482 --> 00:15:12.242
day Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and even ending up in India.

00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:17.592
And as all this was going on, he was still in charge of his kingdom

00:15:17.832 --> 00:15:21.502
back in Macedonia, as well as maintaining law and order in the

00:15:21.502 --> 00:15:25.402
regions that he had conquered, and were therefore under his control.

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:32.802
To state the obvious, he was juggling a lot of balls; military conquests, governing

00:15:32.862 --> 00:15:37.922
acquired lands, keeping peace back at home, diplomacy with allies and enemies.

00:15:39.492 --> 00:15:44.302
By all accounts, and given that there was never a major rebellion against

00:15:44.302 --> 00:15:48.247
him during the thirteen years of the campaign, he was rather good at

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:52.662
it, but this is not to say that everyone was happy with his leadership.

00:15:53.682 --> 00:15:59.222
As the years went by, and after he conquered Persia, he became increasingly Persian

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:05.062
in his habits, and was criticised for abandoning the customs of his Greek homeland.

00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:11.232
He took three wives, which was unusual for Greeks, who were normally monogamous.

00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:17.352
And all three of his wives were not just not Greek; they were Persian.

00:16:18.752 --> 00:16:24.202
He also adopted the Persian custom of forcing his subjects to lie prostrate on

00:16:24.202 --> 00:16:29.992
the ground, bowing down before him, which was a decidedly un-Greek thing to do.

00:16:30.912 --> 00:16:37.542
Greece was a democracy at the time, without a monarch or emperor, so a Greek ruler forcing

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:42.952
people to bow down before him was a sign to some that he had forgotten where he came from.

00:16:44.322 --> 00:16:48.452
Historians do write about people being unhappy with some of these

00:16:48.462 --> 00:16:52.732
tendencies, but not sufficiently to do anything drastic about it.

00:16:54.242 --> 00:16:59.712
There is one account of one of Alexander’s senior officers, a man called Cleitus the

00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:04.682
Black, who had been fighting by Alexander’s side right from the start and was close to him.

00:17:06.022 --> 00:17:13.052
Alexander and his officers were having a boozy celebration, and after many glasses of wine, Cleitus

00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:19.462
told Alexander that he thought he was becoming too Persian, and that he should remember his roots.

00:17:20.562 --> 00:17:25.932
Alexander didn’t say “you know what Cleitus, you’re probably right, thanks for the advice, old pal”.

00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:32.362
He picked up a spear and threw it at him, killing his old friend instantly.

00:17:33.502 --> 00:17:38.682
Eventually, in 326 BC, after reaching the Beas river in

00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:42.222
modern day Punjab, in India, Alexander did turn back.

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:48.622
His kingdom had got too large, too wieldy, and he was aware that pushing

00:17:48.652 --> 00:17:52.692
any further east would take him further away from the centre of power,

00:17:53.082 --> 00:17:57.402
and potentially cause him problems with his increasingly homesick troops.

00:17:58.262 --> 00:18:01.942
His route back to Greece though was not direct, far from it.

00:18:02.562 --> 00:18:05.712
He took the opportunity to consolidate various parts of his

00:18:05.712 --> 00:18:09.912
territory, and was seemingly in no rush to return to Europe.

00:18:11.262 --> 00:18:17.992
He stopped off in Babylon, and then, in June of 323 BC, the unthinkable happened.

00:18:18.872 --> 00:18:21.872
He died, as you heard at the start of the episode.

00:18:23.442 --> 00:18:27.452
As to the cause of his death, there are multiple different views.

00:18:28.432 --> 00:18:33.082
Some say it was malaria, others it was typhoid or pneumonia.

00:18:33.852 --> 00:18:37.452
Others suggest that he was poisoned by an unhappy rival.

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:43.242
Other people have suggested that he was simply weak, injured

00:18:43.452 --> 00:18:47.242
and exhausted from his more than decade long military campaign.

00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:54.422
He may only have been 32 years old, but he had been seriously injured multiple times.

00:18:55.142 --> 00:18:59.762
His lung had been punctured by an arrow, he had a serious neck and head

00:18:59.782 --> 00:19:05.042
injury after being hit by a stone fired from a crossbow, remember, he was

00:19:05.042 --> 00:19:10.702
fighting on the frontlines in serious battles almost non-stop for 13 years.

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:17.642
What’s more, he was a big drinker, most probably an alcoholic by modern standards.

00:19:18.832 --> 00:19:21.962
In many ways, he was very lucky to have survived this

00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:26.682
long, and despite his young age, his body just gave up.

00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:31.092
But what certainly did survive is his legacy.

00:19:32.152 --> 00:19:37.862
One of his wives was pregnant when he died, but he left no surviving living heirs.

00:19:38.902 --> 00:19:45.872
And according to one popular legend, as he lay dying he was asked to whom he would leave his empire.

00:19:46.732 --> 00:19:50.892
He responded “to the strongest”, implying that he expected

00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:54.322
some kind of power struggle to ensue after his death.

00:19:55.602 --> 00:19:57.132
And, he was right.

00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:02.622
After his death his kingdoms were fought over and divided by his generals,

00:20:02.722 --> 00:20:07.492
but none would come anywhere near achieving the success that Alexander had.

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:14.032
He had spread Greek culture and the Greek language across Asia, and for a short

00:20:14.052 --> 00:20:20.072
while, united tens of millions of people from Athens to Samarkand under one ruler.

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:27.012
It is most definitely not without justification that he has come to be called “Alexander The Great”

00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:32.352
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Alexander The Great.

00:20:32.742 --> 00:20:37.322
I’m sure that you knew a bit about his life before this, but I hope that the past 20 minutes

00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:42.942
or so have shed a bit more light onto this fascinating character and his 4th century exploits.

00:20:43.712 --> 00:20:48.072
Of course, it goes without saying that there is a huge amount of his life that we didn’t have

00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:54.152
the chance to cover today, from siege battles to mass weddings to speculation over his sexuality.

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:57.292
It is a bit of a rabbit hole, but one that I would certainly

00:20:57.292 --> 00:21:00.472
encourage you to go down, as it is absolutely fascinating.

00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.742
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:11.062

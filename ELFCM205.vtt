Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:16.566
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:20.979
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.979
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part 3 of our three part series on Brexit.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.899
In Part One we looked at the history of relations between Britain

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:38.569
and Europe, from the Romans invading in 55BC right up to the UK’s

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.579
decision to break with the European Union, over 2,000 years later.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.069
Then in Part Two we looked at the vote itself, why the UK took the

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.949
decision to hold a referendum in the first place, how the campaigns

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.839
were fought, who voted for and against Brexit, and for what reasons.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.559
And in today’s episode, Part Three and the final part of this mini-series, we are going to look at

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:13.669
what has happened since June the 23rd 2016, the day that the UK voted to leave the European Union.

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:19.349
We’ll tell the story of what happened immediately after the vote, the kind of Brexit

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:24.669
that actually happened, how it was different from expectations and how it was the

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:30.079
same, and have a think about what the long term consequences of Brexit might be.

00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:34.257
There is a lot to cover, so let’s get started.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:39.957
The vote to leave the European Union was a shock to the British establishment.

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:47.657
Very few people in positions of power expected the British population to have voted this way.

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:52.647
Indeed, it was the first time in British history that a referendum

00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:56.337
had ever gone against the preferences of the government.

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.877
In other words, the government only ever really offered

00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:05.077
a referendum when it was fairly sure it would go its way.

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:11.567
As a result, there hadn’t been great thought or preparations on either side, in the

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:18.307
Leave or Remain camps, for what would need to be done if the UK did vote for Brexit.

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:23.737
There was no playbook for leaving the European Union; no country had ever done

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:28.867
it before, and very few people in the UK thought it would actually happen.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:33.467
So the question was, the United Kingdom had voted

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:37.277
to leave the EU, but how would it actually do this?

00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:39.777
What kind of Brexit would there be?

00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:44.407
The media and politicians soon started using the terms

00:02:44.677 --> 00:02:49.027
“hard” and “soft” Brexit to describe the two options.

00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:53.477
A hard Brexit would be a clean break, cutting the

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:57.387
country off from the European Union quickly and sharply.

00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:01.637
It might be painful in the short term, but the British

00:03:01.637 --> 00:03:04.997
people had voted to leave, and leave they should do.

00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:10.887
A soft Brexit, on the other hand, would be gradual and gentle.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.947
It would involve keeping many of the aspects of EU

00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:18.637
membership, and still being joined closely to the EU.

00:03:19.627 --> 00:03:26.197
To use the analogy of a relationship breakup, a hard Brexit would be like you slamming

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:31.297
the door on your partner, throwing their clothes out of the window and changing the locks.

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:37.647
A soft Brexit might be more like deciding that you were going to be friends, still meeting

00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:44.057
for coffee and going to the cinema together, but your relationship was now purely platonic.

00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:51.897
Of course, these are the two extremes, and so it was now the job of British politicians

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:57.917
to firstly understand what kind of Brexit the people of Britain actually wanted,

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:04.657
and secondly to try to negotiate this with their soon-to-be-ex colleagues in Europe.

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:11.487
It’s here that we meet our first hurdle though, and you’ll see how Brexit proved

00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:17.577
to be a career-destroying and career-making event for many British politicians.

00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:22.867
The British Prime Minister at the time of the Brexit vote was David Cameron.

00:04:23.647 --> 00:04:28.277
As we heard in the last episode, he was campaigning to Remain and

00:04:28.277 --> 00:04:32.167
he was the one who offered the referendum vote in the first place.

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:36.967
After the people of Britain had voted against his side, he

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:41.177
couldn’t stay, and he resigned a few hours after the result.

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:47.827
A power struggle ensued in the Conservative party, and eventually the

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:53.367
former Home Secretary, a lady called Theresa May was elected Prime Minister.

00:04:54.587 --> 00:05:00.387
In order to try to shore up support for her vision of Brexit, she called

00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:06.167
a general election in 2017, but it proved to be a terrible mistake.

00:05:06.777 --> 00:05:12.477
The Conservatives lost their majority, and had to form a coalition with a party

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:18.807
called the Democratic Unionist Party, the DUP, a party from Northern Ireland.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.107
Theresa May’s leadership was characterised by constant attempts to negotiate both

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:32.257
with the EU and with her own party, but she failed to make any significant progress.

00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:37.677
She couldn’t agree a Brexit deal that would pass the UK parliament.

00:05:38.277 --> 00:05:41.947
Ultimately, like her predecessor David Cameron, Brexit

00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:47.807
was to cost her her head, and she resigned in May of 2019.

00:05:48.737 --> 00:05:54.037
In the meantime, the de facto leader of the pro-Brexit campaign,

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:58.247
Vote Leave, Boris Johnson, had been waiting for his opportunity.

00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:03.457
With his political enemies out of his way, his path was clear,

00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:09.057
and he was voted in as Prime Minister of the UK in July of 2019.

00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:14.237
Like his predecessor Theresa May, he also called a general election

00:06:14.447 --> 00:06:20.217
to shore up the legitimacy to choose the type of Brexit it was to be.

00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:27.227
But unlike Theresa May, he won, and secured the Conservatives a large majority.

00:06:27.927 --> 00:06:36.187
His campaign slogan was to “Get Brexit Done”, and this was a message that resonated strongly with a

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:43.257
nation bored of the back and forth Brexit negotiations that had been taking three and a half years.

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:51.307
So, by Christmas of 2019 Boris Johnson had a clear majority in Parliament, and the

00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:57.497
mandate to negotiate a Brexit on behalf of the British public, to “get Brexit done”.

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:04.057
Now, unless you have a deep interest in British politics, this might not be so interesting to

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:11.217
you, but the reason I’m sharing it is to underline how complicated these negotiations were, and

00:07:11.217 --> 00:07:18.947
how–although the UK had voted for Brexit–how unclear it was what type of Brexit this should be.

00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:26.997
After Johnson’s election victory, the Brexit final negotiations were relatively swift, but they

00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:33.467
went right up to the knife’s edge, with a final agreement only being reached on Christmas Eve

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:42.307
of 2019, and the UK officially left the EU on the 31st of January 2020, with a deal that wasn’t

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:49.527
as soft as the hardline Brexiteers feared, but not as hard as a complete no-deal situation.

00:07:50.677 --> 00:07:56.097
Next up it’s time to talk about the impact of Brexit, and we are going to look

00:07:56.267 --> 00:08:03.097
at six main areas: the economy, immigration, politics & laws, agriculture and

00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:08.327
British farming, foreign policy and finally The Union of the United Kingdom.

00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:11.457
So, to start with, the economy.

00:08:12.087 --> 00:08:18.977
Before Brexit, the predictions from business leaders, economists and politicians were pretty dire.

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:24.877
If the UK voted for Brexit, they said, it would make the country poorer.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:31.227
The Treasury had even put a number on it - £4,200 per year.

00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:37.187
There were fears about food shortages, a collapse in the value of the pound,

00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:42.407
goods and services becoming more expensive and a lot of economic suffering.

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:47.817
The main reason being that the EU was the UK’s largest trading partner.

00:08:48.357 --> 00:08:53.617
Being in the EU means you benefit from the global agreements that the EU has in

00:08:53.617 --> 00:08:59.557
place with non-EU countries and you benefit from easier trade with other EU members.

00:09:00.547 --> 00:09:06.897
Leaving the EU, especially in a hard Brexit scenario where the UK would leave the Customs

00:09:06.907 --> 00:09:13.197
Union would mean giving this up with the hope that the UK would be able to strike more

00:09:13.277 --> 00:09:18.817
advantageous trade deals with countries such as the United States, Australia and Japan.

00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:22.967
In the short term, directly after the vote, the

00:09:22.967 --> 00:09:27.077
economic consequences looked pretty grim, pretty bad.

00:09:27.727 --> 00:09:32.957
The morning after Brexit global stock markets lost $2 trillion of value,

00:09:33.287 --> 00:09:39.057
and the value of the pound against the dollar fell to a 31-year-low.

00:09:40.107 --> 00:09:47.227
Suddenly British holidays abroad weren’t quite so great value, and conversely for Europeans,

00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:52.617
shopping in London became not quite so expensive as it had been a few years before.

00:09:53.577 --> 00:10:00.247
However, within a few weeks the stock market had recovered, the UK hadn’t been plunged into

00:10:00.277 --> 00:10:07.747
a financial crisis, and things weren’t actually as apocalyptic as the fear mongers had said.

00:10:08.737 --> 00:10:13.087
Yes, businesses would have to adapt, trade with Europe wouldn’t

00:10:13.087 --> 00:10:17.497
be as easy as before, but perhaps the country would do just fine.

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:24.047
As the UK approached the withdrawal date, on 31st January 2020,

00:10:24.287 --> 00:10:28.527
there was something that nobody had factored in: a global pandemic.

00:10:29.137 --> 00:10:34.207
And when it comes to any assessment of the impact of Brexit, especially

00:10:34.207 --> 00:10:39.592
the economic impact, it is made a lot harder thanks to the impact of COVID.

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:46.157
As you may have heard about, since the start of 2020 the UK has suffered food

00:10:46.157 --> 00:10:52.897
shortages, fuel shortages, worker shortages, and all round disruption to the economy.

00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:58.657
Politicians have been debating the extent to which Brexit or COVID are

00:10:58.687 --> 00:11:03.637
responsible for this disruption, and there is a distinct lack of agreement.

00:11:04.687 --> 00:11:10.187
Naturally to the proponents of Brexit, to those who supported leaving the EU,

00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:16.157
it is very convenient to blame the UK’s economic problems on COVID, not Brexit.

00:11:16.807 --> 00:11:21.807
And to those looking to score political points against the Brexit-voting

00:11:21.817 --> 00:11:25.467
leadership of the UK, it is very convenient to blame Brexit.

00:11:26.507 --> 00:11:31.157
COVID certainly hasn’t made the situation any easier, but it would be

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:36.707
hard to argue - indeed even the staunchest Brexiteer would struggle to

00:11:36.707 --> 00:11:41.737
claim that Brexit has delivered many tangible economic benefits so far.

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:49.267
Our second category to talk about, which is actually closely related to the first, is immigration.

00:11:50.407 --> 00:11:56.667
One of the main reasons that Brits had voted for Brexit was to control immigration from the EU.

00:11:57.597 --> 00:12:00.627
The Brexit agreement certainly has made it harder for

00:12:00.627 --> 00:12:04.077
people from European countries to come and live in the UK.

00:12:04.687 --> 00:12:09.337
Now, European citizens are treated no differently to citizens from

00:12:09.347 --> 00:12:13.787
any other country, and there is now a points-based immigration system.

00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:20.607
Instead of any EU-citizen being able to come to live in the UK, each applicant

00:12:20.777 --> 00:12:26.157
is assessed individually, based on things like whether they have a job in the UK,

00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:31.617
the salary of that job, the type of job, and even their English language level.

00:12:32.407 --> 00:12:38.517
The idea behind this was to limit the arrival of low-skilled immigrants from the EU,

00:12:38.797 --> 00:12:43.987
and instead allow more space for more skilled immigrants from the rest of the world.

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:50.317
As you might imagine, it has massively reduced the amount of immigration from the EU.

00:12:51.447 --> 00:12:57.557
In 2015, around 630,000 EU citizens came to live in the UK.

00:12:58.217 --> 00:13:06.437
In 2018, even before the points-based system came into place, this number had dropped to 418,000.

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:13.207
Although there are significantly fewer EU immigrants there is a large increase

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:20.207
in non-EU immigrants, and in 2019, the last year for which statistics are readily

00:13:20.207 --> 00:13:25.197
available, there were more immigrants to the UK than at any time in history.

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:32.377
So, for Brexit voters who believed Brexit would simply stop immigration to the

00:13:32.407 --> 00:13:37.567
UK, they may be surprised that there has been no reduction, the immigrants just

00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:42.237
come from different countries, and are generally required to be more skilled.

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:48.567
Although this might sound good in practice, because it leads to a more skilled

00:13:48.567 --> 00:13:55.017
workforce with better paid jobs, Brits have found out that those EU workers who drove

00:13:55.157 --> 00:14:01.137
delivery trucks, worked in agriculture or hospitality and generally did lower-paid

00:14:01.147 --> 00:14:06.597
work that Brits weren’t so keen on doing were actually pretty useful to the country.

00:14:07.317 --> 00:14:11.927
Over the past few months the country has experienced a lack of people

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:16.657
in low-paid work, which has resulted in fuel shortages, so petrol

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:21.447
stations have no petrol, and food shortages in British supermarkets.

00:14:22.297 --> 00:14:28.507
The government is busy assuring the country that this is a teething issue, and is mainly the

00:14:28.507 --> 00:14:35.617
fault of COVID, but at the same time has been offering generous bonuses for EU citizens to

00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:42.307
return to the UK to do things like drive delivery trucks and work in food processing plants.

00:14:43.497 --> 00:14:47.817
Perhaps the government is right, that it will just be a teething issue, and

00:14:47.957 --> 00:14:52.427
leaving the EU will allow a new generation of highly-skilled immigrants to

00:14:52.427 --> 00:14:58.227
come to the UK, but in the short term it certainly seems that restricting EU

00:14:58.267 --> 00:15:02.797
immigration hasn’t delivered any tangible benefits to the people of Britain.

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:08.467
Our third category to explore is relating to politics and laws in Britain.

00:15:09.377 --> 00:15:14.107
As you will remember from episode two, the restoration of sovereignty

00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:19.187
and control over UK laws was a major aspect of the Brexit campaign.

00:15:19.947 --> 00:15:25.607
The Leave campaign had English Nationalism at its heart and played to

00:15:25.607 --> 00:15:30.727
a populist songbook or to populist themes, in particular, immigration.

00:15:31.507 --> 00:15:36.277
The evolution of the ruling Conservative party under the influence of

00:15:36.277 --> 00:15:40.037
the current Prime Minister and leader of the Tories, Boris Johnson,

00:15:40.277 --> 00:15:44.707
has been to strengthen this English nationalist and populist side.

00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:50.367
In the 2019 election, the Conservatives won new electoral seats in the

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:55.177
North of England, seats which had not been won by their party for 50 years

00:15:55.207 --> 00:15:59.827
or more, and had traditionally been a stronghold of the Labour party.

00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:07.057
In these areas people voted Tory for the first time because of the pledge to “Get Brexit Done”,

00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:13.167
and partly because they felt that the party that they had traditionally voted for, the Labour

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:19.457
Party, could not be trusted as being sufficiently patriotic, especially when it came to Brexit.

00:16:20.407 --> 00:16:26.217
The result of all of this on Britain's political life so far has been to lead to

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:32.507
a much more divisive, rougher politics with less respect for rules and promises;

00:16:33.017 --> 00:16:38.467
for example, it has taken a much more aggressive, a more hostile, approach to

00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:44.547
asylum seekers and it looks for opportunities to please its political base.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:49.977
Much like Donald Trump knew he could treat immigrants to the US with a

00:16:50.167 --> 00:16:55.557
certain disdain and it would please his political base, Boris Johnson and his

00:16:55.557 --> 00:17:00.687
Tory government have been increasingly hostile towards migrants to the UK,

00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:05.477
knowing full well that this behaviour resonates with many of their voters.

00:17:06.437 --> 00:17:11.907
Although the strength of the UK’s laws has restrained the Government from some

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:16.747
of its greatest excesses, there are uncomfortable signs that the Government

00:17:16.757 --> 00:17:22.247
is prepared to challenge institutions which have historically been neutral or

00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:28.567
unbiased politically, such as the BBC and cultural institutions, such as museums.

00:17:29.587 --> 00:17:33.517
The fourth area has to do with the countryside and British farming.

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:38.397
This has had very little publicity, but will probably become more

00:17:38.407 --> 00:17:43.187
significant as people become more aware of its gradual impact on the land.

00:17:43.977 --> 00:17:49.937
Leaving the EU means leaving the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, otherwise known as the CAP.

00:17:50.907 --> 00:17:56.137
Many blame that policy for the gradual environmental degradation of Britain's

00:17:56.137 --> 00:18:01.377
countryside, as the CAP’s subsidies encouraged productive agricultural

00:18:01.377 --> 00:18:06.917
production at all costs, with environmental support coming a very poor second.

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:13.167
Now freed of the CAP, there is an opportunity for a more enlightened policy

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:17.977
to shape the British countryside in a way that leads to more sustainable

00:18:17.977 --> 00:18:23.447
farming, better biodiversity and the restoration of endangered local habitats.

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:30.277
I suspect that one reason why there has been so little publicity about this area, is because it is

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:36.867
relatively uncontroversial and also because its effects will be so gradual and difficult to notice.

00:18:37.397 --> 00:18:43.257
However, the changes may make one of the UK's most precious assets, its varied and

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:49.447
attractive countryside yet more so and better appreciated by citizens and tourists alike.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.480
Our penultimate element of exploration today will be Foreign Policy and Britain’s global standing.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.770
The phrase Global Britain was used a lot by the Brexit

00:19:01.803 --> 00:19:05.850
campaigners – without any real explanation of what it meant.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.120
What is it?

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.670
A nostalgic desire to return to the imaginary former glory days of the empire?

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.500
Well, some indication of what is in the current government's mind was illustrated

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.280
recently with the announcement by the USA, Australia and UK of an agreement

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.270
to share technology for nuclear-powered submarines between the three nations.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:36.160
The so-called AUKUS agreement between these three Anglophone countries means that

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:41.680
Australia, which will gain nuclear-powered submarines through it, had to abandon or

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.490
give up its submarine deal with France and to transfer the lucrative work to Britain.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.350
Although President Macron protested in the strongest terms to the countries

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:58.390
involved, especially the USA and Australia, the move was a reminder that

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.960
the UK is not now bound to Europe in the way in which it was before.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.110
The pull of fellow Commonwealth or, in the case of the

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.990
USA, Anglophone countries will be at least as strong.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:17.310
Now, our final element to explore is relating to the United Kingdom itself,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.780
a collection of four unique countries joined together for mutual benefit.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.200
Without a doubt, Brexit has weakened the Union.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:36.287
Scotland voted to remain in the EU by a significant margin– 62% [compared to England’s 48%].

00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:42.040
Brexit is powered by English nationalism and Boris Johnson continues

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.370
to be a highly divisive – some would say toxic – figure for the Scots.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.140
Although Scottish independence was meant to have been settled for a

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.880
generation by the 2014 Independence vote, Brexit has changed the argument.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.350
Scotland has reemerged with the Scottish National Party now

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.360
dominant and calling for a second independence referendum.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.900
The situation in Northern Ireland is yet more dangerous and difficult.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:18.860
In the Brexit campaign, the complexities of Northern Ireland's situation simply were not considered.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:24.000
If you aren’t familiar with these complexities, here’s a brief summary.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.260
The Republic of Ireland, otherwise known as Ireland is in the EU.

00:21:30.072 --> 00:21:34.898
Northern Ireland is part of the UK, and therefore now isn’t in the EU.

00:21:35.508 --> 00:21:41.908
They share a border, and before the Brexit vote there was free movement between the two countries.

00:21:42.578 --> 00:21:47.188
The Northern Irish Protestants are passionately pro the Union with

00:21:47.188 --> 00:21:51.728
Britain, and many Catholics want to be part of the Republic of Ireland.

00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:57.348
There were years of bloody violence between the two parties, and it was very

00:21:57.368 --> 00:22:03.328
important to avoid reinstituting a land border between the two countries.

00:22:04.148 --> 00:22:10.918
There is no hard border between the two, making a de-facto border between the United Kingdom

00:22:11.218 --> 00:22:18.698
and Europe in the Irish Sea, which many Northern Irish Unionists take as a betrayal by Britain.

00:22:19.938 --> 00:22:25.898
To state the obvious, Brexit is a huge complication to the Northern Irish situation,

00:22:26.118 --> 00:22:31.148
and there are genuine fears that this might lead to violence in Northern Ireland,

00:22:31.278 --> 00:22:36.328
and an eventual unification of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

00:22:36.948 --> 00:22:41.508
There are, of course, tens, hundreds, thousands of other implications of

00:22:41.518 --> 00:22:46.148
Brexit, and many important ones we haven’t had the chance to talk about today.

00:22:47.268 --> 00:22:52.568
British people living in Europe, for example, is an important subject that I know a

00:22:52.568 --> 00:22:58.568
lot about, as I am one of the 1.2 million British people living in the European Union.

00:22:59.198 --> 00:23:04.318
And there are the EU citizens living in the UK, like many of my friends, who are

00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:09.498
suddenly questioning their relationship with a country they had come to call home.

00:23:10.278 --> 00:23:16.318
Then there’s the scientific funding, the ERASMUS programme, the impact on British cultural life,

00:23:16.348 --> 00:23:22.195
the impact on English language schools in Europe, because it’s simply far harder for British people

00:23:22.325 --> 00:23:28.685
to come and work in Europe, fishing, sport, driving licenses, air travel, Gibraltar, Brexit is

00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:35.605
something that has affected almost every aspect of British life and many aspects of life in Europe.

00:23:36.545 --> 00:23:39.315
So, what will the long term consequences be?

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:46.305
As Zhou Enlai said, in fact about the Parisian student protests of 1968 instead

00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:52.065
of the French Revolution of 1789, perhaps it is still too early to tell.

00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:58.515
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the aftermath

00:23:58.565 --> 00:24:02.545
of Brexit, and with that comes the end of this mini-series.

00:24:02.985 --> 00:24:06.265
To state the obvious, it is a huge and complicated

00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:10.015
subject, and one we could talk for hours on end about.

00:24:10.385 --> 00:24:15.055
I hope at least that you’ve found this mini-series to be an interesting introduction

00:24:15.325 --> 00:24:20.635
to the past, present, and future of Brexit, and that it has given you a little

00:24:20.655 --> 00:24:25.535
insight into some of the peculiarities of Britain’s relationship with Europe.

00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:31.435
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series.

00:24:31.585 --> 00:24:35.535
The majority of our listeners come from EU countries, and no

00:24:35.535 --> 00:24:39.175
doubt you have an opinion, or perhaps questions about Brexit.

00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:42.725
So, let’s get this Brexit discussion started then.

00:24:42.955 --> 00:24:49.065
The place to go to for that is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:54.595
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:24:55.005 --> 00:24:59.695

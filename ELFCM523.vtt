Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.750
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.240
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.349
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part mini-series.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.500
And for our first mini-series of the year, the first of 2025, the loose theme will be “mystery”.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:43.040
In part one, this episode, we are going to be talking about the shady world of secret societies,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.949
and take a close look at three mysterious societies some people believe hold great power.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.169
Next up, in part two, we will talk about the art of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.129
espionage, and look at the curious history of spying.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.930
And in part three we will finish it off with some stories of amazing lost civilisations,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.269
civilisations that some people believe once existed but of which all traces have now vanished.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.900
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the shady world of secret societies.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.090
An interesting piece of trivia for you is that the record for the longest continuous

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.773
film shoot is held by Stanley Kubrick, for his 1999 mystery thriller, Eyes Wide Shut.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.160
It was a gargantuan effort, a huge piece of work, and Kubrick died of a heart attack just

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.740
six days after showing the final version to Warner Brothers, the studio behind the film.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.290
If you’ve seen this film, you’ll remember that it stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.290
There is a scene in the movie where the character played by Tom Cruise is told about a mysterious

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.380
party at a mansion outside New York City, held by a secret and highly exclusive society.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.120
A special password is required to be allowed in, and everyone

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.120
is required to wear a mask, to disguise their true identity.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.830
Now, many of the characters aren’t wearing much else, and the film continues

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.040
with several scenes too explicit to be described on a family-friendly podcast

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.590
and without an advanced knowledge of vocabulary relating to human anatomy.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.980
But this underlines our obsession with the idea of secret societies.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.060
Behind closed doors, anything could be happening.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.969
Men and women in strange masks, unusual passwords or codes, promises of brotherhood,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.370
and, of course, sworn oaths of secrecy, which only serve to add to the allure.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.650
Naturally, the very nature of a secret society is that, if it really

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.010
is a secret society, the goings-on of the society, its rituals

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.054
and the identities of its members are a closely guarded secret.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.980
Members of the public might have some idea about its existence, some photos might exist

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.700
of members together, but beyond that, little is known about what actually happens.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.960
And such is, or perhaps I should say “such was”, the case with Skull and Bones, a secret

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.775
society at Yale University, one of the top-ranked and most prestigious Ivy League universities.

00:03:53.168 --> 00:04:00.651
Skull and Bones was founded in 1832, during a time of great change in the United States.

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:05.955
The country was still young, having declared independence only 56 years

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:11.755
earlier, and the idea of shaping a national identity was at the forefront.

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:18.135
Elite universities like Yale were hubs for the children of wealthy and influential

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:24.015
families, and they served as training grounds for the next generation of leaders.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.905
Secret societies were becoming a trend in academic institutions,

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:34.535
providing students with a sense of exclusivity and camaraderie.

00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:41.385
Skull and Bones was established as one of these societies, but it quickly

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:46.385
distinguished itself by its intense secrecy and the powerful network it

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:50.976
offered its members, of which there were only 15 new ones every year.

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:57.088
By focusing on rituals and an elite membership, it cemented its

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:01.818
reputation as a group that was as mysterious as it was influential.

00:05:02.858 --> 00:05:08.948
And right from the very early days, it was the subject of intrigue and mystery

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.928
for students at the university, students who were not members, of course.

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:20.528
To quote one book about Yale from 1871, “the mystery now attending its existence

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:26.458
forms the one great enigma which college gossip never tires of discussing."

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:32.538
In other words, nobody knows anything about it, so everyone talks about it.

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:39.548
Now, with time, information has come out about people who were members

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:45.228
of Skull & Bones, and it reads like a who’s-who of America’s elite.

00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:52.338
Rockefellers and Vanderbilts were admitted, as well as three generations of the Bush family.

00:05:53.158 --> 00:05:58.688
Prescott Bush, in the class of 1917, his son George H.W.

00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:03.828
Bush, in the class of 1948, and his son, George W.

00:06:03.828 --> 00:06:06.968
Bush, who was in the class of 1968.

00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:13.408
In fact, the 2004 US Presidential Election was contested

00:06:13.418 --> 00:06:17.838
by two former members of Skull and Bones: George W.

00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:21.208
Bush was one of them, and John Kerry was the other.

00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:29.818
And outside of politics, a list of former members contains powerful and well-known lawyers,

00:06:29.938 --> 00:06:37.868
journalists, financiers, high-powered CEOs, men–and for a long time it was exclusively men–who

00:06:37.868 --> 00:06:44.688
controlled hundreds of billions of dollars, newspapers, political parties or even ran countries.

00:06:45.898 --> 00:06:51.408
This has, as you might imagine, led to a lot of speculation about the

00:06:51.408 --> 00:06:56.258
nature of membership, of what being part of Skull and Bones entails, and

00:06:56.528 --> 00:07:01.618
why such a high proportion of its members go on to positions of importance.

00:07:02.908 --> 00:07:07.428
Are former members of this society all helping each other, ensuring that the

00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:11.718
ties formed as twenty-something-year-old students remain in place for life?

00:07:12.308 --> 00:07:17.848
Or, instead, is it that Skull and Bones selects the most promising students at an

00:07:17.868 --> 00:07:22.658
already highly exclusive university, so these are people who would have gone on

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:26.958
to fame, wealth and power even if they had never been admitted to Skull and Bones?

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:32.888
Of course, it is a secret society, and members are required to swear an oath

00:07:32.888 --> 00:07:37.558
of secrecy; it is impossible to know for sure what membership of Skull & Bones

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:42.048
entails and what is expected of former members after they graduate.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:47.688
But we have some clues about what goes on behind closed doors.

00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:55.808
In April of 2001, the New York Observer reported that it had managed to gain access to

00:07:55.808 --> 00:08:02.128
the initiation ceremony, the event in which 15 new members were welcomed into the society.

00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:07.058
What the newspaper revealed was…plain weird.

00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:14.288
The ceremony involved young men screaming sexual insults at each other, others forced

00:08:14.338 --> 00:08:19.948
to kneel down and kiss a skull, and pretend to cut the throat of another member.

00:08:20.478 --> 00:08:25.688
Death was a recurrent theme, as you might imagine for a society named “Skull & Bones”,

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:31.495
and there was almost as much nudity as in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut.

00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:37.538
It was all very unusual, but was an age-old tradition that brought these

00:08:37.548 --> 00:08:42.478
university students closer together in a bond that united them for life.

00:08:43.948 --> 00:08:49.138
Now, Skull and Bones might be one of the most famous in America, but it

00:08:49.138 --> 00:08:53.298
is neither the oldest nor the best known, outside of the US at least.

00:08:54.508 --> 00:08:59.338
One of the oldest and most famous secret societies is the Knights Templar,

00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:05.938
or the Templars, a Catholic military order founded in Jerusalem in 1119.

00:09:07.578 --> 00:09:11.668
It was first created for religious reasons, to protect

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:14.278
Christian pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:19.428
This was in the aftermath of the First Crusade.

00:09:20.838 --> 00:09:27.148
Christian armies had managed to capture Jerusalem in 1099, and thousands

00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:32.178
of European pilgrims were inspired to make the journey to the Holy Land.

00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:38.338
To state the obvious, this was a difficult and dangerous journey.

00:09:38.938 --> 00:09:43.998
It was long, and the route was filled with bandits and hostile forces.

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.618
This is where the Knights Templar stepped in.

00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:53.578
Their job, their entire reason for existence, was to offer protection

00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:57.618
so that pilgrims could complete their spiritual journey safely.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:02.828
Initially, it was a poor, religious order, with no

00:10:02.838 --> 00:10:06.878
real financial resources and just a handful of knights.

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:12.648
These knights were required to take an oath of poverty, pledging

00:10:12.648 --> 00:10:16.208
to hand over all of their material possessions to the order.

00:10:16.788 --> 00:10:20.358
But, before too long, the order gained the support of

00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:24.228
the Catholic Church, and it was given special privileges.

00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:29.028
These included the ability to collect taxes, build

00:10:29.038 --> 00:10:33.928
fortifications, and operate independently of local authorities.

00:10:34.688 --> 00:10:39.538
It got endorsements from the pope, and wealthy Christian nobles handed

00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:44.118
over their fortunes to the order, to help it continue its holy mission

00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:48.058
of enabling Europeans to make this dangerous pilgrimage safely.

00:10:49.128 --> 00:10:53.628
So, the knights of the Knights Templar played an unusual role.

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:58.808
On the one hand, they lived austere lives, vowing poverty

00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:02.868
and chastity, praying, and following strict religious rules.

00:11:03.688 --> 00:11:06.358
On the other hand, they were highly trained and

00:11:06.368 --> 00:11:09.538
disciplined soldiers who were feared on the battlefield.

00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:15.748
And, today we would also probably call them business pioneers.

00:11:16.768 --> 00:11:22.548
What they ended up developing was an early form of banking and international money transfer.

00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:28.768
Let’s say a Christian pilgrim in France was planning to go to Jerusalem.

00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:35.258
It was a long, dangerous and expensive trip, and carrying all of your

00:11:35.288 --> 00:11:40.728
gold and valuables in a purse, on your person, was a recipe for disaster.

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:49.128
So, instead, this person might go to a Templar in Europe and leave their gold or valuables,

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:55.508
and be provided with a note that goods of equal value could be exchanged for this note

00:11:55.778 --> 00:12:01.238
at certain places along the route, or when the pilgrim eventually arrived in Jerusalem.

00:12:02.618 --> 00:12:06.338
Then, they would have a series of notes that could be redeemed

00:12:06.338 --> 00:12:11.368
for goods or services along the way, just like…modern money.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:17.588
As the order expanded, its role changed from simply protecting pilgrims on the

00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:23.096
journey with their weapons to one of administration, finance and governance.

00:12:24.396 --> 00:12:32.026
And, as you might imagine, with this came serious power, but it would come to be their downfall.

00:12:33.096 --> 00:12:39.336
Now, the going was good for the Knights Templar for 100 years or so, but when

00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:45.606
the Christian Crusaders were finally defeated in 1291 at the Siege of Acre and

00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:50.966
effectively booted out of the Middle East, the tide turned for the Knights.

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:56.596
Their raison d’être, their entire reason for existence, was gone.

00:12:57.796 --> 00:13:01.646
They were forced to flee, first to Cyprus, before having

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:04.736
to escape from the island and return to mainland Europe.

00:13:05.996 --> 00:13:11.606
But the order didn’t just disband; it had tens of thousands of members,

00:13:12.006 --> 00:13:16.306
business interests throughout Europe and the Middle East, and although it

00:13:16.306 --> 00:13:21.996
was not as influential as it had once been, it was still a powerful force.

00:13:23.376 --> 00:13:29.996
In 1306, the leader of the Knights Templar was summoned to France to meet with Pope Clement V.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.266
The meeting was ostensibly to discuss merging The Knights Templar with the Knights

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:42.226
Hospitaller, a slightly older organisation whose objective was to care for injured pilgrims.

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:47.126
Neither leader was keen on the idea of combining forces, but

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:51.776
unbeknownst to them, there was another plan being hatched.

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:56.556
Someone wanted to destroy the Knights Templar altogether.

00:13:57.886 --> 00:14:02.036
The French king, Philip IV, was deeply in debt to the

00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:05.416
Knights, after an expensive war against the English.

00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:09.396
Seizing the Knights Templars’ wealth was a convenient

00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:13.316
way to refill his coffers under the guise of justice.

00:14:14.676 --> 00:14:20.246
He seized on the idea of charging the Knights with some kind of crime that would allow

00:14:20.246 --> 00:14:27.076
him to dismantle the organisation, seize its wealth and free himself of his debts.

00:14:28.316 --> 00:14:33.786
Given his influence, he managed to persuade the Pope to do this on his behalf.

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:39.586
Dozens of knights were rounded up, interrogated and tortured.

00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:43.816
Their crimes, or accused crimes, I should say?

00:14:44.186 --> 00:14:48.546
These were as wide-ranging as spitting on the cross, worshipping

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:52.866
idols, homosexual practices, and financial impropriety.

00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:58.596
Many of the knights admitted to these crimes under extreme torture

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:02.896
and found themselves burned at the stake, executed publicly.

00:15:04.296 --> 00:15:11.656
One who refused to confess was the temple grandmaster, the leader of the order, Jacques de Molay.

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:18.586
According to one eye-witness, as he was being burned alive, with his last

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:23.736
words, he asked God to take revenge on the men who had tormented him.

00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:28.976
Perhaps a perfectly reasonable sentiment if you have been unjustly accused

00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:32.936
of all sorts of crimes and you find yourself being publicly burned to death.

00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:37.751
Anyway, his dying wish seems to have been granted.

00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:45.241
He was executed in March of 1314, and less than a year later, both

00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:50.361
the French king and his puppet pope, Clement V, were also dead.

00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:58.631
Now, the Knights Templar was officially disbanded in 1309, its leaders burned at the stake,

00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:05.061
but there are some people who believe that the order simply retreated into the shadows.

00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:11.311
We know that many former Knights ended up joining similar societies, such as The

00:16:11.311 --> 00:16:15.711
Order of Christ, which is still around today and is headquartered in Portugal.

00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:20.261
But what of the main order, the Knights Templar?

00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:25.951
Well, the problem with a secret society is that, even if there is no firm

00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:31.101
evidence for it existing, this doesn’t stop people from believing it still exists.

00:16:32.021 --> 00:16:37.251
After all, a secret society that everyone knows about isn’t a very good secret society.

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:43.391
And this intrigue over whether it still exists has led to some pretty

00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:47.001
awful crimes being committed in the name of the Knights Templar.

00:16:48.511 --> 00:16:56.741
For example, it was named by the Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in 2011.

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:02.851
He claimed to be part of a reborn cell of the Knights Templar, a group

00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:07.921
fighting against multiculturalism in Europe and continuing what they saw to

00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:11.581
be the work of the Knights Templar protecting Christians against Muslims.

00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:14.291
Pretty vile stuff, indeed.

00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:21.081
Now, let’s turn our attention to our last secret society, another enigmatic

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:25.851
society that has captured the imagination of many: the Freemasons.

00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:31.261
Unlike Skull and Bones or the Knights Templar, Freemasonry

00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:35.451
isn’t confined to a single institution or hidden in history.

00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:41.721
It’s more like a global brotherhood that spans centuries and continents, with members

00:17:41.741 --> 00:17:47.237
that include historical figures like George Washington, Winston Churchill, and Mozart.

00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:54.781
Freemasonry traces its origins back to the 14th century, to medieval stonemasons’

00:17:54.801 --> 00:17:59.871
guilds, organisations of skilled masons who built Europe’s great cathedrals.

00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:07.851
Originally at least, the reason for the secrecy was to protect trade secrets, to ensure

00:18:07.851 --> 00:18:12.331
that not any Tom, Dick or Harry could learn the latest techniques of stonemasonry.

00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:18.641
But starting from this relatively specific function back in the 14th

00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:24.751
century, the Freemasons has evolved into a sprawling organisation that spans

00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:30.001
countries and continents, with an estimated 6 million members worldwide.

00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:34.111
It is, on one level, highly visible.

00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:39.481
There are buildings, called Masonic lodges, that you can see in many towns and

00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:44.311
cities, as they are typically marked by the iconic square and compass symbol.

00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:50.281
You can apply to become a Freemason, Freemasons give interviews about what being

00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:56.091
a Freemason entails, and in many respects, it isn’t a secret society at all.

00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:02.331
For most members, Freemasonry appears to be more about camaraderie,

00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:05.991
self-improvement, and charitable work than anything else.

00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:10.391
But some elements are still kept secret.

00:19:11.531 --> 00:19:14.741
There are different levels to Freemasonry, with members

00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:18.581
needing to learn different codes to progress to the next.

00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:26.191
And, of course, there are symbolic rituals, oaths, and, famously, secret handshakes.

00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:35.671
Again, this mixture of secrecy and transparency has made it a prime target for conspiracy theories.

00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:42.801
Some believe they secretly control governments, financial systems, or even the media, with

00:19:42.801 --> 00:19:48.871
claims of a hidden agenda for world domination—what’s often called the “New World Order.”

00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:55.421
If you spend too much time down internet rabbit holes, you’ll find accusations

00:19:55.431 --> 00:19:59.521
of the Freemasons’ involvement in historical events like the drafting of the U.S.

00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:03.891
Constitution, the French Revolution, and even the moon landing.

00:20:05.331 --> 00:20:10.031
And, much like any conspiracy theory, any denials of involvement,

00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:14.961
or even evidence proving a lack of involvement, is not enough.

00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:20.061
It is merely proof that the secret society is good at covering its

00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:24.337
tracks, or that the person claiming that "nothing of major consequence

00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:28.497
happens at a Freemasons’ Lodge” just wasn’t high enough in the order.

00:20:29.377 --> 00:20:34.517
Of course, Skull & Bones would say that its members do not help each other, of course

00:20:34.737 --> 00:20:39.947
nobody would admit to going to a secret meeting of a group of Knights Templar, of course

00:20:40.157 --> 00:20:45.177
the Freemasons want you to think that they are just a group of friendly old men concerned

00:20:45.187 --> 00:20:50.466
more with raising money for charity or drinking tea than being global puppetmasters.

00:20:51.687 --> 00:20:53.807
Whether these groups are as powerful as some people believe

00:20:58.227 --> 00:20:59.227
or simply ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances,

00:20:59.427 --> 00:21:05.167
One thing is certain: nothing these groups say or do will ever fully extinguish the

00:21:05.177 --> 00:21:11.267
belief in their secrets; for some, the mystery is simply too enticing to let go.

00:21:13.737 --> 00:21:18.297
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Mysterious World of Secret

00:21:18.297 --> 00:21:23.587
Societies, part one of a three-part mini-series on the loose theme of “mystery”.

00:21:24.297 --> 00:21:27.887
Next up, in part two, we will be looking at the unusual

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:31.577
history of espionage, and spying throughout history.

00:21:32.177 --> 00:21:37.127
And in part three we will discuss some mysterious lost civilisations.

00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:42.277
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:42.787 --> 00:21:48.167

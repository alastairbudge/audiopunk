Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:16.152
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:21.232
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:28.442
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Great Game.

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:36.092
It’s the story of a battle for power in Central Asia between Great Britain and Russia,

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:44.332
a story of spies, deception, and a proxy-war fought by young men in the 19th century.

00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:50.412
I read an amazing book about this, probably 10 years ago, and

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:54.162
it has been on my list of episodes to make for quite some time.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.402
So I’m thrilled to be sharing it with you today.

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:06.842
It’s quite a niche topic, but it is a fascinating story, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.312
The Great Game is a tale of high adventure.

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:19.952
Of spymanship, and of what we can call ‘derring-do’, of great courage and bravery.

00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:26.472
It is the story of young adventurers, British and Russian, who

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:31.802
grappled for power and influence in central Asia in the 19th century.

00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:39.342
It’s the sort of thing that sounds almost completely invented, something

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:44.662
you might read about in an adventure novel, but it is actually true.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:49.972
Or at least, most of it is - at the end of the episode we’ll

00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:54.032
talk about some of the debate about how true it actually is.

00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:57.592
So let’s set the scene.

00:01:58.582 --> 00:02:03.122
We are at the start of the 19th century, in the early 1800s.

00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:08.362
The British Empire stretched over almost every corner of the world.

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:14.605
And the jewel in its crown, the most prestigious colony, was India.

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:22.274
Russia, on the other hand, had been building up its own empire, which stretched from the

00:02:22.314 --> 00:02:31.194
Arctic Circle down to the Black Sea, and from the Baltic Sea right across to Alaska, occupying

00:02:31.204 --> 00:02:38.954
large parts of countries we now know as the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan.

00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:44.483
Great Britain is, of course, a long way away from India.

00:02:45.243 --> 00:02:51.153
Russia is a lot closer, and there was this huge fear that Russia was

00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:56.833
making moves towards India, planning to move further and further south,

00:02:57.223 --> 00:03:02.423
in order to launch an attack and seize India, to take it from the British.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.260
Between the southern border of the Russian Empire, and the north-western part of British

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:17.330
India, stood a wide expanse of central Asia governed by various different central Asian rulers.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.460
The area of land we’re talking about here is mainly modern

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.370
day Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:34.341
This area was large enough that the edges of the Russian empire and the British

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:40.051
empire were still thousands of kilometres away from one another, but there was a

00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:45.841
constant threat, and there was the constant fear that the Russians would come south,

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:51.321
and from the Russian side, there was the fear that the British would advance north.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:57.181
So, this led to a series of the most amazing diplomatic

00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:00.861
missions, over the course of almost 70 years.

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:08.005
Because The Great Game isn’t an official term, and it’s not an actual war

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:14.195
in itself, historians disagree over when it actually started and ended,

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:24.185
but most agree that it started in 1830, and ended in either 1895 or 1907.

00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:33.341
The idea, both for Britain and Russia, was to create a series of ‘buffer states’,

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:40.327
countries that were friendly towards either Britain or Russia, between their two empires.

00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:44.360
This was long-term, strategic diplomacy.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.170
The idea was to build allegiances, and not just to march in there with an army.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.890
Well, at least that was the plan.

00:04:54.263 --> 00:05:01.443
In 1830, the governor general of India, Britain’s top man in India, was given the task

00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:08.283
of establishing a trade route between British India and Bukhara, a trade centre in

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:14.533
modern-day Uzbekistan, and the center of the Emirate of Bukhara, a powerful Uzbek state.

00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:20.058
The idea was that this trade route would allow Britain to get a

00:05:20.058 --> 00:05:24.298
foothold in the region and build relations with the local powers.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:31.978
This would be advantageous for Britain because it could trade with the local powers, but

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:39.518
it also had the added bonus that it would mean that having an ally in the region would

00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:45.618
lead to protection in the case of Russia making advances southwards, towards India.

00:05:46.692 --> 00:05:49.152
There were some problems with this approach though.

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:55.722
Firstly, the states that the British wanted to negotiate with weren’t states,

00:05:55.982 --> 00:06:01.132
in the European sense, with demarcated borders and clear rules of law.

00:06:02.232 --> 00:06:06.683
They had fluid borders, and had no intention of adapting

00:06:06.683 --> 00:06:11.902
to this European idea of clear, demarcated borderlines.

00:06:13.152 --> 00:06:19.542
Secondly, the geography of large parts of the region made it very hard to travel through.

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:26.192
Not only was it very mountainous, but it was also deadly

00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:30.202
hot in the summer, and bitterly cold in the winter.

00:06:31.243 --> 00:06:36.511
And linguistically, the differing people of the region spoke different languages.

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:44.071
Very few spoke any English, so any foreigner would need to know the local languages and dialects.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:51.472
And finally, foreigners, especially white Christians, as the British explorers were at

00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:58.124
that time, were often not welcomed with open arms by the majority-Muslim population.

00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:04.554
So, I’ve set the scene, but what actually happened?

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:13.164
Well, over the period of almost 70 years, there was a sort of cold war, as young British and

00:07:13.164 --> 00:07:20.614
Russian spies traveled through the area, often in complete disguise, trying to gather intelligence

00:07:20.654 --> 00:07:27.144
about the geography, the people, and also trying to strike deals with the local leaders.

00:07:28.944 --> 00:07:34.884
It was really the first time that a war was fought in this way, through

00:07:34.884 --> 00:07:40.114
young spies, without any direct conflict between the two opposing sides.

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:47.340
This was quite strange, as historically the way that battles had been fought was

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.836
pretty simple - the different parties would line up opposite each other in a field,

00:07:54.926 --> 00:08:00.246
and fight until enough people on one side were killed and the other one gave up.

00:08:01.446 --> 00:08:07.216
This new strategy of spying, of playing the long game, and of

00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:12.806
individuals adventuring deep into unknown territory was pretty novel.

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:20.326
So it was a fascinating time, and the golden age of the young adventurer.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.110
There are lots of different stories that we could talk about from The

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:31.890
Great Game, but my favourite involves a Scotsman called Alexander Burnes.

00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:39.142
He joined the army when he was just 16 years old, and was sent to

00:08:39.142 --> 00:08:43.492
India to be a soldier in the British East India Company’s Army.

00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:50.192
He had a talent for languages, and learned Urdu and Persian fluently.

00:08:51.277 --> 00:08:54.577
He became very interested in Afghanistan and central

00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:59.437
Asia, and he longed for the chance to explore it properly.

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:02.837
It was the wild west, to the Brits.

00:09:03.457 --> 00:09:08.087
From its geography to its culture, very little was known about it.

00:09:09.557 --> 00:09:16.765
And if Britain was to establish good relations, and a trade route, then they

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:21.565
would need someone to go and explore it, and come back to base with information.

00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:28.785
Burnes was the obvious choice, and in 1831, when he was only 26

00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:34.815
years old, he was sent north, up into the wilderness of Afghanistan.

00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:40.995
He traveled in full disguise, wearing traditional clothing,

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:44.695
and growing his facial hair like the local people.

00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:53.591
He managed to travel all the way from Kabul to Bukhara, almost 1000km, and then back again.

00:09:54.521 --> 00:10:01.225
He returned with a huge amount of intelligence about the local geography, customs and leaders,

00:10:01.555 --> 00:10:09.045
which was incredibly valuable to the British, who prior to this, knew almost nothing about it.

00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:15.673
Armed with this intelligence from Burnes, the British tried to strike trade

00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:21.643
agreements with some of the local leaders, but were rebuffed, they were turned away.

00:10:23.382 --> 00:10:30.472
Six years after his initial trip, Burnes was sent back to Afghanistan to try to

00:10:30.472 --> 00:10:35.669
strike a deal with the Emir, the leader of the country, a man called Dost Mohammed.

00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:43.949
The proposal to Dost Mohammed was that the British would protect him in exchange for his obedience.

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:53.089
However, he was having none of it, Dost Mohammed was not interested, and instead of accepting the

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:59.019
British proposal, he started speaking to the Russians to see what they could offer him instead.

00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:06.560
This was too much for the British, and it startled the leaders back in Delhi.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.820
They got scared.

00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:14.381
So, with diplomacy having failed, or at least not led to the intended

00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:20.461
results, the British opted for the tried and tested method: force.

00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:28.011
They invaded Afghanistan in 1839, removed Dost Mohammed, and

00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:33.997
replaced him with a puppet ruler, a man called Shah Shuja ul-Mulk.

00:11:34.397 --> 00:11:39.987
Now Shah Shuja had previously been the ruler of Afghanistan, but

00:11:40.127 --> 00:11:44.937
had been kicked out of power and had been living in exile in India.

00:11:46.557 --> 00:11:53.327
He was ready to do anything to regain power, including being sympathetic to the British.

00:11:54.564 --> 00:11:59.628
However, he was loathed, he was despised by the Afghan people.

00:12:00.548 --> 00:12:09.298
He sounds like just a horrible man - one of his main hobbies was removing the ears, eyes, nose,

00:12:09.518 --> 00:12:16.848
and testicles of his servants, and he apparently took great pleasure in public executions.

00:12:17.846 --> 00:12:23.102
He was incredibly unpopular, and the British, despite thinking that they could

00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:28.682
just put him on the throne and be done with it, then realised that they had to

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:34.322
keep a large number of soldiers in the capital, Kabul, just to stop an uprising.

00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:42.308
Burnes, our young officer, was stationed in Kabul to try to keep an eye on things and report back.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.587
But the British presence in Kabul was not well

00:12:46.587 --> 00:12:52.017
received by the local population, as you might imagine.

00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:57.017
Not only was it a military occupation, but it looked like the British

00:12:52.017 --> 00:13:11.153
were there for good - like they would be there for the long run.

00:13:01.153 --> 00:13:11.968
Senior officials took houses, and Kabul became the playground for young British officers.

00:13:11.968 --> 00:13:15.273
Of particular offence to the local population was the fact that

00:13:15.273 --> 00:13:37.340
many of these officers struck up relationships with the local women.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.512
Pre-marital relations were completely out of the question in Afghan

00:13:27.512 --> 00:13:33.701
culture, and the fact that these foreigners were openly having relationships

00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:38.677
with Afghan women was deeply offensive to the local male population.

00:13:40.503 --> 00:13:45.143
However, against the well-organised and well-equipped British

00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:49.463
troops, there wasn’t a huge amount that the Afghans could do.

00:13:50.923 --> 00:13:53.753
Afghanistan didn’t have a army.

00:13:54.223 --> 00:13:59.943
Instead, the local chiefs would keep some soldiers, and when the king needed an army,

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:05.573
he would enlist the chiefs to round up their soldiers and they would all come together.

00:14:06.953 --> 00:14:11.243
It was nothing like the British army, but at least it was something.

00:14:13.363 --> 00:14:18.413
After three years of British occupation, the Afghans had had enough.

00:14:19.923 --> 00:14:27.023
Angry mobs formed, crowds of angry people, and they marched on the houses of British officers.

00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:31.817
One of the first targets was Alexander Burnes.

00:14:33.387 --> 00:14:37.587
Now, Burnes had shown great skills at diplomacy and

00:14:37.587 --> 00:14:41.907
persuasion, but this skill also proved to be his downfall.

00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:49.097
The same skills of persuasion resulted in numerous local lovers, and it

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:53.477
was an open secret that he had been sleeping with local Afghan women.

00:14:54.725 --> 00:14:59.005
So it’s hardly surprising that he was one of the first targets.

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:05.315
As the mob stormed his compound, he ordered his guards not to fire their

00:15:05.315 --> 00:15:11.865
weapons, instead, trying to negotiate with the mob in Pashto, the local language.

00:15:13.275 --> 00:15:18.175
His diplomatic skills and charm had served him well, and he was

00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:21.865
confident that he would be able to turn the situation around.

00:15:23.145 --> 00:15:26.035
However, this time, it wasn’t to be.

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:30.195
The mob was furious, they were baying for blood.

00:15:31.685 --> 00:15:39.875
When it was clear that the end was in sight, Burnes reportedly tied a blindfold around his eyes

00:15:40.295 --> 00:15:48.135
and walked out to the mob, where he was beaten to death in an instant, and his head chopped off.

00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:54.915
After the death of Burnes, it was evident that it was going to be too

00:15:54.945 --> 00:16:00.245
dangerous for the British to stay in Kabul, and a retreat was planned.

00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:05.195
But it wasn’t just a small squadron of soldiers.

00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:10.475
There were around 16,000 people in this group, a quarter of whom

00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:15.615
were soldiers, but the rest were families, lovers, and servants.

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:22.305
They thought that they could just retreat to Jalalabad, a city 80 miles, or

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:28.135
5 days walk away, where they would be joined and supported by reinforcements.

00:16:29.374 --> 00:16:31.782
Unfortunately for them, it wasn’t to be.

00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:37.231
Almost all of them died, either frozen to death in the Afghan

00:16:37.241 --> 00:16:42.421
winter, or killed by the 30,000 Afghans who caught up with them.

00:16:43.481 --> 00:16:47.441
The lucky ones were taken prisoner and forced to marry

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:51.801
their captors, but even that doesn’t sound that lucky to me.

00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:59.601
Some historians say that the Great Game ended here, with the humiliating

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:04.691
retreat from Kabul, and then the devastation of the British troops afterwards.

00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:11.441
But for another 40 years or so, the British seemed obsessed with this

00:17:11.471 --> 00:17:16.701
idea that Russia was trying to move south, to curry favour with local

00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:21.511
leaders, with the view of ultimately mounting an attack on British India.

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:31.591
This attack on British India never happened, and historians have debated whether there was actually

00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:39.021
any real threat from Russia, about whether the Russians really ever wanted to make a move for India.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:47.651
One theory is that this entire idea was pushed forward by British political factions,

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:55.731
and exacerbated by young Brits, people like Alexander Burnes, who longed for adventure.

00:17:57.671 --> 00:18:04.311
It’s certainly clear that, if there ever was a game, The Russians played it better than the British.

00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:10.331
They didn’t invade directly, they didn’t attack, they just bided their time.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.702
And while the Great Game, in the Britain vs.

00:18:15.152 --> 00:18:20.422
Russia sense might be over, there’s a strong argument that this was only

00:18:20.422 --> 00:18:26.662
just the start, the only difference is that now some new players have joined.

00:18:28.478 --> 00:18:32.548
Afghanistan has remained a country where political games have

00:18:32.548 --> 00:18:37.238
been fought long after Alexander Burnes was killed, and you could

00:18:37.238 --> 00:18:41.858
certainly say that the Great Game is still being played there today.

00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:49.355
And while 150 years ago the original Great Game might have been played in Afghanistan,

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:54.995
these geopolitical games of chess are now being played all over the world.

00:18:55.769 --> 00:19:01.450
From China in Africa, to the United States in Latin America, countries

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:07.390
have realised that power isn’t won or lost overnight, and that they

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:13.020
have to play the long game, the great game even, in order to succeed.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.730
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.590
I have glossed over quite a lot of the details, and only picked a few

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.310
highlights, but I hope it has whetted your appetite to find out more.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.595
If you are feeling particularly curious, the book I mentioned at the start is called The

00:19:34.595 --> 00:19:40.465
Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia, and it’s by a man called Peter Hopkirk.

00:19:41.275 --> 00:19:45.705
It is 500 pages long, and not the easiest read if

00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:49.065
you are not a native speaker, but it is fascinating.

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:53.507
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

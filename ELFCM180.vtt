Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:16.124
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:20.464
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:27.344
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the English of Winston Churchill..

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:32.794
This is actually our second episode on Churchill, the first one, one of our

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:38.034
member-only ones, came out on Tuesday, and was about his epic life, from

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:43.244
his near-death experiences to his enormous consumption of champagne, and of

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:47.614
course, his political life and some of the controversy that now surrounds him.

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:51.884
Today though, we are going to talk about the language he

00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:56.664
used, and about his skill as an orator, as a public speaker.

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:03.014
And skillful he was - he is often called the greatest public speaker in British history,

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:09.234
and his words galvanised the nation in some of the darkest days of World War II.

00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:14.524
Before we get right into today’s episode though, I want to remind you that you

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:55.964
So, if that is of interest - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:59.884
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:07.984
OK then, let’s get started, and talk about Winston Churchill and the English language.

00:02:09.374 --> 00:02:13.704
Few people in human history have changed the course of history.

00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:19.454
Even fewer have changed it largely through their use of language.

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:24.364
Many people would say that Winston Churchill changed human

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:29.234
history, and the main way he did it was through his use of English.

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:34.254
He was someone who used the English language supremely well.

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:41.224
Few would argue that his use of language, especially in his radio broadcasts to the British

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:48.504
people in the darkest days of the Second World War in 1940 and 1941, was the major factor

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:55.114
in raising the country‘s morale and therefore people‘s determination to resist Nazi Germany.

00:02:55.974 --> 00:03:02.394
When in 1953 Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the award

00:03:02.524 --> 00:03:07.594
was made for his writing of history books but also, said the quote accompanying

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:13.124
the award, for his “brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values”.

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:20.004
These Nobel words capture an essential quality in the man’s language: in defending

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:24.954
Britain against fascism, the battle was not only to defend Britain against being

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:31.944
enslaved but also to defend the values that Churchill saw as vital to human progress

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:38.374
and dignity – democracy, human rights, freedom of speech, liberty and justice.

00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:44.724
This episode, which is a companion to the previous one on his life, will explore

00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:50.164
four different areas of of Churchill's genius as a master of the English language:

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:54.424
Firstly, how he developed his gifts with language;

00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:59.574
Secondly, how much he actually produced, both in writing and speaking;

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:04.684
Thirdly, the immediate background to his great speeches, including

00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:08.524
the medium of the radio, as well as how he wrote his speeches;

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:13.136
and finally those famous speeches themselves, focusing

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:16.826
in particular on three of the most significant ones.

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:21.736
And of course, there will be plenty of opportunity to hear Churchill

00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:25.756
speak for himself, we will listen to some clips of the speeches.

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:33.056
Ok then, it is fair to say that Churchill might not have been destined to be a great orator, a

00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:40.286
great speaker, and he developed his gifts as a speaker and writer in spite of some early obstacles.

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:47.396
Firstly, in his early youth he had both a stammer, when you repeat words and struggle to

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:54.746
pronounce certain words, and a lisp, when you can’t pronounce certain syllables, like sh or th.

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:59.416
In other words his speech was far from fluent and he could not

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:04.616
produce certain words, especially ones that began with the “sh” sound.

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:11.036
Secondly, although he excelled in certain areas of school life and went

00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:14.953
to one of the best private schools in the country, called Harrow, he

00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:19.443
did not do well at school - he was not a natural scholar or academic.

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:27.002
And finally, his father was dismissive and far from encouraging of young Winston’s efforts.

00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:33.402
However, on a more positive note, he loved English and History while at school, and was

00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:38.642
particularly fond of memorising large chunks of literature, particularly Shakespeare.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:46.202
Above all, he had such strong belief in himself and personal ambition that, especially

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:51.582
after he left school and went into the army, he was determined to complete his education.

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:54.712
What about university, you might ask?

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:56.262
Well, he didn’t go.

00:05:56.822 --> 00:06:03.072
It was actually perfectly normal for a young man of his class and ambition not to go to

00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:09.562
university at this time, but he was well aware that many of his future competitors in politics

00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:14.872
would have gone to Oxford or Cambridge, and have received a classical further education.

00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:21.772
So, even when he was serving as a soldier in India, he set out methodically to educate

00:06:21.772 --> 00:06:27.160
himself through demanding and extensive reading of the great English authors and politicians.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.248
This meant that, despite having a relatively short formal education, he

00:06:33.248 --> 00:06:38.992
read much more than many young men who went to university and saw their

00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:42.822
time at university as mainly fun - a kind of upper-class playground.

00:06:43.582 --> 00:06:49.032
He studied the great political speakers – Oliver Cromwell [the leader of the so-called

00:06:49.082 --> 00:06:56.067
Parliamentarians who fought and won against King Charles I in the mid 1600s], Benjamin Disraeli

00:06:56.402 --> 00:07:02.842
[one of the great prime ministers of The Victorian era] and Churchill‘s father, Randolph, who had

00:07:02.842 --> 00:07:09.552
himself been a famous politician until his unfortunate early death from syphilis at the age of 46.

00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:16.492
He would study parliamentary debates, and practice responding to questions in his own words.

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:23.333
In addition to all this systematic self-education, Churchill had an action-packed

00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:29.113
training as a journalist when, from the 1890s onwards he was both a soldier

00:07:29.393 --> 00:07:34.023
and a journalist in military campaigns in India, Sudan and South Africa.

00:07:34.823 --> 00:07:38.813
Finally, we need to remember that by the time that he became prime

00:07:38.813 --> 00:07:45.103
minister in May 1940, aged 65, he had spent four decades as a member

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:49.343
of Parliament, making speeches and taking part in parliamentary debate.

00:07:49.843 --> 00:07:54.063
And if you spend forty years debating in parliament, you get pretty good at it.

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.763
But it wasn’t just practice.

00:07:57.033 --> 00:08:03.103
Churchill had a true gift for storytelling: you can almost feel his energy and the

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:08.383
thrill of adventure in his early writing - it is so full of colour and passion.

00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:14.333
By the age of just 24 he was a highly successful, best-selling

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:17.713
author, earning very large sums of money for his writing.

00:08:18.673 --> 00:08:25.553
So, that is the background to Churchill as a writer and orator - an incredibly talented but also

00:08:25.753 --> 00:08:32.213
dedicated and practiced student of rhetoric and how to use language to get your point across.

00:08:33.093 --> 00:08:35.903
Now, on to the medium of his message.

00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:40.763
Great communicators need the right medium or means of communication.

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:47.013
Churchill’s early political career coincided with an important bit of new technology

00:08:47.383 --> 00:08:53.063
- the radio, which had been invented by the Italian Guglielmo Marconi in 1895.

00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:59.663
Radio was the first of the so-called mass media - a revolutionary means of

00:08:59.663 --> 00:09:04.973
communicating which allowed governments to get their messages into millions of homes.

00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:10.123
It is estimated that more than half of the adult population of

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:15.163
Britain listened to Churchill‘s radio broadcasts on the BBC from 1940.

00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:23.473
I have a particular personal insight into this, as my Scottish grandfather, aged 19 at the time

00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:29.603
when Churchill was making his early wartime broadcasts, listened to them and kept a detailed diary.

00:09:30.373 --> 00:09:36.433
In his diary he records each day all the news coming from the BBC on the radio from the developing

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:43.153
crisis in Europe – in particular the fall of Belgium, the Netherlands and then France in June 1940.

00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:48.303
He and his younger brother, sitting in their parents’ farmhouse in the far

00:09:48.303 --> 00:09:52.943
North of Scotland, were listening avidly to every word that Churchill said.

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:59.653
“Rather a good speech by Churchill tonight”, was my grandfather’s comment on the night of 4

00:09:59.653 --> 00:10:05.623
June 1940, after what later went down in history as one of Churchill’s most famous speeches.

00:10:06.593 --> 00:10:12.063
The final point I want to make before talking about the immediate background or context to

00:10:12.553 --> 00:10:18.927
Churchill's wartime speeches focuses on the ways in which he composed or constructed his speeches.

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:23.787
You may think I am stating the obvious when I say that

00:10:23.787 --> 00:10:26.697
he wrote them himself, but it is worth clarifying.

00:10:27.447 --> 00:10:32.087
For many years now, most politicians have not written their own speeches.

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:37.387
There are teams of professional speechwriters and consultants who do most of the work for them.

00:10:38.457 --> 00:10:43.697
Not only did Churchill write his own speeches, but he took hours preparing them.

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:49.427
In terms of how long they would take to write, he had a simple equation, or

00:10:49.427 --> 00:10:55.757
calculation: it would typically take him an hour to produce one minute of a speech.

00:10:56.827 --> 00:11:00.397
And he wasn’t a traditional politician, who would sit down

00:11:00.397 --> 00:11:03.697
at his desk with a pen and paper and write his speech.

00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:10.057
He would normally dictate his speeches, he would say them out loud to his aides and secretaries,

00:11:10.477 --> 00:11:16.737
and would write at all times of day, from a wide array of different places - walking up

00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:22.697
and down the room in only his dressing gown, lying on his bed, and often from the bath.

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:26.237
And always while puffing on a large cigar.

00:11:27.117 --> 00:11:31.697
An essential part of The Churchill‘s technique was that, as well as his speaking his

00:11:31.697 --> 00:11:37.397
words aloud as he composed, he would ask his secretaries to speak them back to him.

00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:43.037
He revised his words constantly and then, when they were finally typed up

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:48.207
into the copy he would use to deliver his speech, he arranged his words so

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:53.117
that it was clear how long the pauses should be between the different words.

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:59.187
At the start I said that, although this episode does not deal with the full range of his writing,

00:11:59.507 --> 00:12:05.587
I would say a little bit about his overall literary output, about how much he actually produced.

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:09.687
Well, in short his output was quite extraordinary.

00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:16.407
His lifetime output amounted to 40 books in 60 volumes and that is

00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:19.847
not to mention the hundreds of newspaper articles he also wrote.

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:24.417
One estimate has him writing more words in his lifetime

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:28.237
than Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare did combined.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:33.677
And when most people are asked what Winston Churchill did, the word

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:38.107
“author” or “writer” probably wouldn't be the first to come to mind.

00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:41.937
Now, we really are about to hear some of those magical

00:12:41.937 --> 00:12:46.187
speeches, but let me just first set the background to them.

00:12:47.497 --> 00:12:52.237
1940-41 was an extraordinary time in world history.

00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:59.277
Reading my grandfather‘s diary, it is clear how, even to a 19-year-old, fresh out of school,

00:12:59.537 --> 00:13:06.047
he had a sense of history unfolding - and of the most terrible, imminent and worrying danger.

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:11.627
The policies of the Western democracies had failed dramatically:

00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:15.787
disarmament and appeasement had proved to be disastrous.

00:13:16.637 --> 00:13:23.527
The cynical and brutal tactics of Adolf Hitler in particular appeared to be effortlessly successful.

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:30.957
Churchill, having opposed disarmament and appeasement and spoken out strongly in favour of the

00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:36.567
need for Britain to build up its air force in particular, had good support within Parliament.

00:13:37.357 --> 00:13:40.567
All that had seemed constant and certain was collapsing.

00:13:41.057 --> 00:13:45.667
This was especially so when the nations of Western Europe fell over

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:50.667
like a pack of cards, one after another – Belgium, The Netherlands and

00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:56.117
finally, Britain‘s most significant ally since early in the 1900s, France.

00:13:56.827 --> 00:14:01.637
Russia, or the USSR as it became known under authoritarian communist

00:14:01.637 --> 00:14:06.697
rule, had chosen to make a secret alliance with Hitler, partly in order to

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:11.137
increase its own territory through seizing a large proportion of Poland.

00:14:12.057 --> 00:14:19.081
The USA still remained on the sidelines, neutral, and would not enter the war until December 1941.

00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:24.567
The threat of German invasion of Britain was very real and urgent.

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.337
So, let’s let Churchill speak for himself.

00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:34.597
The recordings are, of course, from a long time ago, and the quality is reflective of that.

00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:40.147
So if you don’t understand everything, don’t worry, I'll repeat the most important parts.

00:14:40.717 --> 00:14:43.147
And if you are following this with the transcript

00:14:43.177 --> 00:14:45.817
already, good, that will make your life a lot easier.

00:14:46.827 --> 00:14:51.557
Here are three things that I ask you to observe as you listen to the speeches:

00:14:52.077 --> 00:14:57.857
the choice of words; the use of images – metaphors and similes; and the

00:14:57.857 --> 00:15:03.387
use of rhythm created by repeated words, especially in groups of three.

00:15:04.227 --> 00:15:10.497
The first speech was made to Parliament on 13 May 1940 as Churchill formed

00:15:10.527 --> 00:15:15.207
the new administration that would become what he called the Grand Coalition,

00:15:15.777 --> 00:15:20.577
in other words the government that would lead the country until July 1945.

00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:28.017
He begins by repeating what he said to the new members of his administration earlier in the day:

00:15:29.397 --> 00:15:38.172
“I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.“

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:43.077
That’s “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears

00:15:43.347 --> 00:15:47.587
and sweat.“ - toil is another word for hard work.

00:15:48.857 --> 00:15:49.997
Then, he went on:

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:57.616
“We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind.

00:15:57.616 --> 00:16:01.017
We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering.

00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:04.157
You ask, what is our policy?

00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:11.407
I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and

00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:16.527
with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous

00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:22.817
tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.

00:16:23.777 --> 00:16:24.927
That is our policy.”

00:16:27.007 --> 00:16:30.757
So, I’ll just repeat this again and explain it so you don’t miss anything.

00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:35.552
“We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind.

00:16:35.677 --> 00:16:40.637
An ordeal is a long and unpleasant experience, and grievous means very bad.

00:16:41.037 --> 00:16:45.907
We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering.

00:16:46.417 --> 00:16:48.297
You ask, what is our policy?

00:16:49.047 --> 00:16:54.467
I will say: It is to wage war, [to go to war] by sea, land and air, with all our

00:16:54.467 --> 00:17:00.537
might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:06.647
tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.

00:17:07.347 --> 00:17:08.927
That is our policy.”

00:17:09.847 --> 00:17:12.237
Surpassed means outdone, greater than.

00:17:12.507 --> 00:17:17.407
And the lamentable catalogue of human crime isn’t an expression that

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:20.787
you will find anywhere else, but it certainly is a powerful one.

00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:26.807
Churchill knew that the most powerful words in the English language are the oldest

00:17:26.917 --> 00:17:31.917
and the shortest, so it is no surprise that the four qualities that he lists

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:39.677
initially - blood, toil, tears and sweat - are such basic, emotionally powerful ones.

00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:46.757
Note also the way in which he repeats “wage war” and this repetition is

00:17:46.987 --> 00:17:52.367
completed with that contrasting final short sentence, "that is our policy".

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:58.167
Only a few weeks later, on the 4th of June, following the evacuation of

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:02.937
British and French soldiers from Dunkirk, he made another speech to Parliament.

00:18:03.477 --> 00:18:07.727
Parts of this speech were read out later that evening in a BBC broadcast,

00:18:07.857 --> 00:18:11.997
and it was this speech that my grandfather wrote was “rather good”.

00:18:12.887 --> 00:18:15.137
Churchill ended his speech like this:

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:20.297
“The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their

00:18:20.597 --> 00:18:25.797
cause and in their need, will defend to the death, their native soil,

00:18:26.127 --> 00:18:30.067
aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.

00:18:30.627 --> 00:18:31.967
We shall go on to the end.

00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:40.637
We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, We shall fight with growing

00:18:40.657 --> 00:18:48.087
confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

00:18:48.787 --> 00:18:51.275
We shall fight on the beaches.

00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:54.527
We shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in

00:18:54.527 --> 00:18:59.137
the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills.

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:01.207
We shall never surrender.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:08.667
And if which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it

00:19:09.937 --> 00:19:16.807
were subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded

00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:22.737
by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle until in God's good time.

00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:30.917
The new world with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

00:19:32.987 --> 00:19:35.127
Again, I’ll just recap that for you:

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:40.147
“The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their

00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:44.897
cause and in their need, will defend to the death, their native soil,

00:19:45.547 --> 00:19:49.737
aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.

00:19:50.387 --> 00:19:52.167
We shall go on to the end.

00:19:52.547 --> 00:19:58.717
We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, We shall fight with growing

00:19:58.717 --> 00:20:05.026
confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:07.196
We shall fight on the beaches.

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:10.756
We shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the

00:20:10.756 --> 00:20:15.056
fields and in the streets and we shall fight in the Hills.

00:20:16.116 --> 00:20:17.586
We shall never surrender.

00:20:18.506 --> 00:20:24.096
And even if which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it

00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:30.503
were subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by

00:20:30.503 --> 00:20:37.013
the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle until in God's good time, the new world

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:43.363
with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.”

00:20:44.513 --> 00:20:49.883
As in the previous speech, you will have noticed the way in which Churchill captures the

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:55.813
attention and imagination of his listeners through the list of tangible places - using

00:20:55.813 --> 00:21:01.823
words that everyone can relate to - the beaches, fields, streets and hills; these

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:07.213
images make you feel a spirit of patriotism, of defending things that everyone can

00:21:07.213 --> 00:21:12.763
related to; and again, he uses ancient and short words to get his point across.

00:21:13.803 --> 00:21:20.683
When he wants, by contrast, to refer to the Nazi enemy in a dismissive and disrespectful

00:21:20.713 --> 00:21:27.293
manner, he uses words that have been more recently imported into the language - he referred

00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:34.303
to the Nazis earlier on in the speech as such as “odious apparatus” - a hateful machinery.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:39.077
And, once again, repetition is used: the repeated

00:21:39.077 --> 00:21:42.637
phrase “we shall fight…“ builds towards the climax of.

00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:44.387
“… never surrender.“

00:21:45.757 --> 00:21:52.987
These rhetorical techniques help to give the speech its iron determination, conviction and resolve.

00:21:53.637 --> 00:21:58.067
Not only is the fight described in terms of good against evil,

00:21:58.497 --> 00:22:03.192
but there is also a powerful cord of optimism running through it.

00:22:03.657 --> 00:22:08.637
Churchill‘s words leave you in no doubt: he feels in his bones that the

00:22:08.647 --> 00:22:13.477
British people will win, and it is a true battle of good versus evil.

00:22:14.148 --> 00:22:19.438
The final sentiment of this speech, when he refers to the new world liberating

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:24.308
the old, is, as you will no doubt have observed, directed at the USA.

00:22:25.168 --> 00:22:29.128
Churchill knew that the Americans listened very closely to his speeches.

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:35.208
He was also in close, personal communication throughout the war with President F

00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:41.338
D Roosevelt, sending him over 900 personal messages and receiving over 800 back.

00:22:42.358 --> 00:22:49.158
The connection with the USA provides a handy, a useful link to the final speech of the episode.

00:22:49.928 --> 00:22:56.358
This was made on 9 February 1941, before the USA had agreed to something

00:22:56.358 --> 00:23:00.208
called Lend Lease; this meant that the Americans would provide the

00:23:00.218 --> 00:23:03.918
military hardware that the British needed in order to fight the war.

00:23:04.638 --> 00:23:10.468
Churchill's speech is quite clearly aimed at President Roosevelt and the US Congress.

00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:13.418
I will just give you its final few lines.

00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:18.598
Churchill begins by quoting a poem by the American poet, Longfellow,

00:23:18.908 --> 00:23:23.168
which the President has sent to him in a handwritten private message.

00:23:24.198 --> 00:23:29.728
He then asks his audience [in a rhetorical question, so, a question that he will

00:23:29.728 --> 00:23:35.038
respond to] what answer he should give on behalf of the British people to Roosevelt:

00:23:36.518 --> 00:23:46.738
“Here is the answer which I will give to President Roosevelt: Put your confidence in us.

00:23:46.138 --> 00:23:52.498
Give us your faith and your blessing, and, under Providence, all will be well.

00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:57.498
We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire.

00:23:57.498 --> 00:24:01.958
Neither the sudden shock of battle, nor the long-drawn

00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:06.868
trials of vigilance and exertion, will wear us down.

00:24:06.868 --> 00:24:11.538
Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.”

00:24:11.538 --> 00:24:43.955
So, I'll just recap that you: "Here is the answer which I

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:19.276
will give to president Roosevelt: Put your confidence in us.

00:24:19.276 --> 00:24:25.545
Give your faith and your blessing, and, under Providence, all will be well.

00:24:25.545 --> 00:24:30.629
We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire.

00:24:30.629 --> 00:24:33.655
Neither the sudden shock of battle, nor the

00:24:33.655 --> 00:24:38.661
long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion, will wear us down.

00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:43.666
Give us the tools and we will finish the job."

00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:44.668
So, he is

00:24:44.668 --> 00:24:50.558
saying that the British will not stop, will not tire, no matter what happens - all the Americans

00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:57.448
need to do is loan military equipment to the British, and we will, as he puts it, “finish the job”.

00:24:58.658 --> 00:25:02.418
Here you will see again the way that Churchill chooses

00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:05.808
his words so carefully in order to convey his message.

00:25:06.558 --> 00:25:12.638
Old, short words are combined with ones that have strong religious associations and help

00:25:12.648 --> 00:25:19.028
give the speech the quality mentioned in the Nobel Prize citation of “exalted human values”.

00:25:19.778 --> 00:25:24.628
These religious words are such ones as faith, blessing and vigilance.

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:30.168
Verbs are used in their strongest form, the imperative, and at the

00:25:30.188 --> 00:25:34.698
strongest point in the sentence - the start; so we have the powerful

00:25:34.708 --> 00:25:40.768
rhythm or pulse, pushing the argument forward: “Put..Give..Give..”

00:25:41.618 --> 00:25:48.438
The final sentence, once again, finishes the argument, using those short words and the simplest

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:55.878
but most powerful of metaphors or images: “Give us the tools and we will finish the job.”

00:25:56.988 --> 00:26:01.228
Especially for those of you who come from countries where politicians

00:26:01.438 --> 00:26:06.488
often try to talk in an incredibly complicated language, it might sound

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:11.658
surprising to hear that simple language is most effective in English.

00:26:12.808 --> 00:26:16.868
So, what should we conclude about the effect on the war

00:26:16.868 --> 00:26:20.608
effort of Churchill’s use of spoken English, of his oratory?

00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:24.651
Here are two quotations that sum it up quite well for me.

00:26:25.771 --> 00:26:31.281
A fellow Member of Parliament, Josiah Wedgwood, wrote after Churchill's speech

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:38.051
on 4 June 1940: “That was worth a 1,000 guns, and the speeches of a 1,000 years.”

00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:40.221
President John F.

00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:46.261
Kennedy, when presenting Churchill with honorary American citizenship, quoted journalist Edward

00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:52.521
Murrow, when he said that “Churchill mobilised the English Language and sent it into battle.”

00:26:53.531 --> 00:26:59.471
Before we finish, just so you get some taste of another side of the great man - he was also known

00:26:59.471 --> 00:27:04.281
for his wit, and for his quick responses, which are often quite funny and a little bit rude.

00:27:04.281 --> 00:27:09.041
Here are a few of his best known exchanges.

00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:15.061
During a conversation with Nancy Astor, the first female Member of Parliament,

00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:20.451
she said “If I were married to you, I’d put poison in your coffee.”

00:27:21.094 --> 00:27:24.544
He replied, “If I were married to you, I’d drink it”.

00:27:25.514 --> 00:27:28.424
He described his successor as prime minister, Clement

00:27:28.464 --> 00:27:32.884
Attlee, as “A modest man, who has much to be modest about.”

00:27:33.664 --> 00:27:41.194
And about his lifestyle, he said “I am a man of simple tastes, easily satisfied by the best.”

00:27:42.334 --> 00:27:48.014
And finally, on the matter of his own death, he said: “I am ready to meet my maker.

00:27:48.414 --> 00:27:53.469
Whether my maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.”

00:27:56.049 --> 00:28:01.639
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the English of Winston Churchill.

00:28:02.069 --> 00:28:06.619
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and you now have a

00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:12.199
better sense for one of the reasons why he is such an influential figure in British history.

00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:17.779
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of the

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:22.309

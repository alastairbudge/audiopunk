Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:17.011
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:21.851
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.371
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:30.698
about the story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage.

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:39.561
It is a fascinating story with many appetising ingredients: innovation, rivalry, eccentric genius,

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:48.591
failure, obsession, invention, technology, creative vision, mathematics, poetry and family sadness.

00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:53.121
It is certainly inspiring, and the subjects of today’s

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:57.051
episode were some of the most curious minds in history.

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.231
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get stuck in right away.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:08.161
The two people who are at the heart of our story have often been

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.911
described as the Father of Computing and the Mother of Computer

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:17.791
programming respectively; they are Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace.

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:27.671
Babbage was born in 1791, and Lovelace in 1815, there was a 24 year age difference between the pair.

00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:35.895
They were both influential figures in British society during the 19th century, but in so many ways,

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:43.345
as is often the case with people of genius, their true impact and influence only really became

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:52.255
apparent at least a century after their deaths, in 1871 for Babbage, and in 1852 for Lovelace.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:58.155
So, this is a tale of brilliant innovation, thwarted

00:01:58.225 --> 00:02:02.745
genius and bold ambitions only partially achieved.

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:10.085
I think it is especially interesting and relevant to describe the lives of these two brilliant

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:16.815
technology pioneers because their bold thinking and experimentation may well have laid the

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:22.545
foundations for that vital piece of technology which you will be listening to this episode

00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:28.835
on - a computer, whether that’s a computer in a mobile phone or in a laptop or tablet.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:35.995
Yes, Lovelace and Babbage, in different ways, invented the computer, or

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:40.835
at least, conceptualised the technology that computers would be built on.

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:47.455
I think there is one other additional reason to explore their lives and influence: there

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:54.705
is something reassuringly familiar and indeed timeless about the fights, rivalries,

00:02:54.875 --> 00:03:00.875
aspirations, dreams, failings and relationships that we will encounter in this story.

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:04.185
Let me set the scene as best I can.

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:09.715
The world of early 19th century British society that they were born into was a

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:15.795
stimulating one, with Britain industrialising ahead of any other country and at great

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:20.445
speed, as you will have heard about in the episode on The Industrial Revolution.

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:26.595
It was also a world where people were obsessed with engineering and technology.

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:31.035
It must have been a very exciting place and time, although

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:35.845
somewhat bewildering, confusing, because of the pace of change.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:43.725
Both our protagonists, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, were born into very wealthy families.

00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:49.885
They both had problematic family lives, so although they were privileged

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:55.545
financially, they did not have stable, emotional and loving family lives.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:04:02.345
Charles had a poor relationship with his banker father; although this was no longer a factor

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:08.735
after his father died, leaving him a large fortune, a large amount of money in inheritance.

00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:13.545
This enabled him to pursue his many interests without worrying

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.345
about needing an income through work - or a normal salary.

00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:21.125
He could pursue his many enthusiasms at will.

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:27.665
Ada had about the most exotic and notorious family background that you could have.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:34.335
She was the only legitimate child of the celebrated and notorious poet, Lord Byron.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:41.035
Byron was described famously as “mad, bad and dangerous to know”.

00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:46.315
He was from his early twenties one of the most famous people in the country,

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:51.515
with many of the characteristics of the most notorious of today’s rock stars.

00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:56.985
Famously, he had a pet bear, he would drink from a human

00:04:56.995 --> 00:05:02.425
skull, and had countless affairs with men and women alike.

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:07.195
He was the complete opposite of Ada’s mother, a lady called

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:12.135
Annabella, who was precise, methodical, and a scientist at heart.

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:21.365
He called her the “Princess of Parallelograms”, and she referred to his ‘Volatile poetic insanity’.

00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:25.275
As you might imagine, the marriage did not last.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:31.995
Lord Byron left his wife and young child when she was just four weeks old, he

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:37.895
travelled through Europe, having multiple affairs and causing havoc everywhere he went.

00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:42.525
You’ll hear a little bit more about Lord Byron in an upcoming

00:05:42.555 --> 00:05:46.296
episode on a bizarre tradition called The Grand Tour.

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:50.135
And, sadly, he never saw little Ada again.

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.765
Ada’s mother, Annabella Byron, did everything she could

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:58.695
to remove any trace of him from her daughter’s life.

00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:04.255
She genuinely believed that her husband was insane, he was mad,

00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:09.655
and was worried that little Ada might have inherited some of her

00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:14.485
father’s bad characteristics, including the idea of becoming a poet.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.783
Annabella was determined to keep young Ada away from this path.

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:24.695
She covered up Byron’s portrait with a curtain, so

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.955
Ada couldn’t even see what her father looked like.

00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:35.475
She set out to give Ada the best education possible, especially in mathematics and science.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:42.575
Not only did Annabella engage very good tutors, but she also put her daughter in contact with

00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:49.475
some of the leading scientific and mathematical minds of the day – people she had access to first

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:56.239
through her social status and, later, when Ada married, through her husband‘s social circle as well.

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:01.019
This wasn’t the norm for a woman in Victorian society.

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:06.149
Girls were expected to have some understanding of literature and

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:11.089
to be able to make polite conversation, but mathematics and science

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:15.769
were considered by many to be too complicated for a female mind.

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:22.809
Of course, it might seem mad now, but there are multiple instances of well-respected

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:28.829
scientists and mathematicians even suggesting that the subjects might be too complicated

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:36.199
for Ada, precisely because she was female, and was therefore biologically inferior to a man.

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.989
Ada was to prove them all wrong.

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:45.889
From an early age, she proved to be a fantastically talented student.

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:51.809
She was incredibly curious, had a very advanced understanding of engineering

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:57.679
and mathematics, and at the age of 12 she had designed a mechanical bird.

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:04.419
At the age of 17, as was the custom at the time for young aristocratic

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:09.789
boys and girls, they would be - what's called -brought out into society.

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:15.979
These young men and women would be taken to different parties, where they would make polite

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:21.989
conversation, and eventually meet someone to marry, of a similar social class of course.

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:27.359
So, continuing with this story, please now imagine a very large

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:34.319
evening gathering – perhaps up to 300 people in 1833 – at the grand

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:39.429
London home of Charles Babbage, who would have been 42 at the time.

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:44.919
The fancy word for such an evening was a soirée, taken from the French.

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:49.629
Apparently, there were three reasons that one would have

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:54.989
been invited to such a soiree: ‘intellect, beauty or rank’.

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:57.319
Rank means social importance.

00:08:58.099 --> 00:08:59.819
Ada had all three.

00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:06.419
She was incredibly clever, she was beautiful, and she was at the top of London’s high society.

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:12.074
Amongst all the distinguished and no doubt talented people at this sophisticated

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:17.399
London soirée, it is the host that Annabella wants her daughter to meet most.

00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:22.839
Babbage is one of the most eminent and talked-about people in England.

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:24.169
Why?

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:30.029
Well, Babbage is a man who has enviable talents and learning across a vast

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:35.509
range of subjects; the handy word for this kind of person is a polymath.

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:42.129
Charles Babbage is by this time well known as an influential man with expertise

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:47.739
across an amazing range of subjects: the organisation of factories, the new

00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:52.849
postal system, the invention of the speedometer, astronomy and statistics.

00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:56.259
A true polymath, a true curious mind.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:10:01.959
For those of you who enjoy old Western or cowboy films, it was Babbage who

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:08.919
invented the so-called cow catcher, which is the triangular object attached to

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:14.769
the front of a train to clear cows or any other objects out of the way of a train.

00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:21.499
On top of all his many interests, he was also Lucasian Professor of mathematics

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:27.119
at Cambridge University, incidentally the same post held by Isaac Newton,

00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:31.819
the man who famously discovered gravity when an apple fell on his head.

00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:41.289
It is now 1833 when the 42-year-old illustrious polymath Charles Babbage meets the 17-year-old Ada.

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:44.849
She is of course accompanied by her mother–a young

00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:47.469
lady would not be allowed to go anywhere on her own.

00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:54.089
As you can imagine, with a man who had so many interests and was also extremely social,

00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:59.719
there were plenty of reasons why she and her well-known mother might have wanted to meet him.

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:05.599
For example, he was well known for conducting various quite eccentric

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:10.799
campaigns against certain features of the crowded streets around his house.

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:18.279
He hated street music and in particular the portable organs that were played on the streets by

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:24.589
people who would have been expecting to earn a few pennies for their songs – like buskers nowadays.

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:30.159
So Babbage conducted a campaign against these players of organs.

00:11:30.869 --> 00:11:36.059
He also had an obsession – a bee in his bonnet to use the figurative

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:42.079
expression – about boys who ran through the streets rolling hoops with sticks.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:49.409
You may have seen old pictures of this generally harmless bit of fun that young boys would enjoy.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:55.439
Grumpy old Babbage witnessed accidents when these hoops went out of

00:11:55.439 --> 00:12:00.159
control, getting stuck between horses' legs and breaking their legs.

00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:05.159
So, this carefree, boyish activity should be banned, he

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:08.629
thought, and he campaigned to make the activity illegal.

00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:14.379
Ada, who was, let us not forget, not much older than those carefree,

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:19.499
accident-causing, hoop-rolling boys, was interested in two particular

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:25.279
areas of her host‘s work: the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine.

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:30.269
I need to give you a little bit of background on these, because understanding what

00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:35.769
they did is crucial for our appreciating their role in the history of computing.

00:12:36.609 --> 00:12:42.169
Babbage and his friend, the great astronomer John Herschel, had found themselves

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:48.299
trying to check a series of figures that had already been looked over by computers.

00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:56.349
Now at this stage – and indeed from 1613 when the word computer is first recorded as having

00:12:56.349 --> 00:13:04.359
been used – the word computer referred to a person who calculated things, not a machine.

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:10.399
What Babbage and Herschel decided was that it would be a great idea to create

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:15.789
a machine that could do the job without making mistakes, without human error.

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:20.901
In fact we have the words that he said at the time: “ I wish

00:13:20.957 --> 00:13:25.861
to God that these calculations had been executed by steam.“

00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:32.781
In modern day English he is simply saying that he wished that the process had been automated.

00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:39.481
With this aspiration, Babbage set his brilliant mind to work in order

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:44.221
to create the design for something that he called The Difference Engine,

00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:50.141
which was a sophisticated, mechanised way of doing complex calculations.

00:13:51.301 --> 00:13:57.430
By the time of the party in 1833, part of the Difference Engine had been built.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.320
More excitingly still, Babbage had gone on to draw up a yet more

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.930
complicated design for a machine which he called his Analytical Engine.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.210
Now this is where it gets quite complicated, because his very intricate

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.480
design includes most of the typical features of the modern computer.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.150
The central processing unit, some expandable memory, called the store.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.930
If you know much about computers, these will all be familiar terms.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:35.010
He produced literally thousands of technical drawings which show how all of this fitted together.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.710
The Analytical Engine was in effect a programmable

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.900
machine that was capable of full digital computation.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.770
You would program it, and it would calculate sums for you.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:56.130
It is this brilliant vision and its intricate and detailed designs that earns Babbage his title

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:03.090
as the person who originated the concept of the programmable computer - the Father of Computing.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.030
Now enter Ada Lovelace, let’s not forget, still of school age, but

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.580
full of inquisitiveness and accompanied by her enterprising mother.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.140
Both mother and daughter were fascinated by this machine.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:25.250
After the fancy party Lovelace and her mother decide to go on a tour of factories

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.210
in the English Midlands, in an industrial area of the country, where they look

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:36.140
at how machines work and in particular they look at a new invention, which is

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:42.450
known as the Jacquard Loom - a device for weaving cloth, for making clothes.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.620
The Jacquard Loom was a major invention because, through the use of

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.650
something called punch cards attached to the loom, it was possible for the

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:58.150
machine to create the most intricate and complex patterns and embroidery.

00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:03.763
This visit and the party were clearly inspirations for Lovelace because she

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:09.563
started a regular correspondence with Babbage, they exchanged letters for 20 years.

00:16:10.183 --> 00:16:13.693
This was the beginning of what became a very fruitful

00:16:13.903 --> 00:16:17.153
collaborative relationship and meeting of minds.

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:24.463
Although they met when Lovelace was just 17 years old, there is a 24 year age difference

00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:30.843
between the two and Lovelace is, of course, a woman, Babbage considers her an intellectual

00:16:30.893 --> 00:16:35.613
peer, he considers her to be on the same level from an intellectual point of view.

00:16:36.623 --> 00:16:41.903
Let me now take you onto the final and crucial stage of their collaboration.

00:16:42.573 --> 00:16:47.743
It is a peculiar and slightly complicated story, but I will try and describe it briefly.

00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:54.044
In 1840 Babbage visited Turin in Italy in order to give a talk

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:57.754
about the Analytical Engine, which he was trying to promote.

00:16:58.654 --> 00:17:02.244
Notes on his lecture are taken by a mathematician called Luigi

00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:06.824
Menabrea, who incidentally later becomes Prime Minister of Italy.

00:17:07.434 --> 00:17:12.024
The notes are taken in French, and then published in a Swiss Journal.

00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:17.844
Lovelace, who spoke French, is asked both to translate his

00:17:17.844 --> 00:17:22.024
paper into English and also to add some notes of her own.

00:17:22.824 --> 00:17:28.464
The original version was around 8,000 words, but when Lovelace adds all of

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:34.024
her own commentary it comes to 20,000 words, almost three times the length.

00:17:34.734 --> 00:17:38.854
It is because of these notes and what she adds that she comes

00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:42.844
to be regarded by many people as the first computer programmer.

00:17:43.714 --> 00:17:48.614
What Lovelace realises about the Analytical Engine is that it can be

00:17:48.614 --> 00:17:53.715
used not just for calculating numbers, but for calculating anything.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.644
Here is perhaps the most famous excerpt from what she added to the

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:03.654
lecture notes; she refers to the Analytical Engine: “The machine will

00:18:03.664 --> 00:18:09.614
weave algebraic patterns like a Jacquard Loom weaves flowers and leaves.”

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:15.334
Here is, apparently, the evidence that Ada had the vision to

00:18:15.334 --> 00:18:19.664
see that the machine was not simply constrained by numbers.

00:18:20.114 --> 00:18:23.064
Numbers could be translated into concepts.

00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:27.234
She is saying that this machine has much wider

00:18:27.234 --> 00:18:31.854
significance and use than merely numerical calculations.

00:18:32.814 --> 00:18:36.954
For the software developers among you, Lovelace proposed the

00:18:36.974 --> 00:18:41.744
idea of looping, and conditional branching, or if statements.

00:18:42.304 --> 00:18:46.064
If you aren’t a software engineer and don’t know what I’m talking about, these

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.994
are concepts that are very important for modern day computer programmers.

00:18:50.914 --> 00:18:57.224
And remember, this is from Lovelace’s writing in 1843, coming up to 200 years ago.

00:18:58.084 --> 00:19:02.464
She is also credited with developing an algorithm that would enable

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:07.904
the Analytical Engine to calculate a sequence of rational numbers – for

00:19:07.904 --> 00:19:11.834
the mathematicians amongst you, these are called Bernoulli numbers.

00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:17.694
In subsequent discussions with Babbage on how to develop the Analytical Engine,

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:23.354
Ada encourages him to raise additional money and to build a prototype for it.

00:19:23.774 --> 00:19:26.664
Remember, at this stage it is just a concept.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:32.024
Unfortunately, although the British government had spent the equivalent of nearly £3

00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:37.744
million trying to develop a prototype, it had stopped the investment because progress was

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:44.024
too slow and also, it seems, Babbage was a particularly difficult person to deal with.

00:19:44.304 --> 00:19:49.294
He was awkward and undiplomatic, and he tended to fall out with people.

00:19:49.924 --> 00:19:53.674
And he never lived to see his extraordinary machine built.

00:19:54.734 --> 00:20:01.264
As for Ada, her story doesn’t end well either; she was only 36 when she died of cancer.

00:20:01.984 --> 00:20:04.804
In the cases of both Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage,

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:08.354
their work was largely ignored after their deaths.

00:20:08.944 --> 00:20:13.314
Although they had envisioned the modern computer, it wasn’t until

00:20:13.384 --> 00:20:17.814
almost 100 years later that their work was to be re-examined.

00:20:18.444 --> 00:20:23.384
It was actually Alan Turing, who you can learn more about in episode

00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:28.744
44, who found their work, and built on it with his own inventions.

00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:35.714
In terms of Ada, her name lives on: she has been commemorated in all sorts of different ways.

00:20:36.634 --> 00:20:41.844
Ada is the name of a programming language used in military computers and for aviation.

00:20:42.344 --> 00:20:47.354
Ada Lovelace Day occurs on the second Tuesday of October each year, aiming

00:20:47.354 --> 00:20:51.784
to “… raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering

00:20:51.794 --> 00:20:55.964
and maths”, and to “create new role models for girls and women”.

00:20:56.914 --> 00:21:02.364
The pictures of both Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage can be found inside a British passport,

00:21:02.684 --> 00:21:08.964
and even more importantly and perhaps extraordinarily, you can find full scale working

00:21:08.974 --> 00:21:14.484
Difference Engines, one in The Science Museum in London and another one in California.

00:21:15.224 --> 00:21:20.514
And if you are curious, and you don’t live in London or California, there are some fascinating

00:21:20.524 --> 00:21:26.974
YouTube videos which show this beautiful, intricate and ground-breaking machine in all its glory.

00:21:28.014 --> 00:21:32.224
So, for both these brilliant and colourful 19th-century

00:21:32.244 --> 00:21:35.494
pioneers, their name does live on in different ways.

00:21:36.074 --> 00:21:42.834
There is a kind of immortality, both in these memorials – and of course in everyone’s pockets.

00:21:45.714 --> 00:21:51.019
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage.

00:21:51.484 --> 00:21:55.164
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:59.364
the next time you look down at your phone, or think about the technology

00:21:59.364 --> 00:22:03.684
that goes into your computer, you can think of these two grand inventors.

00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:07.824
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:08.204 --> 00:22:11.134
I know that we have a lot of software engineers, so I

00:22:11.134 --> 00:22:13.322
would particularly love to know what you thought of it.

00:22:13.322 --> 00:22:16.194
Do you know about Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage?

00:22:16.194 --> 00:22:19.254
Do you know any Ada, the programming language?

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.689
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.719
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.949
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Edward Bernays.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.639
He was a PR man, a master manipulator, and over his almost 80 year career he can

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:37.729
claim responsibility for changing public opinion and behaviour on a huge range of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:43.479
different areas, from bananas to bacon, the ballet to women smoking cigarettes.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.059
It is a fascinating story, so let’s get right into it.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.529
In the 1920s, American tobacco companies had a problem.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.929
They had successfully managed to persuade enough American men

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.369
to smoke, with around 50% of adult men being daily smokers.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.819
But it was a different story with women.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.529
Socially, smoking was still seen as something of a taboo for women.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:19.464
It was a man’s activity, and it was associated with loose morals and even prostitution among women.

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:23.474
In other words, good girls didn’t smoke.

00:01:24.664 --> 00:01:30.064
And it wasn’t only a social stigma; in some parts of America it was actually

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:35.194
illegal for women to smoke in public, and there was a bill proposed in Congress

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:41.044
in 1921 to completely ban women from smoking in the District of Columbia.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:49.164
Some women did still smoke, of course, but this was generally done in secret, out of the public eye.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:54.679
So, the number of women who smoked was significantly lower than men.

00:01:55.853 --> 00:02:01.053
The fact that women had a strong incentive not to admit to smoking makes any facts

00:02:01.063 --> 00:02:09.073
on this hard to come by, but according to one estimate, in 1924 US women smoked about

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:16.873
5% of all cigarettes produced, so men were outsmoking women by a factor of 19 to 1.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:21.333
And this was the tobacco companies’ opportunity.

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:27.593
There were just as many women as men, and if they could persuade women to smoke

00:02:27.853 --> 00:02:32.353
to the same degree as men, they could double the number of people who smoked,

00:02:32.713 --> 00:02:36.713
and therefore double the number of cigarettes that were sold, more or less.

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.433
This was a huge opportunity.

00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:45.313
The nature of smoking, especially back then, was that if

00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:48.883
you got a person to start smoking, you had them for life.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:56.673
A smoker was worth a lot to a tobacco company, and women, well they were an untapped market.

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:02.543
It wasn’t like this was a completely new revelation for the tobacco industry.

00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:09.343
They had been trying for years to get women to smoke, but none of the messages seemed to stick.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:12.643
They needed a change in direction.

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:17.713
And this brought them to a man called Edward Bernays.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:24.223
He was still quite young, in his late 30s at the time, but he had developed something

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:29.563
of a reputation for himself as a master of changing public behaviour and opinion.

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:35.752
He had worked for something called The Committee on Public Information, which was essentially the

00:03:35.752 --> 00:03:41.092
US propaganda department that was charged with drumming up public support for the First World War.

00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:48.441
During that campaign, Bernays had seen how comparatively easy it was to change public

00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:55.131
opinion; Americans had started out pretty unenthusiastic about the prospect of entering a

00:03:55.141 --> 00:04:02.401
European war, and after a carefully coordinated PR campaign, public opinion had done a 180.

00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.041
The war enjoyed strong support from the American

00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:09.621
public, and millions of young men signed up to fight.

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:17.361
Bernays had thought, well if it was that easy to get the American public so excited and

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:22.411
passionate about something that was for most people so distant and irrelevant to their

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:28.061
day-to-day lives, it should be easy to do the same thing about products closer to home.

00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:34.181
Or, as he would recall in an interview years later, “what could be done for a

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.841
nation at war could be done for organisations and people in a nation at peace”.

00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.981
And after the war, Bernays did exactly this.

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:50.281
He approached advertising and marketing from a new and up-until-then untested

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:56.961
angle - that of appealing to deeper human emotions and unmet psychological desires.

00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:02.211
This was something that US companies hadn’t really done before.

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:07.281
Up until then, most American advertising had been relatively

00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.171
direct: this is our product and this is what it does.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.721
Buy our coffee because it’s delicious and makes you feel good; smoke our

00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:19.311
cigarettes because they are fresh and have nice packaging, and so on.

00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:26.261
Bernays realised that a message could resonate in a far deeper way if

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:31.911
it really touched a nerve, and appealed to inner or suppressed desires.

00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:36.511
So, what could this be for women and smoking?

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:42.781
It wasn’t that smoking felt good or was what celebrities did or even that it was

00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:47.301
patriotic, which were some of the messages that had resonated so strongly with men.

00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:51.051
Women needed a different approach.

00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:58.311
Bernays looked at what women really wanted, and came to the conclusion that

00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:03.391
it wasn’t anything to do with cigarettes or smoking; it was equality with men.

00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:10.371
As millions of American men had got on boats to Europe to fight in the war, American women had

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:16.881
picked up the mantle, working in factories, and doing all of the traditionally “male” jobs.

00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:24.701
And it turned out that women were equally capable of all of these jobs, there was no “weaker sex”.

00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:31.261
After the war was over, and after a long fight to persuade male

00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:36.881
legislators to finally give in, on the 18th of August, 1920, the 19th

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:40.641
Amendment was passed, which gave American women the right to vote.

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:44.871
Women had shown that they were perfectly capable of doing the jobs that men

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.981
did, they could now vote, just as men did, they were free, just as men were.

00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.591
They could do everything that men could, well, almost everything.

00:06:55.961 --> 00:07:02.861
Smoking was an exception; it was still taboo, smoking was a man’s activity, not a woman’s.

00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:07.701
And that was the angle Edward Bernays decided to exploit:

00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:13.951
make smoking about freedom and equality, not about cigarettes.

00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:19.451
He gave his secretary, a lady called Bertha Hunt, a mission.

00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:26.731
She was to pretend to be a women’s rights activist, and she was charged with getting a group

00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:33.631
of women to walk up and down New York’s Fifth Avenue puffing on cigarettes, smoking in public.

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:38.481
If she could do that, Bernays thought, journalists and photographers

00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:43.101
would descend to cover the march, and this would make national news.

00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:49.121
After all, it was unusual to see women smoking in public, and if these

00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:53.851
women were smoking as a sign of their liberty, well that would be news.

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:59.861
Importantly, Bertha Hunt, Bernays’ secretary, was told in no uncertain

00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:04.771
terms that she was not to reveal any link to Bernays or to his client,

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.961
the American Tobacco Company, the maker of Lucky Strikes cigarettes.

00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:16.632
She sent a telegram to a group of women, and this is what it read: “In the interests of

00:08:16.632 --> 00:08:23.322
equality of the sexes and to fight another sex taboo I and other young women will light

00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:29.512
another torch of freedom by smoking cigarettes while strolling on Fifth Avenue Easter Sunday.”

00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:31.062
End telegram.

00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:36.132
The most important phrase there is the one that would come to be associated

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:41.682
with the campaign, and with smoking among women: “torches of freedom”.

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:48.232
Cigarettes were presented not as a status symbol or way of staying thin

00:08:48.242 --> 00:08:54.212
or of doing something that celebrities did, but as “torches of freedom”.

00:08:55.212 --> 00:09:01.252
A cigarette was something that a woman could proudly hold up in public, like the large Statue

00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:07.642
of Liberty a few kilometres away, to demonstrate her emancipation, and equality with men.

00:09:08.762 --> 00:09:16.092
The telegram worked, and on March the 31st, 1929, Bertha Hunt was joined by a group of

00:09:16.092 --> 00:09:22.042
young women who strolled up and down Fifth Avenue, lighting up cigarette after cigarette.

00:09:23.082 --> 00:09:28.442
As Bernays had hoped, journalists arrived to cover the story, and it was all

00:09:28.492 --> 00:09:33.182
over the national news, with journalists falling hook line and sinker for

00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:37.952
the “torches of freedom” line that had been so carefully crafted by Bernays.

00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:44.162
Now, as to the results of this one campaign, Bernays was later very happy

00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:49.701
to claim that it was his genius idea and this publicity stunt that changed

00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:54.551
the opinion of American women, and from that day on women started to smoke.

00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:59.351
In terms of the numbers, as you will know, the percentage

00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:02.781
of the female population that smoked continued to climb.

00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:07.671
In 1923 only 5% of cigarettes were bought by women,

00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:15.091
rising to 18% in 1935 and then peaking at 33% in 1965.

00:10:16.571 --> 00:10:22.821
But the extent to which Bernays can claim responsibility for this has come under some questioning,

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:29.351
and it’s probably more realistic to say that this was one of many campaigns that continued

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:35.141
to chip away at the stigma of women smoking, not as “the event” that got women smoking.

00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:40.271
Nevertheless, it would go on to cement Edward Bernays’ reputation

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:45.121
as a master influencer, and “the father of public relations”.

00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:49.751
He would go on to write a book, called Propaganda nonetheless,

00:10:50.021 --> 00:10:54.161
which was applauded by the grandfather of psychology and unmet

00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:59.411
desires, Sigmund Freud, as a “clear, clever and comprehensible book”.

00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:03.321
In fact, Freud didn’t just stumble across this book.

00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:07.381
He knew all about Edward Bernays, as he had known him

00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:10.811
his entire life, and had been a huge influence on him.

00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:15.971
The two were related, both through blood and through marriage.

00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:19.381
Bernays’ mother was Freud’s sister.

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:22.903
and his father was Freud’s wife’s brother.

00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:29.663
The pair knew each other very well, and although Bernays had emigrated to the US as a young

00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:35.373
boy, he would spend his summers walking in the Austrian hills with his influential uncle.

00:11:36.713 --> 00:11:42.313
And, as you might expect, Freud’s theories about the irrationality of human

00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:46.923
behaviour were a fundamental part of Bernays’ approach to public relations.

00:11:48.303 --> 00:11:54.543
As you will know, or perhaps as will remember from episode number 290, one of Freud’s

00:11:54.623 --> 00:11:59.913
major theories was that, contrary to Enlightenment thought, humans are completely

00:12:00.023 --> 00:12:05.213
irrational, and cannot be trusted to make decisions based on reasonable arguments.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:11.353
And this was exactly what Bernays tried to exploit with his campaigns.

00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:16.833
Now, you’ve heard about the example of smoking, but let me tell you

00:12:16.843 --> 00:12:22.083
about another famous Bernays campaign, and this relates to breakfast.

00:12:23.393 --> 00:12:28.613
If I had to ask you to imagine what an American breakfast looked like, what would you say?

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:35.353
If you closed your eyes and pictured a “classic American breakfast”, what would you see?

00:12:36.463 --> 00:12:41.473
I imagine it might be quite large, and it would probably have bacon in it, right?

00:12:42.623 --> 00:12:49.483
But if we go back to the 1920s, and before Edward Bernays, Americans tended to

00:12:49.483 --> 00:12:55.193
prefer a lighter breakfast, toast and coffee, more like a continental European

00:12:55.193 --> 00:13:01.723
breakfast of some kind of light carbohydrate and coffee, not a heavy large breakfast.

00:13:03.163 --> 00:13:06.753
Bernays was approached by a company called The Beech-Nut Packing

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:11.423
Company, which sold bacon, and given the task of selling more bacon.

00:13:12.923 --> 00:13:18.643
Now, most PR and advertising companies, if they had been given the task of selling more bacon,

00:13:19.063 --> 00:13:24.403
would have probably put out advertisements in newspapers, maybe with a picture of a happy

00:13:24.403 --> 00:13:29.763
family eating bacon around the table, or talking about how healthy and delicious this bacon was.

00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:35.533
They might have worked, no doubt some people might have seen these adverts and thought,

00:13:35.843 --> 00:13:39.993
hmm, I’ll pick up some bacon from the shop, I hadn’t thought about bacon for a while.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:47.073
But like the mission to get women smoking, Bernays knew that he needed to appeal

00:13:47.073 --> 00:13:52.033
to something deeper, he needed to get people to change their behaviour because of

00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:56.893
some inherent feeling that he could create in the minds of the American consumer.

00:13:58.473 --> 00:14:04.163
His attack vector in this case, his way in, was the traditional, “light”,

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:09.223
American breakfast of coffee and something light, toast, perhaps some cereal.

00:14:10.323 --> 00:14:15.463
Now, I could tell you how he did it, how he went about this campaign,

00:14:15.903 --> 00:14:20.403
but I thought it would be more interesting for him to tell you himself.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:24.093
So here is Edward Bernays, in his own words:

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:30.469
Many years ago, our client was the Beech-Nut Packing company.

00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:34.399
One of their basic problems was bacon.

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:41.749
We made a research and found out that the American public ate

00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:48.649
very light breakfast of coffee, maybe a roll and orange juice.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:57.604
We thereupon decided that the only way to meet the situation was as follows.

00:14:58.294 --> 00:15:09.004
We went to our physician, found that a heavy breakfast was sounder from the standpoint of health

00:15:09.664 --> 00:15:18.214
than a light breakfast because the body loses energy during the night and needs it during the day.

00:15:18.904 --> 00:15:24.934
We ask the physician after telling him why we were talking to him,

00:15:25.414 --> 00:15:33.424
would he be willing at no cost to write to 5,000 physicians and ask them

00:15:33.514 --> 00:15:39.754
whether their judgment, uh, was the same as his, confirmed his judgment.

00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:42.424
He said he would be glad to do it.

00:15:42.904 --> 00:15:47.614
We carried out a letter to 5,000 physicians.

00:15:48.094 --> 00:15:50.809
Obviously, all of them...

00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:53.989
We got about 4,500 answers.

00:15:54.499 --> 00:15:58.729
All of them concurred that a heavy breakfast was better for

00:15:58.729 --> 00:16:02.089
the health of the American people than a light breakfast.

00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:07.099
That was publicised in the newspapers.

00:16:07.669 --> 00:16:15.049
Newspapers throughout the country had headlines saying: "4,500 physicians

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:22.309
urge heavy breakfast in order to improve health of American people."

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:28.969
Many of them stated that bacon and eggs should be embodied

00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:34.939
with the breakfast, and as a result, the sale of bacon went up.

00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:41.129
And I still have a letter from Bartlett Arkell, president

00:16:41.129 --> 00:16:44.209
of the Beech-Nut Packing company, telling me so.

00:16:46.954 --> 00:16:48.584
So, did you get all of that?

00:16:49.244 --> 00:16:56.244
He got his company doctor to write to 5,000 other doctors, 4,500 of whom wrote back in

00:16:56.244 --> 00:17:02.424
agreement that a bigger breakfast was better, and then Bernays proceeded to publicise this

00:17:02.924 --> 00:17:09.434
as “4,500 doctors urge Americans to eat a bigger breakfast, which could include bacon”.

00:17:10.844 --> 00:17:12.714
And bacon sales increased.

00:17:13.664 --> 00:17:17.354
Now, when you look back at these campaigns now, perhaps they

00:17:17.354 --> 00:17:22.444
seem simple and obvious, but they clearly were not at the time.

00:17:23.764 --> 00:17:29.904
Bernays' reputation grew and grew, helping to grow sales of everything from cigarettes to bacon.

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:34.784
And, unfortunately, there is evidence to suggest that

00:17:34.784 --> 00:17:38.444
his mind bending skills were not always used for good.

00:17:39.604 --> 00:17:44.054
He was later informed that the Nazi propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels,

00:17:44.414 --> 00:17:49.144
used one of his books as a manual for his PR campaign attacking Jews.

00:17:50.554 --> 00:17:55.324
This must have been jarring for anyone to hear that their work was being used

00:17:55.334 --> 00:18:01.834
for such vile ends, but particularly so for Bernays, given that he was Jewish and

00:18:02.054 --> 00:18:06.854
that his uncle, Sigmund Freud, had been forced to flee Vienna to save his life.

00:18:08.324 --> 00:18:14.324
So, to wrap things up, Edward Bernays was one of the most powerful figures in PR and

00:18:14.324 --> 00:18:20.094
advertising, and can certainly claim some responsibility for a whole range of behaviours that

00:18:20.114 --> 00:18:25.374
hundreds of millions of people around the world do today, without a second thought as to why.

00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:33.024
While he was alive he embraced the title of “the father of public relations”, but perhaps it

00:18:33.024 --> 00:18:40.164
might be more accurate to describe him, as one 2019 article did, as “The Original Influencer”.

00:18:42.904 --> 00:18:48.964
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Edward Bernays, the father of public relations, the

00:18:48.964 --> 00:18:54.954
original influencer, or simply a man with a keen understanding on how to shape public opinion.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.510
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.710
Are there any behaviours or cultural shifts in your country that

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.050
were the result of a similar coordinated public relations campaign?

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.620
What were they, and how did they work?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.000
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

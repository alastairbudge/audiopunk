Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.251
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.511
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.741
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is part three of

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:28.471
our three-part mini-series on Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:33.161
If you haven’t listened to parts one or two yet, well, go back and do that,

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.551
as they will give you the background you need to understand the story.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:42.121
In part one we talked about who Daphne was, what she wrote about, and

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:46.641
some of the peculiarities of the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:53.241
Then in part two we looked at the criminal investigations into her murder, who

00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:57.791
was suspected, how it was clear that there were leaks coming from the police,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.291
and who was eventually arrested in connection with her brutal assassination.

00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:08.041
And in today’s episode, part three, we will look at the final chapter of

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:12.851
the story, the trials and investigations into the alleged people behind the

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:18.041
murder, what has been revealed, what questions still need answers, and ask

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:22.631
ourselves whether the truth will ever be revealed about who killed Daphne.

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.402
OK then, part three.

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:34.442
So, we are picking up our story at the start of 2020, over two years after Daphne was murdered.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.092
As a reminder, in November of 2019, the police arrested the prominent

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:45.732
businessman, Yorgen Fenech, for being the mastermind behind the murder.

00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:51.922
Fenech said he has information about who else was involved in the murder,

00:01:52.332 --> 00:01:57.112
information that will implicate those at the very top of the Maltese political

00:01:57.112 --> 00:02:01.772
establishment, including some of the Prime Minister’s closest allies.

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:07.242
But in exchange, he wants a pardon, he wants to avoid prison.

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:11.162
He isn’t granted one, he isn’t given a pardon.

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:16.642
There are big protests, the Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, is

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:21.392
forced to resign, and he is replaced by a man called Robert Abela.

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:29.062
The police are proudly declaring that they have the men responsible for the crime in custody, so you

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:35.022
might think that it would be a simple case of a criminal trial and sentencing the guilty parties.

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:38.092
It was far from simple.

00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:44.392
Instead, five years after her murder, the Maltese state has still not convicted

00:02:44.482 --> 00:02:49.892
anybody with being the mastermind of the brutal assassination, and the allegations

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:55.212
remain that key people involved in the murder are not only walking free, but

00:02:55.232 --> 00:03:00.502
still holding a powerful grip over the country’s political and judicial systems.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:04.892
So, what do we know, what has happened so far?

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:09.002
Why did the Maltese police arrest Yorgen Fenech, the

00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:12.652
businessman, and why did they then arrest Keith Schembri?

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:17.862
Well, it first starts with Vince Muscat, one of the

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:21.252
three gangsters who was arrested in the potato shed.

00:03:22.232 --> 00:03:27.952
As a reminder, he is not related to the Prime Minister, they just share the same common surname.

00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:30.502
So Vince Muscat.

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:35.892
Sometime in April of 2018, he starts speaking to police.

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:41.952
He says, perhaps unsurprisingly, that he and his accomplices, the

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:46.622
DeGiorgio brothers, were paid by a third party to carry out the murder.

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:52.567
This third party’s name, this person’s name, was Melvin Theuma.

00:03:53.481 --> 00:04:00.190
Muscat was promised to be paid a total of 150,000 euros to kill Daphne, a

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.700
€30,000 down payment, a deposit, and the remainder after she was killed.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.250
What’s more, Muscat would claim that Theuma had been paying the three men, via intermediaries,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.890
a weekly allowance while they were in prison to keep quiet, to not talk to the police.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.300
Melvin Theuma was merely a taxi driver, he was clearly acting on someone else’s orders.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.040
When he was arrested Melvin Theuma, he revealed that he was acting on the orders

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.640
of Yorgen Fenech, a businessman and one of the wealthiest men on the island.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.020
Fenech, according to Theuma, wanted Daphne to be killed because

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.640
she was going to publish damning accusations about Fenech's uncle.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.270
Or at least this was what he told Theuma.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.860
It would transpire that Daphne did know something revelatory, something very

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.380
surprising, but it wasn’t about Fenech’s uncle, it was about Fenech himself,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.440
and his links to Keith Schembri, the former Chief of Staff of the Prime

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.460
Minister, and Konrad Mizzi, another senior member of the Maltese government.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.190
What Daphne had discovered was that Yorgen Fenech was the owner of a mysterious

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.210
company called 17 Black, which had been named as a company that was going

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.310
to pay Schembri and Mizzi’s offshore companies a total of $2,000,000.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:38.850
Yorgen Fenech, despite having a background in casinos and hotels, had recently entered the energy

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.710
business, and his company had been awarded the rights to build a new power station in Malta.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.010
Who would have been involved in that decision?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.140
Well, at the time the energy minister was Konrad Mizzi,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.500
and Keith Schembri was the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff.

00:05:56.452 --> 00:06:01.752
And Daphne had discovered that these two government officials had set up secretive

00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:06.862
companies and bank accounts with the stated purpose of receiving money from none

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:11.322
other than the man who was set to make millions from this new power station.

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:18.342
Mizzi and Schembri, the senior politicians, would deny any wrongdoing, saying

00:06:18.352 --> 00:06:23.312
that they set up these secretive companies and bank accounts for honest, personal

00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:29.169
reasons, but it certainly did seem like unusual behaviour, exactly the sort of

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.062
behaviour one might do if, for example, one wanted to receive a very large bribe.

00:06:36.242 --> 00:06:42.672
This information about this link, I should add, was never published in Daphne’s lifetime, it was

00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:48.892
only released by a brave collection of journalists who meticulously went through Daphne’s notes and

00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:56.022
research and eventually published this story in late 2019, just before Fenech and Schembri’s arrest.

00:06:57.582 --> 00:07:04.552
And as Vince Muscat, the bomb fixer, and Melvin Theuma, the middleman, started

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:10.052
talking, more and more of the details of the murder plot started to be revealed.

00:07:11.072 --> 00:07:16.142
I should say, of course, that this is their testimony, and there are the obvious

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:20.732
question marks over the truth, but this is what has been revealed so far.

00:07:22.102 --> 00:07:28.122
Shortly after being asked by Yorgen Fenech to arrange the murder, Melvin Theuma would claim

00:07:28.242 --> 00:07:34.682
that he was given a job working for the Family Affairs Ministry, the government, as a driver.

00:07:35.632 --> 00:07:40.622
He was told to turn up to Castille, the office of the Prime Minister, and

00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:46.732
after a two minute interview he was hired on a salary of €1,200 a month.

00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:53.882
The salary might not have been super high, but the best bit about his new job was

00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:58.986
that he never actually had to turn up, it was a completely phantom government job.

00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:06.506
Now, these kinds of phantom jobs in Malta are, unfortunately, not so incredibly

00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:13.276
uncommon, but to be handed one, ostensibly, for arranging a murder would be peculiar.

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:16.776
And it certainly seems like a coincidence.

00:08:17.866 --> 00:08:22.671
What’s more, Theuma would testify that, during one of his trips to Castille,

00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:28.106
to the Office of the Prime Minister, he was told to pass on a message to the

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:32.666
three men in jail, the DeGiorgio brothers and Vince Muscat, that they would

00:08:32.676 --> 00:08:37.446
be released from jail soon and they would each be given a million Euros.

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:42.806
Theuma starts to think that people at the highest levels of the Maltese political

00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:47.964
system were involved with the murder, and are involved in the subsequent coverup.

00:08:49.226 --> 00:08:53.786
Combined with his knowledge that it was the powerful businessman, Fenech, who

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:58.466
paid him to arrange the murder, Theuma starts to get more and more paranoid,

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:03.126
thinking that he is going to be killed or silenced by powerful forces.

00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:09.286
It certainly seems like warranted, justified, suspicion, especially as

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:13.896
Fenech’s behaviour becomes even more erratic, although it would turn out

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:18.821
that this erratic behaviour was partly due to a crippling cocaine addiction.

00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:24.371
So, Theuma starts recording his conversations with Fenech, he keeps

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:29.271
an old ice cream tub of evidence with him at all times as protection.

00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:34.691
He tells Fenech that he has this big box of evidence, promising that he

00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:39.111
will send copies of it to policemen he trusts if anything happens to him.

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:46.391
So, starting in early 2018, only a few months after the murder, and after

00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:51.081
Vince Muscat starts talking to police, Theuma knows he might be arrested.

00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:56.611
After all, he was involved, and Vince Muscat, who is in police

00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:00.371
custody and is starting to talk to the police, knows who he is.

00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:06.681
But more than this, Theuma too is receiving inside information

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:10.591
about the investigation, information that isn’t publicly available.

00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.811
He knows what’s going on.

00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:18.111
But he hopes that he knows too much, and that the powerful forces

00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:22.121
that he believes ordered the murder will save him from the police.

00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.251
Eventually, however, his luck runs out.

00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:32.871
On 14th November of 2019 he is arrested, and it's his arrest that

00:10:32.891 --> 00:10:36.153
leads to the arrest of Yorgen Fenech and then Keith Schembri.

00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:43.723
Even more bizarrely, perhaps, it would be claimed that, after the arrests of Fenech and Schembri,

00:10:44.213 --> 00:10:49.903
Schembri arranged for a letter to be sent to Fenech where Fenech was instructed to claim

00:10:50.193 --> 00:10:55.123
that it was Chris Cardona, the former minister of the economy, who had ordered the killing.

00:10:56.523 --> 00:11:00.353
Chris Cardona has vehemently denied these claims, and it should

00:11:00.363 --> 00:11:03.753
be said that he has not been questioned or charged with anything.

00:11:05.143 --> 00:11:09.883
I know that there are a lot of names and dates here, but the point to underline

00:11:10.093 --> 00:11:15.103
is that there are fingers being pointed in all directions and a lot of paranoid

00:11:15.143 --> 00:11:20.063
people fearing that someone will spill the beans and reveal everything.

00:11:21.503 --> 00:11:24.643
So, what is the current status of the investigation?

00:11:26.123 --> 00:11:31.543
Keith Schembri, the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff, was questioned and released, with the

00:11:31.543 --> 00:11:37.673
police stating that “The police at this stage see no reason to hold Mr Schembri under arrest”.

00:11:38.853 --> 00:11:44.733
He has been arrested and questioned regarding several other allegations of corruption, but as

00:11:44.733 --> 00:11:50.103
far as the investigation of Daphne’s murder is concerned, he has not been charged with anything.

00:11:51.175 --> 00:11:56.533
Yorgen Fenech, on the other hand, has remained in custody, maintaining that he has

00:11:56.593 --> 00:12:01.133
evidence that will implicate other powerful players in Malta’s political scene.

00:12:02.553 --> 00:12:06.683
As of the time of writing, and as a reminder, this is five

00:12:06.683 --> 00:12:10.423
years after Daphne was murdered, the trial is ongoing.

00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:16.753
Three men, the DeGiorgio brothers and Vince Muscat have been charged with the

00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:21.513
killing, and they are currently serving their sentences, but they were merely

00:12:21.513 --> 00:12:26.623
the executors of the plan, the people who planted and detonated the bomb.

00:12:27.573 --> 00:12:30.013
Who was ultimately responsible?

00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:35.543
Well, there was a public inquest, in July of 2021 which

00:12:35.573 --> 00:12:40.583
did assign responsibility, but not to any one individual.

00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:49.903
This 437-page report named the Maltese State as being responsible for Daphne’s death, writing

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:56.123
that "It created an atmosphere of impunity, generated from the highest echelons of the

00:12:56.123 --> 00:13:02.383
administration inside Castille, the tentacles of which then spread to other institutions,

00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:08.663
such as the police and regulatory authorities, leading to a collapse in the rule of law".

00:13:10.003 --> 00:13:15.243
In other words, there was a culture of corruption where the people at the top thought that they

00:13:15.243 --> 00:13:20.763
were untouchable, which led to a total breakdown in the official workings in the rule of law.

00:13:21.973 --> 00:13:28.613
The report stated that Daphne provided the only real opposition in the country, and the state’s

00:13:28.623 --> 00:13:34.573
failure to protect her from danger meant that it had to accept responsibility for her death.

00:13:35.933 --> 00:13:39.563
Despite whatever truth there might have been behind this report,

00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:43.273
it did nothing to bring Daphne’s killers any closer to justice.

00:13:44.313 --> 00:13:51.173
And were Daphne to be writing today, her inbox would be just as full of allegations of corruption.

00:13:52.113 --> 00:13:58.193
Indeed, if you were to have opened almost any newspaper in Malta over the past few months, you would

00:13:58.193 --> 00:14:04.523
have found stories of suspicious sounding deals, of an alleged kidnapper being given a contract

00:14:04.523 --> 00:14:10.613
to supply cars to the justice department, of the same alleged kidnapper doing a property deal with

00:14:10.613 --> 00:14:16.493
the current Prime Minister, of politicians creating phantom jobs for their lovers or constituents.

00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:20.623
And almost all newspapers in Malta are significantly

00:14:20.633 --> 00:14:23.873
more friendly to the government than Daphne ever was.

00:14:24.743 --> 00:14:29.623
I wonder, what would Daphne have written about the investigations of her own murder?

00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:33.693
What would she have written about the lawyer working for state

00:14:33.693 --> 00:14:37.243
prosecution who then switched to Yorgen Fenech’s defence?

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:42.433
What would she have written about one of Yorgen Fenech’s lawyers admitting that he had

00:14:42.433 --> 00:14:48.533
tried to bribe a journalist from the Times of Malta with an envelope of €500 notes, and

00:14:48.693 --> 00:14:53.093
that his only excuse for this would be that he had “never dealt with a journalist before”?

00:14:53.853 --> 00:14:57.923
What would she have written about the fact that this lawyer was acquitted

00:14:57.983 --> 00:15:02.033
of any wrongdoing and continued to represent her alleged killer?

00:15:02.923 --> 00:15:08.223
What would she have written about the fact that the middleman, Melvin Theuma, was found stabbed

00:15:08.413 --> 00:15:14.003
several times in his apartment in 2020, after it was revealed that he was testifying in court?

00:15:14.753 --> 00:15:19.123
What would she have written about Keith Schembri managing to permanently lose his

00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:24.243
mobile phone at 5am in the morning 30 minutes before the police arrived to arrest him?

00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:29.703
What would she have written about the constant leaks from the police to the alleged killers?

00:15:30.383 --> 00:15:34.333
And what would she think today about the extent to which her murder

00:15:34.343 --> 00:15:38.683
had done anything to change her country or its political situation?

00:15:39.953 --> 00:15:45.093
Joseph Muscat, the Prime Minister condemned by the report as being responsible for

00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:50.783
creating a culture of impunity, is already in the process of being rehabilitated,

00:15:51.103 --> 00:15:56.333
and has taken on the role of chairman for the Association of Maltese Football Clubs.

00:15:57.023 --> 00:16:03.203
Many political commentators see this as being just the first step of his return to political power.

00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:06.728
And has public opinion shifted?

00:16:07.308 --> 00:16:13.884
The public were given the chance to have their say, in a general election in May of 2022.

00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:18.798
For some, this was an opportunity to get rid of the corrupt

00:16:18.818 --> 00:16:21.908
influences at the top of the Maltese political system.

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:26.678
The people spoke with their votes, but the message was clear.

00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:28.508
It doesn’t really matter.

00:16:29.428 --> 00:16:33.828
The Labour party, the party that came to power under Joseph Muscat,

00:16:33.888 --> 00:16:38.848
whose senior members included Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, won with

00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:44.178
an even greater percentage of the popular vote than in 2017 or in 2013.

00:16:45.468 --> 00:16:49.938
Although the voter turnout, the percentage of the population that actually

00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:55.698
voted, was the lowest in 67 years, it was a clear message that the plethora

00:16:55.828 --> 00:17:00.528
of allegations of corruption weren’t enough to really change people’s minds.

00:17:01.568 --> 00:17:03.038
So, what’s next?

00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:06.328
Five years on, the trial continues.

00:17:06.848 --> 00:17:11.678
Is there going to be enough evidence for a conviction of anyone of any serious power?

00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:17.868
There certainly seems to be enough evidence, but the past five years suggests that the links

00:17:17.898 --> 00:17:23.128
between the police, the judiciary, the political system and the world of business are so

00:17:23.158 --> 00:17:29.208
close, so tight, that it’s optimistic to think that there will be any major developments.

00:17:30.108 --> 00:17:35.818
Anyone who was involved has now had plenty of time to cover up their tracks, destroy

00:17:35.848 --> 00:17:40.818
evidence, or make sure that their “lost” mobile phone will never be found again.

00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:48.478
It’s very sad to say, but perhaps the last words Daphne ever wrote are as appropriate now as

00:17:48.478 --> 00:17:53.938
they were thirty minutes before she was killed: “there are crooks everywhere you look now.

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:56.278
The situation is desperate”.

00:17:58.998 --> 00:18:03.768
OK then, with that ominous quote comes the end of this episode, and

00:18:03.768 --> 00:18:07.598
the end of this mini-series on the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:11.798
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that it might have shone some

00:18:11.798 --> 00:18:16.198
light on this dark case of a brutal attack on this brave journalist.

00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:20.148
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:21.708
Have you been to Malta?

00:18:21.738 --> 00:18:24.228
Did you know about Daphne Caruana Galizia?

00:18:24.858 --> 00:18:29.178
Do you think the people responsible for her death will go unpunished?

00:18:29.798 --> 00:18:32.958
What more can be done, both by individuals and

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:36.278
governments, to stop the senseless murder of journalists?

00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:38.848
I would love to hear your perspective.

00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.698

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:16.668
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:21.018
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:25.508
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another

00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:30.098
three-part mini-series, this time on The Atomic Bomb.

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:35.988
There are few times in history where you can say that an event truly

00:00:35.988 --> 00:00:42.068
changed the course of world history, but at 8.15am on August the 6th,

00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:48.068
1945, when the first atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima was one of them.

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:53.138
It didn’t just kill tens of thousands of people instantly, it didn’t just kill

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:57.978
tens of thousands more in the following weeks, months and years, it changed

00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:03.468
the entire concept of what war was, and ushered in a new, nuclear, age.

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:07.908
And it’s no surprise that, when it comes to lists of what people

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:11.838
believe are the most important events of the 20th century, the

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:16.268
creation and dropping of the atomic bomb is always up there at the top.

00:01:16.818 --> 00:01:20.308
So, this is what we’re going to talk about in this mini-series.

00:01:20.758 --> 00:01:25.828
In part one, today’s episode, we are going to talk about the run up to the dropping

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:32.328
of the first bomb, how scientists discovered the potential for an atomic weapon, how

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:37.258
the bomb actually worked, and the years that led up to it actually being dropped.

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:42.618
Then in part two, we will talk about the dropping of the atomic bombs on

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:47.788
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and talk about the immediate aftermath of the events.

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:52.974
Then in part three, our final part, we’ll talk about the aftermath of

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:58.004
the atomic bomb, some of the ethical questions that it raised and ask

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.884
ourselves whether such a huge loss of life could have been avoided.

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:04.991
OK, let’s get started.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:12.541
If you can think back to your science class at school, perhaps you remember something about atoms.

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:17.761
An atom is the smallest unit of matter that exists, they are

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.981
tiny, about one hundred-millionth of a centimetre across.

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:26.881
You’d need to put a hundred million side by side, and even if

00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:30.191
you could, they would be no bigger than your little finger.

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:35.041
And you might think that, given they are so incredibly small,

00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:39.161
the discovery of the atom would be a relatively new thing.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:40.731
It isn’t.

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:46.501
The atom, or at least the idea of the atom, in fact, is nothing new.

00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:52.451
If you know your ancient Greek, you will know that the word “atom” comes from the

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:57.701
ancient Greek word “atomon”, meaning something that is impossible to be cut or divided.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:05.011
Ancient Greek philosophers, going back to the 5th century BC, theorised about

00:03:05.011 --> 00:03:10.281
what the smallest thing in the world was, imagining what would happen if every

00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:15.771
piece of matter was cut in half until it was impossible to cut any further.

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:20.631
And although they, of course, lacked the technical ability

00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:24.101
to actually do this, they did believe that it existed.

00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:30.431
It wasn’t just the ancient Greeks - there’s evidence of Indian philosophers in the 8th

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:37.131
century BC having similar discussions, imagining what the smallest unit of matter could be.

00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:39.951
And they reached a similar conclusion.

00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:45.721
For millennia this idea, the concept of what was called

00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:49.001
Atomism, was something that remained theoretical.

00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:53.541
Galileo explored it, as did Descartes and Sir Isaac Newton.

00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:59.261
Modern atomic theory was spearheaded by an Englishman named

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.581
John Dalton back at the very start of the 19th century.

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.811
In 1897, the English scientist J.J.

00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:12.421
Thomson discovered the electron, the negatively charged particles that circle the atom.

00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:18.201
In 1911, a New Zealander called Ernest Rutherford discovered the

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:22.271
proton, the positively charged particle at the centre of the atom.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:28.961
But the crucial discovery for the purposes of the bomb would come 21 years

00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:35.561
later, in 1932, when an Englishman named James Chadwick discovered the neutron,

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:41.341
which, as the name suggests, is neutral, it’s neither positive or negative.

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:48.471
This was important because scientists suddenly realised that there must be an incredibly

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:55.121
powerful amount of energy holding the protons and the neutrons together at the core of the atom.

00:04:56.101 --> 00:05:00.651
Hidden in the centre of an atom was the most incredible amount of energy.

00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:06.651
If only that energy could be released, well it would unleash a new world of possibilities.

00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:13.911
It was still, to most leading scientists, considered to be impossible - the nucleus was

00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:19.891
so small there was no way it could be split, no way that this energy could be released.

00:05:21.135 --> 00:05:26.811
Some, for example the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard, strongly

00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:32.041
believed it was possible, but lacked the ability to actually prove it.

00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:39.871
But six years later, in 1938 the German physicist Otto Hahn and the Austrian-Swedish

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:46.031
physicist Elise Meitner became the first people to actually conduct nuclear fission,

00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:52.561
a reaction in which the nucleus of an atom is split, broken into two or more pieces.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:06:01.051
What Hahn and Meitner observed was that during this process large amounts of energy were released.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:05.451
News of this discovery spread fast.

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:11.271
While scientists might have been interested in it from a scientific discovery point of view,

00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:17.941
politicians and also business people were interested in possibilities for its practical use.

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.841
If there was a process that would release vast

00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:24.881
amounts of energy, just think of how it could be used.

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:31.811
To create energy, to power transport, for construction, or even for…destruction.

00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:41.081
Shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission, war broke out in Europe, and by December of 1941

00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:47.041
the United States had also entered the war, after the bombing of Pearl Harbour on December the 7th.

00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:54.951
Hitler had become very interested in nuclear fission’s potential, and there was a real fear

00:06:55.201 --> 00:07:01.591
in the United States and in Europe that Nazi Germany would develop a weapon that harnessed the

00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:07.841
immense power of nuclear fission, that Germany would get to the bomb before the Allies did.

00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:17.471
After all, nuclear fission had been discovered in Germany, and as early as 1939 Hitler had created

00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:24.101
the “Uranverein”, the Uranium Club in English, which was the German nuclear weapons programme.

00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:29.941
Fortunately, it wasn’t just the Nazis who had started their research early.

00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:37.011
In 1939, two years before the US even entered the war, a group of scientists sent a

00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:42.601
letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging him to start a nuclear research programme.

00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:47.451
The scientists weren’t a random, fringe, group.

00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:53.561
The letter had been drafted by the well-known Hungarian scientist Leó Szilárd, who had

00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:59.481
been forced to flee Europe to the United States to avoid persecution, as he was Jewish.

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:06.471
And the letter was signed by Albert Einstein, by this time a well-known physicist

00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:12.371
who had already won a Nobel Prize and who was himself in exile in the United States.

00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:19.581
On a related note, it is interesting to think that many of the scientists who made breakthroughs

00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:26.571
in atomic research and were instrumental in the discoveries that made the bomb possible were German

00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:32.831
and/or Jewish, and were pushed out of Europe precisely because of Hitler’s anti-semitic policies.

00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.581
Now, back to this letter written to President FDR.

00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:44.371
It’s worth reading out parts of the letter, as it gives you an idea of quite how right they were.

00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:46.631
The letter reads:

00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:53.131
"In the course of the last four months it has been made probable – through the work

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:59.061
of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America – that it may become

00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:06.391
possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:12.401
amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated.

00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:18.711
Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.

00:09:20.021 --> 00:09:27.311
This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable – though

00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:33.801
much less certain – that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed.

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:41.521
A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very

00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:46.241
well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."

00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:51.351
This letter had quite the impact on President Roosevelt.

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:55.891
Funding was allocated for research and mining uranium,

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.691
the element with atoms that are easiest to split apart.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:06.721
But it wasn’t until two years later, in 1942, that a full-blown,

00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:10.901
large scale programme to build an atomic bomb was created.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:17.391
The name of this programme, as you may well know, was The Manhattan Project.

00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:27.131
It was a huge operation, with 125,000 people employed at its peak and an estimated

00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:32.421
over half a million people employed on it over the five years it was active.

00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:39.451
When some people think of this kind of scientific discovery, or ask who discovered

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:44.228
the atomic bomb, people often think of a small group of scientists working in a

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:50.201
laboratory, and some name a man called Oppenheimer as “the creator” of the atomic bomb.

00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:56.381
But really it was a huge operation involving over a hundred thousand people.

00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:03.491
Oppenheimer, given we’ve mentioned him, was the head of a secretive laboratory where parts of

00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:10.161
the bomb were developed, but he was far from a mad scientist working alone on a dastardly bomb.

00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:14.291
It’s even been said that the entire United States

00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:18.561
was turned into one big factory to develop this bomb.

00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:26.481
The correct type of Uranium needed to be taken from the ground, and then enriched to create Uranium

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:34.141
235, the Uranium isotope, the particular type of Uranium, that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction.

00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:40.401
Alongside this there were huge factories working on producing plutonium,

00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:44.551
the element which would later be used in the bomb in Nagasaki.

00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:49.661
The technology that went into the two atomic bombs was actually very different.

00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:53.411
Uranium for the one that would later be dropped on

00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:57.291
Hiroshima, and plutonium for the one dropped on Nagasaki.

00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:03.361
The Manhattan project worked on both at the same time, in order to increase the

00:12:03.391 --> 00:12:08.431
odds, increase the probability of discovering one type of bomb that would work.

00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:13.761
Now, you are probably thinking, “this sounds like an absolutely

00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:17.881
monumental project, with hundreds of thousands of people involved.

00:12:18.381 --> 00:12:20.451
Was it really a secret project?

00:12:20.481 --> 00:12:22.911
Surely the news of it would get out”.

00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:28.351
Well, there were over a hundred thousand people working on this project at

00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:32.991
its peak, but only a tiny proportion of them would have known what they were

00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:37.521
actually working on, that they were actually working on developing a bomb.

00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:43.551
The scientists would likely have known or at least had some knowledge, but

00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:49.103
they were actually a small proportion of the total workforce, as little as 5%.

00:12:50.422 --> 00:12:55.581
The rest were working in construction of these very large plants, in mining the

00:12:55.581 --> 00:13:00.011
uranium, and would likely not have known that they were building an atomic bomb.

00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:08.071
27 months later, on July 16th of 1945, the first bomb was ready.

00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:13.661
A test site was chosen in the desert in New Mexico,

00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:17.721
an isolated area far away from any other settlements.

00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:24.291
At 5.29am, with hundreds of scientists watching eagerly

00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:28.461
from a distance of 30km, the weapon was detonated.

00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:35.231
The scientists believed it would work, but had no real idea of what would happen.

00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:38.631
Nobody had ever done anything like this before.

00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:44.691
And the director of The Manhattan Project, a man called Lieutenant General

00:13:44.781 --> 00:13:50.281
Leslie Groves, had prepared three separate statements that could be provided to

00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:55.491
the governer of New Mexico, depending on what happened after the bomb exploded.

00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:01.941
The first statement read that everything had worked, that there was nothing major to report.

00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:09.701
The second read that there had been major damage, and the third included the obituaries, the

00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:16.481
articles written after a person dies, for every scientist that had been watching 30km away.

00:14:17.902 --> 00:14:22.982
This gives you an idea of quite how unsure they were about what might happen.

00:14:24.432 --> 00:14:29.782
Fortunately, only the first statement was required, and the test revealed

00:14:29.852 --> 00:14:34.652
to the scientists quite the destructive power of what they had created.

00:14:35.432 --> 00:14:39.322
There was a huge explosion, a massive flash of light,

00:14:39.732 --> 00:14:44.072
and a mushroom cloud that rose 6km up in the sky.

00:14:45.002 --> 00:14:51.242
The desert sand melted, and the shock was felt as far as 160km away.

00:14:52.122 --> 00:14:56.992
The scientists looked at each other, in awe of what they had created.

00:14:58.012 --> 00:15:01.522
They had all known in theory what they were working towards.

00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:06.462
But seeing their creation in action must have been something very different.

00:15:07.152 --> 00:15:12.252
It was clear to all quite how powerful this weapon was, quite how much

00:15:12.282 --> 00:15:17.662
destruction it could cause if it were detonated in a city, not in the desert.

00:15:18.822 --> 00:15:23.742
Indeed, Oppenheimer, the lead scientist of the project, later recounted

00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:28.702
that at this moment he thought of the words from the Hindu sacred text,

00:15:28.952 --> 00:15:35.222
the Bhagavad-Gita, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”.

00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:40.724
From the point of view of The Manhattan Project, the test had worked.

00:15:41.194 --> 00:15:44.714
The United States had successfully built an atomic bomb.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.360
The only question remaining, and perhaps the hardest question that a US

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.610
president would ever have to ask themselves, was how would it be used?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:03.140
OK then, that is it for part one of this mini-series on The Atomic Bomb.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.850
We went from the early ideas about the structure of atoms through

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.510
to the discovery that an atom could be split, right through to the

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.910
consequences of this, and the detonation of the world’s first atomic bomb.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.230
Next up in part two of this mini-series is going to be what happened next.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.670
I’m sure you know something of what happened next – atomic bombs were dropped

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:30.300
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki – but in the next episode we’re going to discuss this

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.480
in detail, and pick up where we left off from the first test of the atomic bomb.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.440
That’s going to be one of our member-only ones, by the way, and will come out next Tuesday.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.870
Then in part three we’ll explore the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.910
discuss some of the ethical questions that have been raised about

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.860
the atomic bomb, and look at how the world has changed since then.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.610
As always I would love to know what

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.370
you thought about this episode.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.560
Was the Manhattan Project inevitable?

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.060
How do you think the scientists working on the atomic

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.090
bomb felt at the time, and after they had seen its impact?

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.140
What would you have done in their position, if you knew what they atomic bomb would be used for?

00:17:13.762 --> 00:17:14.852
I would love to know.

00:17:15.052 --> 00:17:17.992

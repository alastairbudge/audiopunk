Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:16.097
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:20.227
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:26.407
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Tower of London.

00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:32.587
It is one of the most famous monuments in the UK, with almost 3 million visitors every year.

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:37.157
And its story, the story of the Tower of London is full of

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:41.834
gruesome tales of executions, torture and ghostly hauntings.

00:00:42.617 --> 00:00:48.097
Not only this, it is also home to the dazzling crown jewels of the United Kingdom, it

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:53.807
is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is actually the oldest standing building in London.

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:57.517
And today we are going to tell its amazing story.

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.504
Okay then, the Tower of London.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.754
Our story starts just under 1,000 years ago, with

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:10.054
the arrival of a French Duke of Normandy to England.

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:15.864
His name was William, and he would later become William I, King

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:20.404
of England, after he invaded and conquered England in 1066.

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:27.954
Upon his victory, William needed to secure his reign, his rule, over the English.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:34.764
As he feared an uprising against him, and he lacked the support of the people, he immediately

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:40.564
ordered that the first fortifications be built on what is now the site of the Tower of London.

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:46.164
While London and the south of the country had surrendered to William, he

00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:50.874
did not have the people’s loyalty yet, not everyone accepted him as king.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:55.944
What’s more, the entire north of the country was still controlled

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:59.584
by English lords who were determined to fight back against him.

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:08.114
So to protect himself and to make a sign to the English people that he was not someone to be messed

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:14.854
with, someone to rise up against, William I did what kings and queens have done for centuries.

00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:19.494
He decided to build an extremely secure fortress that

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:22.924
would send a clear message to the people of the country.

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.774
It would be built in a very different style, and

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:30.114
with very different materials to the rest of London.

00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:35.244
At the time most buildings in London were made of wood

00:02:35.394 --> 00:02:38.704
and fires were frequent, there were a lot of fires.

00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:46.414
St Paul’s Church, for example, the precursor to St Paul’s Cathedral, burned down in 1087.

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:51.364
William had grown up in Normandy, in northern France,

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.614
and he knew one material that wouldn’t burn down.

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:55.854
Stone.

00:02:56.894 --> 00:03:01.774
And in particular, a type of stone called “Caen stone”, a kind

00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:05.774
of light creamy stone from the city of Caen, in Northern France.

00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:12.634
William, perhaps unsurprisingly, ordered for his new palace to be built in

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:17.164
this white creamy stone, which was brought over from France specifically.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:23.544
The site he chose stood on the remains of two Roman defensive walls,

00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:28.644
which William would use to shore up his defences, to reinforce the fort.

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:36.724
Around 1078, 12 years after the invasion, work began on what we recognise now as

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:42.354
the White Tower, the most famous and oldest part of the Tower of London complex.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:48.394
Just to clarify, today, when you hear someone talking about the Tower of

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:53.264
London, they normally mean the whole site which counts numerous buildings,

00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:57.849
not just the White Tower, but the White Tower is the main part of the Tower.

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.969
It is a square shape, 36 by 32 metres, and rises up 29 metres into the sky.

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.109
By modern standards, it’s no skyscraper, but it was by far the tallest and most imposing

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:19.169
non-religious building in the city, exactly as William The Conqueror intended it to be.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.219
Over the next several centuries, fortifications, defences, were added around the White Tower.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.429
By the time of Edward I’s reign in the 14th century, the

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:36.079
Tower of London boasted two defensive walls, plus a huge moat.

00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:41.609
A moat is the defensive ditch that was dug around castles and often

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.059
filled with water, making it harder for invading soldiers to cross.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.639
The Tower of London became England's strongest castle and it was home to

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.199
sumptuous Mediaeval royal apartments where the King and Queen could stay.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.819
Bear in mind that in mediaeval times, the monarch would frequently move between royal residences.

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:10.109
Although a place called Westminster Palace was the main royal palace, the Tower of

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:15.219
London was also an important residence for the monarch to stay in, especially in times

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:20.479
of crisis, when the king or queen needed somewhere where they knew they would be safe.

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:26.496
The Tower continued to be used as a royal residence right up until the time of the

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:33.509
Tudors, the period from 1485-1603, although it was still common for the monarch,

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:39.249
the king or queen, to occasionally stay there in later years for ceremonial reasons.

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:46.509
But when people think of The Tower of London, it isn’t normally thought of as a “royal palace”.

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.939
It’s most famous for being the place where enemies of the state were held, and then executed.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:59.689
While the Tower had also been used to house prisoners from as early on as 1100,

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:04.949
it wasn’t until the Middle Ages that it really became a prison in its own right.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.929
Prisoners in the Tower of London were most often political prisoners.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.359
While there were lots of other prisons in London, the

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:18.069
Tower of London was the most secure prison in the country.

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:24.269
For this reason it was used for prisoners who were considered to pose

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:29.209
a threat to national security or those who had been accused of treason.

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.719
Members of powerful noble families who fell out of grace with

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.359
the monarch would all too often end up being locked in the Tower.

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:43.369
And, as you might imagine, if you are a political prisoner who has got on the wrong

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:48.289
side of the king or queen, there is normally only one way you get “out of prison”.

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:53.209
I don’t mean you were set free to go off and live your life elsewhere,

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.449
oh no, English kings and queens weren’t usually so forgiving.

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:04.909
The journey of a political prisoner at the Tower of London would normally end in a public execution.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:10.799
If the prisoner was a high ranking noble or had a lot of supporters,

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:16.049
they might be executed at Tower Green within the Tower of London itself.

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:21.849
If the prisoner was not a noble, if they were a high-profile

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.619
rebel, for example, they would be killed in front of a large crowd.

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.969
Executions in front of the masses took place at Tower Hill just a

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.269
little to the northwest of the Tower outside of the main compound.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:41.879
By the 16th and 17th centuries, the Tower of London had become

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:46.019
the most important and the most feared prison in the country.

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:51.219
So much so, that the phrase “being sent to the Tower” has become

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:55.869
another way of saying being imprisoned, being put in prison, even today.

00:07:56.679 --> 00:08:00.739
Now, you’ve probably heard of a lot of the prisoners who either spent

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:05.119
time imprisoned in the Tower, or who ended up being executed there.

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:09.409
William Wallace, the famous Scottish freedom fighter, was a

00:08:09.429 --> 00:08:13.892
prisoner in the Tower before being brutally executed in 1305.

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:20.139
Guy Fawkes, the English conspirator who unsuccessfully attempted to blow up the

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:25.639
Houses of Parliament in 1605, was also imprisoned in the Tower of London and

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:31.109
subjected to excruciating torture in an attempt to make him say who else helped him.

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:36.249
Henry the VIII imprisoned two of his queens, Anne Boleyn and

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:39.469
Catherine Howard, in the Tower, before having them executed.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:46.019
His daughter Elizabeth I would also spend a spell in the Tower before becoming queen.

00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:51.729
On a side note, we do actually have episodes on William Wallace, on

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:55.649
Guy Fawkes and on the wives of Henry VIII, so if you haven’t listened

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:59.119
to those and you weren’t aware that they existed, well they do.

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:06.009
But The Tower of London wasn’t just for notable rebels or out-of-favour wives.

00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:10.107
In the late 15th century the Tower is thought to have become the

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:15.689
final gruesome resting place for two young boys, two royal princes.

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:21.999
After their father, King Edward IV, died unexpectedly from illness, his

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:26.739
12-year-old and 9-year-old sons were kept in the Tower of London on the

00:09:26.739 --> 00:09:31.499
orders of their Uncle Richard, a man who would later become King Richard III.

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:37.619
Their uncle kept them in the tower supposedly for their own protection,

00:09:38.049 --> 00:09:42.639
until the 12-year-old prince was old enough to become king, but the boys

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:47.429
mysteriously disappeared, and their uncle Richard became king instead.

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:52.659
It has always been assumed that they were murdered as they were never seen

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:56.919
alive after they were sent to the Tower, supposedly "for their own safety”.

00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:04.149
In 1674, however, two skeletons that would fit the age of the princes were

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:08.179
found buried under the staircase in the White Tower of the Tower of London.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:13.779
The Tower was used less and less as a prison going into the 19th and

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:18.419
20th centuries, although Rudolf Hess, Hilter’s second in command,

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:22.309
was imprisoned there during World War II as the last state prisoner.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:28.639
The last person to be executed in the Tower, in fact, was a Nazi spy

00:10:28.849 --> 00:10:34.106
called Josef Jakobs who had parachuted into Britain, was discovered, sent

00:10:34.146 --> 00:10:38.576
to the Tower of London and was killed by a military firing squad in 1941.

00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:43.876
In a strange twist of fate, the Tower of London’s very

00:10:43.886 --> 00:10:48.486
last prisoners were the infamous Kray twins in 1952.

00:10:49.056 --> 00:10:52.636
They were only in the Tower for a few days after failing

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:55.686
to report for National Service, for military service.

00:10:56.116 --> 00:11:01.316
They were released, and the twins would go on to become London’s most feared gangsters.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:05.426
If you’d like to learn more about the Krays and their murderous

00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:09.396
life of crime, by the way, you can listen to episode number 223.

00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:17.696
Today, if you visit the Tower of London you’ll see this amazing castle steeped in history, but

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:23.836
you will also see some slightly strangely dressed men and women, men and women normally wearing

00:11:23.936 --> 00:11:30.646
bright red clothes, a big black hat, and occasionally carrying a black bird in their hand.

00:11:31.886 --> 00:11:36.136
These people are called “Beefeaters”, and no story about

00:11:36.136 --> 00:11:38.396
The Tower of London would be complete without them.

00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:41.726
They aren’t officially called “Beefeaters”.

00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:46.036
They are called The Yeomen Warders, and they can trace their history back

00:11:46.036 --> 00:11:52.066
to Henry VII when he created this regiment as a sort of personal bodyguard.

00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:56.776
Why they are called “beefeaters” is a subject of debate.

00:11:57.526 --> 00:12:04.446
Some say it comes from the French, “Buffetier”, which is an old French word for a waiter or servant.

00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:09.516
Others say it comes because part of their salary was paid in beef.

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:15.996
In any case, the Yeoman Warders, or rather the Beefeaters, continue to this

00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:21.506
day, and act as sort of ceremonial guards of the Tower and guides to tourists.

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:26.896
The Beefeaters still wear the same uniform as they did in Tudor times

00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:31.236
and they live within the Tower complex, often joined by their families.

00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:38.366
In the past, being a Beefeater could be passed down from father to son, but today, you

00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:43.426
have to have been in the British armed forces for at least 22 years and with at least

00:12:43.446 --> 00:12:48.736
the rank of an officer and have been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:53.529
And contrary to popular belief, there are female Beefeaters too.

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:59.259
The role is traditionally held by men, but there have been three female

00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:04.389
beefeaters, including a lady called Moira Cameron, who is currently in the role.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:10.979
Aside from living in the Tower of London, the Beefeaters also have another very

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:17.269
special perk - their very own personal Tower of London pub called The Keys.

00:13:18.439 --> 00:13:23.959
Not only is the pub private to Yeomen Warders only, it also sells two

00:13:23.989 --> 00:13:29.339
exclusive craft beers that are brewed just for them, with of course, the widely

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:33.779
available Beefeater gin, of which they receive a bottle for their birthday.

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:39.509
The beefeaters are also responsible for the ravens of the Tower of London.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:44.889
Ravens, by the way, are the large black birds that are prized for

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:49.999
their intelligence and their ability to mimic, to copy, human voices.

00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:52.839
They look a bit like big crows.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:57.089
The tradition of keeping ravens at the Tower of London

00:13:57.339 --> 00:14:01.369
dates back to the time of Charles II in the 17th century.

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:07.429
While there had been ravens earlier, Charles II was the first monarch to insist

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:12.509
that they were protected, appointing a Yeoman Warder Ravenmaster to care for them.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:18.534
Legend has it that there must always be a minimum of six ravens at the

00:14:18.534 --> 00:14:23.119
Tower or else the Tower and the monarchy will fall, it will collapse.

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:28.639
Naturally, it’s not a good idea to leave the fate of the Tower of London or the monarchy

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:33.746
completely up to the ravens, so their feathers are cut so they can't fly to far.

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:42.959
As a little fun linguistic aside, the collective noun for a group of ravens is an unkindness or

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:49.099
a conspiracy - it's probably linked to ravens often being considered to be unlucky or creepy.

00:14:50.016 --> 00:14:55.705
Now, just to conclude this episode, I wanted to share some other interesting facts about what else

00:14:55.725 --> 00:15:01.505
The Tower of London was used for, facts you might not hear on a tour, or read about in a guide book.

00:15:02.575 --> 00:15:08.365
From the 1200s to 1835, the Tower of London also housed what was known

00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:13.465
as the Royal Menagerie, essentially a zoo containing exotic animals.

00:15:14.295 --> 00:15:18.665
The Tower of London was at one point home to a polar bear, a gift

00:15:18.675 --> 00:15:22.235
from the King of Norway, an elephant, from the King of France and

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:27.365
three lions, or possibly leopards, gifted by the Holy Roman Emperor.

00:15:28.315 --> 00:15:34.205
Over the years, the collection grew to include a tiger, jackals, leopards and eagles.

00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:39.345
However, over time people became more aware of the unsuitability of

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:43.955
the surrounding for animals, and the Menagerie closed down in 1835.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:47.535
What happened to the animals, you might be asking?

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:55.355
Well, 150 animals were rehoused to Regent's Park in 1826, creating what would become

00:15:55.405 --> 00:16:02.165
London Zoo, an actual, purpose-built real zoo, not a prison-come-castle turned into a zoo.

00:16:03.085 --> 00:16:07.385
And although exotic animals are precious and valuable, they weren’t the

00:16:07.395 --> 00:16:11.445
most valuable things kept under lock and key at The Tower of London.

00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:15.015
Weapons and armour were stored there, of course.

00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:19.835
But, being such a secure place, the Tower of London was the ideal

00:16:19.835 --> 00:16:24.165
place to control England's currency supply, the supply of money.

00:16:25.165 --> 00:16:30.305
All English coins were created, or “minted”, at the Tower of London from

00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:36.025
the end of the 13th century up until 1810 in what was called the Tower Mint.

00:16:37.355 --> 00:16:41.935
And of course, if you go to The Tower of London today, you too can see

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:46.355
debatably the most valuable piece of jewellery in the country, The Crown

00:16:46.365 --> 00:16:51.505
Jewels, which are thought to be worth anywhere from 4 to 6 billion Euros.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:54.285
And who is responsible for guarding them?

00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:55.905
The Beefeaters of course.

00:16:57.175 --> 00:17:02.695
And our final curiosity about The Tower of London is that the first person to be kept

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:08.265
prisoner in The Tower of London was also the first person to escape from the Tower of London.

00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:14.635
His name was Bishop Ranulf Flambard, and he was thrown into the Tower of London

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:19.535
after falling out of favour with William the Conqueror’s younger brother, Henry I.

00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:25.285
Henry I threw the bishop into the tower, but it sounded

00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:28.095
like it wasn’t a particularly uncomfortable prison.

00:17:28.695 --> 00:17:32.355
The bishop still had access to money and fine food.

00:17:32.815 --> 00:17:37.525
He decided to put on a banquet, a large meal, for his jailors,

00:17:37.665 --> 00:17:41.275
and ordered for barrels of wine to be sent into the Tower.

00:17:42.135 --> 00:17:46.825
In one of these barrels was a rope, and while the guards were enjoying

00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:51.165
the fine food and wine, perhaps enjoying the wine too much, the

00:17:51.165 --> 00:17:55.535
bishop used this rope to lower himself out of the Tower to safety.

00:17:56.385 --> 00:18:00.365
His supporters had arranged for a horse to be left outside the window.

00:18:00.565 --> 00:18:06.125
The bishop jumped onto it, rode all the way to the coast and then got on a boat to France.

00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:10.825
So, there you go, a brief history of The Tower of London.

00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:18.225
From its beginnings as a defensive castle, a royal residence, prison, mint, zoo and home to the

00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:24.655
Crown Jewels, the Tower of London has a rich and fascinating history, spanning over 900 years.

00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:30.845
It’s little wonder that the once feared Tower of London is now one of the most popular UK

00:18:30.845 --> 00:18:35.945
tourist attractions, as well as a national monument that is a central part of English history.

00:18:36.525 --> 00:18:41.125
And it’s one that you can still visit today, and I’d certainly recommend you do.

00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:47.055
Go to The Tower, strike up a conversation with a Beefeater, think of all the

00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:50.975
prisoners who spent their last days looking out through the prison windows.

00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:53.905
And keep a lookout for ravens.

00:18:54.325 --> 00:18:58.635
If you can’t see six of them, well, you might just be the first person

00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:02.415
to realise that the future isn’t bright for the British monarchy.

00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:08.795
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the Tower of London.

00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:12.565
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned about the real

00:19:12.565 --> 00:19:16.985
history of London’s most iconic landmark, as well as some of the quirky

00:19:16.985 --> 00:19:20.335
details that you’re less likely to hear about on the tourist trail.

00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:24.305
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:27.865
Have you ever been to the Tower of London or are you planning to?

00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:32.415
If you’ve been, did you see the Beefeaters, or even the Crown Jewels?

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:36.075
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.
